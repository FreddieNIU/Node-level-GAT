Since I believe in the strategy behind it, I'm continuing to operate the account behind that portfolio in largely the same way."", ""When it comes to providing that income growth, 2023 was a great year for the account.

Dividends received by the account have been retained as cash and opportunistically invested as conditions allow.', ""There are two primary reasons why this account saw its dividend income grow faster than the overall S&P 500's. First and foremost, it was designed to seek out dividend growth. To be included in it, a company had to pay a dividend, have regularly increased its dividends, and look capable of continuing to increase its dividends in the future."", 'Contrast that with the S&P 500, where the primary requirement to be included is to be one of the 500 largest U.S.-based publicly traded companies.', ""The account's set of requirements led to picks like Texas Instruments (NASDAQ: TXN), which was bought for the account in January 2013. At the time, Texas Instruments had recently increased its dividend to $0.21 per share per quarter, which was the company's tenth increase in the previous nine years."", ""In 2023, Texas Instruments continued its trend, boosting its quarterly payout to $1.30 per share, marking 20 straight years of increases. With a payout ratio of around 65% of the company's earnings, Texas Instruments will need to rely on continued operating growth to support its continued rising dividends. As analysts expect it to be able to increase its earnings by around 10% annualized over the next five years, it has the potential to continue its dividend streak if that growth materializes."", 'The second reason is the fact that this account keeps its dividends hanging around, prepared to reinvest when the opportunity arises. That cash provided a decent chunk of the $12,000 I invested in Fifth Third Bancorp\xa0earlier this year, just before it also increased its dividend.', 'Similar to Texas Instruments, I saw Fifth Third Bancorp as a company with a decent history of dividend growth and a good reason to believe it could continue. It provided a very clear example of how a paid and growing dividend, reinvested in companies that also look capable of paying and increasing their dividends, could ultimately drive powerful compounding.', 'As awesome as this dividend growth focused investing strategy has performed at its primary goal in 2023, it has its own share of risks. Dividends are never guaranteed payments. If a company cuts its dividend, its share price will often fall as well. That combination could cause you to lose both your dividend income and the capital that provided it, making it very difficult to recover from a cut.', ""Because of that reality, it's important to keep an eye on companies' payout ratios, growth prospects, and balance sheets. Those factors play a key role in determining whether a dividend can be maintained."", 'Any investor looking to follow a similar strategy should prepared to watch those factors like a hawk. Being ready to sell before a cut happens can be the difference maker when it comes to protecting your capital.', ""Still, as this year showed, when it's working well, a dividend growth focused approach can provide an increasing income stream. To get those payments, though, you must be invested in the stocks that pay them before they go ex-dividend and hold at least until their ex-dividend dates."", ""If you're interested in this type of investing strategy, make today the day you get started seeking out companies that might fit. If you wind up with this type of market-trouncing dividend growth in your own portfolio, you'll be glad you did."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Texas Instruments right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Texas Instruments, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Texas Instruments wasn't one of them.

The neutral inventory numbers notwithstanding, futures settled with a sixth consecutive loss week over week, overwhelmed by high production and insipid weather-related demand.In fact, the market hasn't been kind to natural gas in 2023, with the commodity trading considerably lower year to date and briefly breaking below the $2 threshold for the first time since 2020. At this time, we advise investors to focus on stocks like Range Resources RRC, Coterra Energy CTRA and Cheniere Energy LNG."", 'Stockpiles held in underground storage in the lower 48 states fell 55 billion cubic feet (Bcf) for the week ended Dec 8, tallying with the guidance of a survey conducted by S&P Global Commodity Insights. The decrease compared with the five-year (2018-2022) average net shrinkage of 81 Bcf and last year’s decline of 46 Bcf for the reported week.The latest draw puts total natural gas stocks at 3,664 Bcf, which is 245 Bcf (7.2%) above the 2022 level and 260 Bcf (7.6%) higher than the five-year average.The total supply of natural gas averaged 110.4 Bcf per day, down 0.3 Bcf per day on a weekly basis due to lower shipments from Canada, partly offset by a slight increase in dry production.Meanwhile, daily consumption rose to 122.5 Bcf from 118.1 Bcf in the previous week, mainly reflecting strength in residential/commercial usage and higher power burn, to go with a pickup in deliveries to LNG export terminals.', 'Natural gas prices trended downward last week following the expected inventory decrease. Futures for January delivery — which slumped to a six-month low earlier in the week — ended Friday at $2.49 on the New York Mercantile Exchange, retreating some 3.5% from the previous week’s closing. The decrease in natural gas realization is the result of high supply and mild weather.As is the norm with natural gas, changes in temperature and weather forecasts can lead to price swings. With mild weather across major parts of the United States during the early part of winter and forecasts of above-normal temperatures into the end of the year, usage of the commodity to generate electricity has taken a hit. In addition to this, natural gas is also under pressure from near-record output, with current inventory levels well above the year-ago figure and the five-year average. \xa0Having said that, there are signs of curtailment in domestic volumes. According to energy services provider Baker Hughes, the U.S. natural gas rig count — a pointer to where production is headed — is down some 23% from last year. Industry observers believe this could set the stage for a pullback in near-term drilling and supplies.Meanwhile, a stable demand catalyst in the form of continued strong LNG feedgas deliveries is supporting natural gas. LNG shipments for export from the United States have been elevated for months, reaching record levels due to environmental reasons and Europe’s endeavor to move away from its dependence on Russian natural gas supplies due to the war in Ukraine.', 'Following last week’s decrease, the natural gas market is down more than 44% so far this year. Based on several factors, the space is currently quite unpredictable and spooked by the sudden changes in weather and production patterns. As such, investors are clueless about what to do. As of now, the lingering uncertainty over the fuel means that they should preferably hold on to fundamentally strong stocks like Range Resources, Coterra Energy and Cheniere Energy.Range Resources: RRC is a leading operator in the prolific Appalachian Basin — a premier natural gas play — with huge inventories of low-risk drilling sites that are likely to provide production for several decades. About 68% of the Zacks #3 Rank (Hold) company’s total output is natural gas.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Range Resources beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the trailing four quarters, with the average being 33.6%. Valued at around $7.2 billion, RRC has gained 12.7% in a year.Coterra Energy: It is an independent upstream operator primarily engaged in the exploration, development and production of natural gas. Headquartered in Houston, TX, the firm owns some 183,000 net acres in the gas-producing Marcellus Shale of the Appalachian Basin. The Zacks Rank #3 company churned out an average of 2,204 million cubic feet on a daily basis from these assets in 2022.Coterra beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the trailing four quarters, the average being 11.8%. Valued at around $18.9 billion, CTRA has edged up 1.6% in a year.Cheniere Energy: Being the first company to receive regulatory approval to export LNG from its 2.6 billion cubic feet per day Sabine Pass terminal, Cheniere Energy certainly enjoys a distinct competitive advantage.Cheniere Energy has a projected earnings growth rate of 602.3% for the current year.

For Walmart and Target, their investments are also aimed at narrowing the gap in delivery speed with Amazon, which has set the standard for fast shipping and remains the king of speed.', 'Amazon packages have been arriving at the doors of Prime customers even faster this year under the company’s new distribution model, which divides the country into eight regions and predominantly ships items from warehouses in those areas. The idea, according to Amazon, is to get shipments to travel shorter distances with fewer touchpoints, which helps the company not only speed up deliveries but also cuts down on costs.', 'Previously, the Seattle-based e-commerce giant used to fulfill orders from warehouses across the country. In July, it said 76% of customer orders were being fulfilled within their region, up from 62% before the change.', '“We remain on pace to deliver the fastest delivery speeds for Prime customers in our 29-year history,” Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said in October during an earnings call with analysts.', 'Company executives have noted faster shipping is also being driven by Amazon’s expansion of same-day delivery, which was first rolled out in 2015 to Prime members who currently pay $139 a year for free two-day shipping and other perks. Same-day delivery sites are smaller warehouses that are located in metro areas and predominantly store the top 100,000 products customers want. Amazon Vice President of Delivery Experience Sarah Mathew said the company currently has 55 of these sites in the country. And it has plans to double the number in the coming years.', '“Psychologically, fast delivery is very important to the consumer when ordering online,” said Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail. “That is why everyone is trying to push out more into this space even though it’s very expensive to support and it often requires a lot of new infrastructure.”', 'To catch up, Walmart and Target have been pouring money into warehouse upgrades, new facilities or other efforts that they say will also help trim costs.', 'Walmart uses more than 4,000 of its stores across the country as fulfillment centers and delivery hubs for online orders. In November, the company said it would be adding 40 so-called parcel stations to stores in nine states by the end of the year in an effort to process more goods and get them faster to customers. The nation’s largest retailer said many of the stations — which are like mini post-offices that receive and deliver packages -- would be operating during the holiday season.', 'At the same time, the Bentonville, Arkansas-based company is working to overhaul its warehouses through automation to help speed up delivery to stores and customers.', ""Walmart is doing this in various ways: It's automating all 42 of its regional distribution centers, which hold non-perishable items and ship goods to replenish stores. Furthermore, it's building four automated warehouses that handle perishable items. And it's planning to add more than 100 smaller facilities that are connected to its stores and handle online orders."", ""Since last year, Walmart has also opened its first three fully automated “next generation” fulfillment centers, which hold a deeper assortment of the most wanted items and cut down the number of steps it takes to pack and ship orders from 12 to five. The company has said these hubs, as well as changes to its transportation network, have made it able to “drastically increase” the number of orders it's able to ship the next day. The goal, Walmart says, is to double the number of customer orders fulfilled daily and expand next- and two-day shipping to nearly 90% of the US."", 'Meanwhile, Target is aiming to increase its shipping speed by augmenting its own warehouses, called sortation centers, with a $100 million investment announced earlier this year.', 'Sortation centers receive packages for online orders from 30 to 40 surrounding Target stores that are sorted, batched and routed for delivery to local neighborhoods by a third-party carrier or Shipt, which Target owns. The warehouses are expected to double their delivery volume to more than 50 million packages this year, with a growing number of items delivered to customers the next day. The company - which currently has 10 around the country and plans a modest increase to at least 15 by early 2026 -- said it expects to deliver 9 million packages from sortation centers during the holiday season.', '“These facilities have transformed how we move inventory with speed and precision to guests’ doorsteps,” Target’s executive vice president and chief operations officer John Mulligan told analysts earlier this year.', 'Though both Walmart and Target use their physical footprint to help fulfill online orders, Jason Goldberg, the chief commerce strategy officer at the advertising giant Publicis, noted that Amazon has far more warehouse space and trucks than Walmart and Target. He said even if both Target and Walmart were to dramatically add more delivery hubs, they still wouldn’t be able to catch up with Amazon.', '“It’s almost hard to imagine you could ever catch up with Amazon’s model,” Goldberg added.']"

Retail titan Walmart\xa0was the biggest customer, at 88% of revenue in 2023. But in a new era of artificial intelligence (AI) wherein ""automation"" is in high demand, Symbotic has been increasing its backlog of orders with other key retailers, wholesalers, and other consumer goods companies in need of unlocking efficiencies in their supply chains and logistics operations.', ""After soaring over 300% in 2023 alone, there's hope that Symbotic stock can double again in 2024. The company's growth trajectory would certainly seem to indicate such is possible. However, just underneath the headline financial figures are reasons investors should give serious pause before buying this warehouse robotics stock."", 'Symbotic provides an end-to-end robotics and automation platform for the massive North American warehousing market (valued at an estimated $144 billion). These warehouses address the complex and costly supply chain of big retailers and wholesalers operating in general merchandise, groceries and food distribution, and apparel.', 'In other words, a Symbotic system comprises storage compartments, robotic arms, self-driving warehouse bots and forklifts that move boxes, conveyor belts, and more, all stitched together in a unified software platform.', ""Perhaps you know of Amazon's\xa0efforts in similar warehouse robotics and supply chain automation. Symbotic admits Amazon could eventually become a competitor. But much of Amazon's robotics are for its own internal use in its e-commerce empire, not the brick-and-mortar-centric retailers Symbotic serves."", ""No wonder Walmart has been hot to install Symbotic's systems. In the digital age, stoking higher profit from sprawling networks of operations is a must. A growing number of customers include Albertsons, Target, and privately owned grocery wholesaling and distribution giant C&S Wholesale Grocers (C&S)."", 'After nearly doubling revenue in fiscal 2023 (the 12 months ended in September 2023) to $1.18 billion, Symbotic thinks it has lots of growth left ahead of it. And so do many investors.', ""Now, about C&S. Symbotic's management team is intertwined with C&S. In fact, Symbotic's founder, CEO, and chairman of the board is Richard B. Cohen, the billionaire inheritor and current chairman of C&S who grew the wholesaler into a grocery empire over the last several decades."", ""Symbotic has a dual-class share structure. If you're a small investor reading this article, class A shares represent the stock you own (or are trying to learn about). These shares entitle you to participate in (current) losses at Symbotic but also potential future profits."", ""Then there's the class V-1 and V-3 shares. Those are noneconomic shares (they don't participate in losses or profit), but hold voting rights for Symbotic corporate decision-making (class V-1 gets one vote per share, and class V-3 gets three). As of the end of fiscal 2023, the Cohen family and various trusts and investment vehicles controlled 89.8% of voting power for Symbotic."", 'No big deal, right? A highly invested founder is a good thing for a fast-growing start-up. However, I see two potential issues.', ""First, the class V shares are convertible to class A shares over time. That means lots of future dilution is coming for the financially vested shareholders of class A stock. Currently, Symbotic's market cap is $4.2 billion, a seemingly reasonable value for a fast-growing business that just topped $1 billion in annual sales. However, when including the value of the class V stock (again, currently not participating in Symbotic's losses and profits), Symbotic's market cap is actually nearly $28 billion as of this writing."", ""Second, other than future dilution of your economic interest in Symbotic's financial performance, complicated billionaire and institutional investor shareholder structures tend not to jive with those of small individual retail investors. Besides being left to wonder whether the Cohen family will steadily cash out of Symbotic stock over time, Japan's investment holding giant SoftBank\xa0is another big shareholder (Walmart is a large shareholder, too, by the way)."", 'In fact, SoftBank acquired another warehouse robotics upstart, Berkshire Grey, early in 2023 and, a few months later, struck a new robotics joint venture business with Symbotic, called GreenBox. Symbotic owns just 35% of GreenBox, with SoftBank owning the majority.', ""In other words, Symbotic is under control of other parties that likely don't have exactly the same long-term investment goals you do."", 'All told, while Symbotic\'s technology and revenue growth trajectory look incredibly promising, this investment looks like it should be placed in the ""too hard"" file for most individual investors. Unfortunately, Symbotic sales growth and further progress on turning a profit won\'t simply and automatically translate into comparable stock price performance. I have serious doubts this stock will perform anything remotely similar to its performance in 2023.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Symbotic right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Symbotic, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Symbotic wasn't one of them.

Those stocks were serving as generals leading the rally, but until the ""soldiers,"" or other stocks in the S&P 500, joined the front, the rally wouldn\'t be seen as strong.', 'But now, as the S&P 500 is once again pressing near all-time highs, the generals have brought support.', ""Analysis from Yahoo Finance's Jared Blikre shows the largest gainers in the S&P 500 over the last month are Bath & Body Works (BBWI), Illumina (ILMN), and Norwegian Cruise Lines (NCLH), all of which have risen more than 35%."", 'Meanwhile, none of the Magnificent Seven have gained more than 8% over the last month.

But on the bright side, you can make far more than 100% on a really good stock. Long term Microchip Technology Incorporated (NASDAQ:MCHP) shareholders would be well aware of this, since the stock is up 178% in five years. Also pleasing for shareholders was the 17% gain in the last three months.', ""With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies."", ' View our latest analysis for Microchip Technology ', ""In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS)."", 'Over half a decade, Microchip Technology managed to grow its earnings per share at 140% a year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 23% over the same period. So one could conclude that the broader market has become more cautious towards the stock.', 'The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).', 'It is of course excellent to see how Microchip Technology has grown profits over the years, but the future is more important for shareholders. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on how its financial position has changed over time.', ""It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Microchip Technology, it has a TSR of 200% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!"", ""It's nice to see that Microchip Technology shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 30% over the last year. Of course, that includes the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 25% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.

As a key insider of the company, Kranich's stock transactions are closely monitored for insights into Gartner Inc's financial health and future prospects."", 'Robin Kranich serves as the EVP & CHRO of Gartner Inc, a leading research and advisory company.

The company specializes in providing critical insights, advice, and tools for leaders in IT, finance, HR, customer service and support, legal and compliance, marketing, sales, and supply chain functions. With a broad client base that spans across industries and geographies, Gartner's research services are considered essential for businesses looking to navigate complex markets and technological landscapes."", ""Insider transactions, particularly those involving buying and selling of shares, can provide valuable clues about a company's financial stability and the confidence insiders have in the company's future performance. In the case of Gartner Inc, the recent sale by Robin Kranich may raise questions among investors. Over the past year, Kranich has sold a total of 4,104 shares and has not made any purchases. This one-sided activity could suggest that insiders might perceive the stock as being fully valued or potentially overvalued at current levels."", ""When examining the relationship between insider transactions and stock price, it's important to consider the context in which these sales occur. The insider trend for Gartner Inc shows a pattern of more insider selling than buying over the past year, with 47 insider sells and no insider buys. This trend could indicate that insiders are taking profits or reallocating their investments, which might be a signal for investors to watch the stock closely."", ""On the day of Kranich's recent sale, Gartner Inc's shares were trading at $455.29, giving the company a market cap of $35.05 billion. This price point is significant as it reflects a price-earnings ratio of 38.67, which is higher than the industry median of 26.905 but lower than the company's historical median price-earnings ratio. This could suggest that while the stock is trading at a premium compared to the industry, it may still be undervalued when considering the company's own historical valuation metrics."", 'However, the price-to-GF-Value ratio stands at 1.23, with the GF Value at $369.50, indicating that the stock is modestly overvalued based on its intrinsic value estimate. The GF Value is a proprietary metric developed by GuruFocus, factoring in historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor, and future business performance estimates from analysts.', ""It's important to note that while insider selling can be a red flag for potential investors, it is not always indicative of a lack of confidence in the company. Insiders may sell shares for a variety of personal reasons, such as diversifying their investment portfolio, tax planning, or other financial needs. Therefore, while insider transactions should be considered, they should not be the sole basis for investment decisions."", ""The sale of 1,444 shares by EVP & CHRO Robin Kranich is a transaction that warrants attention from Gartner Inc's investors. While the insider trend suggests more selling than buying among insiders, the company's stock valuation presents a more nuanced picture. With a market cap of over $35 billion and a modest overvaluation based on the GF Value, investors should weigh the insider selling trend against the broader financial performance and market conditions of Gartner Inc."", ""As always, it is recommended that investors conduct thorough due diligence and consider a multitude of factors, including insider transactions, financial metrics, industry trends, and broader market dynamics, before making any investment decisions. The sale by Kranich is but one piece of the puzzle in understanding Gartner Inc's investment potential."", 'This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

That will give it the funds to acquire even more income-producing real estate.

Despite operating in energy, where up-and-down commodity prices can impact business, Chevron has consistently put cash in its shareholders' pockets."", ""Today Chevron faces more uncertainty. Oil prices have dropped, and the company's working through a massive acquisition that's facing potential geopolitical trouble. The result is a stock trading near its 52-week lows."", 'Should investors lean into the fear and buy the stock? Here is what you need to know.', ""Investors are probably looking for clarity around two dark clouds over Chevron. First, oil prices are falling. Oil has trended lower since early 2022, when inflation peaked. This is despite OPEC, the organization of petroleum-exporting countries, voluntarily cutting production to support market prices. There are also two wars happening simultaneously, one in the Middle East. Oil prices typically rise under these circumstances, but they're dropping."", 'Why? The economy may not be as strong as some think. While consumer spending remains solid, setting a new sales record on Black Friday this year, manufacturing could be struggling. The ISM Manufacturing Index, which measures U.S. manufacturing activity, has contracted for 13 consecutive months and is now below levels from nine of the past 12 recessions.', ""Investors should note that Chevron can fund its operations and dividend at an average oil price of $50 per barrel. However, price declines will naturally stunt earnings, which has eroded the market's sentiment toward Chevron stock."", 'Chevron is navigating a massive acquisition against the backdrop of falling oil prices. It agreed to acquire Hess Corporation in an all-stock deal worth $53 billion this fall. A primary motive for the acquisition is the Stabroek block in Guyana, an offshore asset with an estimated 11 billion BBOE (billion barrels of oil equivalent) in gross recoverable resources.', 'Hess is currently generating 110,000 BOE per day in Guyana from two FPSO vessels, with three more in development and a potential for ten. Management believes that could last into the 2030s, not counting additional future discoveries. Notably, the Stabroek block is very profitable. Last year production costs in Guyana were only $11.23 per barrel, less than half of production in U.S. assets.', ""However, Venezuela is attempting to claim the Strabroek block as part of a long-standing territory dispute that heated back up after Guyana's significant oil discoveries in recent years. Tensions reached the point that the U.S. conducted military drills with Guyana in preparation for a potential escalation. Fortunately, the two countries met in the last few days and agreed to keep the peace."", ""It's an important step, but investors should monitor the situation in case tensions flare up. Potential political instability is never good, especially at the center of a $53 billion acquisition. Any conflict could slow or diminish productivity in Guyana, or even jeopardize the merger."", ""The stock is trading toward the high end of its historical price-to-book value ratio over the past decade, though it has fallen from its high. The company's generating free cash flow on nearly ten percent of its revenue, and its return on equity is near its highest levels in a decade."", ""On one hand, you could argue that Chevron is earning its higher valuation. However, these fundamentals could deteriorate if oil prices continue falling. The good news is that Chevron is financially prepared for turbulence. The company's debt-to-equity ratio is the lowest since coming out of the financial crisis in 2008-2009. In other words, the balance sheet hasn't looked this strong in years."", ""Ultimately, nobody can predict what the markets will do, where oil will trade, or how geopolitical conflicts will be resolved. It seems that oil is trending lower, especially considering the prolonged weakness in manufacturing. Chevron's strong fundamentals instill long-term confidence, but the short-term share price could be volatile."", ""Buying a little bit at a time would be the smart move.

Although 2023 has been a banner year for equities, highlighted by the outperformance of the high-growth ""Magnificent Seven,"" it\'s dividend stocks that should be on investors\' radar as we prepare to open the curtain on\xa0 2024.', ""Publicly traded companies that offer a regular dividend to their shareholders are almost always profitable on a recurring basis and time-tested. What's more, income stocks have left non-payers eating their dust. Between 1972 and 2012, companies initiating and growing their payouts generated an annualized return of 9.5%. That compares to a meager 1.6% annualized return for public companies that didn't offer a dividend between 1972 and 2012."", 'However, not all dividend stocks are cut from the same cloth. As we get ready to move into the new year, five exceptionally safe high-yield dividend stocks (those with yields of at least 4%) stand out as top buys.', ""The first extremely safe high-yield dividend stock that's begging to be bought in 2024 is telecom company Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ)."", ""Although Verizon's high-growth days are long gone, upgrading its network to handle 5G download speeds is providing a healthy and sustainable lift to its bottom line. The company's wireless division generates its juiciest margins from data -- and data consumption should continue to climb as consumers upgrade their wireless devices."", ""Additionally, Verizon is beginning to see the payoff from its aggressive spending on mid-band spectrum. Having the ability to offer at-home 5G broadband has helped Verizon secure more than 400,000 net broadband additions in each of the past four quarters. Broadband might not be the growth driver it once was, but it's the perfect tool to encourage its customers to bundle their services. Bundling tends to lead to higher margins and better customer retention."", 'Investors would also be wise to look past the mostly unwarranted concerns regarding lead-clad cables that were raised in a July report by The Wall Street Journal. Verizon has noted that lead-sheathed cables account for a small percentage of its current network. Further, any future liability would be established by the U.S. courts, which could take many years to work its way through.', 'Valued at roughly 8 times forward-year earnings, there appears to be a solid floor and reasonable upside for Verizon stock.', ""A second super safe high-yield dividend stock that's ripe for the picking as we get ready to turn the page to 2024 is retail real estate investment trust (REIT) Realty Income (NYSE: O). Realty Income pays its dividend monthly and has increased its payout in each of the past 104 quarters."", ""While the prospect of a recession in 2024 has some investors concerned, Realty Income's more than 13,000-unit commercial real estate (CRE) portfolio is built to thrive in virtually any economic climate. Over 90% of Realty Income's total rent is resilient to economic downturns."", ""More specifically, over a third of the company's annualized contractual rent originates from grocery stores, convenience stores, dollar stores, and drugstores. These are businesses that provide basic-need goods and services and will therefore draw in customers, no matter how well or poorly the U.S. economy performs."", ""We've also begun to see Realty Income diversify its CRE portfolio. The company has made two gaming industry transactions in less than two years, and is in the process of acquiring Spirit Realty Capital in a deal valued at $9.3 billion. The latter is a complementary deal that'll help Realty Income diversify into new industries and become even more resilient to economic downturns."", 'Realty Income is valued at 13 times consensus cash flow for 2024, which represents its lowest multiple to cash flow in more than a decade.', ""The third safe high-yield dividend stock that makes for a genius buy in 2024 is pharmaceutical company Pfizer (NYSE: PFE). Except for a very short period during the Great Recession, Pfizer's existing yield of 6.3% has never been higher."", ""The knock against Pfizer is that its massive bump in sales from COVID-19 vaccines has largely been backed out of its revenue and profit forecasts moving forward. Now that the worst of the pandemic is in the rearview mirror, attention has turned to Pfizer's other drugs and its expansive pipeline. With Pfizer's 2024 guidance failing to impress, shares fell to a 10-year low."", ""Though Pfizer anticipates a $0.40-per-share hit to its earnings in the new year due to its now-completed $43 billion acquisition of cancer drug developer Seagen, it's important to recognize that this isn't a recurring loss or expense for the company. The combination of these two businesses will eventually result in recurring cost savings, as well as add billions of dollars in annual revenue for Pfizer."", ""Equally important is the fact that Pfizer's non-COVID therapeutics are still growing. Sales for non-COVID products jumped 10% during the third quarter, with Pfizer's Special Care segment leading the way. If the company's COVID-19 sales bump hadn't occurred, it's unlikely we'd see such an overreaction to sales and profits returning to their normal (i.e., modest) upward trajectory."", 'At less than 3 times forecast sales in 2023 and 2024, Pfizer looks to be quite the bargain for patient income seekers.', 'Safe high-yield dividend stocks can be found in the small-cap arena, too! Business development company (BDC) PennantPark Floating Rate Capital (NYSE: PFLT), which also pays its dividend on a monthly basis, is a rock-solid income stock to buy for 2024.', 'BDCs are businesses that invest in the debt and/or equity of middle-market companies. By ""middle market,"" I mean generally unproven micro-cap and small-cap businesses. In PennantPark\'s case, a sizable percentage of its portfolio is tied up in debt securities.', ""The clear advantage of this debt-focused approach can be seen in the yield PennantPark generates. Since most small businesses are unproven, their access to traditional debt and credit markets may be limited or closed off entirely. As a result, financing deals are often secured at lending rates that are well above average. As of Sept. 30, PennantPark's weighted average yield on debt investments was a cool 12.6%!"", ""The key to PennantPark's success -- in case the company's full name didn't already give it away -- is that 100% of its $906.3 million debt-securities portfolio sports variable rates. The Federal Reserve just undertook its most aggressive rate-hiking cycle in four decades. These cumulative rate hikes since March 2022 have increased PennantPark's weighted average yield on debt investments by 520 basis points."", ""Furthermore, PennantPark's management team has done a truly phenomenal job of protecting the company's invested assets. The average investment size spanning 131 companies is just $8.1 million, and 99.99% of the company's debt securities are first-lien secured. First-lien secured debt holders are at the front of the line for repayment in the event that a borrower seeks bankruptcy protection."", 'The last of the safest high-yield dividend stocks to buy for 2024 is none other than tobacco juggernaut Altria Group (NYSE: MO). Altria has raised its payout 58 times over the past 54 years, which makes it a true Dividend King.', 'The clear problem for Altria and its peers is that consumers have wised up about the potential dangers of long-term tobacco use. Since the mid-1960s, adult cigarette smoking rates in the U.S. have fallen from around 42% to just 11.5%, as of 2021. A shrinking pool of potential customers has led to modest declines in aggregate cigarette shipments for Altria.', ""However, Altria Group has exceptional pricing power in its corner. Tobacco products contain nicotine, an addictive chemical. The strong desire to continue using tobacco products has allowed Altria to pass along price hikes that often outweigh any decline in cigarette shipments. It also doesn't hurt that premium brand Marlboro accounts for more than 42% of retail cigarette share, which makes raising prices relatively easy."", 'Altria Group is also looking beyond its traditional tobacco lines and shifting its sales toward smokeless products. For instance, it completed the acquisition of electronic-vapor company NJOY Holdings for $2.75 billion in early June. NJOY has received a half-dozen marketing granted orders (MGOs) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for its products and devices. These MGOs grant NJOY the right to keep its items on retail shelves. The vast majority of e-vapor companies lack MGOs.', ""Similar to Verizon, Altria Group's forward-year price-to-earnings ratio of 8 provides a safe floor, with plenty of upside for long-term, income-seeking investors."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Verizon Communications right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Verizon Communications, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Verizon Communications wasn't one of them.

You were out with an extensive note, and an amusing one, looking at what's going on for 2024. But let's zero in on one of your top calls for next year. And that's Salesforce, which you're upgrading to an outperformance saying that's one of the best bets here. What do you think Salesforce has got to get right next year for it to perform as you're talking about?"", ""ALEX ZUKIN: Yeah, I think it's a combination of three points. I think point one is double-digit growth. I think this is a company that has a lot of wind at its back. I think the organic product innovation around Data Cloud, I think the pricing opportunity and the uplift possible from generative AI in the portfolio, and I think just the renewed culture and sense of selling enables this company to perform at least as good as we think they can executing to double-digit growth for the next few years."", ""I think point two is a commitment for that growth to be profitable, responsible, and that's language for margins that are going to continue to go up. I think if you look at where the company crossed a pretty meaningful threshold and operating margin performance this year all the way up to 30%, I think that's a great start and they should be extremely proud of that."", ""And I think the next stop is 40%. That's where you go from really strong and solid to iconic. I don't think they're going to get there next year, but I think the journey to get to 40%, matching companies like Microsoft, Adobe, and the like is something that this is-- there's no reason why Salesforce can't get there. And I think that unlocks a lot of incremental earnings power, a lot of incremental free cash flow that investors are going to want to underwrite and invest behind."", ""And finally, I think a commitment to responsible M&A has been something the company has talked about the last few earnings calls. I think that's going to be really important for this stock to keep on working, where whether it's small tuck-ins or larger strategic deals, having at the outset really a framework and a commitment to how that can be accretive to either the growth and the profitability of the company is going to be super important for investors. And they have all the attributes to do that."", ""- I wanted to ask you about that Alex because Marc Benioff, he likes to pull the trigger on big acquisitions. So I guess is part of your call here you think there's just minimal risk that he's going to do that next year because obviously that would have a big impact on where you think margins are headed."", ""ALEX ZUKIN: Yeah. That's probably the most important crux of the bet. And look, I actually-- I bring the Figma-Adobe situation right back into the mix here. You know, part of the settlement here is that the regulators are saying no to big strategic M&A, and I think that's actually a positive for Salesforce. I think it's going to be harder for them to engage in larger strategic M&A, not impossible certainly, but I think it lowers the likelihood that they would pursue that."", ""Now, I will also say that if they do go down that road, I think the ability to, you know, really be-- to pick and choose and to very cogently outline the profitability potential and the accretion potential of the M&A is going to be very important. But my opinion is that you're going to be looking at Salesforce to do more tuck-ins, more kind of the acqui-hire type of deals rather than the big, meaty dilutive M&A of the past.""]"

Share prices of the tech giant have soared 76% through mid-December, easily beating the 23% rally in the S&P 500 this year."", ""It might seem outlandish to think Amazon stock will have another strong year after outperforming at that fantastic level in 2023, but don't discount that real possibility. There are at least three good reasons to believe you haven't missed the market-beating gains from Amazon stock just yet."", ""Many tech companies, including Apple, are shifting away from a focus on selling products and moving toward marketing services. Services have higher profit margins, after all. Compare Microsoft's 42%-plus operating margin to Apple's 30% figure for some illustration of that difference. And services provide more stable income because they tend to be subscription-based."", ""Amazon is moving quickly in Microsoft's direction. Its services unit -- anchored by Amazon Web Services (AWS) and things like its merchant advertising business and Prime subscription sales -- now accounts for nearly 60% of total revenue. It is expanding at a much faster pace than e-commerce sales, too, suggesting that it will be an even bigger part of the company over time. As a result, Wall Street is starting to look at -- and value -- the stock as less of an e-commerce retailer and more of a tech services giant."", ""Since its inception, Amazon has famously prioritized growth over short-term net earnings, to the consternation of many investors. That broader approach hasn't changed, but management is now more focused on finding balance. There's no reason why this massive business can't deliver strong earnings even while investing aggressively in areas like artificial intelligence (AI) and its global delivery network."", 'You can see proof of that shift in areas like free cash flow, which was $21 billion over the past full year compared to a $20 billion outflow in the prior-year period. Operating income was $24 billion in the first nine months of 2023, up sharply from about $10 billion a year earlier.', 'Expectations for further gains in these metrics are key reasons why Amazon stock has done so well lately. Management predicted in late October that Q4 operating earnings will land between $7 billion and $11 billion, up from $3 billion last year.', ""The best news is that there's room for Amazon's stock valuation to continue rising in 2024. Shares are priced at less than 3 times annual sales even factoring in the 2023 rally. That compares well against other tech giants like Apple (8 times sales) and Microsoft (12 times sales)."", ""Sure, Amazon isn't nearly as profitable as these companies. Its 5% operating margin is closer to what you might see from a retailer like Walmart than what tech investors are accustomed to. Yet that rate is improving right now and has a good chance of expanding toward double-digit percentages in 2024.

Famed investor Charlie Munger once told a young attendee at a Berkshire Hathaway shareholder meeting in the 1990s that once you have $100,000 you can ""ease off the gas a little bit.""

You don't have to be some trading wonk who dives into annual reports and stock charts. If that stuff doesn't interest you a whole lot, it'll be hard to outperform investors who read SEC filings just for fun."", ""The simplest way to invest your money is by using a simple broad-market index fund. An index fund that tracks the S&P 500 or a total stock market index typically has low fees, and it's going to closely match what the overall stock market returns."", 'A few examples of great index funds are:', 'Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (NYSEMKT: VTI)', 'SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT: SPY)', 'iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT: IVV)', 'All of the above have expense ratios of less than 0.1% and do a great job of tracking the index they benchmark. Those two things will ensure you get similar results to the overall market.', ""And if you think this is a cop-out, consider this. Over the last 15 years, just 8% of actively managed mutual funds have outperformed the S&P 500. Those are the professionals who get paid handsomely to outperform the market. And they can't consistently produce results year after year good enough to justify the fees they charge. So, sticking with an index fund is a good bet for most."", ""If you put $100,000 to work in an S&P 500 index fund, and it returns its average 6.5% real compound annual return, it'll take less than 37 years for you to reach $1 million in today's dollars."", 'Small-cap stocks outperform large-cap stocks in the long run, so adding more small-cap investments to your portfolio can help boost returns.', 'Over the last 30 years, the small-cap focused S&P 600 has produced a compound annual return 33 basis points higher than the S&P 500. And it can outperform much more in the early days of a bull market.', 'You might not know it based on the recent performance of megacaps like the ""Magnificent Seven,"" but the reason small-caps have the potential to outperform is because it\'s a lot easier for a $300 million company to grow to a $3 billion company than it is for a $300 billion company to grow into a $3 trillion company. Not every company can be Apple or Microsoft.', ""But when you invest in what sounds like a well-diversified index fund like the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF, you're mostly buying large-cap stocks. That's because the fund is market-cap-weighted. Nearly 16% of the entire fund is invested in Apple, Microsoft, and Alphabet, Google's parent company. The top 10 holdings account for over 28%."", 'Small-cap stocks are generally riskier than large-cap stocks. What makes them outperform in the long run (their small size) also makes them more volatile. Luckily, adding small-cap stocks can be done with an index fund, which can mitigate the risk of investing in individual companies. Additionally, focusing on profitable small-caps, like those found in the S&P 600,\xa0has been shown to improve returns.', 'A couple of small-cap index funds to consider:', 'Vanguard Small-Cap ETF (NYSEMKT: VB)', 'SPDR S&P 600 Small-Cap ETF (NYSEMKT: SPSM)', 'Even boosting your portfolio returns by a few basis points can cut years off your journey from $100,000 to $1 million. Small-cap stocks are one way to do that.', ""Another class of stocks that's historically outperformed the overall market is dividend growth stocks. In the 50 years from 1973 through 2022, companies initiating and growing a dividend produced a compound annual total return of 10.24% versus just 6.6% for those that never changed their dividend policy."", 'A dividend growth stock is consistently profitable and grows those profits enough over time that it can raise its dividend paid to shareholders most years. And if you reinvest those dividends every year, you can end up with a substantial income-producing portfolio over time.', ""Investing in dividend growth stocks can be a winning strategy even if you don't plan to live off those dividends in retirement. Again, if you don't want to pick individual stocks, you can add exposure to dividend growth stocks with an index fund. Some examples include:"", 'Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF (NYSEMKT: VIG)', 'WisdomTree U.S. Quality Dividend Growth Fund (NASDAQ: DGRW)', 'The nice thing about dividend growth stocks is that they make it easy to stay the course. Even if the stock price moves up and down, a steady dividend increase can assure you the underlying businesses are producing positive results for investors.', ""If you want to grow $100,000 to $1 million by the time you retire, you'll want to invest in a broad portfolio of stocks. And while you can get there by just putting $100,000 into an index fund and waiting, you'll get there a lot faster if you continue to add to your holdings every year."", ""If you've already done the hard part -- the first $100,000 -- the path to $1 million is pretty straightforward."", 'When\xa0our analyst team has an investing tip, it can pay to listen.

Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Monster Beverage as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole.

While renewable energy investments are significantly surpassing conventional energy investments, fossil fuels severely disrupted and confused the markets over the last few years with uncertainty. The Russia-Ukraine war sent the oil and gas prices flying, threw supply chains into disorder, caused the inflation rates to skyrocket, and forced the Fed into taking aggressive measures.', 'Fossil fuel’s ability to provide energy at any time of the day or year has made it the most important energy source of today. On the other hand, mainly due to high-interest rates, renewable energy investments slowed down in 2022.

The report covers six months of data and includes hours viewed for every title (original and licensed) watched for over 50,000 hours. In total, Netflix said the report covers more than 18,000 titles — representing 99% of all viewing on Netflix — and nearly 100 billion hours viewed.', ""Prior to the report, Netflix, like other streamers, hadn't made many specifics on viewership available externally, but the Hollywood guilds recently secured transparency provisions in their latest contract negotiations with the studios."", ""Third-party rating services like Nielsen and Comscore also don't track streaming ratings as they do with linear television."", ""Netflix has released its weekly top 10 lists and Most Popular report since 2021 — but that dataset remains limited in scope relative to the new report given it's restricted to a handful of titles."", '""In the earliest days, it really wasn\'t really in our interest to be that transparent because we were building a new business and we needed room to learn,"" Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said on a press call last week, adding the company didn\'t want to provide a ""roadmap"" to competitors and that, by not releasing data, it wasn\'t beholden to numbers and ratings.', 'But as the business evolved, ""the unintended consequence of not having more transparent data about our engagement was it created an atmosphere of mistrust over time with producers and creators and the press,"" the executive said. ""So I would say that this is on the continuum of transparency as streaming has become more and more mainstream.""', ""Netflix has been ahead of the curve relative to competitors, which still largely keep their respective streaming figures hidden. It's possible Netflix's move could prompt more transparency as more consumers cut the cord or drop their cable packages and the media world evolves past overnight Nielsen ratings."", ""Netflix wouldn't speculate on what others might do in response."", '""That\'ll just be up to them,"" Sarandos said. ""They\'re all running their businesses as they see fit and they are also in different places in their existence. We thought very differently about this 10 years ago, too.""', ""What's different from years past is the push from the creative community, who called for more data transparency during both the writers and actors strikes."", 'The argument? To better compensate creators who produce highly engaging content. Both guilds were able to secure this provision in their respective contracts.', 'On the call, Netflix confirmed the new engagement data is the exact data shared with creatives.', 'Netflix\'s data is interesting in the context of what content works and which areas Netflix has an opportunity to further capitalize on. For instance, South Korea was the most successful territory after the United States, thanks to shows like ""The Glory,"" ""Physical:100,"" and ""Crash Course in Romance.""', 'This suggests an opportunity to leverage more K-content in the region.', '""Hardly anybody turns off the things that they love. And hardly anyone watches things that they hate when it\'s so easy to switch to something else. So we think this is the most accurate reflection of that,"" Sarandos said, explaining how the data can help inform the company\'s content decisions.', 'In April, Netflix confirmed plans to spend $2.5 billion over the next four years to produce more Korean movies, TV series, and reality shows. Sarandos has previously spoken about the opportunity for more unscripted local language content, citing the success of K-reality shows like ""Physical: 100.""', 'Licensed content, meanwhile, made up a significant portion of viewing hours as shows like ""Suits"" saw new life on the platform. From January to June 2023, 55% of viewing came from Netflix films and series with 45% from licensed titles.', 'Licensed content often keeps viewers engaged between new seasons of original series, which continued to lead the engagement report.', 'In fact, nine of the top 10 shows are all Netflix originals, led by Season 1 of ""The Night Agent"" and the second installment of ""Ginny and Georgia."" Telenovela ""La Reina del Sur"" is the only licensed show in the top 10.', ""The resurgence of licensed content seems to have brought the streaming wars full circle after companies spent billions to create original IP in a bid to edge out competitors and attract subscribers. It also underscores Netflix's ability to find audiences for shows and movies that aren't its own — especially as content budgets shrink across the board."", ""But despite licensing picking up steam, Netflix said it doesn't plan to license its own content to competitors anytime soon."", '""What\'s interesting is a show like \'Suits,\' which has been played on USA for a long time, has been available on Peacock and had been available on Amazon for a couple of years before it hit Netflix, and yet we were able to unlock this enormous, enormous global audience for it,"" Sarandos said in response to Yahoo Finance\'s question on the call regarding its licensing strategy.', '""That\'s the combination of our large subscriber base and our recommendation system that knew to put \'Suits\' in front of people who were going love it the most,"" he said. ""I do not think that that necessarily would happen in reverse. I do think that we can add tremendous value when we license content. I\'m not positive that that\'s reciprocal.""', 'Alexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

At the same time, global GDP growth has decelerated, and that’s a key concern for policymakers. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is already projecting two interest rate cuts next year. I would not be surprised if the policymakers are more aggressive in pursuing expansionary policies towards the end of 2024.', 'In general, interest rate cuts result in a weaker dollar as the amount of liquidity in the financial and economic system increases. That translates into a rally for riskier asset classes, with part of the excess liquidity diverted toward speculative activity.', 'This article focuses on stocks from three asset classes likely to benefit from potential rate cuts next year. These asset classes include gold, oil & gas and cryptocurrencies. If I had a portfolio of these three stocks (with equal allocation), I would bet on 40% to 50% total returns.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Let’s discuss the reasons to be bullish on these stocks to buy.', 'Source: Piotr Swat/Shutterstock', 'The World Gold Council believes gold is poised for new all-time highs next year. A key reason is potential rate cuts, and I believe that gold mining stocks will rally. Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) stock looks attractively valued after trending lower this year. I would not be surprised with a 30% to 40% rally from current levels if gold makes new highs.', 'I like the fact that Newmont has an investment-grade balance sheet with a robust liquidity buffer of $6.2 billion. If gold trends higher, free cash flows will swell and translate into robust dividend growth.', 'At the same time, Newmont is positioned for aggressive organic and acquisition-driven growth. With the successful completion of the acquisition of Newcrest Mining, the company has added gold and significant copper reserves. Newmont is, therefore, positioned for a strong 2024 and is among the top stocks to buy to benefit from interest rate cuts.', 'Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com', 'Economic slowdown concerns have translated into a correction in crude prices. As a result, some of the best oil & gas stocks have trended lower. I see this as a good opportunity to accumulate fundamentally strong names like Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY).', 'With the possibility of rate cuts, there are two reasons to be bullish on oil. First, lower interest rates imply a weaker dollar. That triggers a rally in asset classes like commodities and energy. Further, rate cuts will boost investment and consumption spending. As growth gains traction, oil is likely to trend higher. I, therefore, believe OXY stock could rally from oversold levels in the coming year.', 'In recent news, Occidental acquired privately owned CrownRock for $12 billion. The acquisition will result in immediate free cash flow accretion with $1 billion FCF expected in the first year. With a potential upside in crude, the FCF is likely to be higher.', 'I must add here that for Q3 2023, Occidental reported free cash flow of $1.7 billion. Clearly, the annualized FCF potential will be robust in 2024, implying higher dividends and a ramp-up in share repurchases.', 'Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.com', 'There are already multiple reasons to be bullish on Bitcoin (BTC-USD) for 2024. The major ones include halving and the potential introduction of Bitcoin spot ETF. I believe the possibility of multiple rate cuts is another reason to be bullish on Bitcoin. With lower interest rates and a potentially weaker dollar, risky asset classes find favor. That is good news for cryptocurrency stocks. Riot Platforms (NASDAQ:RIOT) is one name that seems poised for a meaningful rally.', 'I believe Riot is the best pick among Bitcoin miners for two reasons. First, the company has a strong balance sheet with zero debt and a cash buffer (including digital assets) of $599 million.', 'Further, Riot is pursuing aggressive Bitcoin mining capacity expansion. By the end of the year, it expects mining capacity at 12.4 EH/s. Capacity is expected to increase to 38.1 EH/s by the end of 2025. By more than tripling capacity, the company will be positioned for stellar growth.

When we see a weak earnings outlook with slower than market growth, we suspect the share price is at risk of declining, sending the high P/E lower. This places shareholders' investments at significant risk and potential investors in danger of paying an excessive premium."", 'It is also worth noting that we have found 1 warning sign for Zoetis that you need to take into consideration.', 'Of course, you might also be able to find a better stock than Zoetis.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the banking sector and the performance of bank stocks, and go directly to read 5 Best Bank Dividend Stocks To Buy Now.', 'During most of the 2022 market decline, financial stocks were seen as a somewhat secure option. However, things shifted in March due to a crisis in regional banking. Investors got concerned about how much banks might lose because of increasing interest rates, and that changed the view of financial stocks as a safe bet. Amidst these shifts, while the Federal Reserve has been reducing the size of its balance sheet, a significant development has been occurring beneath the surface. Central banks have been actively bolstering support for markets by allowing bank reserves to grow. This expansion in reserves increases the amount of money available for banks to invest in both the markets and the broader economy. This action essentially provides banks with more capital, enabling them to have greater resources to allocate toward investments in financial markets and lending to businesses and individuals.', ""Research conducted by Matt King, previously a strategist at Citigroup and now leading his independent research firm, Satori Insights, proposes a noteworthy shift in focus. Rather than concentrating on the Federal Reserve's reduction in its overall balance sheet, King highlights the paramount importance of understanding the considerable $500 billion surge in reserves within the U.S. banking system since January. He further mentioned that other major central banks have followed a similar path as the Federal Reserve. Rather than withdrawing approximately $1 trillion in liquidity, as initially expected when they declared a proactive stance against inflation in 2022, these prominent global central banks opted to inject nearly an equivalent sum into the financial system."", ""On December 14, shares of U.S. banks surged significantly following the Federal Reserve's indication of possible interest rate cuts in 2024. This optimistic signal propelled the sector to reach its highest level since the early part of March. The positive momentum was further fueled by Wells Fargo and BofA Global Research analysts, who responded to the Fed's more accommodative stance by increasing their price targets for various banks within the sector. This shift in sentiment also serves as a reminder of how sensitive financial markets can be to signals from key financial institutions like the Federal Reserve. While the recent positive momentum might paint a hopeful picture, it doesn't overshadow the fact that banking stocks have lagged in terms of growth and returns when compared to the overall market trends. S&P Banks Select Industry Index, which tracks the performance of prominent financial stocks like Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC), Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C), and KeyCorp (NYSE:KEY), gained 1.88% so far this year, compared with broader market’s 23.4% rally."", 'The financial crisis has prompted Wall Street banks to adopt and heavily rely on Artificial Intelligence (AI) to revolutionize the landscape of finance. Among the largest banks in the US, JPMorgan stands out significantly by showcasing its commitment to AI adoption. According to data from Evident, a substantial global advertising push was observed from February through April, with JPMorgan prominently advertising a staggering 3,651 positions directly related to AI.

This probably means the low-hanging fruit found at the height of the 2022 bear market has largely disappeared.', 'Nonetheless, investors can find bargains, particularly with established tech giants that appear poised for a comeback. With the S&P 500 close to all-time highs, investors might want to consider IBM (NYSE: IBM), Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), and Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM). Here\'s why these three ""cheap"" tech stocks are potential buys right now.', 'For much of the previous decade, IBM stock fell into decline as most of its business segments became stagnant amid slowing or negative growth. But this has appeared to shift under current CEO Arvind Krishna, who led the historic $34 billion takeover of Red Hat, helping to transform IBM into a cloud giant.', 'That move made the company a leader in the hybrid cloud, the infrastructure that facilitates more-seamless integration between private and public clouds. It continued this transformation by spinning off its managed infrastructure business into Kyndryl and acquiring numerous cloud companies to increase its capabilities.', 'For 2023, IBM forecasts $10.5 billion in free cash flow, an increase of $1 billion for the year. That will help fund its more than $6 billion in annual dividend payments.', 'The payout, which amounts to $6.64 per share annually, has risen for 28 straight years, and its dividend yield is just above 4%. Thanks to the growth in its cloud business, the payout hikes should continue.', 'Admittedly, the stock has not risen significantly over the last year. Nonetheless, it sells near multiyear highs, and at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 22, investors can still buy into a tech recovery and income stream at an affordable price.', 'As with IBM, the loss of a technical lead wreaked havoc on Intel stock over the last few years. Consequently, rival Advanced Micro Devices took a technical lead in the CPU space, and it faces pressure from Nvidia and others in the data center business.', 'Still, CEO Pat Gelsinger envisions Intel retaking its technical lead. To that end, he has begun building foundries to support a new business, Intel Foundry Services (IFS). It has attracted clients such as Amazon and Cisco Systems, and chip design companies such as Nvidia have expressed an interest.', ""On the performance end, it has just released its Emerald Rapids CPUs. While Emerald Rapids might not outperform AMD's latest chips, it represents a considerable improvement that could help Intel meet its goal of technical parity in 2024."", ""The push to build foundries left Intel with a negative free cash flow of over $12 billion in the first nine months of the year. Still, the third quarter's adjusted free cash flow was $943 million, indicating its finances might finally be improving."", ""That could partly explain why its stock has risen nearly 60% over the last year. While its forward P/E of 48 might not look cheap, a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 4 is well below AMD's sales multiple of 10, indicating that more investors might perceive it as inexpensive as the company recovers."", 'Qualcomm is another established tech giant looking to recover. Unlike IBM and Intel, it never lost its technical lead, but sales of its market-leading 5G smartphone chipsets fell as consumers became more uncertain about the economy.', 'Moreover, Qualcomm is in a transition amid a likely decline in importance for the smartphone. To that end, it has also pivoted into the Internet of Things and automotive markets. But the company faces significant competition in these segments, which may have led to doubts about its future.', ""And 63% of its revenue came from China in fiscal 2023 (ended Sept. 24). As U.S.-China relations have become more tenuous, that dependence on China could raise concerns about Qualcomm's growth."", 'Indeed, the aforementioned falling sales brought about a 19% revenue decline in fiscal 2023. Still, the free cash flow of almost $10 billion increased amid rising receivables and falling payables. Also, revenue forecasts in the fiscal 2024 first quarter point to a possible return in growth.', 'As the slump seems to have ended, investors have bid the stock to 52-week highs. And even with the beginnings of a rising stock price, investors can buy Qualcomm at 22 times earnings, a low multiple by historical standards.

It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.', ""It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them."", 'In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.', 'Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.', 'There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.', 'Should You Invest in QCOM?', 'In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Qualcomm, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $9.10.', ""Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term."", ""The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Qualcomm.

Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed.

So when we looked at Rockwell Automation (NYSE:ROK), they do have a high ROCE, but we weren't exactly elated from how returns are trending."", ""For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business.

If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Rockwell Automation here  for free."", ""On the surface, the trend of ROCE at Rockwell Automation doesn't inspire confidence. Historically returns on capital were even higher at 32%, but they have dropped over the last five years. However, given capital employed and revenue have both increased it appears that the business is currently pursuing growth, at the consequence of short term returns. And if the increased capital generates additional returns, the business, and thus shareholders, will benefit in the long run."", 'Even though returns on capital have fallen in the short term, we find it promising that revenue and capital employed have both increased for Rockwell Automation. And long term investors must be optimistic going forward because the stock has returned a huge 136% to shareholders in the last five years. So while the underlying trends could already be accounted for by investors, we still think this stock is worth looking into further.', 'If you want to continue researching Rockwell Automation, you might be interested to know about the 1 warning sign that our analysis has discovered.', 'High returns are a key ingredient to strong performance, so check out our free list ofstocks earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.', 'Have feedback on this article?

Yet the company itself remains somewhat mysterious to everyday investors. I’ve always found BlackRock intriguing due to its immense size and impact across the investing world. There’s no doubt BlackRock sits as the sage among Wall Street firms when it comes to navigating market trends.', 'Since its founding in 1988, BlackRock has leveraged its expertise to deliver consistent, market-beating returns across various asset classes. So, when BlackRock goes shopping for new growth stock opportunities, my ears naturally perk up. If any firm can identify the next generation of high-flying stocks primed for gains, BlackRock has the resources and know-how to do it.

While software AI companies are likely to face a cooldown due to the AI hype starting to dry up and there being no profitability in sight, industrial robotics companies are seeing organic growth and profit growth, as blue-collar jobs have become more and more in demand. I believe this will ultimately lead to significant growth in the long-run for companies like Rockwell.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'As one of the largest industrial robotics and automation companies, Rockwell has much to gain from the increasing demand for automation and robotics. With skilled labor shortages and rising wages, companies are looking to automation to improve efficiency.', 'Rockwell already enjoys a strong competitive position with over $9 billion in annual revenue and leadership across diverse industries. However, the accelerating pace of automation adoption provides a substantial runway for growth.

This is an aerostructures manufacturing company that tumbled when the pandemic hit, and is yet to recover to previous levels. Spirit has recently undergone a 90% recovery from its trough, but the stock remains around 60% off its peak. I believe this is quite the discount, since the company’s financials have turned a corner, and the stock is already rallying very quickly.', 'Substantial upside potential lies ahead in the commercial aviation space, as activity recovers steadily.

However, I will note that Spirit has underwhelmed when it comes to earnings, and despite beating earnings per share estimates by 7% in the latest quarter, it has missed by substantial margins in the past. However, even if we add an extra year to these expectations, the stock still appears very undervalued to me.

As global energy systems migrate towards renewable sources, NET Power has incredible potential, as companies look to cost-effectively retrofit existing plants in a bid to reduce their carbon footprints.', 'BlackRock has not added many growth stocks to its portfolios, and has dialed back its risk profile, much like other hedge funds. However, it appears BlackRock sees a lot of upside potential with NPWR stock. This is a pre-revenue company that has been in quite a lot of trouble. Thus, it’s no surprise the stock is down around 41% from its peak.', 'Still, I believe that BlackRock sees an opportunity, and may be thinking this company could turn the corner soon. Notably, NET Power has $645 million in cash, which is enough to fund the company for years until it can generate significant revenue and profits.', 'It may be unwise to suggest NET Power will be profitable anytime soon. That said, analysts think it will generate around $760 million in revenue annually in 2032. This could be an underestimate if clean energy activism keeps gaining ground and Net Power benefits from additional tailwinds.', 'BlackRock has a modest $3.3 million of the stock in its portfolio.

For anything less than that, the payout rate will be 22%."", ""Michael King, an industry recruiter and the president of New York-based Michael King Associates, said Wells Fargo is wise to be setting a clear benchmark for obtaining higher pay.

Although 2023 has been a banner year for equities, highlighted by the outperformance of the high-growth ""Magnificent Seven,"" it\'s dividend stocks that should be on investors\' radar as we prepare to open the curtain on\xa0 2024.', ""Publicly traded companies that offer a regular dividend to their shareholders are almost always profitable on a recurring basis and time-tested. What's more, income stocks have left non-payers eating their dust. Between 1972 and 2012, companies initiating and growing their payouts generated an annualized return of 9.5%. That compares to a meager 1.6% annualized return for public companies that didn't offer a dividend between 1972 and 2012."", 'However, not all dividend stocks are cut from the same cloth. As we get ready to move into the new year, five exceptionally safe high-yield dividend stocks (those with yields of at least 4%) stand out as top buys.', ""The first extremely safe high-yield dividend stock that's begging to be bought in 2024 is telecom company Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ)."", ""Although Verizon's high-growth days are long gone, upgrading its network to handle 5G download speeds is providing a healthy and sustainable lift to its bottom line. The company's wireless division generates its juiciest margins from data -- and data consumption should continue to climb as consumers upgrade their wireless devices."", ""Additionally, Verizon is beginning to see the payoff from its aggressive spending on mid-band spectrum. Having the ability to offer at-home 5G broadband has helped Verizon secure more than 400,000 net broadband additions in each of the past four quarters. Broadband might not be the growth driver it once was, but it's the perfect tool to encourage its customers to bundle their services. Bundling tends to lead to higher margins and better customer retention."", 'Investors would also be wise to look past the mostly unwarranted concerns regarding lead-clad cables that were raised in a July report by The Wall Street Journal. Verizon has noted that lead-sheathed cables account for a small percentage of its current network. Further, any future liability would be established by the U.S. courts, which could take many years to work its way through.', 'Valued at roughly 8 times forward-year earnings, there appears to be a solid floor and reasonable upside for Verizon stock.', ""A second super safe high-yield dividend stock that's ripe for the picking as we get ready to turn the page to 2024 is retail real estate investment trust (REIT) Realty Income (NYSE: O). Realty Income pays its dividend monthly and has increased its payout in each of the past 104 quarters."", ""While the prospect of a recession in 2024 has some investors concerned, Realty Income's more than 13,000-unit commercial real estate (CRE) portfolio is built to thrive in virtually any economic climate. Over 90% of Realty Income's total rent is resilient to economic downturns."", ""More specifically, over a third of the company's annualized contractual rent originates from grocery stores, convenience stores, dollar stores, and drugstores. These are businesses that provide basic-need goods and services and will therefore draw in customers, no matter how well or poorly the U.S. economy performs."", ""We've also begun to see Realty Income diversify its CRE portfolio. The company has made two gaming industry transactions in less than two years, and is in the process of acquiring Spirit Realty Capital in a deal valued at $9.3 billion. The latter is a complementary deal that'll help Realty Income diversify into new industries and become even more resilient to economic downturns."", 'Realty Income is valued at 13 times consensus cash flow for 2024, which represents its lowest multiple to cash flow in more than a decade.', ""The third safe high-yield dividend stock that makes for a genius buy in 2024 is pharmaceutical company Pfizer (NYSE: PFE). Except for a very short period during the Great Recession, Pfizer's existing yield of 6.3% has never been higher."", ""The knock against Pfizer is that its massive bump in sales from COVID-19 vaccines has largely been backed out of its revenue and profit forecasts moving forward. Now that the worst of the pandemic is in the rearview mirror, attention has turned to Pfizer's other drugs and its expansive pipeline. With Pfizer's 2024 guidance failing to impress, shares fell to a 10-year low."", ""Though Pfizer anticipates a $0.40-per-share hit to its earnings in the new year due to its now-completed $43 billion acquisition of cancer drug developer Seagen, it's important to recognize that this isn't a recurring loss or expense for the company. The combination of these two businesses will eventually result in recurring cost savings, as well as add billions of dollars in annual revenue for Pfizer."", ""Equally important is the fact that Pfizer's non-COVID therapeutics are still growing. Sales for non-COVID products jumped 10% during the third quarter, with Pfizer's Special Care segment leading the way. If the company's COVID-19 sales bump hadn't occurred, it's unlikely we'd see such an overreaction to sales and profits returning to their normal (i.e., modest) upward trajectory."", 'At less than 3 times forecast sales in 2023 and 2024, Pfizer looks to be quite the bargain for patient income seekers.', 'Safe high-yield dividend stocks can be found in the small-cap arena, too! Business development company (BDC) PennantPark Floating Rate Capital (NYSE: PFLT), which also pays its dividend on a monthly basis, is a rock-solid income stock to buy for 2024.', 'BDCs are businesses that invest in the debt and/or equity of middle-market companies. By ""middle market,"" I mean generally unproven micro-cap and small-cap businesses. In PennantPark\'s case, a sizable percentage of its portfolio is tied up in debt securities.', ""The clear advantage of this debt-focused approach can be seen in the yield PennantPark generates. Since most small businesses are unproven, their access to traditional debt and credit markets may be limited or closed off entirely. As a result, financing deals are often secured at lending rates that are well above average. As of Sept. 30, PennantPark's weighted average yield on debt investments was a cool 12.6%!"", ""The key to PennantPark's success -- in case the company's full name didn't already give it away -- is that 100% of its $906.3 million debt-securities portfolio sports variable rates. The Federal Reserve just undertook its most aggressive rate-hiking cycle in four decades. These cumulative rate hikes since March 2022 have increased PennantPark's weighted average yield on debt investments by 520 basis points."", ""Furthermore, PennantPark's management team has done a truly phenomenal job of protecting the company's invested assets. The average investment size spanning 131 companies is just $8.1 million, and 99.99% of the company's debt securities are first-lien secured. First-lien secured debt holders are at the front of the line for repayment in the event that a borrower seeks bankruptcy protection."", 'The last of the safest high-yield dividend stocks to buy for 2024 is none other than tobacco juggernaut Altria Group (NYSE: MO). Altria has raised its payout 58 times over the past 54 years, which makes it a true Dividend King.', 'The clear problem for Altria and its peers is that consumers have wised up about the potential dangers of long-term tobacco use. Since the mid-1960s, adult cigarette smoking rates in the U.S. have fallen from around 42% to just 11.5%, as of 2021. A shrinking pool of potential customers has led to modest declines in aggregate cigarette shipments for Altria.', ""However, Altria Group has exceptional pricing power in its corner. Tobacco products contain nicotine, an addictive chemical. The strong desire to continue using tobacco products has allowed Altria to pass along price hikes that often outweigh any decline in cigarette shipments. It also doesn't hurt that premium brand Marlboro accounts for more than 42% of retail cigarette share, which makes raising prices relatively easy."", 'Altria Group is also looking beyond its traditional tobacco lines and shifting its sales toward smokeless products. For instance, it completed the acquisition of electronic-vapor company NJOY Holdings for $2.75 billion in early June. NJOY has received a half-dozen marketing granted orders (MGOs) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for its products and devices. These MGOs grant NJOY the right to keep its items on retail shelves. The vast majority of e-vapor companies lack MGOs.', ""Similar to Verizon, Altria Group's forward-year price-to-earnings ratio of 8 provides a safe floor, with plenty of upside for long-term, income-seeking investors."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Verizon Communications right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Verizon Communications, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Verizon Communications wasn't one of them.

Amidst rapidly weakening coronavirus product revenue and significant cost cuts billeted for next year, the drugmaker's annual sales of more than $100.3 billion in 2022 are undeniably a thing of the past."", ""But as smart investors know, betting against one of an industry's capstone companies can mean missing out on returns over time. So is there still a long-term investing thesis for Pfizer, or are its best days in the past?"", ""Let's take a beat to appreciate why it's perfectly reasonable for investors to be having doubts about this company's chances of being a good purchase, given its upcoming challenges. Management is expecting that the 2024 top line will be around $61.5 billion, at best. Given that it's anticipating a maximum of $61 billion for this year, the story is clear: There's no growth coming, at least in the near term."", ""As mentioned, the reason for the stagnating top line is that demand for its coronavirus vaccine, Comirnaty, and for its coronavirus antiviral pill, Paxlovid, is collapsing now that the most intense phase of the pandemic is over. It's very unlikely that demand will return anytime soon."", ""But what about potential growth from other new medicines in the pharma giant's gargantuan research and development (R&D) pipeline, which currently boasts 83 programs? Even without the decline of coronavirus product revenue, the company would only grow its sales by a maximum of 8% on an operational basis this year. That's including the launch of at least 10 programs, split between new medicines and expanded indications of previously approved ones."", ""The troubling conclusion for investors is that if Pfizer wants to expand at a faster rate, which is to say a pace that would imply some real upside to the stock, it needs its pipeline to be even more productive. Even for one of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies, it's hard to do much better than it already is on that front; it has 23 programs in late-stage clinical trials."", ""So it looks like in the next few years, it will be quite difficult to maintain its current less-than-snappy pace. And that implies it'd be better to invest elsewhere."", ""Keen readers will note that the bear argument against Pfizer is centered around its short-term performance. The bears aren't wrong: The doldrums are here, and they won't be leaving for a while. But after zooming out to look at the next decade and beyond, this company is very likely to be a decent investment for the right kind of investor."", ""As of Dec. 14, Pfizer's acquisition of Seagen, an oncology drug developer, is wrapped, and starting next year, its new oncology division will be formally initiated, packed with twice as many programs as before. The deal, inked earlier this year for $43 billion in cash raised via taking out debt, is part of the company's grand strategy to revamp its pipeline over the next six years or so."", ""Via a combination of acquisitions, licensing of pharmaceutical assets, advancing new programs in its pipeline, and expanding the indications of existing medicines, Pfizer aims to add around $45 billion to its revenue by 2030. It'll also be able to realize at least $1 billion in cost synergies to boost its profitability along the way -- and that's on top of the $4 billion in cost savings expected next year from other economizing initiatives. In short, this is going to be transformational for the company, but it's going to take a while."", 'After paying off the debt from the Seagen acquisition, management plans to start diverting more of its capital back to investors in the form of share repurchases and dividend payments. At the moment, its forward dividend yield is at a high 6.1%, which means now is an attractive entry point for long-term holders. When paired with its Goldilocks neither-too-pricey-nor-suspiciously cheap valuation, at a trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 14.5, the case for buying shares now looks even stronger.', 'Of course, none of this is to say that Pfizer is going to be a rapidly growing business.

Really allowing consumers to break down and split up their payments into equal installments."", 'And even Affirm CEO coming on to Yahoo Finance, touting that consumers see this as a safer option with closed and fixed loans, and avoid the traps of revolving credit without any late fees.', ""So what exactly does this mean for the economy? Well, economists telling me that it's allowed consumers to have an easier time spending than historically. And this has allowed for more spending, increased sales, and greater financial inclusion."", ""And it's also been a win for retailers because if these consumers didn't have this option and they didn't want to rely on credit, well, then they ultimately wouldn't have made as many sales as they have so far this year.

And in the last month alone, shares of Affirm are up 70%."", 'But, really, the way that it works is Affirm earns revenue partially from merchants when they help facilitate a transaction. They dub it merchant discount rate.

And Affirm is continuously assessing customers' financial health after each purpose. He also said that come years from now, buy now, pay later will just be one way that Affirm makes money."", ""And so the idea that they're able to skirt around the risk that consumers won't be able to pay back is a key component of Affirm's business model. But there are currently five-- there are currently ratings of 5 buys, 11 holds, and 6 sells of Affirm on the street right now."", 'Some of the risks outline is that we saw that boom of e-commerce during the pandemic.

After all, a winner on the stock market is a winner, but there are some key differences between the way generations invest.', 'The most important one is their time horizon. Younger investors naturally have a longer time horizon than older investors, which generally manifests itself in greater risk tolerance.', 'Younger investors are better off trying to find the next Amazon or Tesla because they have the time to stay in the market to reap the benefit of those investments if they pay off. On the other hand, older investors such as retirees are more likely to invest in lower-risk assets like dividend stocks or bonds that come with an income stream and are less likely to result in steep losses.', ""Younger investors also have another advantage, which is the freedom to make mistakes. Since Gen Zers still have a number of working years ahead of them, and their portfolios are likely small, how their investments perform is less important than earning potential. They have a good opportunity to experiment and find the investing style that's best for them."", 'Lastly, as Peter Lynch advised, investors should buy what they know: They will have the greatest advantage by buying companies whose products or businesses they are familiar with.', 'Buying what you know means different things for different generations, of course. On that note, here are two tech stocks that look like great buys for Gen Z investors.', 'Few companies are as close to the cutting edge of financial services as Block (NYSE: SQ), which owns Square; Cash App; the Afterpay buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) service; the Tidal streaming service; TBD, a decentralized platform targeting Bitcoin and DeFi; as well as other smaller businesses.', 'Led by Jack Dorsey, Block seems to jibe well with Gen Z sensitivities. Dorsey, for example, is a big fan of Bitcoin, and Block holds Bitcoin on its balance sheet. Gen Zers are also fond of the digital, blockchain-based currencies, cryptocurrencies are actually the most widely held asset class among Gen Z after stocks, with 54% of Gen Z owning crypto and 60% owning stocks.', ""There's another key overlap between Gen Z and Block as well. This generation is fond of the Cash App, Block's peer-to-peer money transfer app that competes with PayPal's Venmo."", 'Though PayPal is still the most popular, Cash App does better with Gen Z than it does with other generations. According to data from YPulse, 55% of Gen Z has used PayPal, with Cash App coming in second with 38% adoption. A Piper Sandler survey of teens found that Cash App was the No. 1 choice for 50% of respondents.', ""Lastly, there's a more important reason for Gen Zers to consider investing in Block. The company continues to deliver solid growth and is penetrating massive addressable markets across all of its businesses."", 'Gross profit rose 21% to $1.9 billion in its most recent quarter, and its profit margins are ramping up quickly. With interest rates expected to come down next year, Block could be a big winner as that could help grease financial services companies.', 'Another stock with many of the same qualities as Block that appeals to Gen Z is Lemonade (NYSE: LMND), the insurance tech that is based on artificial intelligence (AI). It has targeted Gen Z with products like renters insurance, auto insurance, and pet insurance, and plans to keep expanding its product suite.', 'Like Block, Lemonade is targeting a massive addressable market and plans to win market share by focusing on the youngest insurance buyers -- Gen Zers -- who prefer an app-based interface and not having to talk to anyone on the phone.', ""The company has had a rough time on the stock market since its 2020 initial public offering (IPO), as it's still substantially below its IPO price of $29. However the business is growing quickly and continues to gain market share thanks to Gen Z and millennials, and it just passed 2 million active customers."", 'In its third quarter, revenue grew 55% to $114.5 million, and adjusted gross profit nearly doubled to $24.9 million. But the company is still losing money based on adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) with a loss of $40.2 million in the quarter.', ""Lemonade's investment in AI could give it an edge as well, though it's still unclear if that strategic bet will pay off. The stock carries lots of risk, but its valuation is reasonable: It trades at a price-to-sales ratio of around 3. Like Block, Lemonade should also benefit from falling interest rates, which tend to make unprofitable, high-growth stocks more attractive."", 'It will also make it easier for the company to borrow money if it needs to, and encourage consumer and business spending, which favors Lemonade.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Block right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Block, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Block wasn't one of them.

The other banks in this group are J.P. Morgan and Bank of America.', 'As a G-SIB, Citi is subjected to increased regulatory supervision by global bank regulators and central banks.

These reforms resulted in the largest G-SIBs moving away from risk-oriented banking activities such as advisory, high-yield lending, and trading, towards lower-risk activities. Indeed, Citi’s most valuable, high-growth segment, Treasury and Trade Solutions, is in lower-risk and entrenched activities such as liquidity and cash management, payments, trade solutions, and automated receivables processing.

The stock is up 65% in 2023 with just a couple weeks to go until 2024, a partial reverse from its precipitous fall after its publicly traded debut a couple years ago.', 'After its separation from IBM, Kyndryl has been restructuring for a new era of information technology -- and not just by making a maddening change from a fiscal year aligning with the calendar year to one ending every March. (The most recent Q2 fiscal 2024 was for the three-month period ended in September 2023). Kyndryl has been offloading unprofitable business as it steers its customers to a hybrid cloud strategy. With this migration now well underway, is Kyndryl stock still a top buy for 2024?', ""Before delving into Kyndryl's path forward, let's address what it does in the first place. Remember IBM mainframes? These days such machines may be referred to as servers, big computers, or, in some tech company reports, enterprise (or non-cloud) computers."", ""Basically, a mainframe is a powerful on-premises computer (one not housed in a data center) that's responsible for some heavy lifting for a company -- like crunching data before it heads for long-term storage, handling financial transactions, or filtering data to help an organization make financial plans and projections."", 'The cloud is all the rage these days. The public cloud, provided by companies like Amazon\'s AWS or Microsoft\'s\xa0Azure, is a shared data center-based infrastructure accessed via the internet. The new IBM post-Kyndryl split is focused on ""hybrid cloud,"" whereby a large organization uses public cloud infrastructure as well as its own privately owned and operated data centers.', 'So where does that leave a company like Kyndryl, which provides consulting and management services for the mainframe computing of yesteryear (or yester-decade)?', 'As it turns out, a hybrid cloud IT strategy still makes plenty of use of on-premises mainframes. Some data is just too critical or sensitive to be offloaded to a remote data center. So to this day, even left to its own devices, Kyndryl remains a close collaborator and business partner to the ""new"" hybrid cloud IBM.', ""That said, when Kyndryl was separated from IBM a couple of years ago, it looked like nothing more than a collection of IBM's unwanted no-growth and no-profit businesses -- and it was sandbagged with ample debt IBM didn't want, to boot."", 'But Kyndryl is fixing these problems by walking away from low- or no-margin mainframe business and instead promoting its higher-margin consulting and management services aimed at hybrid cloud. Today even mainframe management services tend to have flexible pricing like cloud computing platforms. And in a sign of the times, of course the catchphrase ""AI"" is being bandied about even when it comes to mainframe management.', ""Kyndryl's pivot is showing early signs of success. Q2 fiscal 2024 (again, the three months ended in September 2023) declined 3% year over year to $4.1 billion. But according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), net losses narrowed to $142 million, compared to a net loss of $281 million last year."", ""However, much of that GAAP net loss is due to noncash depreciation expenses on property and equipment and the amortization of intangible assets (both items expensed in the past, but their costs were realized over time for tax purposes). So, promisingly, Kyndryl's preferred adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization) was $574 million, up 34% from the same period a year ago."", 'For value investors looking to scoop up a hot deal, Kyndryl stock might check off some boxes. While the top-line revenue print is far from flattering, Kyndryl is making real and measurable progress on profitability. And the stock trades for 19 times trailing 12-month EBITDA -- a deal indeed if the company keeps making rapid advances on profit margins in the years ahead.', ""But some investors may not want to babysit a stock like this. Kyndryl is, after all, a rebound story in a very low-growth niche of the overall growing IT industry. Kyndryl doesn't pay a dividend, nor does it meaningfully repurchase stock -- at least not yet."", 'For most tech investors, Kyndryl is probably not a buy-now stock. Nevertheless, if unearthing stocks that do not reflect the full value of future business potential is your bag, Kyndryl might be worth doing some digging on.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Kyndryl right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Kyndryl, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Kyndryl wasn't one of them.

This probably means the low-hanging fruit found at the height of the 2022 bear market has largely disappeared.', 'Nonetheless, investors can find bargains, particularly with established tech giants that appear poised for a comeback. With the S&P 500 close to all-time highs, investors might want to consider IBM (NYSE: IBM), Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), and Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM). Here\'s why these three ""cheap"" tech stocks are potential buys right now.', 'For much of the previous decade, IBM stock fell into decline as most of its business segments became stagnant amid slowing or negative growth. But this has appeared to shift under current CEO Arvind Krishna, who led the historic $34 billion takeover of Red Hat, helping to transform IBM into a cloud giant.', 'That move made the company a leader in the hybrid cloud, the infrastructure that facilitates more-seamless integration between private and public clouds. It continued this transformation by spinning off its managed infrastructure business into Kyndryl and acquiring numerous cloud companies to increase its capabilities.', 'For 2023, IBM forecasts $10.5 billion in free cash flow, an increase of $1 billion for the year. That will help fund its more than $6 billion in annual dividend payments.', 'The payout, which amounts to $6.64 per share annually, has risen for 28 straight years, and its dividend yield is just above 4%. Thanks to the growth in its cloud business, the payout hikes should continue.', 'Admittedly, the stock has not risen significantly over the last year. Nonetheless, it sells near multiyear highs, and at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 22, investors can still buy into a tech recovery and income stream at an affordable price.', 'As with IBM, the loss of a technical lead wreaked havoc on Intel stock over the last few years. Consequently, rival Advanced Micro Devices took a technical lead in the CPU space, and it faces pressure from Nvidia and others in the data center business.', 'Still, CEO Pat Gelsinger envisions Intel retaking its technical lead. To that end, he has begun building foundries to support a new business, Intel Foundry Services (IFS). It has attracted clients such as Amazon and Cisco Systems, and chip design companies such as Nvidia have expressed an interest.', ""On the performance end, it has just released its Emerald Rapids CPUs. While Emerald Rapids might not outperform AMD's latest chips, it represents a considerable improvement that could help Intel meet its goal of technical parity in 2024."", ""The push to build foundries left Intel with a negative free cash flow of over $12 billion in the first nine months of the year. Still, the third quarter's adjusted free cash flow was $943 million, indicating its finances might finally be improving."", ""That could partly explain why its stock has risen nearly 60% over the last year. While its forward P/E of 48 might not look cheap, a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 4 is well below AMD's sales multiple of 10, indicating that more investors might perceive it as inexpensive as the company recovers."", 'Qualcomm is another established tech giant looking to recover. Unlike IBM and Intel, it never lost its technical lead, but sales of its market-leading 5G smartphone chipsets fell as consumers became more uncertain about the economy.', 'Moreover, Qualcomm is in a transition amid a likely decline in importance for the smartphone. To that end, it has also pivoted into the Internet of Things and automotive markets. But the company faces significant competition in these segments, which may have led to doubts about its future.', ""And 63% of its revenue came from China in fiscal 2023 (ended Sept. 24). As U.S.-China relations have become more tenuous, that dependence on China could raise concerns about Qualcomm's growth."", 'Indeed, the aforementioned falling sales brought about a 19% revenue decline in fiscal 2023. Still, the free cash flow of almost $10 billion increased amid rising receivables and falling payables. Also, revenue forecasts in the fiscal 2024 first quarter point to a possible return in growth.', 'As the slump seems to have ended, investors have bid the stock to 52-week highs. And even with the beginnings of a rising stock price, investors can buy Qualcomm at 22 times earnings, a low multiple by historical standards. Assuming demand for its chipsets has finally begun to recover, investors might want to buy this stock before it becomes more pricey.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in International Business Machines right now?', 'Before you buy stock in International Business Machines, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and International Business Machines wasn't one of them.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the banking sector and the performance of bank stocks, and go directly to read 5 Best Bank Dividend Stocks To Buy Now.', 'During most of the 2022 market decline, financial stocks were seen as a somewhat secure option. However, things shifted in March due to a crisis in regional banking. Investors got concerned about how much banks might lose because of increasing interest rates, and that changed the view of financial stocks as a safe bet. Amidst these shifts, while the Federal Reserve has been reducing the size of its balance sheet, a significant development has been occurring beneath the surface. Central banks have been actively bolstering support for markets by allowing bank reserves to grow. This expansion in reserves increases the amount of money available for banks to invest in both the markets and the broader economy. This action essentially provides banks with more capital, enabling them to have greater resources to allocate toward investments in financial markets and lending to businesses and individuals.', ""Research conducted by Matt King, previously a strategist at Citigroup and now leading his independent research firm, Satori Insights, proposes a noteworthy shift in focus. Rather than concentrating on the Federal Reserve's reduction in its overall balance sheet, King highlights the paramount importance of understanding the considerable $500 billion surge in reserves within the U.S. banking system since January. He further mentioned that other major central banks have followed a similar path as the Federal Reserve. Rather than withdrawing approximately $1 trillion in liquidity, as initially expected when they declared a proactive stance against inflation in 2022, these prominent global central banks opted to inject nearly an equivalent sum into the financial system."", ""On December 14, shares of U.S. banks surged significantly following the Federal Reserve's indication of possible interest rate cuts in 2024. This optimistic signal propelled the sector to reach its highest level since the early part of March. The positive momentum was further fueled by Wells Fargo and BofA Global Research analysts, who responded to the Fed's more accommodative stance by increasing their price targets for various banks within the sector. This shift in sentiment also serves as a reminder of how sensitive financial markets can be to signals from key financial institutions like the Federal Reserve. While the recent positive momentum might paint a hopeful picture, it doesn't overshadow the fact that banking stocks have lagged in terms of growth and returns when compared to the overall market trends. S&P Banks Select Industry Index, which tracks the performance of prominent financial stocks like Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC), Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C), and KeyCorp (NYSE:KEY), gained 1.88% so far this year, compared with broader market’s 23.4% rally."", 'The financial crisis has prompted Wall Street banks to adopt and heavily rely on Artificial Intelligence (AI) to revolutionize the landscape of finance.

The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period.

So it seems the smart money knows that debt - which is usually involved in bankruptcies - is a very important factor, when you assess how risky a company is. We note that Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) does have debt on its balance sheet. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky."", ""Generally speaking, debt only becomes a real problem when a company can't easily pay it off, either by raising capital or with its own cash flow. Part and parcel of capitalism is the process of 'creative destruction' where failed businesses are mercilessly liquidated by their bankers. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, debt can be an important tool in businesses, particularly capital heavy businesses. The first step when considering a company's debt levels is to consider its cash and debt together."", ' View our latest analysis for Verizon Communications ', 'The chart below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that Verizon Communications had US$151.4b in debt in September 2023; about the same as the year before. On the flip side, it has US$4.31b in cash leading to net debt of about US$147.1b.', 'Zooming in on the latest balance sheet data, we can see that Verizon Communications had liabilities of US$55.7b due within 12 months and liabilities of US$230.1b due beyond that. Offsetting this, it had US$4.31b in cash and US$24.1b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So it has liabilities totalling US$257.3b more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined.', 'This deficit casts a shadow over the US$157.1b company, like a colossus towering over mere mortals. So we definitely think shareholders need to watch this one closely. At the end of the day, Verizon Communications would probably need a major re-capitalization if its creditors were to demand repayment.', ""We measure a company's debt load relative to its earnings power by looking at its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and by calculating how easily its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) cover its interest expense (interest cover). The advantage of this approach is that we take into account both the absolute quantum of debt (with net debt to EBITDA) and the actual interest expenses associated with that debt (with its interest cover ratio)."", ""Verizon Communications's debt is 3.1 times its EBITDA, and its EBIT cover its interest expense 6.5 times over. This suggests that while the debt levels are significant, we'd stop short of calling them problematic. Unfortunately, Verizon Communications saw its EBIT slide 4.0% in the last twelve months. If that earnings trend continues then its debt load will grow heavy like the heart of a polar bear watching its sole cub. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Verizon Communications can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting."", ""Finally, while the tax-man may adore accounting profits, lenders only accept cold hard cash. So it's worth checking how much of that EBIT is backed by free cash flow. Over the last three years, Verizon Communications recorded negative free cash flow, in total. Debt is usually more expensive, and almost always more risky in the hands of a company with negative free cash flow. Shareholders ought to hope for an improvement."", ""We'd go so far as to say Verizon Communications's level of total liabilities was disappointing. But at least it's pretty decent at covering its interest expense with its EBIT; that's encouraging. Overall, it seems to us that Verizon Communications's balance sheet is really quite a risk to the business. For this reason we're pretty cautious about the stock, and we think shareholders should keep a close eye on its liquidity. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. To that end, you should be aware of the   1 warning sign  we've spotted with Verizon Communications ."", ""At the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt.

With the excitement generated by ChatGPT, investors have rushed into many prominent AI stocks.', ""Such price action may persuade investors to make a New Year's resolution to buy a specific stock. Verizon (NYSE: VZ) is one to consider. Investors hammered it as debt costs and growth struggles weighed on the telecom stock. Nonetheless, thanks to a critical piece of news, this stock is likely to surge higher in the new year for one key reason."", 'Admittedly, after years of declines, one can understand some hesitation to buy Verizon. The stock has fallen 35% over the last five years as slow customer growth, competition from T-Mobile and AT&T, and the massive capital costs in a nearly continuous process of network upgrades weighed on the company.', 'Consequently, Verizon managed to rack up nearly $147 billion in debt, and that is without the costly moves into pay TV and content that have hurt AT&T. Over the next year, almost $13 billion in debt will come due on debt ranging from 1.625% to 4.073% in interest costs.', 'Hence, unless it reduces or eliminates the dividend, which is on track to cost it $11 billion in 2023, Verizon will likely have to turn to the capital markets to refinance most of the debt at higher rates. Worse, it could have to keep repeating this process in subsequent years.', 'However, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has held the federal funds rate steady and indicated the Fed will reduce it three times in 2024. That move could reduce the effect of the higher rates as it issues new debt.', ""Moreover, lower rates could improve Verizon's revenue prospects. Businesses had cut back on activity with the higher cost of borrowing, but lower rates could mean that they'll resume spending."", ""This is important because J.D. Power has named Verizon No. 1 for network quality 31 consecutive times. Networks like Verizon's support AI-driven activities, and such accolades could make it the best-positioned telecom company to attract that business."", ""AI has also helped foster an additional source of revenue for Verizon. Its 5G network can support AI-driven tasks such as repetitive work and bring insights and innovation in real time, making Verizon's network a critical component of increasing productivity."", ""As a result, enterprises as diverse as Honda Motor Company and Arizona State University rely on Verizon's 5G to support connectivity and IT-related functions that are critical for AI to work. Attracting similar clients will almost certainly make Verizon's 5G network and the application of AI more critical."", 'As such benefits become more evident to investors, more people and entities may want to become Verizon shareholders. In the recent past, its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just under 8 did not attract investors due to slow growth and high debts. Still, if AI-driven applications start to spur more revenue growth, investors will probably respond positively to the low earnings multiple.', 'Investors may also be in better shape with regard to the dividend. After 17 yearly increases, the annual payout of $2.66 per share amounts to a dividend yield of over 7%, nearly five times the S&P 500 average of 1.5%.', ""Admittedly, one could argue that eliminating the dividend helps Verizon stock since it makes faster debt reduction possible. Still, lower debt costs make it less costly to maintain a payout, which could preserve the stock's appeal to income investors."", ""Verizon's support of AI-driven applications makes its stock more appealing under current conditions. Since it leads in network quality, it has already begun to serve the 5G-related AI needs of clients, a business that will likely grow."", ""With the added prospect of falling interest rates, adopting that technology could accelerate. Moreover, lower rates should make the company's debt load more manageable, increasing the shareholder appeal of Verizon stock in the new year."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Verizon Communications right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Verizon Communications, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Verizon Communications wasn't one of them.

In my view, a new bull market begins when two criteria are met. First, an index must have rebounded at least 20% from recent bear market lows. Second, it must set a new all-time high.', ""The S&P 500 has met the first threshold but hasn't quite achieved the second one. There's better news, though, for the widely followed Dow Jones Industrial Average. A new bull market is here for the Dow Jones. Here are the three best Dow stocks to buy for 2024, listed in alphabetical order."", ""American Express (NYSE: AXP) was added to the Dow Jones in 1982, making it one of the index's five longest members. The company is a giant in the financial services industry, providing global credit-card payment-processing services."", ""The Dow's performance has been helped quite a bit by American Express in 2023. Amex stock has soared more than 20% year to date, with the company's third-quarter update providing a nice catalyst."", 'Amex reported its sixth consecutive quarter of record revenue in Q3. Its earnings per share jumped 34% year over year to a record high, as well. With the U.S. economy seemingly in a good position to continue chugging along, American Express should be able to keep its momentum going in 2024.', ""Even after delivering solid gains this year, American Express shares trade at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of only around 14.5. That's a much more attractive valuation than fellow Dow Jones member and top credit-card rival Visa. I think the stock should have plenty of room to run in the new year."", ""It's possible that the Dow Jones could enjoy a strong bull market without Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) performing well. However, I think it's unlikely. Microsoft makes up more than 6.5% of the index, ranking behind only UnitedHealth Group\xa0and Goldman Sachs."", 'Microsoft has been sizzling hot in 2023, with its shares skyrocketing more than 50%. The company has been a big beneficiary of the explosion of interest in generative AI, thanks to its partnership with and large stake in ChatGPT creator OpenAI.', 'Some might worry that the party could soon be over for Microsoft. After all, its stock now trades at a forward earnings multiple of 33, which reflects a premium valuation. However, the generative AI boom should provide a major tailwind for the company for years to come.', ""I also like that Microsoft is well-positioned in several other hot technology areas. The company is now even more of a force in the gaming market with its acquisition of Activision Blizzard. It's a top cloud services provider and cybersecurity leader. It's also one of a handful of companies at the forefront of quantum-computing research."", 'Unlike American Express and Microsoft, Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ) has held the Dow Jones back in 2023. Shares of the telecommunications company are down close to 5% this year.', ""There's more to the story, though. Verizon stock had fallen more than 20% year to date, as of early October. But it began a big comeback later in the month, thanks to strong Q3 results."", 'Verizon beat Wall Street earnings estimates. Its year-to-date free cash flow improved by $2.2 billion year over year, enough to prompt the company to raise its full-year free-cash-flow guidance.', 'Things are looking up for Verizon. Value investors could find the stock especially attractive since its shares trade at only 8x expected earnings.', 'Income investors have a lot to like about Verizon, too, with a dividend yield that currently stands at 7.1%. The company has increased its dividend for 17 consecutive years. With the company generating more free cash flow, I expect this streak of dividend hikes will continue in 2024.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Verizon Communications right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Verizon Communications, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Verizon Communications wasn't one of them.

Although 2023 has been a banner year for equities, highlighted by the outperformance of the high-growth ""Magnificent Seven,"" it\'s dividend stocks that should be on investors\' radar as we prepare to open the curtain on\xa0 2024.', ""Publicly traded companies that offer a regular dividend to their shareholders are almost always profitable on a recurring basis and time-tested. What's more, income stocks have left non-payers eating their dust. Between 1972 and 2012, companies initiating and growing their payouts generated an annualized return of 9.5%. That compares to a meager 1.6% annualized return for public companies that didn't offer a dividend between 1972 and 2012."", 'However, not all dividend stocks are cut from the same cloth. As we get ready to move into the new year, five exceptionally safe high-yield dividend stocks (those with yields of at least 4%) stand out as top buys.', ""The first extremely safe high-yield dividend stock that's begging to be bought in 2024 is telecom company Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ)."", ""Although Verizon's high-growth days are long gone, upgrading its network to handle 5G download speeds is providing a healthy and sustainable lift to its bottom line. The company's wireless division generates its juiciest margins from data -- and data consumption should continue to climb as consumers upgrade their wireless devices."", ""Additionally, Verizon is beginning to see the payoff from its aggressive spending on mid-band spectrum. Having the ability to offer at-home 5G broadband has helped Verizon secure more than 400,000 net broadband additions in each of the past four quarters. Broadband might not be the growth driver it once was, but it's the perfect tool to encourage its customers to bundle their services. Bundling tends to lead to higher margins and better customer retention."", 'Investors would also be wise to look past the mostly unwarranted concerns regarding lead-clad cables that were raised in a July report by The Wall Street Journal. Verizon has noted that lead-sheathed cables account for a small percentage of its current network. Further, any future liability would be established by the U.S. courts, which could take many years to work its way through.', 'Valued at roughly 8 times forward-year earnings, there appears to be a solid floor and reasonable upside for Verizon stock.', ""A second super safe high-yield dividend stock that's ripe for the picking as we get ready to turn the page to 2024 is retail real estate investment trust (REIT) Realty Income (NYSE: O). Realty Income pays its dividend monthly and has increased its payout in each of the past 104 quarters."", ""While the prospect of a recession in 2024 has some investors concerned, Realty Income's more than 13,000-unit commercial real estate (CRE) portfolio is built to thrive in virtually any economic climate. Over 90% of Realty Income's total rent is resilient to economic downturns."", ""More specifically, over a third of the company's annualized contractual rent originates from grocery stores, convenience stores, dollar stores, and drugstores. These are businesses that provide basic-need goods and services and will therefore draw in customers, no matter how well or poorly the U.S. economy performs."", ""We've also begun to see Realty Income diversify its CRE portfolio. The company has made two gaming industry transactions in less than two years, and is in the process of acquiring Spirit Realty Capital in a deal valued at $9.3 billion. The latter is a complementary deal that'll help Realty Income diversify into new industries and become even more resilient to economic downturns."", 'Realty Income is valued at 13 times consensus cash flow for 2024, which represents its lowest multiple to cash flow in more than a decade.', ""The third safe high-yield dividend stock that makes for a genius buy in 2024 is pharmaceutical company Pfizer (NYSE: PFE). Except for a very short period during the Great Recession, Pfizer's existing yield of 6.3% has never been higher."", ""The knock against Pfizer is that its massive bump in sales from COVID-19 vaccines has largely been backed out of its revenue and profit forecasts moving forward. Now that the worst of the pandemic is in the rearview mirror, attention has turned to Pfizer's other drugs and its expansive pipeline. With Pfizer's 2024 guidance failing to impress, shares fell to a 10-year low."", ""Though Pfizer anticipates a $0.40-per-share hit to its earnings in the new year due to its now-completed $43 billion acquisition of cancer drug developer Seagen, it's important to recognize that this isn't a recurring loss or expense for the company. The combination of these two businesses will eventually result in recurring cost savings, as well as add billions of dollars in annual revenue for Pfizer."", ""Equally important is the fact that Pfizer's non-COVID therapeutics are still growing. Sales for non-COVID products jumped 10% during the third quarter, with Pfizer's Special Care segment leading the way. If the company's COVID-19 sales bump hadn't occurred, it's unlikely we'd see such an overreaction to sales and profits returning to their normal (i.e., modest) upward trajectory."", 'At less than 3 times forecast sales in 2023 and 2024, Pfizer looks to be quite the bargain for patient income seekers.', 'Safe high-yield dividend stocks can be found in the small-cap arena, too! Business development company (BDC) PennantPark Floating Rate Capital (NYSE: PFLT), which also pays its dividend on a monthly basis, is a rock-solid income stock to buy for 2024.', 'BDCs are businesses that invest in the debt and/or equity of middle-market companies. By ""middle market,"" I mean generally unproven micro-cap and small-cap businesses. In PennantPark\'s case, a sizable percentage of its portfolio is tied up in debt securities.', ""The clear advantage of this debt-focused approach can be seen in the yield PennantPark generates. Since most small businesses are unproven, their access to traditional debt and credit markets may be limited or closed off entirely. As a result, financing deals are often secured at lending rates that are well above average. As of Sept. 30, PennantPark's weighted average yield on debt investments was a cool 12.6%!"", ""The key to PennantPark's success -- in case the company's full name didn't already give it away -- is that 100% of its $906.3 million debt-securities portfolio sports variable rates. The Federal Reserve just undertook its most aggressive rate-hiking cycle in four decades. These cumulative rate hikes since March 2022 have increased PennantPark's weighted average yield on debt investments by 520 basis points."", ""Furthermore, PennantPark's management team has done a truly phenomenal job of protecting the company's invested assets. The average investment size spanning 131 companies is just $8.1 million, and 99.99% of the company's debt securities are first-lien secured. First-lien secured debt holders are at the front of the line for repayment in the event that a borrower seeks bankruptcy protection."", 'The last of the safest high-yield dividend stocks to buy for 2024 is none other than tobacco juggernaut Altria Group (NYSE: MO). Altria has raised its payout 58 times over the past 54 years, which makes it a true Dividend King.', 'The clear problem for Altria and its peers is that consumers have wised up about the potential dangers of long-term tobacco use. Since the mid-1960s, adult cigarette smoking rates in the U.S. have fallen from around 42% to just 11.5%, as of 2021. A shrinking pool of potential customers has led to modest declines in aggregate cigarette shipments for Altria.', ""However, Altria Group has exceptional pricing power in its corner. Tobacco products contain nicotine, an addictive chemical. The strong desire to continue using tobacco products has allowed Altria to pass along price hikes that often outweigh any decline in cigarette shipments. It also doesn't hurt that premium brand Marlboro accounts for more than 42% of retail cigarette share, which makes raising prices relatively easy."", 'Altria Group is also looking beyond its traditional tobacco lines and shifting its sales toward smokeless products. For instance, it completed the acquisition of electronic-vapor company NJOY Holdings for $2.75 billion in early June. NJOY has received a half-dozen marketing granted orders (MGOs) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for its products and devices. These MGOs grant NJOY the right to keep its items on retail shelves. The vast majority of e-vapor companies lack MGOs.', ""Similar to Verizon, Altria Group's forward-year price-to-earnings ratio of 8 provides a safe floor, with plenty of upside for long-term, income-seeking investors."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Verizon Communications right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Verizon Communications, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Verizon Communications wasn't one of them.

The company recently reported earnings for its third quarter of fiscal 2024, ended Oct. 29, handily beating its revenue guidance and setting a new record.', ""But even after its 240% stock return so far this year, there are plenty of reasons to believe the party is just getting started for Nvidia. Let's dig into the tailwinds pushing demand for the company's semiconductor chips and assess if now is a buying opportunity for long-term investors."", 'Nvidia specializes in the production of graphics processing units (GPUs). GPUs play a critical role in gaming, crypto mining, and AI. When it comes to AI use cases, GPU chips are designed to help power large language models (LLMs). This is important because LLMs are a core component of generative AI applications.', ""Given the skyrocketing rise of Microsoft's ChatGPT and Alphabet's Bard, it's easy to draw a dotted line connecting Nvidia to a host of other major AI players.

Nvidia stock could face a tougher 2024 after two recent developments. Here's a look at each and why they could be a problem for Nvidia."", ""Nvidia has commanded a dominant position in the AI chip market so far. There simply hasn't been much competition. However, that's changing."", ""Last week, Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) announced plans to launch its new Gaudi3 chip in 2024. Gaudi3 is specifically designed to run generative AI applications. It should compete head-to-head against Nvidia's H100, the current market leader in powering AI apps run on server farms."", 'Intel stated in a press release that it ""has seen a rapid expansion of its Gaudi pipeline due to growing and proven performance advances, combined with highly competitive TCO [total cost of ownership] and pricing."" The company believes that it will be able to increase its market share in the AI accelerator market next year thanks to the introduction of the Gaudi3 chip.', 'But that\'s not all. Intel is also launching its new Core Ultra chip for running AI apps on personal computers. CEO Pat Gelsinger said, ""We\'ve been seeing the excitement with generative AI, the star of the show for 2023."" He added, ""We think the AI PC will be the star of the show for the upcoming year.""', ""Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) announcement of its new Gemini large language models (LLM) on Dec. 6 deserved all the attention that it received. The most powerful version of the new LLM model, Gemini Ultra, beat the current state-of-the-art AI models on 30 of 32 benchmarks. It even outperformed human experts on the MMLU (massive multitask language understanding) test -- the first AI system to do so."", 'What didn\'t receive as much attention, though, was another new product. Google DeepMind CEO and co-founder Demis Hassabis revealed in a blog post the launch of Cloud TPU v5p. The new tensor processing unit (TPU) chip is specifically designed for training AI models. Hassabis stated that it\'s ""the most powerful, efficient, and scalable TPU system to date.""', ""Importantly, Google trained Gemini using its own TPUs. There was no mention of Nvidia's GPUs at all. The introduction of Cloud TPU v5p could signal a key advance in Google's AI chip technology."", ""Sure, Google remains closely connected with Nvidia. In August, the two companies announced an expansion of their partnership to make Nvidia's generative AI technology available to Google Cloud customers. However, it's clear that Google doesn't want to depend entirely on Nvidia."", ""Do Intel's launches of the Gaudi 3 and Core Ultra AI chips and Google's introduction of its Cloud TPU v5p mean that Nvidia is in dire and imminent trouble? No. There's no reason to think that Nvidia's GPUs won't remain the gold standard for AI apps for now."", ""However, investors are banking on Nvidia continuing to deliver tremendous growth over the next few years. Anything that disrupts that growth could weigh on Nvidia's share price."", ""Nvidia is subject to the laws of supply and demand. The company's soaring profits (and stock price) have been due to fast-growing demand for its GPUs, combined with a limited supply of the AI chips. The recent moves by Intel and Google could diminish the demand for Nvidia's GPUs to some extent."", ""Again, I don't expect Nvidia's momentum to be completely derailed as a result of these new chips. However, it's reasonable to anticipate that Nvidia could face a tougher slog in 2024 than it has in 2023.

"", ""If you liken the artificial intelligence boom to the California Gold Rush, Nvidia would sell the picks and shovels instead of mining for gold. This strategy gives the company a massive market opportunity and shields it from rising competition in the more consumer/client-focused side of the industry. And despite its market cap of $1.21 trillion, investors aren't too late to bet on the chip makers' long-term potential.

"", ""This level of growth is staggering for such a large company. More importantly, it is translating to record-breaking profitability. Net income surged more than 1,200% to $9.24 billion. This can be credited to Nvidia's spectacular pricing power because of low competition, which has led to high margins. "", 'Rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices are racing to bring competition to the AI chip market. But with industry experts expecting the opportunity to be worth $400 billion by 2027, there is plenty of room for more players. ', ""While Nvidia's trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 65 looks high compared to the S&P 500 average of 26, this is a backward-looking metric that doesn't account for the company's epic growth rate. With a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 25, Nvidia stock is still affordable relative to its projected earnings."", 'Like Nvidia, Amazon is another technology giant focusing on the infrastructure side of the AI opportunity, albeit a little bit further up the food chain. The company is incorporating AI-related services into its cloud computing platform AWS, and this could add much-needed growth and diversification to its sprawling technology empire. ', 'In September, Amazon announced the general availability of Bedrock, a platform designed to help clients build and scale customizable AI models. Bedrock will compete with similar services from rivals like Alphabet and Microsoft. But its association with the AWS ecosystem (the leading cloud service provider) could give it an economic moat. Because of its scale, more users are familiar with AWS, and enterprises may prefer to take a one-stop-shop approach to all their cloud computing needs. ', ""Amazon has also built its own AI-capable chips, Trainium and Inferentia, which could help lower costs and reduce Amazon's dependence on third-party providers for its hardware. "", ""With a forward P/E of 40, Amazon stock isn't cheap. But part of the premium valuation can be explained by management's ongoing cost-cutting efforts, which are improving the company's bottom line. Third-quarter net income rose 244% year over year to $9.88 billion. "", 'Throughout their histories, Nvidia and Amazon have gone through substantial evolutions in their business models. ', 'Nvidia made its name selling GPUs for personal computers before demand shifted toward cryptocurrency mining and data centers.\xa0Amazon started off as an online bookseller before transitioning to a generalized third-party marketplace that gets most of its profits from cloud computing.

However, investors might be overlooking a clear opportunity or potential setback if there is no rational basis for the P/E.', ""With its earnings growth in positive territory compared to the declining earnings of most other companies, Genuine Parts has been doing quite well of late.

Meanwhile, the rest of the market is forecast to expand by 12% per annum, which is noticeably more attractive.', 'With this information, we find it interesting that Genuine Parts is trading at a fairly similar P/E to the market. It seems most investors are ignoring the fairly limited growth expectations and are willing to pay up for exposure to the stock. Maintaining these prices will be difficult to achieve as this level of earnings growth is likely to weigh down the shares eventually.', ""While the price-to-earnings ratio shouldn't be the defining factor in whether you buy a stock or not, it's quite a capable barometer of earnings expectations."", ""Our examination of Genuine Parts' analyst forecasts revealed that its inferior earnings outlook isn't impacting its P/E as much as we would have predicted. When we see a weak earnings outlook with slower than market growth, we suspect the share price is at risk of declining, sending the moderate P/E lower. This places shareholders' investments at risk and potential investors in danger of paying an unnecessary premium."", 'You always need to take note of risks, for example - Genuine Parts has 1 warning sign   we think you should be aware of.', 'Of course, you might also be able to find a better stock than Genuine Parts.

The iconic Dow Jones Industrial Average recently hit an all-time closing high, while the benchmark S&P 500 and growth-driven Nasdaq Composite are respectively higher by 23% and 42% on a year-to-date basis, as of Dec. 15."", ""Yet in spite of these already huge gains, some of Wall Street's smartest and most-successful money managers are positioning their funds to benefit from a continued surge in growth stocks in the new year. Based on the latest round of Form 13F filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, billionaire money managers absolutely want to own the following three growth stocks in 2024."", ""The first high-powered growth stock that billionaire investors have flocked to is data-mining company Palantir Technologies (NYSE: PLTR). The third quarter saw six billionaire asset managers add to their funds' existing positions or open a new position, including (total shares purchased in parenthesis):"", 'David Siegel and John Overdeck of Two Sigma Investments (4,655,969 shares)', 'Jim Simons of Renaissance Technologies (3,805,496 shares)', 'Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management (893,931 shares)', 'Israel Englander of Millennium Management (604,716 shares)', 'Jaff Yass of Susquehanna International (509,063 shares)', 'The lure of Palantir Technologies likely boils down to four factors.', ""To start with, Palantir has turned the corner to recurring profitability on the basis of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Mindful cost-cutting, coupled with a steady double-digit growth rate, have pushed Palantir into the recurring profit column faster than Wall Street had expected. Although the company's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is still at nosebleed levels, the simple fact that it's profitable on a GAAP basis somewhat changes the dynamic of the valuation discussion."", ""Secondly, there's a lot of excitement surrounding artificial intelligence (AI), and Palantir gives investors the ability to have a front-row seat to this next-big-thing investment. Palantir's Gotham platform is driven by AI and machine learning to assist federal agencies with mission planning, data culling, and a host of other tasks. The analysts at PwC have estimated that AI could boost global gross domestic product by close to $16 trillion come 2030."", ""Another factor at play is the early innings growth potential of Palantir's Foundry platform. Foundry offers solutions to businesses that'll help them make sense of big data, with the purpose of streamlining their operations. Foundry's commercial customer count grew by a hearty 34% in the September-ended quarter from the prior-year period."", 'Lastly, there are no large-scale substitutes for Palantir. Though its stock may be pricey, no other company services federal agencies and wide-ranging businesses with AI-driven, dynamic solutions quite like Palantir. This gives it an incredibly sturdy moat.', 'Third-quarter 13F filings also make it abundantly clear that billionaire money managers absolutely want to own shares of social media stock Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) in the new year. A grand total of 10 billionaires opened a position in, or added to their existing position in, Meta Platforms in the September-ended quarter, including (total shares purchased in parenthesis):', 'Stephen Mandel of Lone Pine Capital (2,779,103 shares)', 'Dan Loeb of Third Point (1,100,000 shares)', 'David Siegel and John Overdeck of Two Sigma Investments (583,953 shares)', 'Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (525,573 shares)', 'Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management (496,278 shares)', 'Ole Andreas Halvorsen of Viking Global Investors (462,474 shares)', 'David Tepper of Appaloosa Management (447,500 shares)', 'Chase Coleman of Tiger Global Management (330,800 shares)', 'Ken Fisher of Fisher Asset Management (158,862 shares)', 'The likeliest reason these 10 billionaire investors have plowed their respective fund\'s money into Meta is its dominance in the social media space. Despite seemingly never-ending competition, Meta\'s social media ""real estate"" consistently sits at the top of the pecking order. Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Facebook Messenger are among the four most-downloaded apps globally.', ""To build on this point, the sheer number of monthly active users (MAUs) Meta is able to draw in with its social media apps is jaw-dropping. The September-ended quarter featured 3.96 billion MAUs from its family of apps. That's more than half of the world's adult population visiting a Meta-owned asset at least once monthly. It's precisely the reason why Meta can typically command strong ad-pricing power."", ""Billionaire money managers are probably also enamored with Meta's cash flow and its balance sheet. This is a company that closed out the September quarter with north of $61 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, as well as $51.7 billion in net cash from operations through the first nine months of 2023. Meta's pristine balance sheet affords risk-tasking that most other companies couldn't even dream about."", ""For example, CEO Mark Zuckerberg is intent on aggressively innovating with regard to augmented and virtual reality. Despite steep losses from Meta's Reality Labs segment, the company remains quite profitable and is still easily growing its cash pile."", ""There's an intriguing value proposition with Meta, as well. Even after more than tripling from its 2022 bear market low, it's trading a sizable discount to its cash flow multiple over the previous five years."", 'The third growth stock billionaire money managers absolutely want to own in 2024 is media giant Walt Disney (NYSE: DIS). Based on the latest round of 13Fs, four prominent billionaire investors piled into the famed ""House of Mouse,"" including (total shares purchased in parenthesis):', 'Nelson Peltz of Trian Fund Management (26,443,257 shares)', 'Israel Englander of Millennium Management (2,963,518 shares)', 'Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors (568,101 shares)', 'Ken Fisher of Fisher Asset Management (399,294 shares)', ""Arguably the top catalyst for Walt Disney is the normalization of its operations worldwide. The COVID-19 pandemic clobbered both its theme-park operations and film entertainment segment. With China abandoning its stringent COVID-19 mitigation measures last December, and consumers steadily returning to theaters, there's a clear path for Disney to return to strong top- and bottom-line growth."", ""Another reason billionaire investors are drawn to Walt Disney is the company's irreplaceability. While there are plenty of other theme-park operators and content creators, none has the characters or engagement factor that Disney brings to the table.

But there is some optimism, according to our next guest, particularly in snack foods. For more on the 2024 consumer staples outlook, we're talking to Jason English, Goldman Sachs managing director."", ""Jason, it's great to see you. As you know, Jason, listen, 2023, not easy if you were long consumer staples. As an analyst, Jason, what are the core financial metrics you're watching to gauge, you know, how this sector is going to perform now as we head into 2024?"", ""JASON ENGLISH: Well, Josh, some of the last year's underperformance has to do with two sessions ago, where you talked about the fear versus greed index. Needless to say, consumer staples rest heavily on the fear side. So when the market's in agreed on moment as we are right now or mood, clearly my sector is left out behind."", ""Now from a fundamental perspective, next year is very much about the chase for top line growth. We've had very robust sales growth the last couple of years fueled by pricing. The inflation backdrop required a lot of price growth for these companies. They achieved that they gave leverage throughout the P&L, particularly as some of the input costs have begun to subside, but now focuses on volume, because next year, we're not going to have the type of inflation supporting topline growth. And of late, volume growth just hasn't been there."", ""In fact, volumes have been declining in the US for these large processed packaged food companies. If they can't get it back to growth, then the top lines are going to stall out. And these P&L's just won't work. They won't deliver the type of bottom line growth that investors and management teams are expecting."", ""JULIE HYMAN: Yeah. And we've definitely started to hear some food companies, whether it's consumer staples or on the restaurant side, talk about deflation as well that we are now seeing-- going to see creep into some of these goods. Are there any companies that are going to be able to have pricing power going into 2024? And if there are, what distinguishes them from their competitors?"", ""JASON ENGLISH: Yeah. It's a good question, Julie. And this is good news for consumers. Obviously, the cost to buy a groceries has been going nothing but higher the last few years. As we look into next year, in some pockets, we would actually expect a degree of deflation. Some of those are pass through categories like meat or flour. But even in more branded-centric companies, like canned goods, soup, for example, we're seeing deflation as promotions come back to the market."", ""So these companies need to get volume going, look for them to spend into more promotions. Good news for the consumer, not necessarily good news for many of the companies, because that deflation is really expensive and damaging to the P&L. So the question you asked is spot on, who are the companies who can have continued pricing power, resilient price growth, even if modest? There, we look to companies with emerging market exposure, where we're expecting the rate of inflation in those markets to sustain."", ""Companies that fit that bill would be Procter & Gamble, Colgate, Coke, Mondelez is some examples. And then we're also favoring snack food companies, where there's a degree of conspicuous consumption that gives brands more power with more brand-centric, also comes more pricing power. And I like snack foods in particular, because the market's really thrown them out with the bathwater this year, because the volume has been weak for the industry at large. And many are arguing that GLP-1s are going to destroy volume. It's caused many of these snack food companies to derail. I think that fear is overdone. And I'm looking for a bounce back next year with snack foods.""]"

While renewable energy investments are significantly surpassing conventional energy investments, fossil fuels severely disrupted and confused the markets over the last few years with uncertainty. The Russia-Ukraine war sent the oil and gas prices flying, threw supply chains into disorder, caused the inflation rates to skyrocket, and forced the Fed into taking aggressive measures.', 'Fossil fuel’s ability to provide energy at any time of the day or year has made it the most important energy source of today. On the other hand, mainly due to high-interest rates, renewable energy investments slowed down in 2022. In 2023, the renewable energy stocks did not perform well. iShares Global Clean Energy ETF (ICLN), Invesco WilderHill Clean Energy ETF (PBW), and SPDR S&P Kensho Clean Power ETF (CNRG) have shown low double-digit year-to-date declines as of December 15.', 'Nevertheless, the latest Fed announcement has brought optimism to the market.

(NYSE: PLD) said it expects inflation to slow more quickly than expected, giving the Federal Reserve more latitude to cut the federal funds rate — the rate banks charge each other for overnight loans — deeper than it or even the markets are anticipating.', 'The current federal funds rate sits at a range of 5.25% to 5.5%. The Fed’s projections made last week indicate a pivot to three to four rate cuts in 2024, bringing the rate down to the 4.5% to 4.62% range. Market participants believe there will be deeper cuts than that next year as inflation continues to slow appreciably. Prologis’ forecast tends to lean toward the market view.', 'In its forecast, Prologis said that the 10-year Treasury yield, the mechanism often used to benchmark the cost of real estate loans, will fall below 4% in 2024. As of Monday morning, the yield on the 10-year note stood at 3.91%.', 'Prologis predicted that the rate cuts will be back-loaded into the second half of the year. This in turn will encourage “institutional dry powder” to reenter the market as the capital markets cycle begins to turn. Institutional funds, which generally drive logistics real estate development, have mostly been parked on the sidelines amid what had been an 18-month spike in borrowing costs.', 'The rapid rise in interest rates, which Prologis Chairman and CEO Hamid R. Moghadam has criticized on several occasions as being overdone, has led to a dramatic decline in construction project starts. Prologis expects that the decline in global construction starts to intensify in 2024 to hit the lowest level since the 2008 financial crisis.', 'The U.S. vacancy rate could climb to the high 5% range as projects currently under development are delivered, according to Prologis, which said vacancy rates will eventually drop into the 4% range as additional capacity is absorbed.', 'In an email to FreightWaves, Prologis said it arrived at its interest rate forecast after analyzing cost and pricing trends throughout the supply chain, as well as supply and demand factors. The company said discretionary spending on travel, entertainment and housing could slow appreciably in 2024, if not enter into deflationary cycles.', 'Among Prologis’ 2024 projections is a reversal in the global freight recession, paced by double-digit growth in port and truck traffic. Latin American rents will grow at more than double the global average, led in part by an increase in production nearshoring. Vacancy rates in Mexico, currently under 2%, will remain tight in 2024. Supply will be capped by limited access to sufficient power sources, especially for new manufacturing-related requirements.', 'Technology advancements will drive up energy requirements in logistics facilities, incentivizing owners to double solar capacity, Prologis predicted. Logistics warehousing demand in China will rise to its second-highest level on record, the company forecast.', 'Cap rate compression will occur in U.S. and European markets but go the other way in Asia, Prologis said. Cap rates are inversely related to market pricing; thus when cap rate compression occurs, prices increase without a relative increase in rental income.', 'Like every broad-based forecast, not all of Prologis’ 2023 projections panned out. U.S. rent growth rose 7% during the year, not the 10% that Prologis had forecast. E-commerce leasing this year proceeded at a moderate pace and was not the second-most active year on record (after 2021) that the company had predicted. Demand for solar warehouse capacity was held back by supply chain issues and did not grow as rapidly as Prologis had forecast.', 'The post Prologis sees faster interest rate declines as inflation eases appeared first on FreightWaves.']"

In that line of thought, here's a look at why UPS (NYSE: UPS), Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), and machine vision company Cognex (NASDAQ: CGNX) are good ways to play this theme."", ""I'll start with a few words/charts on why rates could be lower. A quick look at the recent inflation data shows a continuation of a downtrend that began in the summer of 2022."", 'The data was good enough to lower market interest rates, with the benchmark 10-year Treasury rate falling. In addition, note that one-year and two-year rates are notably lower than the six-month rate, implying that the Federal Reserve target rate will be lower in one year than in six months.', ""While there's no guarantee the bond markets are right, history suggests higher interest rates, over an extended period, will result in lower inflation."", ""This stock will suit investors looking for solid returns and some income. UPS will benefit from the effect lower rates will have on the economy. That should result in increased volumes, or at least increased levels of the delivery volumes that management targets. In addition, there's likely to be a positive margin mix impact as customers stop shifting to lower-cost delivery options the way they have been doing in the rising rate environment."", ""While it's true that UPS enjoyed a couple of boom years during the pandemic (as lockdowns drove customers into buying online), and according to Wall Street analysts, it won't get back to 2022 levels of sales of $100.3 billion until 2025, there are a couple of favorable things to bear in mind."", 'First, analyst forecasts have UPS generating earnings of $9.71 a share in 2024 and free cash flow (FCF) of $7.1 billion, putting the stock at 16.7 times 2024 earnings and less than 19 times FCF in 2024. Those are reasonable multiples for a stock that will be in volume recovery mode in 2024.', 'Second, UPS is achieving good traction in its goal of growing revenue in targeted markets like small and medium-sized businesses and healthcare. As such, it will emerge from the slowdown with a better revenue quality than when it entered it. Throw in a 4% dividend yield, and UPS is a solid choice for investors in 2024.', 'Like UPS, Tesla will likely have a stronger underlying business coming out of a rising rate environment. Yes, Tesla is an automaker, meaning rate movements will impact its sales; consumers usually buy cars on credit, so monthly interest payments are a crucial part of the decision.', ""In contrast to the internal combustion engine (ICE) market of recent decades, the electric vehicle (EV) market is not a low-single-digit type growth market; it's high-growth and relatively early-stage. That distinction impacts the decisions CEO Elon Musk has made this year."", ""In response to rising rates, Tesla reduced prices to keep cars affordable and maintain market share while enabling volume growth.

I think the stock should have plenty of room to run in the new year."", ""It's possible that the Dow Jones could enjoy a strong bull market without Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) performing well.

With Buffett's long track record, investors would be wise to read about his techniques, which he generously shares in his annual letter to shareholders. In recent years, Buffett has highlighted the importance of retained earnings."", ""Let's delve into the retained earnings formula, explore why Buffett favors this metric, and highlight two stocks in Berkshire's portfolio that excel at it."", ""Retained earnings is a line item on the balance sheet demonstrating a company's accumulated profits over its lifetime. It is calculated by taking a company's net lifetime earnings and subtracting its dividends paid (and any net losses). Companies can use retained earnings to expand, make acquisitions, pay down debt, and repurchase their stock."", ""Buffett prefers to simplify the metric by focusing only on a company's annual earnings and dividends paid. That is because share repurchases can significantly distort the metric you see on the balance sheet. One of Buffett's favorite stocks, Apple, has surprisingly low lifetime retained earnings, at -$214 million. This is because of Apple's sheer number of share repurchases through the constructive retirement method, which assumes the shares will never be reissued, affecting retained earnings. Notably, Apple spent $77.5 billion on share repurchases in its fiscal year 2023 ended Sept. 30."", ""Beyond best-in-class Apple, two stocks in Berkshire's portfolio also excel in retained earnings: Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) and American Express (NYSE: AXP). In what is likely more than a mere coincidence, those two stocks are Berkshire's second- and third-largest holdings behind Apple, respectively."", 'First, Bank of America is the second-largest bank in the world by market capitalization, totaling about $265 billion. Over the trailing 12 months, Bank of America generated $30.5 billion in net income and paid roughly $9 billion in total dividends, resulting in retained earnings topping $21.5 billion during that time frame.', 'With its retained earnings, Bank of America has aggressively repurchased its stock -- retiring more than 18% of its shares outstanding over the past five years. Buffett recently wrote: ""The math isn\'t complicated: When the share count goes down, your interest in our many businesses goes up. Every small bit helps if repurchases are made at value-accretive prices.""', ""Nonetheless, despite Bank of America's share repurchases and a higher-than-average annual dividend yield of 2.9%, its stock has only generated a total return (price appreciation plus dividends) of 55% over the past five years, trailing the benchmark S&P 500's trailing return of 97%."", ""Bank stocks have underperformed recently either due to self-inflicted wounds like scandals around opening fake accounts or macroeconomic events largely out of a bank's control, like rising interest rates. Nonetheless, using the common valuation metric for bank stocks of price-to-book ratio, Bank of America currently trades at 1, meaning the market isn't placing a premium on its net assets like it does competitor JPMorgan Chase's price-to-book ratio of 1.6. Additionally, Bank of America's five-year price-to-book ratio average is 1.1, suggesting it might be slightly underpriced based on recent history."", ""Next, let's look at the global financial services company American Express, a company Berkshire Hathaway first purchased in 1991, and which generated $8 billion in net income over the trailing 12 months. With an annual dividend yield of 1.3%, the company paid $1.7 billion in dividends to its shareholders. As a result, American Express produced roughly $6.3 billion in retained earnings."", 'Like Bank of America, American Express is aggressively buying back its stock with retained earnings, lowering its shares outstanding by 14% over the past five years. During that time, American Express outpaced its larger competitors by market cap, Mastercard and Visa, in stock buybacks (those companies repurchased 9% and 8%, respectively).', 'In addition to its share repurchases, American Express has acquired five fintech companies since 2019 -- all private companies for undisclosed prices. The strategy has proven helpful in fueling revenue growth as the company most recently set a sixth consecutive quarterly record, generating $15.4 billion for the third quarter of\xa02023.', 'Finally, American Express stock appears attractive when assessed against its competitors through the widely used valuation metric price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. With a P/E multiple of about 17, American Express stands out as notably undervalued compared to Mastercard and Visa with P/E ratios of 36 and 31, respectively.', 'In 2020, Buffett wrote: ""Retained earnings have propelled American business throughout our country\'s history. What worked for Carnegie and Rockefeller has, over the years, worked its magic for millions of shareholders as well.""', ""These two stocks, plus Apple, make up roughly 65% of Berkshire's $370 billion stock portfolio, meaning they are likely some of Buffett's favorite stocks. Given Berkshire's past success, investors would be smart to follow the Oracle of Omaha's strategy and consider adding Bank of America and American Express to their portfolios."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Bank of America right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Bank of America, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Bank of America wasn't one of them.

This will further propel demand for products sold by companies like MLM. In the near term, it expects affordability-driven headwinds in the single-family residential end market. This will be offset by a significant acceleration in public infrastructure investment and continued strength in large-scale energy, domestic manufacturing and multi-family residential projects.As of Sep 30, 2023, highway, bridge and tunnel contract awards increased 18.2% to a record of $114 billion compared with $97 billion as of September 2022 end.

As you know, Jason, listen, 2023, not easy if you were long consumer staples. As an analyst, Jason, what are the core financial metrics you're watching to gauge, you know, how this sector is going to perform now as we head into 2024?"", ""JASON ENGLISH: Well, Josh, some of the last year's underperformance has to do with two sessions ago, where you talked about the fear versus greed index. Needless to say, consumer staples rest heavily on the fear side. So when the market's in agreed on moment as we are right now or mood, clearly my sector is left out behind."", ""Now from a fundamental perspective, next year is very much about the chase for top line growth. We've had very robust sales growth the last couple of years fueled by pricing. The inflation backdrop required a lot of price growth for these companies. They achieved that they gave leverage throughout the P&L, particularly as some of the input costs have begun to subside, but now focuses on volume, because next year, we're not going to have the type of inflation supporting topline growth. And of late, volume growth just hasn't been there."", ""In fact, volumes have been declining in the US for these large processed packaged food companies. If they can't get it back to growth, then the top lines are going to stall out. And these P&L's just won't work. They won't deliver the type of bottom line growth that investors and management teams are expecting."", ""JULIE HYMAN: Yeah. And we've definitely started to hear some food companies, whether it's consumer staples or on the restaurant side, talk about deflation as well that we are now seeing-- going to see creep into some of these goods. Are there any companies that are going to be able to have pricing power going into 2024? And if there are, what distinguishes them from their competitors?"", ""JASON ENGLISH: Yeah. It's a good question, Julie. And this is good news for consumers. Obviously, the cost to buy a groceries has been going nothing but higher the last few years. As we look into next year, in some pockets, we would actually expect a degree of deflation. Some of those are pass through categories like meat or flour. But even in more branded-centric companies, like canned goods, soup, for example, we're seeing deflation as promotions come back to the market."", ""So these companies need to get volume going, look for them to spend into more promotions. Good news for the consumer, not necessarily good news for many of the companies, because that deflation is really expensive and damaging to the P&L. So the question you asked is spot on, who are the companies who can have continued pricing power, resilient price growth, even if modest? There, we look to companies with emerging market exposure, where we're expecting the rate of inflation in those markets to sustain."", ""Companies that fit that bill would be Procter & Gamble, Colgate, Coke, Mondelez is some examples. And then we're also favoring snack food companies, where there's a degree of conspicuous consumption that gives brands more power with more brand-centric, also comes more pricing power. And I like snack foods in particular, because the market's really thrown them out with the bathwater this year, because the volume has been weak for the industry at large.

Wendy Carruthers, the Executive Vice President of Human Resources at Boston Scientific, sold 11,672 shares of the company's stock on December 15, 2023. This transaction has caught the attention of investors and market analysts, prompting a closer look at the implications of such insider activity.Who is Wendy Carruthers of Boston Scientific Corp?Wendy Carruthers has been serving as the Executive Vice President of Human Resources at Boston Scientific since joining the company. With a wealth of experience in managing human capital and developing strategies to foster a productive workforce, Carruthers plays a crucial role in shaping the company's culture and driving its success. Her insider position provides her with a unique perspective on the company's operations and future prospects.Boston Scientific Corp's Business DescriptionBoston Scientific is a global medical technology leader with a focus on transforming lives through innovative medical solutions that improve the health of patients around the world. The company operates in various segments, including Cardiovascular, Rhythm and Neuro, MedSurg, and more. Boston Scientific's products and technologies are used to diagnose or treat a wide range of medical conditions, including heart, digestive, pulmonary, vascular, urological, women's health, and chronic pain conditions.Analysis of Insider Buy/Sell and the Relationship with the Stock PriceThe recent sale by Wendy Carruthers is part of a broader trend of insider selling at Boston Scientific. Over the past year, Carruthers has sold a total of 116,711 shares and has not made any purchases. This pattern of selling without corresponding buys could signal that insiders, including Carruthers, may believe the stock is fully valued or potentially overvalued at current levels."", ""The insider transaction history for Boston Scientific shows a total of 34 insider sells over the past year, with no insider buys during the same timeframe. This trend of insider selling could be interpreted as a lack of confidence in the stock's future appreciation or simply a desire to realize gains or diversify personal portfolios.Valuation and Market ReactionOn the day of the insider's recent sell, shares of Boston Scientific were trading at $55.61, giving the company a market cap of $81.321 billion. The price-earnings ratio of 67.70 is higher than the industry median of 30.1, suggesting that the stock may be trading at a premium compared to its peers. However, it is lower than the company's historical median price-earnings ratio, indicating that the stock may be more reasonably priced relative to its own trading history.With a price of $55.61 and a GuruFocus Value of $51.49, Boston Scientific Corp has a price-to-GF-Value ratio of 1.08. This suggests that the stock is Fairly Valued based on its GF Value."", ""The GF Value is an intrinsic value estimate that takes into account historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on past returns and growth, and future business performance estimates from Morningstar analysts. The current price-to-GF-Value ratio indicates that the stock is trading close to its intrinsic value, which may explain why insiders like Wendy Carruthers are choosing to sell their shares.ConclusionThe insider selling activity at Boston Scientific, particularly by EVP Wendy Carruthers, raises questions about the stock's valuation and future performance. While the company remains a leader in the medical technology industry, the consistent pattern of insider selling could be a signal for investors to proceed with caution. As always, it is important for investors to conduct their own research and consider the broader market context when making investment decisions."", 'Warning!

But I think one of the bigger surprises this year is that we did not see more action in the commodities."", 'There was all kinds of expectation with China, the reopening at the beginning of the year and the demand that that was supposed to cause. Well, that did not really occur. And we can see the S&P GSCI index, that is pretty much toward the lows of the year there.', ""And what I think is interesting if we take a five-year view, we can see this spike here.

You could aim for stocks that offer high yields up front or look for smaller yields from companies that can grow their payouts.', 'The first option rarely works out over time, because dividend-paying stocks rarely offer high yields until investors are worried about the underlying business and its ability to sustain its commitment.', ""The stocks on this list don't offer the highest yields, but they are far above average. Plus, they have long histories of consecutive annual dividend increases."", 'With strong advantages to keep the competition from eating into their profit margins, these stocks could keep paying and raising their dividend payouts for as long as you care to hold them.', ""Cigarette sales have been declining for decades, but the value of Altria Group's (NYSE: MO) Marlboro brand in the U.S. keeps rising. Strict regulations that make it impossible to build new brands make it easy for tobacco giants to raise prices that offset declining volumes."", ""By Altria's estimates, cigarette volumes in the U.S. declined by 8% during the first nine months of 2023. With price increases and rising sales of non-combustible products, though, total revenue fell just 1.4% year over year. By lowering its outstanding share count through buybacks, adjusted earnings per share were able to rise by 3.3% over the same time frame."", ""Altria isn't relying entirely on the Marlboro brand's pricing power for growth. Earlier this year, the company grew its smoke-free portfolio with the acquisition of NJOY, which markets the only pod-based e-vapor product with marketing authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration."", ""At recent prices, Altria offers a 9.4% dividend yield that is rising steadily. This summer, the company raised its dividend payout for the 58th time in 54 years.

One of the most impactful has been time. The billionaire credits the many decades he\'s had as an investor for being a key factor supporting his success. ""It helps to start early and live into your 90s,"" he said in this year\'s letter to Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) shareholders.', ""For the last 30 of those years, Buffett has made Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) an important part of Berkshire's portfolio. He accumulated 400 million shares of the beverage titan by 1994 and now counts over $700 million in annual dividend payments from that single investment. It's true that Coke isn't as cheap as it was back in the '90s, but it is still priced at a great value today. Here's why."", ""Wall Street has avoided Coca-Cola's shares this year, either because investors were more focused on high-growth tech stocks or because they were worried that the company's best days are behind it. Yet this is an impressive growth stock, too."", 'Sure, the company is facing demand pressures as some consumers move away from traditional soda drinks. But Coke has complimented its huge portfolio of core soda brands with offerings in popular growth niches like sparkling waters, teas, and energy drinks.', ""This strategy is helping deliver solid revenue gains. Organic sales were up a healthy 11% last quarter, in fact. Coke is achieving this growth through a mix of rising prices and increased volumes. That's a great sign for investors who simply want to patiently hold the stock as Coke improves on its already impressive market share in the global beverage industry."", ""Coke is among the most impressive businesses on the planet when it comes to financial strength. Start with profit margin, which last quarter held steady at a blazing 30% of sales. That's roughly double the rate that PepsiCo (NASDAQ: PEP) generates across its portfolio of beverage and snack food brands."", 'Coke produces a flood of free cash flow, too, thanks to assets like its massive global reach and highly efficient infrastructure. This cash allows Coke to invest aggressively in areas like marketing while still delivering direct cash returns through stock buybacks and dividend payments.', ""That dividend has risen for more than 60 consecutive years, which is a testament to Coke's enduring competitive strength. The next annual increase should be ample given that management is expecting to finish 2023 with an increase in earnings per share of as much as 14%."", 'But the best news is that Coke stock looks cheap. Its shares have fallen this year through mid-December even as the broader market has rallied. You can now own Coke for less than 6 times annual sales, down from about 6.5 times sales at the start of the year.', 'That discount makes no sense given that Coca-Cola is gaining market share and improving on its already stellar profit margin. And a rising dividend should support even better returns for shareholders who choose to reinvest those increasing payments. Coke might not be in your portfolio for several decades like it has been for Warren Buffett.

A business such as Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO), the furthest thing from a massive tech corporation, might be on your radar. Is this top beverage stock a smart buy before the end of 2023? ', ""Here's what investors should be thinking about now."", ""Everyone has heard about Coca-Cola, whether it's because of the namesake soft drink or its other popular beverages like Vitamin Water and Dasani. This business has one of the strongest brands in the world. And because it has been around for such a long time, Coca-Cola has tremendous stability and staying power."", ""Investors should realize that this is a quality enterprise. That brand recognition creates a wide economic moat that protects Coca-Cola from rivals in the industry. This competitive standing isn't going to change, at least not for many decades."", ""This business has proven that it can perform well even in uncertain economic times. In the third quarter, Coca-Cola was able to increase revenue by 11%, a favorable outcome made possible by the company's proven pricing power. Customers are loyal, and they won't easily switch to a PepsiCo product even if it's slightly cheaper."", ""There are no concerns about this business ever running into financial woes. That's because Coca-Cola is incredibly profitable. In the third quarter, its operating margin was a superb 27.4%. And the business generated $7.9 billion of free cash flow through the first nine months of 2023."", 'That cash goes toward repurchasing the stock, which increased the equity ownership of existing shareholders. But the majority of the cash, $4.1 billion total in the last three quarters, was used to pay dividends. The current yield is more than 3.1%. ', ""Even Warren Buffett agrees that this is a wonderful business. The conglomerate he runs, Berkshire Hathaway, owns 9.3% of the outstanding stock worth $23 billion at today's prices. Coca-Cola is the fourth largest position in the portfolio, and it generates roughly $736 million in passive annualized income for Berkshire, so Buffett probably has no intention to sell anytime soon."", ""For all of its favorable characteristics, you would think that Coca-Cola would be crushing the market. But this just isn't the case. To be fair, in the 1980s and 1990s this was a fantastic stock that beat the S&P 500 in each of those two decades. "", ""The business hasn't been too kind to shareholders in more recent times, though. Let's look at the past decade. Since Dec. 2013, Coca-Cola has produced a total return (including dividends) of 107%. The S&P 500, on the other hand, would've more than tripled your money. It's the same story in the last one-, three-, and five-year periods as well."", ""The takeaway is that investors would simply be better off owning an index fund tracking the broader market than adding this dominant beverage business to their portfolios. That's because there isn't any reason to believe that the stock can beat the market over the long term due to limited growth prospects and how mature it is. "", ""Of course, if the current price-to-earnings ratio of 23.7 dropped significantly to a much lower valuation, then perhaps shares would look more attractive as a deep-value play. But in my opinion, this is a stock that's probably best avoided right now for investors seeking higher returns."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Coca-Cola right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Coca-Cola, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Coca-Cola wasn't one of them.

Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years."", ""A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:"", '2024', '2025', '2026', '2027', '2028', '2029', '2030', '2031', '2032', '2033', ' Levered FCF ($, Millions) ', 'US$4.94b', 'US$6.11b', 'US$7.09b', 'US$8.31b', 'US$9.77b', 'US$10.8b', 'US$11.7b', 'US$12.5b', 'US$13.2b', 'US$13.7b', 'Growth Rate Estimate Source', 'Analyst x9', 'Analyst x10', 'Analyst x5', 'Analyst x1', 'Analyst x1', 'Est @ 11.00%', 'Est @ 8.36%', 'Est @ 6.52%', 'Est @ 5.23%', 'Est @ 4.33%', ' Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.3% ', 'US$4.6k', 'US$5.3k', 'US$5.7k', 'US$6.3k', 'US$6.9k', 'US$7.1k', 'US$7.2k', 'US$7.1k', 'US$7.0k', 'US$6.8k', '(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$64b', ""After calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage.

In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth.

Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Intuit as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.012. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole.

The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued.

As long-term owners of our properties, we look forward to further investing in portfolio growth and demonstrating why we are a company-of-choice for this retail environment.”Regency is focused on building a premium portfolio of grocery-anchored shopping centers.

As you know, Jason, listen, 2023, not easy if you were long consumer staples. As an analyst, Jason, what are the core financial metrics you're watching to gauge, you know, how this sector is going to perform now as we head into 2024?"", ""JASON ENGLISH: Well, Josh, some of the last year's underperformance has to do with two sessions ago, where you talked about the fear versus greed index. Needless to say, consumer staples rest heavily on the fear side. So when the market's in agreed on moment as we are right now or mood, clearly my sector is left out behind."", ""Now from a fundamental perspective, next year is very much about the chase for top line growth. We've had very robust sales growth the last couple of years fueled by pricing. The inflation backdrop required a lot of price growth for these companies. They achieved that they gave leverage throughout the P&L, particularly as some of the input costs have begun to subside, but now focuses on volume, because next year, we're not going to have the type of inflation supporting topline growth. And of late, volume growth just hasn't been there."", ""In fact, volumes have been declining in the US for these large processed packaged food companies. If they can't get it back to growth, then the top lines are going to stall out. And these P&L's just won't work. They won't deliver the type of bottom line growth that investors and management teams are expecting."", ""JULIE HYMAN: Yeah. And we've definitely started to hear some food companies, whether it's consumer staples or on the restaurant side, talk about deflation as well that we are now seeing-- going to see creep into some of these goods. Are there any companies that are going to be able to have pricing power going into 2024? And if there are, what distinguishes them from their competitors?"", ""JASON ENGLISH: Yeah. It's a good question, Julie. And this is good news for consumers. Obviously, the cost to buy a groceries has been going nothing but higher the last few years. As we look into next year, in some pockets, we would actually expect a degree of deflation. Some of those are pass through categories like meat or flour. But even in more branded-centric companies, like canned goods, soup, for example, we're seeing deflation as promotions come back to the market."", ""So these companies need to get volume going, look for them to spend into more promotions. Good news for the consumer, not necessarily good news for many of the companies, because that deflation is really expensive and damaging to the P&L. So the question you asked is spot on, who are the companies who can have continued pricing power, resilient price growth, even if modest? There, we look to companies with emerging market exposure, where we're expecting the rate of inflation in those markets to sustain."", ""Companies that fit that bill would be Procter & Gamble, Colgate, Coke, Mondelez is some examples. And then we're also favoring snack food companies, where there's a degree of conspicuous consumption that gives brands more power with more brand-centric, also comes more pricing power. And I like snack foods in particular, because the market's really thrown them out with the bathwater this year, because the volume has been weak for the industry at large. And many are arguing that GLP-1s are going to destroy volume. It's caused many of these snack food companies to derail. I think that fear is overdone.

Every day of closure increases the impact to the supply chain for critical commodities, including automobiles, industrial products and grain.”', 'The Association of American Railroads (AAR) called for an immediate reopening of both rail crossings.', '“The urgency of reopening these crossings and restoring rail service between the two nations cannot be overstated,” AAR President and CEO Ian Jefferies said in a news release. “There are not separate U.S. and Mexican rail networks; there is only one interconnected North American rail network. Every day the border remains closed unleashes a cascade of delay across operations on both sides of the border, impacting customers and ultimately consumers.”', 'Union Pacific and BNSF operate 24 trains daily at the two crossings, moving agricultural products, automotive parts, finished vehicles, chemicals, consumer goods and more, according to Jefferies.', 'CBP has adjusted its operations to handle an influx of migrants attempting to use illegal pathways into the U.S.', 'In Eagle Pass, northbound passenger vehicle traffic remains suspended at Eagle Pass International Bridge 1, which has affected commercial cargo truck movements. In San Diego, San Ysidro’s Pedestrian West operations remain suspended. In Lukeville, Arizona, the Lukeville port of entry remains closed, CBP said.', '“Over the past several weeks, CBP has made a number of operational adjustments in order to maximize our ability to respond, process, and enforce consequences,” CBP said.', 'Along with the disruption from migrants, the Texas Department of Public Safety began safety inspections on Nov. 28 for all cargo trucks arriving from Mexico in Eagle Pass and Del Rio, Texas.', 'Cargo truck wait times at the Eagle Pass port of entry are currently over two hours.', 'More articles by Noi Mahoney', 'Mexico averaged 57 thefts a day from cargo trucks in Q3', 'The top US-Mexico business stories of 2023', 'Borderlands: Texas company aims to help keep returns out of landfills', 'The post CBP halts freight rail operations at 2 Texas ports of entry appeared first on FreightWaves.']"

While insider selling can be a red flag for potential investors, it is essential to consider the broader context, including the company's valuation, industry position, and financial performance. Cisco's lower price-earnings ratio compared to the industry and its modest undervaluation based on the GF Value suggest that the company may still be an attractive investment opportunity despite the insider selling trend. Investors should conduct their due diligence and consider all factors before making investment decisions."", ""As with any insider transaction, it's important to view these events as part of a larger investment mosaic. While insider sales can provide valuable clues, they should not be the sole basis for investment decisions. A comprehensive analysis of Cisco Systems Inc's financial health, market position, and growth prospects should be undertaken to fully understand the implications of insider activities like those of Richard Herren."", 'This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

I was there for the signing of a new partnership to support the university and its students, enabled by Student Freedom Initiative (SFI) and Cisco.', ""Participating in this event was meaningful to me for two reasons. First, because representation matters. I was representing my heritage-Pomo, Hawaiian, and Choctaw-as well as the broader Native/Indigenous community. Second-and no less important-because of the way Cisco's investment will benefit Native/Indigenous students."", 'Expanding to Support Tribal Colleges', ""In 2021, Cisco announced our partnership with SFI, a nonprofit that supports students attending minority-serving institutions. As part of this partnership, Cisco funded a $50 million endowment for juniors and seniors pursuing STEM education at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). The funding was part of $150 million commitment to HBCUs through Cisco's social justice initiative. Our inaugural work with HBCUs created a blueprint that is now expanding to other minority-serving institutions, and LCOOU is the first tribal college beneficiary."", '""Bridging the digital divide for Native/Indigenous communities is paramount for helping them achieve sovereignty for themselves and future generations.""', 'Supporting Students Beyond Financial Needs', 'LCOOU now has access to a loan program for juniors and seniors in STEM, but the partnership with LCOOU goes beyond dollars. It also includes technology modernization and access to the Cisco Networking Academy.', 'Cybersecurity Compliance', 'Part of the agreement includes ensuring LCOOU can meet important cybersecurity standards.', ""Cisco partner, Procellis, was engaged to conduct an assessment required by the National Institute of Standards and Technology. Colleges and universities must be in compliance with more than 100 security controls to continue receiving federal aid under Title IV. Cisco's donation of security products and services will help LCOOU achieve and maintain cybersecurity compliance."", 'For minority-serving institutions like LCOOU, protecting federal funding through technology compliance is critical.', 'Cisco Networking Academy', 'Cisco is also working with LCOOU to place a Networking Academy at the university. The university will be able to include Network Academy curriculum in its computer science program. As a result, students can graduate with a degree as well as industry-recognized certification.', 'Supporting Native/Indigenous Communities', ""I'm proud of the efforts that Cisco has made not just to listening to Indigenous voices, but also supporting and empowering us. Our work with LCOOU is one example, but there are so many more."", ""For example, I'm co-lead of our Native American Network (NAN), one of our employee resource organizations. Cisco is the first company I've worked at that has a Native American network. We're a small group-Native Americans make up less than 1% of Cisco's employee base. NAN gives us a vehicle to celebrate our culture and make contributions to the Native/Indigenous community. We are also able to build bridges between our company and Native communities, many of which do not trust big companies, and can benefit from technology."", ""I am proud of Cisco's purpose to power an inclusive future for all and commitment to ensuring minority-serving institutions like LCOOU have access to technology, services and infrastructure. Bridging the digital divide for Native/Indigenous communities is paramount for helping them achieve sovereignty for themselves and future generations."", 'View original content here.', 'View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Cisco Systems Inc. on 3blmedia.com.', 'Contact Info:Spokesperson: Cisco Systems Inc.Website: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/cisco-systems-incEmail: info@3blmedia.com', 'SOURCE: Cisco Systems Inc.', 'View the original press release on accesswire.com']"
