You should consider the Schwab Fundamental U.S. Small Company Index ETF (FNDA), a passively managed exchange traded fund launched on 08/13/2013.The fund is sponsored by Charles Schwab. It has amassed assets over $5.82 billion, making it one of the largest ETFs attempting to match the Small Cap Value segment of the US equity market.Why Small Cap ValueSitting at a market capitalization below $2 billion, small cap companies tend to be high-potential stocks compared to its large and mid cap counterparts, but come with higher risk.Value stocks are known for their lower than average price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios, but investors should also note their lower than average sales and earnings growth rates. Looking at their long-term performance, value stocks have outperformed growth stocks in almost all markets. They are however likely to underperform growth stocks in strong bull markets.CostsSince cheaper funds tend to produce better results than more expensive funds, assuming all other factors remain equal, it is important for investors to pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.25%, putting it on par with most peer products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.60%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsEven though ETFs offer diversified exposure which minimizes single stock risk, it is still important to look into a fund's holdings before investing. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Industrials sector--about 20.20% of the portfolio. Consumer Discretionary and Information Technology round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, First Solar Inc (FSLR) accounts for about 0.42% of total assets, followed by Geo Group Reit Inc (GEO) and Valmont Inds Inc (VMI).The top 10 holdings account for about 2.36% of total assets under management.Story continuesPerformance and RiskFNDA seeks to match the performance of the Russell RAFI US Small Co. Index before fees and expenses. The Russell RAFI US Small Company Index measures the performance of the small company size segment by fundamental overall company scores.The ETF has lost about -0.79% so far this year and is down about -11.37% in the last one year (as of 03/24/2023). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $42.52 and $54.89.The ETF has a beta of 1.20 and standard deviation of 27.32% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 976 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesSchwab Fundamental U.S. Small Company Index ETF holds a Zacks ETF Rank of 2 (Buy), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Because of this, FNDA is a great option for investors seeking exposure to the Style Box - Small Cap Value segment of the market. There are other additional ETFs in the space that investors could consider as well.The iShares Russell 2000 Value ETF (IWN) and the Vanguard Small-Cap Value ETF (VBR) track a similar index. While iShares Russell 2000 Value ETF has $10.79 billion in assets, Vanguard Small-Cap Value ETF has $22.96 billion. IWN has an expense ratio of 0.23% and VBR charges 0.07%.Bottom-LineWhile an excellent vehicle for long term investors, passively managed ETFs are a popular choice among institutional and retail investors due to their low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency.To learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The company, he added, would not have to ""sell a single security.""Bettinger told the paper that any potential funding gaps could be filled through the collection of interest payments on bonds it owns, borrowing from the Federal Home Loan Bank, or by issuing certificates of deposit.The comments come after Bettinger said last week that the business is still seeing significant levels of asset inflows. He also revealed that he bought 50,000 shares in Charles Schwab for his personal account - a purchase worth about $3 million at the time.Shares in the tenth-largest U.S. bank have shed around a fourth of their value since Silicon Valley Bank collapsed on March 8, sending shockwaves through the global banking system and leading investors to seek out other lenders who are seeing heavy withdrawals and paper losses on bond holdings.Like SVB, Schwab invested in long-term bonds which have seen a sizeable chunk of their value fall as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates from near-zero in a bid to curb inflation. However, Bettinger told the WSJ that steps were taken to prepare for this situation, adding that it has around $100 billion from cash on hand, interest payments on bonds it holds, and expected net new assets.Related ArticlesCharles Schwab CEO says firm could operate in case of deposit flight - WSJCitigroup CEO declares 'this is not a credit crisis' after U.S. bank failuresBlackRock to keep questioning boards on 'material' climate risks]"

Projected FFO per share growth rates for the first quarter and 2023 are 14.7% and 7.9%, respectively.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMAA’s well-diversified Sunbelt-focused portfolio is set to gain from healthy operating fundamentals. The pandemic has accelerated employment shifts and a population inflow into the company’s markets as renters seek more business-friendly, lower-taxed and low-density cities. These favorable longer-term secular dynamic trends are increasing the desirability of its markets.This Sunbelt-focused apartment REIT opts for opportunistic investments to maintain the right product mix and raise the number of apartment communities in dynamic markets. MAA projects development investments of $250 to $350 million and acquisitions of $350 to $450 million for 2023. Such efforts are likely to improve portfolio quality and propel the company’s growth over the long term.MAA continues to implement its three internal investment programs — interior redevelopment, property repositioning projects and Smart Home installations. The programs will help the company capture the upside potential in rent growth, generate accretive returns and boost earnings from its existing asset base.In 2022, the company completed 6,574 interior unit upgrades and installed 24,029 Smart Home packages. As of Dec 31, 2022, the total number of smart units is more than 71,000, and management expects to finish the rest of the portfolio in 2023.Along with the healthy operating fundamentals of Sunbelt markets and a robust development pipeline, the prospects of MAA’s redevelopment program and progress in technology measures are likely to drive margin expansion.MAA enjoys a solid balance sheet, with low leverage and ample availability under its revolving credit facility. As of Dec 31, 2022, MAA had a strong balance sheet with $1.3 billion in combined cash and capacity available under its unsecured revolving credit facility. It generated 95.2% unencumbered NOI in the fourth quarter of 2022, providing the scope for tapping additional secured debt capital if required.Solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticements for REIT shareholders, and MAA remains committed to that. In the last five years, MAA has increased its dividend six times, and its five-year annualized dividend growth rate is 5.45%. Check Mid-America Apartment’s dividend history here.However, with a robust development environment and continued supply-chain issues, personnel and repair and maintenance and material costs are expected to climb up. Moreover, real estate taxes and insurance costs are expected to produce significant cost pressure.  A hike in the interest rate is a concern for MAA. Rising rates imply a higher borrowing cost for the company, which will affect its ability to purchase or develop real estate. Moreover, the dividend payout might also become less attractive than yields on fixed income and money market accounts.MAA currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

7,cbfb817b-9ef5-39c4-bd1c-9f31202c4116,UNM,2023-03-24,5 Low Price-to-Book Stocks to Add to Your Portfolio,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-low-price-book-stocks-113611850.html,1679657771,STORY,"['GM', 'DBK.DE', 'UNM', 'PK']","[When evaluating a company’s value, investors mostly look at a stock’s Price-to-earnings (P/E) or Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio. While P/E is the ratio of annual earnings to stock price, P/S reflects the amount investors pay for each dollar of revenues generated by the company.Though P/E and P/S valuation tools are more commonly used for stock selection, the price-to-book ratio (P/B ratio) is also an easy-to-use metric for identifying low-priced stocks with high-growth prospects.P/B is the ratio of stock price to book value.It is calculated as below:P/B ratio = market capitalization/book value of equityThe P/B ratio helps to identify low-priced stocks that have high growth prospects. Deutsche Bank DB, General Motors GM, Unum Group UNM, Park Hotels &amp; Resorts PK and Sterling Infrastructure STRL are some such stocks.Now let us understand the concept of book value.What’s Book Value?Book value is the total value that would be left over, according to the company’s balance sheet, if it goes bankrupt immediately. In other words, this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off all its liabilities.It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company. In most cases, this equates to the common stockholders’ equity on the balance sheet. However, depending on the company’s balance sheet, intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine book value.Understanding P/B RatioBy comparing the book value of equity to its market price, we get an idea of whether a company is under-or overpriced. However, like P/E or P/S ratio, it is always better to compare P/B ratios within industries.A P/B ratio of less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value, or the stock is undervalued and, therefore a good buy. Conversely, a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive.Story continuesFor example, a stock with a P/B ratio of 2 means that we pay $2 for every $1 of book value. Thus, the higher the P/B, the more expensive the stock.But there is a caveat. A P/B ratio of less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets or that the assets are overstated, in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value. Conversely, the stock’s price may be significantly high — thereby pushing the P/B ratio to more than one — in the likely case that it has become a takeover target, a good enough reason to own the stock.Moreover, the P/B ratio isn't without limitations. It is useful for businesses — like finance, investments, insurance, and banking or manufacturing companies — with many liquid/tangible assets on the books. However, it can be misleading for firms with significant R&amp;D expenditure, high debt, service companies, or those with negative earnings.In any case, the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number. One should analyze other ratios like P/E, P/S and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision.Screening ParametersPrice to Book (common Equity) less than X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.Price to Sales less than X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how much the market values every dollar of the company’s sales/revenues — a lower ratio than the industry makes the stock attractive.Price to Earnings using F(1) estimate less than X-Industry Median: The P/E ratio (F1) values a company based on its current share price relative to its estimated earnings per share — a lower ratio than the industry is considered better.PEG less than 1: PEG links the P/E ratio to the future growth rate of the company. The PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and investors need to pay less for a stock that has bright earnings growth prospects.Current Price greater than or equal to $5: They must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Average 20-Day Volume greater than or equal to 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to #2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Score equal to A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best opportunities in the value investing space.Here are our five picks out of the 10 stocks that qualified the screening:Headquartered in Frankfurt am Main, Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft, also called Deutsche Bank AG, is the largest bank in Germany and one of the largest financial institutions in Europe and the world, as measured by total assets.Deutsche Bank has a Zacks Rank #1 and a Value Score of B.

8,483798f4-721f-3395-b0be-50579cb4c436,UNM,2023-03-24,Why Unum (UNM) is a Great Dividend Stock Right Now,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-unum-unm-great-dividend-154503136.html,1679586303,STORY,['UNM'],"[All investors love getting big returns from their portfolio, whether it's through stocks, bonds, ETFs, or other types of securities. But when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns.Unum in FocusHeadquartered in Chattanooga, Unum (UNM) is a Finance stock that has seen a price change of -7.36% so far this year. Currently paying a dividend of $0.33 per share, the company has a dividend yield of 3.47%. In comparison, the Insurance - Accident and Health industry's yield is 2.54%, while the S&amp;P 500's yield is 1.8%.Taking a look at the company's dividend growth, its current annualized dividend of $1.32 is up 4.8% from last year. Unum has increased its dividend 4 times on a year-over-year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 6.16%. Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Right now, Unum's payout ratio is 21%, which means it paid out 21% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Earnings growth looks solid for UNM for this fiscal year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $6.66 per share, which represents a year-over-year growth rate of 7.25%.Bottom LineInvestors like dividends for a variety of different reasons, from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits. It's important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout.Story continuesHigh-growth firms or tech start-ups, for example, rarely provide their shareholders a dividend, while larger, more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options. Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. That said, they can take comfort from the fact that UNM is not only an attractive dividend play, but also represents a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The consensus mark for quarterly revenues is pegged at $2.3 billion, indicating a decline of 3.9% from the prior-year reported number.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fiscal fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.64 per share, suggesting a decline of 42.3% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. The consensus mark for earnings has moved up by a penny in the past 60 days.For fiscal 2022, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $8.9 billion, suggesting a 3.1% decline from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 earnings indicates an 18.5% year-over-year decline to $8.27.In the last reported quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 22.1%. Its bottom line surpassed estimates by 22.9%, on average, over the trailing four quarters.PVH Corp. Price and EPS Surprise  PVH Corp. price-eps-surprise | PVH Corp. QuoteFactors to NotePVH Corp has been reeling under uncertainties related to macroeconomic challenges, particularly in Europe, continued COVID impacts in Asia, and the impacts of the Russia-Ukraine war. Also, higher costs and increased promotions are likely to have dented the fiscal fourth-quarter performance.Management anticipates fiscal 2022 revenues to be at the higher end of the previously stated year-over-year decrease of 3-4% (up 3-4% on a cc basis), in sync with our estimate of a sales decline of 4%. This is inclusive of a 2% reduction each for the exit of the Heritage Brands Retail business and the war in Ukraine. The bottom line is expected to be $8.25 for the year, down from last year’s reported figure of $10.15 but in line with our estimate. Interest expenses are likely to be $85 million, suggesting a decline from the prior year’s reported figure of $104 million.For fourth-quarter fiscal 2022, management expects a 4% year-over-year revenue decline, whereas we estimate sales to decrease 5.1%. This is inclusive of a 2% decline from the war in Ukraine. The bottom line is likely to be 45 cents on a GAAP basis and $1.65 on an adjusted basis. We estimate the bottom line to be 49 cents and $1.63 on a GAAP and Non-GAAP basis.Notably, the company reported $3.89 and $2.67 on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, respectively, in the year-ago quarter. This includes unfavorable currency impacts of 27 cents, as well as 15 cents of adverse impacts of the Ukraine war. Interest expenses for the fiscal fourth quarter are likely to have been flat year over year.However, the company has been gaining from the continued momentum in its core brands, Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, along with pricing actions. The company's Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein brands are anticipated to have performed well in the quarter under review, driven by robust consumer demand.Also, the continued momentum in PVH Corp's international unit is likely to have aided the company’s performance in the fiscal fourth quarter.Story continuesZacks ModelOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for PVH Corp this season.

Most notably, we completed enrollment at the start of 2023 in our TREK-AD Phase 2b trial, testing eblasakimab as a novel treatment for moderate-to-severe AD, and we look forward to reporting topline data from this study in early July 2023. In addition, we formed a collaboration with Thermo Fisher Scientific to manufacture a high concentration formulation of eblasakimab that will allow us to administer 400mg in a single subcutaneous injection with a range of different devices.”Dr Firth continued, “We recently announced strong support from BVF Partners and additional investors on a $20 million financing, allowing us to advance farudodstat into a Phase 2, proof-of-concept study in alopecia areata (AA) in the second quarter of 2023. This is a common autoimmune disease that is associated with a severe psychological burden yet there are few effective treatments that are safe for long-term use. Farudodstat potently inhibits key drivers of AA disease pathophysiology and has the potential to be a novel, first-in-class treatment.”Story continuesFourth quarter 2022 and recent business highlights Q4 and recent clinical developments In March 2023, two abstracts showcasing new data on eblasakimab were accepted for poster presentation at the First International Societies for Investigative Dermatology (ISID) Meeting, taking place from May 10 to 13, 2023, in Tokyo, Japan. Posters being presented at the meeting will explore eblasakimab’s efficacy in difficult to treat areas in patients with AD, such as the head and neck, and its potential for alleviating the underlying itch and hypersensitized sensory nerve fibers through multiple molecular pathways in AD.In February 2023, ASLAN announced the advancement of its clinical program to investigate farudodstat, a highly selective, oral dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) inhibitor, in a Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial as a potential first-in-class treatment for AA. Farudodstat is 30-fold more potent than approved drugs in its class and has demonstrated a well-tolerated safety profile. The trial will recruit about 60 patients in the US and enrollment is expected to begin in the second quarter of 2023. The interim topline readout following the first 12-week treatment period is expected in the first quarter of 2024 and will inform the design of the subsequent Phase 2b dose-ranging study.In February 2023, the final patient was enrolled in the TREK-AD (TRials with EblasaKimab in Atopic Dermatitis) study, a Phase 2b, dose-ranging, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of eblasakimab in adults with moderate-to-severe AD. ASLAN expects to report topline data from this study in early July 2023. The study is evaluating the efficacy and safety of eblasakimab in biologic naïve AD patients over a 16-week treatment period.In January 2023, ASLAN and Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc (NYSE: TMO) announced a partnership to manufacture a high concentration formulation of eblasakimab for Phase 3 clinical trials. ASLAN has developed a high concentration formulation of eblasakimab, allowing up to 400mg eblasakimab to be administered in a single subcutaneous injection and suitable for use with different devices.In December 2022, the first patient was screened in the TREK-DX study of eblasakimab in adult patients with moderate-to-severe AD who have previously been treated with dupilumab. The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 2 clinical trial is expected to enroll 75 patients in North America and will assess the efficacy and safety of eblasakimab in dupilumab experienced patients who have discontinued their treatment for any reason, including inadequate disease control, loss of access to drug or an adverse event.Corporate updates In March 2023, ASLAN’s management team hosted a virtual farudodstat Research and Development Day with Key Opinion Leader (KOL) Brett King, MD PhD, Associate Professor of Dermatology, Yale University School of Medicine, to discuss the unmet medical need and current treatment landscape in AA. A replay of the event and presentation materials are available on the Investor Relations section of ASLAN’s website.In February 2023, ASLAN announced that it entered into a definitive purchase agreement (“Purchase Agreement”) to raise gross proceeds of approximately $20 million resulting from the sale of its ordinary shares (or pre-funded warrants) and accompanying purchase warrants, at a purchase price of $0.178 per ordinary share (or the equivalent of $4.45 per American Depositary Share (“ADS”) after giving effect to the ADS Ratio Change described below to BVF Partners LP, K2 HealthVentures and certain existing investors. In addition, ASLAN has the potential to receive up to an additional $80 million in proceeds if all purchase warrants issued in connection with the Purchase Agreement are fully exercised.Anticipated upcoming milestones New clinical and translational data on eblasakimab will be presented at the ISID Meeting in Tokyo, Japan. Posters will be available to view at the meeting on May 10, 2023, and will be uploaded to ASLAN’s website at this link following presentation.The first patient is expected to be enrolled in the farudodstat proof-of-concept Phase 2a study in AA in the second quarter of 2023.Topline data from the Phase 2b TREK-AD trial of eblasakimab is expected in early July 2023.Topline data from the TREK-DX trial of eblasakimab is expected in the first quarter of 2024.Topline interim data from the farudodstat Phase 2a study in AA is expected in the first quarter of 2024.Fourth quarter 2022 financial highlights Cash used in operations for the fourth quarter of 2022 was $12.0 million compared to $11.9 million in the same period in 2021.Research and development expenses were $10.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to $9.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. The increase was primarily driven by higher clinical development and manufacturing costs for eblasakimab.General and administrative expenses were $2.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to $2.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2021.Net loss attributable to stockholders for the fourth quarter of 2022 was $14.5 million compared to a net loss of $9.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2021, which included a gain of $2.3 million resulting from the dilution of JAGUAHR Therapeutics in December 2021 and recognition of its associates. The increase was primarily driven by higher clinical development and manufacturing costs for eblasakimab.The weighted average number of ADSs outstanding in the computation of basic loss per share for the fourth quarter of 2022 was 13.95 million (representing 348.7 million ordinary shares) compared to 13.92 million (representing 348.0 million ordinary shares) for the fourth quarter of 2021. After the ADS Ratio Change described below was effected, one ADS is the equivalent of twenty-five ordinary shares.Full-year 2022 financial highlights Cash used in operations for the year ended December 31, 2022, was $38.4 million compared to $34.0 million in 2021.Research and development expenses were $38.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to $22.0 million in 2021. The increase was driven primarily by the increase in clinical development and manufacturing costs for eblasakimab.General and administrative expenses were $9.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to $11.8 million in 2021. The decrease in general and administrative expenses was mainly due to lower fundraising costs compared to 2021.Net loss attributable to stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2022, was $51.4 million compared to a loss of $31.3 million in 2021. The increase was primarily due to the increase of clinical development and manufacturing costs for eblasakimab.Cash and cash equivalents total $56.9 million as of December 31, 2022, compared to $90.2 million as of December 31, 2021. On February 28, 2023, ASLAN received gross proceeds of $20.0 million upon the closing of the Purchase Agreement with BVF and other investors. Management believes that the Company’s cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund operations through at least the second quarter of 2024.The weighted average number of ADSs outstanding in the computation of basic loss per share for the year ended December 31, 2022, was 13.9 million (representing 348.7 million ordinary shares) compared to 13.0 million (representing 325.7 million ordinary shares) for the year ended 2021.At the opening of trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market on March 13, 2023, the Company effected a change in the ratio of its ADSs to its ordinary shares from one (1) ADS representing five (5) ordinary shares to one (1) ADS representing twenty-five (25) ordinary shares (the “ADS Ratio Change”). For the Company’s existing ADS holders, the ADS Ratio Change had the same effect as a one-for-five reverse ADS split.ASLAN Pharmaceuticals LimitedCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS (In US Dollars, other than shares or share data) December 31, 2021(audited)  December 31, 2022(audited) ASSETS           CURRENT ASSETS     Cash and cash equivalents$90,167,967  $56,902,077 Total cash and cash equivalents 90,167,967   56,902,077 Other assets 3,612,846   3,976,350 Total current assets$93,780,813  $60,878,427         NON-CURRENT ASSETS     Investment in associate company 494,728   8,587 Property, plant and equipment 34,979   43,140 Right-of-use assets 197,746   249,601 Intangible assets 9,956   5,836 Total non-current assets 737,409   307,164         TOTAL ASSETS$94,518,222  $61,185,591         LIABILITIES AND EQUITY           CURRENT LIABILITIES     Trade payables$3,116,786  $12,784,485 Other payables 2,817,909   2,325,038 Lease liabilities - current 199,124   215,671 Current borrowings —   7,748,831 Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss 223,352   90,213 Total current liabilities 6,357,171   23,164,238         NON-CURRENT LIABILITIES     Long-term borrowings 30,857,308   29,656,133 Total non-current liabilities 30,857,308   29,656,133         Total liabilities 37,214,479   52,820,371         EQUITY ATTRIBUTABLE TO STOCKHOLDERS OF THE COMPANY     Ordinary shares 63,019,962   63,019,962 Capital surplus 221,467,061   223,910,955 Accumulated deficits (227,004,332)  (278,386,749)Other reserves (178,948)  (178,948)        Total equity attributable to stockholders of the Company 57,303,743   8,365,220         Total equity 57,303,743   8,365,220         TOTAL LIABILITIES AND EQUITY$94,518,222  $61,185,591         ASLAN Pharmaceuticals LimitedCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE LOSS(In US Dollars, other than shares or share data) For the Three Months EndedDecember 31 (unaudited)  For the Twelve Months EndedDecember 31 (audited)  2021 2022 2021 2022 OPERATING EXPENSES          General and administrative expenses$(2,171,896) $(2,708,055) $(11,825,131) $(9,881,993)Research and development expenses (8,964,318)  (10,685,486)  (22,021,321)  (38,000,494)Total operating expenses (11,136,214)  (13,393,541)  (33,846,452)  (47,882,487)               LOSS FROM OPERATIONS (11,136,214)  (13,393,541)  (33,846,452)  (47,882,487)               NON-OPERATING INCOME AND EXPENSES          Interest income 42   224,018   219   354,457 Other income 772,113   162,711   1,108,072   386,138 Gain on dilution of subsidiary and recognition of associate 2,307,735   —   2,307,735   — Other gains and losses (143,731)  (571,079)  1,106,510   (29,583)Finance costs (747,902)  (778,257)  (1,860,954)  (3,675,689)Total non-operating income andexpenses2,188,257   (962,607) 2,661,582   (2,964,677)Share in losses of associated company, accounted for using equity method (190,309)  (45,516)  (405,712)  (436,032)LOSS BEFORE INCOME TAX (9,138,266)  (14,401,664)  (31,590,582)  (51,283,196)INCOME TAX EXPENSE —   (79,379)  —   (99,221)NET LOSS FOR THE PERIOD (9,138,266)  (14,481,043)  (31,590,582)  (51,382,417)OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS          Unrealized loss on investments —   —   —   — TOTAL COMPREHENSIVE LOSS FOR THE PERIOD(9,138,266) $(14,481,043) $(31,590,582) $(51,382,417)              NET LOSS ATTRIBUTABLE TO:          Stockholders of the Company$(9,138,266) $(14,481,043) $(31,321,618) $(51,382,417)Non-controlling interests —   —   (268,964)  —  $(9,138,266) $(14,481,043) $(31,590,582) $(51,382,417)               TOTAL COMPREHENSIVE LOSS ATTRIBUTABLE TO:          Stockholders of the Company$(9,138,266) $(14,481,043) $(31,321,618) $(51,382,417)Non-controlling interests —   —   (268,964)  —  $(9,138,266) $(14,481,043) $(31,590,582) $(51,382,417)               LOSS PER ORDINARY SHARE          Basic and diluted$(0.03) $(0.04) $(0.10) $(0.15)LOSS PER EQUIVALENT ADS - AFTER THE ADS RATIO CHANGE          Basic and diluted$(0.66) $(1.04) $(2.40) $(3.68)Weighted-average number of ordinary shares in the computation of basic loss per ordinary share 348,028,867   348,723,365   325,684,272   348,723,365 Weighted-average number of equivalent ADS in the computation of basic loss per ADS – after the ADS Ratio Change13,921,155   13,948,935   13,027,371   13,948,935 About ASLAN PharmaceuticalsASLAN Pharmaceuticals (Nasdaq: ASLN) is a clinical-stage, immunology-focused biopharmaceutical company developing innovative treatments to transform the lives of patients.

11,34fd1eea-bc42-3bd3-9736-2d806ff840dc,TMO,2023-03-24,Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO) Gains But Lags Market: What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/thermo-fisher-scientific-tmo-gains-221510370.html,1679609710,STORY,"['TMO', '^GSPC']","[In the latest trading session, Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO) closed at $555.19, marking a +0.16% move from the previous day. This move lagged the S&amp;P 500's daily gain of 0.3%. Elsewhere, the Dow gained 0.24%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 0.34%.Coming into today, shares of the maker of scientific instrument and laboratory supplies had gained 1.08% in the past month. In that same time, the Medical sector lost 2.43%, while the S&amp;P 500 lost 1.21%.Investors will be hoping for strength from Thermo Fisher Scientific as it approaches its next earnings release. The company is expected to report EPS of $4.95, down 31.72% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $10.57 billion, down 10.58% from the prior-year quarter.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $23.72 per share and revenue of $45.34 billion, which would represent changes of +2.07% and +0.95%, respectively, from the prior year.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Thermo Fisher Scientific. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection remained stagnant.

We installed or improved metering capabilities at many plants, and we will continue this effort in FY'23.We also completed an assessment of each type of water-treatment and -reuse system currently utilized by Cintas to identify opportunities for improvement and expansion. Further, we continued evaluating advances in wastewater-treatment technology that could also expand the long-term potential of water reuse.This examination of our water-reuse technologies and capabilities will be especially important as we identify opportunities to reduce our total water consumption in geographic areas experiencing significant water stress.More than 30 years ago, Cintas started installing Dissolved Air Flotation (DAF) systems in plants. Those systems aid our efforts to reuse water. Over time, we have worked with our vendors to standardize the design of our DAF systems and incorporate the latest technological advancements into our plants.MAXIMIZING REUSE IN THE GREAT LAKES AREARecently, we've had significant success in leveraging water-reuse technologies at facilities in our Rental division's Great Lakes and East Central groups.These groups include plant locations in Northern Indiana, Michigan, Northern and Eastern Ohio, Western and Central Pennsylvania, Western and Central New York, Kentucky, West Virginia, and Maryland.Some locations near the Great Lakes have demonstrated reuse capabilities approaching - and in some cases exceeding - 30% of their water needs, and have been ground zero for our reuse-optimization testing.Story continuesOptimizing reuse technology at these plants has allowed us to create greater efficiencies at these locations and expand their capacity while continuing to operate within permitting limits. Their success has also helped us identify optimal reuse technology integrations and use cases that will benefit our enterprise footprint. This includes our processing locations in water-stressed regions that face added challenges.WHAT'S AHEADOptimizing our ability to reuse water and lower our overall water consumption is an important priority at Cintas.Water reuse will continue to be a focus of our engineering, production, and plant management teams. Our Operational Excellence activities will play a central part in this work, and our customers' expectations and satisfaction will continue to be paramount.Read moreView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Cintas on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: CintasWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/cintasEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: CintasView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/745445/Cintas-Spotlight-Pursuing-Greater-Water-Reuse]"

Let's take a closer look.Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.Hologic and Edwards Lifesciences are sporting Zacks Ranks of #2 (Buy) and #3 (Hold), respectively, right now. This means that HOLX's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.HOLX currently has a forward P/E ratio of 21, while EW has a forward P/E of 31.52.

This is all according to Reuters. The retail giant scaling back on some of its staffing at a few e-commerce f-- fu-- fulfillment centers-- if I can get it out. Right now, about 200 employees are going to be impacted. But Walmart will reportedly make similar changes at a number of centers across a couple of states here, ultimately affecting hundreds of more jobs.Now, Walmart says that it is working with its employees to find new positions within the company. So the retail giant is making some tough decisions here. We have seen a number of its competitors, including Amazon, ax thousands of jobs. It's been able to avoid layoffs of that size for now, but, Josh, we certainly are seeing the retail landscape change. These companies need to make strategic decisions. A lot of that is investment in tech, investment in automation. And some jobs are being eliminated as a result.JOSH SCHAFER: And it's only a couple hundred jobs. You don't want to make a big deal about the automation note there, but it is interesting to cut human jobs for automation. It reminded me of what Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told us yesterday. With this rate hike environment, as companies try and cut back, one way to do that is computing. Of course, he's talking his own book a little bit there with AI. But it is interesting to think about that, right, Dave, and what AI and what automation could do to help jobs in that way. Again, only a couple hundred jobs, but still it looks like that might be what is being used here to some extent-- automation.DAVE BRIGGS: Well, and on that note, I've just been surprised that Amazon hasn't had more targeted layoffs in the e-commerce section because that's where they exploded. They doubled their headcount in that two-year period. And we've seen even the most recent layoffs were not anywhere near e-commerce, which is sort of a surprise.Story continuesAnd I think those are-- I hate to say it-- I do think they're probably coming at some point this year-- but also layoffs. Accenture laid off 19,000 today. Indeed laid off 2,200 or 15% of their workforce today. A gloomy economic backdrop continues to appear.JOSH SCHAFER: We stopped talking about banks for a day, and then, all of a sudden, we're back on the layoff story, right? And it's still happening.- Unfortunately.JOSH SCHAFER: You know it's still happening, though. And it's something we hadn't talked about it seemed like in a couple of weeks, but it's back.]"

Walmart is the largest private employer in the United States with about 1.7 million U.S. workers.Apart from Pedricktown, New Jersey, Walmart did not post a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) notice for the layoffs, according to a Reuters review of labor government data. A WARN notice is mandated by U.S. labor law and requires companies with 100 or more employees to provide 60 days' advance notification of plant closings and mass layoffs.The spokesperson declined to call them mass layoffs and said that the warehouses continued to operate normally. The company did not issue a WARN notification for the other locations as it is unsure about the total number of employees that will be eventually laid off and re-hired, the spokesperson added.(Reporting by Siddharth Cavale in New YorkEditing by Nick Zieminski)]"

According to the research firm, Rystad, spending on offshore oil investments exceeded $100 billion in 2022 for the first time in a decade, and will do so again in 2023 and 2024. Norway, the Scandinavian country that has positioned itself as a climate leader, is driving some of this boom. Norway is spending $21.4 billion on oil projects this year, an increase of 22% from the previous year.Norway’s investment in offshore oil is among the highest in the world this year, according to Rystad. It lands behind the $33 billion that will be spent on offshore projects in the Middle East, but ahead of countries like the US, which is putting $17 billion in offshore investments, and the UK with $7 billion.Read moreChatGPT is getting more nuancedChina is changing its tune on the mRNA vaccineA fresh idea for gathering remote and hybrid employees togetherOffshore projects are designed to pump oil for decades; investments that begin this year could continue to churn out oil well into the 2050s.Norway’s good deeds were always funded by oil and gasNorway’s fuzzy commitments to easing climate change feel like solutions to a problem that is, in no small part, of its own making. Norway is one of the world’s top exporters of oil. Since the 1990s, the country has funneled its oil revenues into the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund—which, with $1.4 trillion in assets, is now the world’s largest.The fund is among the biggest investors in the world, and it uses its considerable financial influence to advance its values. In recent years, it has dropped or put under close observation Thai, Israeli, Polish, Chinese and Indian companies over human rights abuses, and has wielded its power to bend companies toward net-zero goals.Some of the pro-climate positions that Norway has taken includes demanding transparency from Exxon to prevent the kind of corporate lobbying that leads to bad climate policies. Norway has also pushed Chevron to commit to taking responsibility for “Scope 3"" emissions—the broadest definition of the pollution that any company produces. This would include lowering customers’ emissions (as well as Chevron’s own), for example, by reducing the carbon intensity of its fossil fuel products.Story continuesIn 2022, Norway announced its goal to have every company in its portfolio reach net-zero emissions by 2050 and followed that up by voting against 61 directors at 18 companies for not doing enough to mitigate climate risk. This February, Norway said that it will continue to use its votes to push out directors and board members who fall short of climate goals.Norway is trying to put policy where its money isBut high oil prices are also inspiring other priorities, and Norway is joining a trend among flush oil companies and countries to refocus on fossil fuel extraction, sometimes at the expense of renewables.Norway has backed its refreshed interest in fossil fuel extraction with international policy. In the IPCC’s mammoth climate report released on March 20, Norway negotiated for wiggle room for its oil and gas investments, watering down language about limiting human-caused climate change from “deep, rapid and sustained” reductions, to “strong” emissions reductions—an imprecise word that accommodates its backtracking on North Sea projects More from QuartzThe split of the African plate could gift six landlocked countries a coastlineHow Credit Suisse’s demise strengthens Switzerland’s place in global financeSign up for Quartz's Newsletter.

Although crude began Friday trade with a loss, it was modestly up at the time of writing.West Texas Intermediate had recovered to top $70 per barrel at the time of writing and it was set for a weekly gain of more than 4%. On a monthly basis, however, WTI has lost about $3 per barrel.Brent crude also looked set to end the week with an overall gain: the benchmark started the week at around $70 per barrel and has since climbed to over $76 per barrel, although Brent remains much lower than it was a month ago, at over $82 per barrel.The main upward force in oil markets remains the expectation of returning Chinese demand, although most analysts believe the oil market won’t tighten until the second half of the year. A growing consensus that fears of a banking crisis were overblown and last week’s selloff was largely speculative has further helped oil markets recover. Finally, rumors that the Fed may end its string of interest rate hikes soon have provided some hope to markets.The recent slew of bearish catalysts for oil prices includes the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s latest weekly report, which estimated another inventory build, the Fed’s interest rate hike, and Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm’s statement on Thursday that the federal government will take its time with refilling the strategic petroleum reserve.It could take years to refill the SPR, Granholm said yesterday, dampening hopes for a demand spike from the refill effort, even though crude is currently trading close to the range set by the Energy Department for the start of the refill push.Last year, the federal government sold more than 220 million barrels of crude from the SPR to lower retail fuel prices. This took the SPR to the lowest level in 40 years, at around 372 million barrels. The administration’s refill plans are seen as bullish for oil prices and tricky for the administration itself because of that.Story continuesRecession fears in the U.S., meanwhile, remain high, adding pressure to oil prices, which seem set for their sharpest quarterly drop since 2020. Back in 2020, it was the pandemic lockdowns that decimated demand and led to a plunge in prices.Now, its recession fears, the continued flow of Russian oil abroad despite Western sanctions, and lower demand from France, where refinery workers are striking and oil tankers are being diverted from ports.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:The Case Against Massive Investments In Natural GasThe Path To True EV SustainabilityThe Real Reason Xi Jinping Is Making A Long-Term Bet On PutinRead this article on OilPrice.com]"

Gas flares from the field light the night sky bright orange, spewing acrid smoke; when the wind picks up, the 40-year old’s clothes are coated black.For Iraq’s poorest, evidence of the country's monumental oil wealth is inescapable. So is the knowledge that very little of it trickles down to them.Jasim’s savings were depleted when he was diagnosed with cancer last year, a disease he is convinced was caused by the toxic plumes. Twenty years since the U.S.-led invasion toppled Saddam Hussein and remade Iraq’s political order with the promise of democracy and freedom, he has one wish: To find a way to leave.“There is no future here for my children,” he said.Basra province, which boasts most of Iraq’s oil reserves, is symbolic of the deep disparities that have endured since the 2003 invasion. Basra continually bewilders experts, envoys and residents: How can a relatively stable province so rich in resources rank among the poorest and most under-developed in the country?“Of course, I blame the corrupt Iraqi government,” said Jasim, a policeman, echoing a widespread view in the region. “But I blame the Americans too. They replaced our leaders with thieves.”Local leaders in Basra talk of the oil reserves as both a blessing and a curse. They say resources bring affluence but have also given rise to vicious competition between political elites and armed groups at the expense of the Iraqi people.The power-sharing system in place since 2003, which divides the state and its institutions along ethnic and sectarian lines, sucks oil wealth into a pool of corruption and patronage. The higher the oil price, the more entrenched this system becomes as sectarian-based parties claim lucrative ministry portfolios, appoint loyalists in key positions and dole out public jobs to ensure support. According to the International Monetary Fund, public sector employment tripled from 2004 to 2013, but service delivery in health, education and power sectors remained inadequate.Story continuesThe result is that elections keep establishment parties in power. Voter turnout has dropped to record lows.Apart from institutional failures, air pollution is extensive in Basra, and salinity levels arising from a severe fresh water crisis are leading causes of illness, according to local researchers. Unemployment is rampant, with more than half the population below the age of 25.Public anger gave rise to violent protests in 2018, the precursor to mass anti-government protests in the capital a year later. But a swift crackdown by security forces and assassinations by armed groups have created a climate of fear.“The killings silenced many activists,” said Basra activist Ammar Sarhan. “Business continues as usual.”The 2003 toppling of Saddam propelled the oil-rich country into the global economy, opening the doors to foreign investment. In pre-invasion planning, U.S. advisors and their Iraqi opposition allies in exile had envisioned a shock system of reforms that would revamp Iraq’s oil industry and fund post-war reconstruction.Instead, violence hobbled oil production for years. A charm offensive by then-Oil Minister Hussein al-Shahrestani paved the way for major oil contracts to be awarded in 2007 and 2009. Today exports reach over 3 million barrels a day, double the rate in the early 2000s. The state budget, which in 2021 reached up to $90 billion, is financed almost entirely by oil revenues. Still, the government fails to deliver essential services, including water and electricity.In Basra, conditions rank amongst the worst in the country. Unemployment stands at 21%, above the national average of 16% according to a 2022 study by the International Labor Organization. Statistics for poverty rates vary from 10-20% according to various studies and local economists. Meanwhile, the province boasts around 70% of the country's oil production capacity.The road leading to Jasim’s humble home is rocky and unpaved.In 2003, he was a young man bewitched by the Bush administration’s rhetoric of building a democratic Iraq, he said. “We were full of hope,” he recalled. Twenty years on, he is middle-aged, tired of rampant government corruption and recovering from cancer.The loan he had taken out to build a home was used up to pay for $30,000 in private medical bills. Basra’s decrepit public hospitals were overwhelmed and unable to provide treatment, he said.His is a common story in Nahran Omar, a village of fewer than 2,000 people adjacent to a state-run oil field where cancer rates are disproportionately high. Every family here has a story of illness and debt, said Bashir Jabir, the mayor.“After 2003, more and more oil was exported, and we expected to benefit from this,” he said. “Instead, it hurt us.”The government long played down the link between cancer rates in the south and oil production activity, saying cases are only marginally higher than the rest of the country. This changed in 2022, when then-Environment Minister Jassim al-Falahi acknowledged that pollution from the fields was the main reason for the rise in sickness.Nahran Omar highlights a tragic irony: The natural gas burned from the oil fields, if captured, could solve Iraq’s perennial electricity shortages and reduce pollution. But securing investment to do this has been set back by protracted contract negotiations, a common headache for most major foreign investors.The entry of foreign investors also exacerbated competition between tribes, said Sheikh Muhammed al-Zaidawi, who leads an assembly of southern tribal elders. Tribes, which often wield more influence than government institutions in the south, pressure foreign companies for jobs, compensation, training for youth and development of their villages.“Most of the problems between tribes today are caused by the presence of oil companies,” he said, “All of them want to benefit.” Tribal disputes often turn into deadly gun battles.Reliance on the oil industry has stifled private sector development. Nearly every prime minister since the invasion has repeated calls to diversify the economy and boost incentives for Iraqi businesses.Nidhal Musa is one success story.She grew up in a poor suburb of Basra city and was 35 when the U.S. invaded Iraq. She spent subsequent years taking care of her sick and disabled husband. Desperate to earn money, she began sewing clothes to sell in the local market.By 2013, she had gathered a group of women just like herself, beleaguered and in need of money to support their families. She pooled together enough funds to open a garment factory and became known for employing the poor.But not everyone welcomed her success.In 2022, Musa received a slew of death threats. “Be very careful,” one message read. She believes she is being targeted because she refused to use her local fame to back a powerful political party that asked her to promote their campaign in 2021 elections.“They try to keep us weak,” she said. “They know perfectly well, if the people are hungry, they will be preoccupied only by their hunger.”]"

The move brewed concerns over a further deterioration in U.S.-Iran relations, which in turn could disrupt crude supply from the Middle East.Brent oil futures were flat at $75.92 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate crude futures rose 0.1% to $70.00 a barrel by 02:24 ET (06:24 GMT). Both contracts had fallen as much as 0.5% each earlier in the session.Oil prices fell on Thursday after the U.S. downplayed plans to immediately refill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR), with U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm stating that it could take years for the government to refill the SPR.Her comments implied lesser buying action in oil markets over the near-term, and also offset prior signals from the Biden administration that it would begin replenishing the SPR if prices were consistently around $67 to $72 a barrel.Sales by the Biden administration had pushed the SPR to a near 50-year low in 2022. The government is also set to release an additional 26 million barrels from the reserve as part of a congressional mandate.Still, oil prices were set to rise between 3% and 5% this week, as they recovered from a recent tumble to 15-month lows. The collapse of several U.S. banks earlier this month pushed up concerns over an economic slowdown this year, which fed into fears that weak economic growth will dent crude demand.Concerns over a banking crisis were still in play, while a middling economic outlook from the Federal Reserve also dented markets.Uncertainty over a production cut by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies (OPEC+) also weighed on crude markets, after a Reuters report suggested that the cartel will keep production unchanged during a meeting in early-April.Story continuesRelated ArticlesOil pares losses as Middle East tensions rise after U.S. air strikeOil prices dip as U.S. holds off on restocking strategic reserveGold pinned near $2,000, overtakes dollar as premier safe haven]"

West Texas Intermediate U.S. crude futures fell 70 cents, or 1%, to $69.26 a barrel.Both benchmarks rose this week as banking sector turmoil eased. Brent futures rose 2.8% in the week while U.S. crude futures rose 3.8%. Last week, both benchmarks posted their biggest declines in months.""We're riding along macroeconoic headwinds, and there's a newfound correlation with equities"" said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital LLC in New York.Banking stocks slid in Europe with Deutsche Bank and UBS Group slammed by worries that the worst problems in the sector since the 2008 financial crisis could persist.U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen convened an unscheduled meeting of the Financial Stability Oversight Council on Friday morning.The dollar rose 0.6% against other currencies, which also pressured oil, making crude more expensive to holders of other currencies.The White House said in October it would buy back oil for the SPR when prices were at or below about $67-$72 per barrel.On Thursday, Granholm told lawmakers it would be difficult to take advantage of low prices this year to add to stockpiles, which are at their lowest level since 1983 following sales directed by President Joe Biden last year.Oil drew some support from strong demand expectations from China. Goldman Sachs said commodities demand was surging in the world's biggest oil importer, with oil demand topping 16 million bpd.Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said a previously announced cut of 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) in Russia's oil production would be from an output level of 10.2 million bpd in February, the RIA Novosti news agency reported.That means Russia aims to produce 9.7 million bpd between March and June, according to Novak, a much smaller output cut than Moscow previously indicated.(Additional reporting by Ahmad Ghaddar in London; Yuka Obayashi in Tokyo and Trixie Yap in Singapore; Editing by Marguerita Choy, Louise Heavens and David Gregorio)]"

Grainger GWW.3 Best Momentum Stocks Banking of the Driehaus StrategyThe Driehaus strategy is known as the ""buy high and sell higher"" theory. No doubt, it's a successful investment strategy that helped Richard Driehaus make a place in Barron's All-Century Team. In fact, to choose the best momentum stocks, the Driehaus strategy can be applied.To that end, stocks like Omnicom Group, Inter Parfums and W.W. Grainger have been selected as the momentum picks for the day using the Driehaus strategy.A Detailed Look Into the Driehaus StrategyRegarding the strategy, Driehaus once said: ""I would much rather invest in a stock that's increasing in price and take the risk that it may begin to decline than invest in a stock that's already in decline and try to guess when it will turn around."" In line with this insight, the American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) took into account the percentage 50-day moving average as one of the key criteria before creating a portfolio following Driehaus' philosophy.It is calculated by dividing the numerator (month-end price minus 50-day moving average of month-end price) by the 50-day moving average of the month-end price. Another momentum indicator — positive relative strength — has also been included in this strategy. A positive percentage 50-day moving average indicates that the stock is trading at a price higher than its 50-day moving average level, indicating an uptrend.Moreover, AAII found that Driehaus primarily focuses on strong earnings growth rates and impressive earnings projections to pick potential outperformers. Companies with a strong history of beating estimates are also given importance in this strategy, which was made to provide better returns over the long term.Here are three of the 13 stocks:Story continuesOmnicom Group is one of the largest advertising, marketing, and corporate communications companies in the world.

(NYSE:CRM), the leading customer relationship management software solutions provider in the world, reported strong earnings for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 on March 1, attracting wide praise from Wall Street analysts, economists and investors. Shares popped more than 15% the following day with investors getting behind the company in hopes for much higher investment returns in the future with the company pledging to focus more on profitability and operating margins.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Signs with CRM. Click here to check it out. CRM 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of CRMPeter Lynch Chart of CRMSalesforce: Risks Looming on the HorizonCRM Data by GuruFocusThe company doubled its share buyback program from $10 billion to $20 billion as well - a move that improved the investor sentiment toward in an era where investors have lost faith in many tech companies.Although the outlook for Salesforce seems promising, a deeper dive into the company reveals several major risks looming on the horizon.Balancing margins and growth in a competitive marketSalesforce delivered a remarkable performance in its fiscal fourth quarter, which has been touted by many analysts as a pivotal moment in the company's growth story. The company exceeded Wall Street expectations by a considerable margin, reporting strong revenue and profitability that reflects the strength of its business model amid challenging macroeconomic conditions.The company reported $31.4 billion in revenue for full fiscal 2023, representing an 18% year-over-year increase or 22% in constant currency, indicating strong underlying growth trends.Salesforce had strong operating cash flow of $7.1 billion, the highest in the company's history, which is a testament to its operational efficiency and ability to generate cash from its core business operations. This significant increase of 19% reflects the company's focus on driving growth while also maintaining a strong financial position.Story continuesThe company's impressive performance is a result of its relentless focus on innovation and strategic investments in its platform and product offerings. Salesforce's cloud-based software solutions enable businesses to better manage their customer relationships and drive growth by improving customer engagement and satisfaction. However, despite its strong performance and market leadership position, the company is facing a few risks and challenges.One major issue is the presence of powerful activist investors who are seeking to exert control over the company. Elliott Management, one of the five activist investors of note, has put forward its own slate of candidates for the board of directors. This move is aimed at gaining enough voting control to impose its agenda, which could have significant consequences for the future of Salesforce.Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff has stated that he does not mind activist investors circling his company, as long as they are knowledgeable and have the best interests of the company at heart. However, he has been dismissive of Strive Asset Management, which was co-founded by 2024 Republican presidential hopeful and Woke Inc. author Vivek Ramaswamy. In a recent interview, Benioff referred to Ramaswamy as ""just a politician."" He said that anyone can be an activist, but those who are using activism for their own political agenda are not beneficial to the company.In recent times, the management structure and the growth strategy of Salesforce have become a major concern for investors. Two co-CEOs left their position in just three years, and activist investors believe that the company's management structure needs to be reviewed.Additionally, the company's focus on profitability is another challenge it's facing. Salesforce has achieved meaningful growth through acquisitions, but as investors demanded answers about Salesforce's balance of growth and margins, the company is now more focused on increasing profit margins. This new focus will result in the company curbing spending and investment, which could make it harder for Salesforce to address emerging threats such as the evolution of a long-time partner into a competitor.Veeva Systems Inc. (NYSE:VEEV), a company that sells software to life sciences organizations, is one such long-time partner that built its core software on top of Salesforce's app-development platform. However, this relationship will come to an end in 2025, and the company has announced that the contract with Salesforce will not be renewed as it has built CRM software in-house. It would not be surprising if a few other customers decide to follow Veeva to manage the long-term costs associated with hiring a third-party CRM software solutions provider. While Veeva has agreed to pay Salesforce as its customers use Salesforce's platform, the costs have risen as more people have come to rely on Veeva. In exchange for Veeva's payments, Salesforce has agreed not to enter Veeva's specialized, regulated market. This agreement is becoming challenging as Veeva becomes profitable and is a publicly traded software company with a $28 billion market capitalization. The move to ditch Salesforce is seen as positive for Veevas customers as it simplifies their landscape. However, it remains to be seen whether other large Salesforce customers will follow Veeva's lead and whether Salesforce will be able to develop technology to address these emerging threats.TakeawayDespite Salesforce's strong financial performance and apparent potential for continued growth, the company is not entirely free from risks and challenges. Some of these include concerns over management structure, profitability and emerging competition. With the influence of activist investors and a new focus on short-term profitability, Salesforce may find it difficult to address new threats effectively. Nevertheless, the company continues to hold a significant position in the cloud software development industry, and its actions in the future will be worth observing as it confronts these challenges. Balancing growth with profit margins will be crucial for Salesforce as it navigates these hurdles.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

41,d93c3736-4ccb-33f5-b63a-d5294739c90b,MCO,2023-03-24,TikTok’s CEO Fails to Placate US Lawmakers Eager to Ban It,Bloomberg,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tiktok-ceo-defiant-us-lawmakers-160557416.html,1679643724,STORY,['MCO'],"[(Bloomberg) -- TikTok Chief Executive Shou Chew’s appearance in Congress on Thursday did little to calm the bipartisan fury directed at the viral video-sharing service. If anything, his more than four hours of testimony gave critics more fuel to insist the app be banned in the US.Most Read from Bloomberg$52 Billion Chipmaking Plan Is Racing Toward FailureFBI Releases Files on Ivana TrumpNew Yorkers Are Moving to These Three Florida CitiesBanks in France Face More Than $1.1 Billion Fines After RaidsUBS Veteran Ermotti Returns to Lead Credit Suisse Takeover“We came here hoping to hear some action that would alleviate our concerns,” said Representative Lisa Blunt Rochester, a Delaware Democrat. “I’ve not been reassured by anything you’ve said so far. I think quite frankly your testimony has raised more questions for me than answers.”Chew faced hostile questioning from members of both parties — who often cut off his attempts to answer — in his appearance before the House Energy and Commerce Committee. The testimony comes as lawmakers and the Biden administration are exploring how to force TikTok’s Chinese parent company, ByteDance Ltd., to sell its shares of the unit or block it in the US.Chew said TikTok is independent of its Beijing-based owner and the platform’s headquarters are in Singapore and Los Angeles.“The bottom line is this is American data on American soil by an American company overseen by American personnel,” Chew said. He could not unequivocally say that no ByteDance employees have access to that data, saying rather that he’s “seen no evidence” of that happening.Ohio Representative Bob Latta asked Chew “yes or no,” do Chinese employees including engineers have access to US user data? Chew’s response - “this is a complex subject” - drew incredulous chuckles in the room.Chew answered other yes or no questions with incomplete denials. “That’s not how we see it,” he said when asked whether TikTok is a Chinese company. “I’ve seen no evidence,” he said when asked whether ByteDance employees access US user data.Story continuesWhen asked by Representative Neal Dunn of Florida whether China can use TikTok to spy on Americans, Chew replied, “no.” When confronted with a Forbes article regarding ByteDance employees accessing the data of US journalists, Chew said “I don’t think that spying is the right way to describe it” — again drawing murmurs of disbelief from the crowd.Chew was repeatedly reminded that he was under oath, echoing the prevailing sentiment on Capitol Hill this week that any statement from TikTok or ByteDance is not to be trusted.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said her nation had “never asked and will never ask any company or individual to collect or provide data, information or intelligence data located in other states through means that are in violation of local laws.”The US has not provided evidence that TikTok threatens national security, she said at the regular press briefing in Beijing, and called on the US to “stop suppressing foreign companies.”The hearing took a dark turn when Florida Republican Michael Bilirakis played a compilation of TikTok videos about suicide accompanied by ominous music.Michelle and Dean Nasca, whose 16-year old son died by suicide after using TikTok, were present at the hearing. The couple is suing ByteDance, alleging that TikTok sent their son more than 1,000 videos related to suicide, hopelessness and self-harm.Chew told the lawmakers that TikTok takes the mental health of its users very seriously and refers people asking about suicide or death it to the platform’s safety page.“We aren’t buying it,” Cathy McMorris Rodgers, the committee’s chair and a Washington Republican, said of TikTok’s arguments of why the service is safe.Rodgers said the app’s wide popularity — used by 150 million Americans — is precisely why it poses such a threat.The room was overflowing with TikTokers who credit the app with giving them a voice or growing their small business. But the lawmakers weren’t assuaged, firing rapid-fire questions to Chew.“Congressman, you’re giving me no time to answer the questions, I reject the characterizations,” Chew said after an exchange with Representative Neal Dunn, a Florida Republican.Chew said the TikTok algorithm drives a great experience for many users, citing content about science and books.“Yes, there are some bad actors who come in and post violative content, and it’s our job to remove that,” Chew said. “But the overwhelming experience is a positive one for our community.”The centerpiece of Chew’s offering to quell concerns about Chinese influence — a $1.5 billion investment in US-based data security measures — has already been rejected by US government officials.Chew, in his prepared remarks, said “conversations with the government are ongoing,” and TikTok’s effort to isolate and protect US user data “has continued unabated.”Moody’s released a statement during the hearing about how a ban would impact the share price of other US social media companies. Even the famously secretive Committee on Foreign Investment in the US — which hasn’t even confirmed that it is reviewing TikTok — released a statement with a general warning about data security.Chew compared the steps TikTok is taking — to protect both data security and the safety of young users — to the practices of other big tech companies. He described the measures TikTok takes to verify the age of its users and enforce restrictions for children and teens as industry-leading.“It’s not a fair fight, the algorithms are on one side of the screen and human brains are on the other side of the screen,” Maryland Democrat John Sarbanes said, emphasizing that young brains are still not fully developed and are no match for TikTok’s technology.Florida’s Darren Soto, a Democrat, said “the genie is really out of the bottle” with so many Americans already on TikTok. He extended his concern to other US social media companies and said it’s up to this committee to set stricter rules for the whole industry.Indiana Republican Greg Pence said “This is the 32nd hearing we’ve held about privacy and Big Tech,” pence said, pounding the desk. Pointing his finger at Chew and raising his voice, he asked how much profit TikTok makes from the data collected from his children, grandchildren and neighbors.“I respect and understand your opinion,” Chew said quietly, insisting that most people on TikTok have a positive experience.--With assistance from Philip Glamann.(Updates with comments from China’s Foreign Ministry.

And it doesn't help that merchants are also struggling to pay for security guards as labor costs rise. But William Santana Li has a solution right out of science fiction: Robot Guards.“It's an exciting time to be developing brand new cutting edge technologies and taking all the crazy stuff that Hollywood had been streaming out and actually putting it in the real world,” Li, the CEO of Knightscope, which makes the security robots, told Yahoo Finance. (Video above)By the numbers, it looks like a great opportunity for Li. and his Silicon Alley-based firm.Wages for security guards and patrol services have increased 20% in the past three years, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Meanwhile, complaints of retail theft soared during the pandemic, as Yahoo Finance previously reported. A 2022 survey by the National Retail Federation shows that organized retail theft (when crime rings facilitate the thievery) soared by 26.5% in 2021.To solve both problems—theft and labor costs—Knightscope has produced the The K5 ASR, a 5 foot tall, roughly 400 pound, autonomous robot that patrols an area for crime. Knightscope offers annual subscriptions for the devices at a price of $0.75 to $7 per hour, according to the company.Li said the robots operate “anywhere you might see an officer indoors or outdoors"" and that their clients include commercial real estate, corporate campuses, law enforcement agencies, casinos, schools, parking structures and hospitals among other locations. Recently, home retailer Lowe's (LOW) began using Knightscope robots in Philadelphia, per the Philadelphia Inquirer. Li also said that PG&amp;E (PCG) and ABM (AMB) are clients.William Santana Li, chairman and CEO of Knightscope Inc. demonstrates a security robot at WSJD Live conference in Laguna Beach, California, U.S., October 25, 2016. REUTERS/Mike Blake“These are intended to not only deter negative behavior, but just physically being there, you can stop a lot of nonsense from happening, but to give officers and guards really smart eyes, ears, and their voice on the ground in multiple locations at the same time,” said Li.Story continuesThe robot recharges itself without human intervention, according to Knightscope, and can run 24/7. It also uses 360-degree, eye-level video streaming and recording to assess its surroundings.Robot security, according to a 2022 report by Forrester Research, can save companies up to $79,000 a year.Knightscope maintains an online list of some of the victories the robots have achieved in fighting crime. For instance, the K5 curbed crime Huntington Park, a city in Los Angeles County, where it helped increase arrests by 27% over a year.Can Knightscope can be trusted with all of the data its robots collect? Li claimed Knightscope has good intentions. “It's intended solely to be used for public safety, and it's not to be resold and used in any other manner other than at times improving our algorithms.”The robots can collect up to 90 terabytes or 90,000 gigabytes of data per year and clients can retrieve information information for up to 30 days, according to Knightscope’s website. ""I don't believe the founders of our country ever expected us to build a society where going to school, going to work, or going shopping literally came with the risk of being shot or killed,"" Li said. ""And that's why we're so passionate about making a big difference here and trying to get both the public and the private sector to work together to reimagine public safety.""Dylan Croll is a reporter and researcher at Yahoo Finance.

He also said that he plans to work half a day each month at stores in order to keep him close and Starbucks close to culture and to its customers. And he did say that the refounding of Starbucks, that reinvigoration, is quote, unquote, ""well underway.""But as Dave noted, this comes at a time where there is that ongoing tension between both Starbucks and the more than 290 company-owned stores that have voted to unionize. And so in a Q&amp;A, when asked about if Starbucks will enter a labor neutrality agreement, the public affairs for Starbucks, AJ Jones, said it will, quote, ""not because it will prohibit the ability for us to talk openly and freely with our partners, provide them with the information that they need about the value and importance of relationship with us and how it could change under union representation.""Now, of course, one of the proposals that they did vote on today-- that is, shareholders of Starbucks-- was to push the company to agree to do an independent assessment of its commitments to workers' rights. So of course, that's things like the freedom to collective bargaining and the ability or right to join a union without management interference.Story continuesWe will get the results of the shareholder meeting today in four business days. So certainly, lots to unpack and lots on Laxman's plate. But, of course, this does come as Howard Schultz, the former CEO of Starbucks, is set to testify on the Hill next week.DAVE BRIGGS: Yeah, that'll be interesting after what we saw today, man.SEANA SMITH: It certainly will be interesting.DAVE BRIGGS: Although it'll be much more one-sided, the questioning of--SEANA SMITH: Yeah. Yes.DAVE BRIGGS: I think Republicans--SEANA SMITH: Safe to say.DAVE BRIGGS: --are pretty supportive of Howard Schultz.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, yeah, exactly. He's only going to be facing maybe some of those hostile questions from one side of the aisle, coming up here in a few weeks. But, Brooke, when we talk about some of the items that are on the agenda here for the new CEO, the Oleato--BROOKE DIPALMA: Right, right.SEANA SMITH: I'm saying that right?BROOKE DIPALMA: You're saying it right.SEANA SMITH: An olive oil-infused coffee. We got it on set. We talked about it, so we got it. Give it a try. I'm a little skeptical, to be honest.BROOKE DIPALMA: All right. Well, this is the cold brew with the golden foam. Now, I did get this from a Reserve, so it does not come in this fancy cup all the time. This runs a bit lower in price. But for this one, it was $9 from our local Reserve. Now, this golden foam, they actually-- it's creamy.SEANA SMITH: The coffee was $9?BROOKE DIPALMA: The coffee was $9. I know. Yeah.SEANA SMITH: Gosh.DAVE BRIGGS: Whoa!BROOKE DIPALMA: But it typically--DAVE BRIGGS: 9 bones?SEANA SMITH: --runs lower. It's typically about $6.45 for this one at a--DAVE BRIGGS: OK.SEANA SMITH: OK.BROOKE DIPALMA: --when it does roll out nationwide. So this was introduced today, and then it will essentially roll out at nationwide Starbucks in the coming months. It's now available in the Reserve locations and select locations as well. But it-- they're calling it a lush flavor. And then Howard Schultz said virtually on the call today that it has a lingering aftertaste--[INTERPOSING VOICES]SEANA SMITH: It does have a lingering aftertaste.BROOKE DIPALMA: So be prepared for that.DAVE BRIGGS: I'm surprised how much you can't taste the actual olive oil. We actually made one in our coffee bar, here at Yahoo, and I didn't taste it. I taste it, and I actually feel it on my lips a little bit. Thank god, I love olive oil, but--BROOKE DIPALMA: And I did want to point--DAVE BRIGGS: --I don't know.BROOKE DIPALMA: --out today that at the Reserve, they had this big to-do about it. Amelia was one of the baristas, I guess you could say, who was serving samples. And as she pointed out-- don't choke now, Dave.SEANA SMITH: Don't choke.BROOKE DIPALMA: As she pointed out, she said it was like a moisturizer for your lips, and I actually thought that was pretty legit.SEANA SMITH: Yeah.BROOKE DIPALMA: It's olive oil--SEANA SMITH: Although I don't know if I want--BROOKE DIPALMA: --and it stays.SEANA SMITH: --to be tasting my coffee like a moisturizer, but I don't know.BROOKE DIPALMA: It's not bad.SEANA SMITH: Initially, I thought it was pretty good. Now, I'm a little skeptical. That aftertaste is very, very strong.DAVE BRIGGS: Every once in a while, I'd give it a go.SEANA SMITH: Not for $9 though.DAVE BRIGGS: I don't know if it was a gift to Laxman or not--BROOKE DIPALMA: Some analysts do worry--DAVE BRIGGS: --by Howard Schultz.BROOKE DIPALMA: --that it was not going to be a habitual routine and that it may just be one and done.SEANA SMITH: Well, all right, guys. Well, we got to leave it there. We got to drink our coffees.]"

""We must care for"" customer-facing staff, he wrote.""We strive to be a different kind of company operating in a different kind of world,"" he said, adding Starbucks plans to ""reinvigorate"" its employee culture.His comments came the day after Starbucks workers walked off the job at 100 stores around the United States, and a video posted by the union on social media showed hundreds of activists marching in protest outside company headquarters.The former PepsiCo and Reckitt Benckiser executive, who joined the company in October, took over on Monday as Howard Schultz stepped down from his third stint as CEO of the chain he helped turn into a global coffee behemoth.Narasimhan must contend with the company's divisive record on labor unions, an issue of increasing concern to politicians and shareholders.The company has said it complies with U.S. labor law. It has accused the union of failing to bargain in good faith and the National Labor Relations Board of running unfair elections that favored the union.Schultz is scheduled to testify next week before a U.S. Senate committee on the topic.Investors voted Thursday on a shareholder proposal for an independent review of Starbucks' practices on union organizing and collective bargaining.The company did not disclose results of the voting.During the meeting, acting executive vice president and general counsel Zabrina Jenkins addressed the proposal, saying the company is conducting an independent assessment ""that will include a deeper level review of the principles of freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining. This represents a much broader commitment than the shareholder proposal requests.""Story continuesJonas Kron, chief advocacy officer at shareholder Trillium Asset Management, one of the investors that made the proposal, said this was the first time he had heard that argument.Jenkins' comments ""didn't provide clarity"" and were ""very vague,"" Kron said.But Narasimhan taking over ""is a real opportunity for a pivot"" on unions, he said.Much of the meeting consisted of a video showing Narsimhan's last six months with the company, visiting coffee farmers, suppliers and cafes around the world, donning a green apron and giving fist bumps and high fives to baristas.LABOR STRIFESince late 2021, workers at more than 290 U.S. corporate-owned locations have voted to unionize. Unionized employees say the company illegally retaliated against union organizers with firings and store closures.Hundreds of pro-union baristas and supporters protested outside Starbucks' Seattle headquarters on Wednesday, according to Starbucks Workers United and video on social media.Chanting and carrying signs reading ""seize the beans of production"" and ""be kind to your workers,"" baristas urged the company to increase staffing and schedule the workers for more hours so they could qualify for health insurance benefits.""Stop union busting and show up to the bargaining table,"" barista Hailey Cribbs from Bellingham, Washington, told the rally.

DoorDash CEO Tony Xu and his executive team make DoorDash deliveries once a month, for example.Narasimhan, 55, issued the letter just prior to the company’s annual meeting, which was held virtually. The former PepsiCo executive has spent the last six months immersing himself in Starbucks, earning his barista certification as well as visiting stores, farms and manufacturing centers across the world.""I felt it was very important to start as a barista. I wanted to really understand what they do and how they do it,"" Narasimhan said in comments emailed to The Associated Press. ""I’ve loved and learned so much about the retail experience from working in our stores, and can now make an excellent French press if I do say so myself.""Narasimhan said his first priority is addressing some of the company's limitations. A reinvention plan announced last fall is updating equipment and layouts to make stores more efficient and increasing employee retention with better pay and benefits, he said. The average U.S. Starbucks worker now makes $17.50 per hour.Narasimhan said he would like to see Starbucks evolve into a more global company, be less wasteful and move with greater speed.""My immersion provided me with exposure to every aspect of Starbucks business, culture, and brand,"" he said. “Together, we have acknowledged the opportunity for a refounding of Starbucks.”Story continuesNarasimhan succeeds longtime Starbucks leader Howard Schultz, who came out of retirement last spring to serve as interim CEO while the company searched for a new chief executive. Schultz will remain on the company’s board.Some investors were unhappy with that move, saying Starbucks should have had a more robust succession plan in place when former CEO Kevin Johnson retired last April. Among the shareholder proposals investors voted on Thursday was one that would require Starbucks' board to begin succession planning at least three years before an expected transition.Another shareholder proposal would require Starbucks to commission a third-party assessment of its commitment to workers' collective-bargaining rights. That proposal came amid an ongoing unionization movement that Starbucks opposes.At least 293 of Starbucks' 9,000 company-owned U.S. stores have voted to unionize since late 2021. Workers have begun bargaining with the company but so far no store has reached agreement on a new contract.The process has been contentious. Earlier this month, a federal labor judge found that the company violated labor laws “hundreds of times” during a unionization campaign in Buffalo, New York. The company is appealing.On Wednesday, workers at more than 100 U.S. Starbucks stores went on strike across the country, demanding that Starbucks come to the bargaining table and hammer out labor agreements. It was the third time that workers have held a nationwide strike.Starbucks Workers United, the union organizing the workers, said it wanted to send Narasimhan a message that the CEO transition is an opportunity to break with the past and partner with the union. Schultz had a long history of opposing unionization.But in his comments to the AP, Narasimhan struck a similar tone to his predecessor. He said Starbucks respects workers' right to organize but believes the company functions best without a union.“As a company, our experience is that a having a direct relationship with our partners is core to our culture and the experiences we create in our stores,"" Narasimhan said. “I continue to believe a direct relationship with our partners is the best way forward.”Starbucks said it would announce the results of the shareholder votes in the next few days.Starbucks shares closed down less than 1% at $98.42 Thursday.]"

Despite new CEO Laxman Narasimhan’s efforts to start off on the right foot by pledging to work at a store one day every month, unionized Starbucks baristas aren’t sold on it.On Wednesday, unionized employees at roughly 100 Starbucks cafes went on strike to send a message to the company about its alleged union busting practices. Starbucks baristas formed their first union in December 2021, and since then, the movement has spread across the country to over 280 stores (albeit the pace has slowed in recent months). Starbucks’ Schultz was not a fan and repeatedly pushed back on Starbucks Union’s demands. Meanwhile, his successor Narasimhan told employees Thursday he plans to stay “close to the culture” at Starbucks by working a shift for half a day every month, CNBC reported. ""We're hopeful that Laxman Narasimhan will be the innovative leader Starbucks partners deserve; that he'll honor our union, bargain a fair contract, and let us help return this company to its stated mission and values,"" Michelle Eisen, a Starbucks employee in Buffalo, N.Y., told Fortune in a statement.The strikes came a day before Starbucks’ annual shareholder meeting on Thursday, where investors will vote on a resolution about workers’ rights. One of the key questions Narasimhan faces is how he works to address the concerns of baristas regarding pay and working conditions. The meeting will not include members of the Starbucks Workers United and it’s unclear what Narasimhan seeks to do on the union negotiations front.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.Why is Starbucks seen as “anti-union”?During Schultz’s time at Starbucks, which has spanned about 25 years over three stints, he was vocal about social issues including race and healthcare. But when labor unions began organizing at Starbucks stores, Schultz opposed it. If anything, he tried to sideline unionized baristas. One initiative to boost the financial well-being of employees last September covered all employees—except those who worked at unionized stores. Schultz has held that while “partners” at Starbucks had the right to unionize, the company preferred a more direct approach of engaging with them. The unions’ demands include better pay, healthcare, and paid parental leave for all employees, but the company has resisted, saying it already provides the industry’s leading benefits.Starbucks workers make an average of about $17.50 an hour in the U.S., a company spokesperson told Fortune.“I’m not an anti-union person. I am pro-Starbucks, pro-partner, pro–Starbucks culture,” Schultz said at a company town hall last year. “We didn’t get here by having a union.” His reasons for opposing the union are emotional because of Starbucks’ perceived ethos as a “model employer,” people close to Schultz told the New York Times. Schultz viewed unions as an example of Starbucks losing its way as a “values-based company.”Allegations that Starbucks quashed unionizing, including refusing to negotiate contracts and firing union leaders, led the National Labor Relations Board to file more than 80 complaints against the Seattle-based coffee giant. The company has rejected claims about being anti-union and that the NLRB is using its case to set a new standard for labor laws.Schultz is set to testify in Congress next week after he declined a previous request in February to appear before the Senate regarding unionization campaigns at the company. Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-VT) called the former CEO to “end his illegal anti-union activities” and has led the effort to bring in Schultz to testify about Starbucks’ adherence to federal labor laws.“While Howard Schultz is a multi-billionaire who runs a very profitable multi-national corporation he must understand that he and his company are not above the law,” Sanders said earlier this month.Correction, March 23, 2023: This article has been changed to include the most recent data on wages as provided by Starbucks. The headline and story have also been adjusted to remove references to the company's new CEO receiving barista training after taking that role.

(AP) — Water containing a radioactive material has leaked for a second time from a nuclear plant near Minneapolis and the plant will be shut down, but there is no danger to the public, the plant’s owner said Thursday.A leak of what was believed to be hundreds of gallons of water containing tritium was discovered this week from a temporary fix at the Monticello Nuclear Generating Plant, where 400,000 gallons (1.5 million liters) of water with tritium leaked in November, Xcel Energy said in a statement Thursday.The plant about 38 miles (61 kilometers) northwest of Minneapolis is scheduled to power down Friday so permanent repairs can begin, the company said.There was a monthslong delay in announcing the initial leak that raised questions about public safety and transparency, but industry experts said there was never a public health threat.The new leak, announced a day after Xcel Energy says it was discovered, was found to be coming from a temporary fix to the original leak, the company said in a statement. This time, the leak is anticipated to be in the hundreds of gallons.“While the leak continues to pose no risk to the public or the environment, we determined the best course of action is to power down the plant and perform the permanent repairs immediately,” said Chris Clark, president of Xcel Energy–Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota. “We are continuing to work with and inform our state, federal, city and county leaders in the process.”After the first leak was found in November, Xcel Energy made a short-term fix to capture water from a leaking pipe and reroute it back into the plant for re-use. The solution was designed to prevent new tritium from reaching the groundwater until installation of a replacement pipe during a regularly scheduled outage in mid-April, the company said.However, monitoring equipment indicated Wednesday that a small amount of new water from the original leak had reached the groundwater. Operators discovered that, over the past two days, the temporary solution was no longer capturing all of the leaking water, Xcel Energy said.Story continuesThe leaked water remains contained on-site and has not been detected in any local drinking water, Xcel Energy said.Tritium is a radioactive isotope of hydrogen that occurs naturally in the environment and is a common by-product of nuclear plant operations. It emits a weak form of beta radiation that does not travel far and cannot penetrate human skin, according to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency and Minnesota Department of Health released a statement Thursday saying they were told of the new leak Thursday afternoon and that it is ongoing. The agencies said they will continue to monitor groundwater samples and will inform the public if there is an imminent risk.Minnesota regulars said last week that Xcel Energy voluntarily notified state agencies and reported the leak of tritium to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission soon after it was confirmed in November. The amount of leaked material never reached a threshold requiring public notification and they waited to make a public announcement until they had more information, officials said.Edwin Lyman, director of nuclear power safety with the Union of Concerned Scientists, told The Associated Press last week that a significant health risk only would occur if people consumed fairly high amounts of tritium. That risk is contained if the plume stays on the company’s site, which Xcel Energy and Minnesota officials said is the case.]"

68,6efaf163-9de0-33b0-ba79-db9f85c0c419,PM,2023-03-24,The CSO of the world’s largest tobacco company doesn’t smoke. Can she get Philip Morris’s millions of customers to quit too?,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cso-world-largest-tobacco-company-135757497.html,1679579877,STORY,['PM'],"[“I hate cigarettes,” Jennifer Motles, the chief sustainability officer at the world’s largest tobacco company, Philip Morris International, told me over the phone this week. But that admission is remarkably on brand for PMI, a company that, since 2016, says it is committed to a future without smoking.By 2025, PMI wants to be a majority “smoke-free” business, replacing cigarettes with IQOS, the company’s line of vape products. Sales of PMI’s “heated tobacco” products made up 29% of company revenues in 2021; 72% of those customers were, according to PMI’s latest annual report, cigarette quitters.It’s easy to be skeptical of PMI’s commitment to that goal, and indeed I am. PMI has set no deadline for when it wants 100% of sales to come from smoke-free products and, although not all vape users are former smokers, PMI’s increased sales of IQOS products currently rely on a stream of smokers quitting cigarettes, which means it will need smokers for years to come.But for Motles, who says she has never smoked cigarettes or vaped, the audacity of PMI’s ambition is what makes her role as CSO so appealing.“It's really when you make companies that are not good, where you feel so uncomfortable with the status quo, then you really need to change it that you can see impactful and meaningful change happen,” Motles says.The area where PMI can have the most impact, according to the company’s latest materiality report, is on the health of its users, i.e. by helping smokers stop smoking. (See this previous issue of Impact Report for a skeptic’s take on materiality reports.)You might think the easiest way to do that would be for PMI to stop selling cigarettes and force a consumer change but—much like how the world isn’t ready to quit oil—Motles can list a litany of reasons why affecting a paradigm change isn’t as easy as going cold turkey.For one, PMI has tobacco farmers whose livelihoods could be upended if one of the world’s largest cigarette makers suddenly cut its orders. Even PMI’s slow-burning shift away from cigarettes and toward vapes, which consume roughly 50% of the tobacco volume, leaves farmers confronting a major loss.Story continuesFor Motles, that poses a challenge in her role as CSO, where she has to consider the ESG issues confronting the value chain PMI’s quitting—cigarettes—as well as the one it’s entering—vapes. Although there are synergies between the two, like the impact on the livelihoods of tobacco farmers or factory workers, vapes pose issues that aren’t present in cigarettes.How PMI sources the metal heating components for its vape pens and how the company ensures the disposable cartridges are recycled, for example, are new issues. To that end, in some markets, PMI has implemented a Take Back initiative, where it provides IQOS consumers with postage bags that they can use to return spent cartridges to the company to recycle them.But for all the changes PMI is making, can a company whose business is based on addiction ever truly be a source of good? Motles says the answer is a relative yes.“You have a cigarette company that is willing to stop making cigarettes and use its know-how…to create nicotine-containing products that are significantly less harmful than smoking,” Motles says, adding that model is “absolutely” better than a cigarette company that only plans to keep selling cigarettes (which are, as a reminder, legal).Motles thinks ESG-prone investors will see the good in PMI’s ambition and that the market will reward the company for its efforts. If so, then the rest of the cigarette industry might play along, too.“As I said before, the intention here is not just to make PMI smoke-free. It is really to create this paradigm shift where the rest of the industry follows our lead because they understand that this is also the right thing to do, or because they don't have a choice,” she said.Eamon Barretteamon.barrett@fortune.comThis story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeExpert advice to keep your money safe during bank failuresUFB Direct savings account is offering an APY above 5%—and with no feesThis is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home ]"
69,6316a02f-35d3-3d4b-aa7f-2631ee101492,SPG,2023-03-24,Seeking at Least 7% Dividend Yield? Goldman Sachs Suggests 2 Dividend Stocks to Buy,TipRanks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/seeking-least-7-dividend-yield-130928780.html,1679663368,STORY,"['GS', 'SPG', 'SPG-PJ', 'KRC']","[Since the banking crisis began, investors have been looking toward the Federal Reserve. The central bank’s move on interest rates had been widely anticipated, and investors were eager for a sign to indicate whether the Fed saw inflation or a bank run crisis as the greater threat.With central bank’s announcement of a 25 basis point rate hike, or 0.25%, the impression is that the Fed has tried to take a middle path, and is slowing its interest rate policy to calm the banking sector while not abandoning the fight against inflation. The key funds rate is now in the range of 4.75% to 5%; the Fed’s end-of-year target is assumed to be between 5% and 5.25%.Reflecting on this situation, Goldman Sachs chief US equity strategist David Kostin wrote, “If the economy slows sharply and justifies current rate market pricing, then investors will likely rotate from unprofitable stocks towards perceived ‘quality,’ including firms with high margins and high returns on capital.”And this will take us to dividend stocks, a perennially popular defensive play when markets turn sour. Goldman Sachs analyst Caitlin Burrows has been pointing out some quality dividend stocks for just that. These are div players offering yields of at least 7%, and according to the analyst, they also offer double-digit upside potential.Kilroy Realty (KRC)We’ll start with a REIT, a real estate investment trust, Kilroy Realty. These companies are perennial champs among dividend payers, and Kilroy is a good example of the group. The company has a portfolio of 55 properties, mainly in California, but also in Washington State and Texas. Kilroy’s portfolio focuses on office space, life science properties, retail, and residential developments. As of the end of 2022, Kilroy had nearly $10.8 billion in total assets, including $9.5 billion in real estate assets.Those real estate assets are primarily the properties in the portfolio, which totaled 16.2 million square feet. At the end of 4Q22, Kilroy’s properties had a 92.9% lease rate, and a 91.6% occupancy rate. These underlaid the company’s sound performance in the last reported quarter, 4Q22, when the total revenue came in at $284.3 million, beating the forecast by $6.17 million. The quarterly funds from operations, FFO, a key metric for REITs, was reported at $1.17 per share, 2 cents better than expected.Story continuesFor the full year 2022, Kilroy reported revenues in excess of $1 billion, marking the first time the company had achieved that level. FFO for 2022 was reported at $4.68 per diluted share.Kilroy’s sound results support the company’s dividend payment, which in February was declared for an April 12 payout of 54 cents per common share. At this rate, the dividend annualizes to $2.16 per share and gives an inflation-beating yield of 7.8%.Covering this high-yield dividend stock for Goldman Sachs, analyst Caitlin Burrows sees a bright future, and writes: “We forecast KRC’s average annual FFOPS growth over 2023E-2025E to equal +0.9%, which is +150 bps better than the Office REIT average of -0.6%. In the current environment, within office REITs, we believe KRC’s mix of high quality and relatively new properties, positive mark-to-markets, and lower leverage position the company well for multiple expansion.”In line with her upbeat stance, Burrows gives KRC shares a Buy rating and a price target of $41 to suggest a potential gain of 48.5% in the next 12 months. Based on the current dividend yield and the expected price appreciation, the stock has ~56% potential total return profile. (To watch Burrows’ track record, click here)Overall, there are 11 recent analyst reviews on file for Kilroy, and their breakdown of 4 Buys and 7 Holds leads to a Moderate Buy consensus rating for the stock. The shares are trading at $27.61 with a $44.18 average price target, for a 60% upside potential in the coming year. (See KRC stock forecast)Simon Property Group (SPG)The next stock Goldman Sachs is betting on is another REIT, Simon Property. This company is mainly a commercial REIT with a portfolio of retail properties skewed heavily toward the shopping mall niche. Simon currently has more than 250 top-end retail properties around the world, including 25 of the top locations in the US for retail. Simon has more than $9 billion invested in development projects, and since 2020, Simon has had an 80% ownership interest in the Taubman Group, another large international retail property owner.Simon can boast a strong occupancy rate for its properties, of 94.9% as of December 31, 2022. This was up 1.5% year-over-year, and reflected increased retail activity post-COVID.The company’s revenues, net income, and FFO also showed increases over the past year. In the last quarter, 4Q22, Simon had revenue of $1.4 billion, up 6% y/y and beating the forecast by 8.5%. Net income attributable to stockholders was $673.8 million, or $2.06 per diluted share, for a 34% y/y increase. Quarterly FFO came in at $1.183 billion, up from $1.17 billion in the prior year. The FFO per diluted share, at $3.15, came in ahead of the $3.13 consensus.For the full year 2022, FFO was reported at $4.45 billion, or $11.87 per diluted share. This represented a 3.8% increase from the $11.44 reported in Q421.While reported results were strong, Simon’s forward guidance was somewhat disappointing. The projected 2023 FFO, in the range of $11.70 to $11.95, was well below the consensus expectation of $12.13.Even though guidance was low, Simon still maintained its reliable, high-yield dividend. The next payment, of $1.80 per common share, is scheduled to go out on March 31. At the annualized rate of $7.20 per common share, the yield is 7%; this is a full point above the current annualized rate of inflation.Among the bulls is Goldman Sachs’ Caitlin Burrows, who believes the company’s ‘large, high-quality portfolio’ of assets isn’t fully reflected in the current share price.“As a result of continued store openings, especially in high quality properties, we expect SPG’s occupancy and rental rates to increase. We believe this strength in fundamentals is not currently appreciated in SPG’s multiple. Further, we believe SPG’s market share of properties (including 94 US malls, 69 US outlets, and an additional roughly 75 properties across Mills, international outlets, and the TRG mall portfolio) and balance sheet allow the company to win an outsized number of leasing deals,” Burrows opined.In Burrows’ view, steady and reliable growth is worth a Buy rating, and her $150 price target indicates her confidence in a 46.5% share appreciation over the course of this year. (To watch Burrows’ track record, click here)Overall, SPG has picked up 11 recent analyst reviews, with a breakdown of 7 Buys and 4 Holds for a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The stock is selling for $102.38, and its average price target of $134.18 implies a 31% one-year gain.

HCA continues to benefit from growing patient admissions, acquisitions and a solid financial position.Zacks Rank &amp; Price PerformanceHCA Healthcare carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at present.The stock has gained 35.9% in the past six months compared with the industry’s 29.4% growth. The Medical sector and the S&amp;P 500 composite index have increased 2.8% and 7.5%, respectively, in the same time frame.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFavorable Style ScoreHCA is well-poised for progress, as evidenced by its impressive VGM Score of A. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum, and the score is a weighted combination of all three factors.Robust Growth ProspectsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for HCA’s 2023 earnings is pegged at $17.16 per share, indicating an improvement of 1.6% from the year-earlier reading, while the same for revenues stands at $62.6 billion, implying a 3.9% increase from the prior-year actual.The consensus mark for 2024 earnings is pegged at $19.24 per share, suggesting 12.1% growth from the 2023 estimate. The same for revenues stands at $65.9 billion, which indicates a rise of 5.3% from the 2023 estimate.Decent Surprise HistoryHCA’s earnings outpaced estimates in two of the trailing four quarters and missed the same twice, the average being 2.28%.Business TailwindsThe top line of HCA Healthcare is aided by improved patient volumes, which is the most significant contributor to a hospital’s revenues. Patient volumes witnessed an uptick due to increased inpatient surgeries as well as diminishing adverse effects of the COVID pandemic resulting in higher outpatient visits. Same-facility equivalent admissions are anticipated to grow in the range of 2-3% in 2023, while revenue per equivalent admissions is estimated to witness around 2% improvement.A series of acquisitions undertaken over the years have expanded HCA’s healthcare portfolio, diversified income streams and bolstered the nationwide presence of the company. The healthcare provider spends a substantial amount on buyouts of hospitals and health-care entities and in 2022, the amount spent was $224 million. HCA operated 182 hospitals and approximately 2,300 ambulatory sites of care at 2022-end.Story continuesHCA Healthcare also extends telehealth services that can be availed within the comfort of one’s home. To address the growing incidence of behavioral health issues among Americans, it has five psychiatric hospitals in place. HCA Healthcare seems prudent to shed off non-core businesses and focus on more profitable units.The healthcare provider boasts sufficient cash reserves and adequate cash-generation abilities that are immensely required to pursue business growth initiatives and deploy capital. As of Dec 31, 2022, cash and cash equivalents stood at $908 million, which is way higher than the short-term debt of $370 million.

It started divesting its life and retirement business, Corebridge Financial, in September.

We believe these operational levers will continue to drive profitability—measured in its combined ratio—while enabling more capital allocation to stockholders. In 2022, solid underwriting quality coupled with a strong pricing environment drove AIG’s profitability to levels not seen since before the global financial crisis, and in the third quarter, AIG divested a portion of Corebridge to free up more capital for aggressive buybacks. AIG’s most recent quarterly results featured strong underwriting results against concerns of catastrophic losses from hurricanes and wildfires, which AIG effectively sidestepped by previously exiting commercial insurance in high-risk areas.

The optimism led by a solid fourth-quarter 2022 performance, along with a few regulatory clearances, is expected to contribute further. However, headwinds due to data security threats and overdependence on diagnostic tests persist.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has lost 22.2% compared with a 39.7% decline of the industry and the S&amp;P 500's 13.9% fall.The renowned rapid diagnostic testing solutions provider has a market capitalization of $5.72 billion. QuidelOrtho projects 11.4% growth for 2024 and expects to maintain its strong performance. The company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and missed the same in the other, the average surprise being 54.3%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Strong Product Portfolio: We are upbeat about QuidelOrtho’s products, which it sells directly to end users and distributors, in each case, for professional as well as individual, non-professional and over-the-counter use. Currently, QuidelOrtho’s diagnostic testing solutions include the Sofia and Sofia 2 Analyzers, QuickVue, and InflammaDry and AdenoPlus products. Some other notable products include the Solana system, and the Savanna multiplex molecular analyzer system and Savanna RVP4 assay.Regulatory Approvals: We are upbeat about a few recent regulatory clearances for QuidelOrtho’s products. This month, the company announced that it had been granted a De Novo request from the FDA, allowing the company to market its new Sofia 2 SARS Antigen+ FIA (fluorescent immunoassay).In December 2022, QuidelOrtho announced that its TriageTrue High-Sensitivity Troponin I Test on the Quidel Triage MeterPro had been approved for use in Canada by Health Canada.Strong Q4 Results: QuidelOrtho’s robust fourth-quarter 2022 results buoy optimism. The company recorded robust overall top-line performance and strong revenues in the majority of its business units at a constant exchange rate, excluding COVID-19 revenues. Excluding COVID-19 revenues, geographical results also improved in two regions. Strong Recurring revenues, which were up including and excluding COVID-19 revenues, and solid Instrument revenues were also seen. QuidelOrtho’s expanded global commercial footprint also raises optimism.Story continuesDownsidesData Security Threats: QuidelOrtho utilizes complex information technology systems to transmit and store information, including proprietary information, to support its business and process. In the future, these systems may prove inadequate to its business needs and necessary upgrades may not operate as designed, resulting in high costs or disruptions in portions of the company’s business.Overdependence on Diagnostic Tests: A significant percentage of QuidelOrtho’s revenues comes from the sale of COVID-19 and influenza tests and these are expected to remain a significant portion of the company’s total revenues for at least in the near future. As a result, if sales or revenues of COVID-19 or influenza tests fall for any reason, the company’s operating results will be affected.Estimate TrendQuidelOrtho is witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for 2023. In the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings has moved 1.9% north to $5.20.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s first-quarter 2023 revenues is pegged at $762.7 million, suggesting a 23.9% decline from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

89,cbbdafe6-ce2a-3286-b527-52becf7a2405,TJX,2023-03-24,7 Defensive Stocks to Buy During This Chaotic Spell,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-defensive-stocks-buy-during-223105438.html,1679351465,STORY,"['TJX', 'APD', 'PGR', 'XOM', 'WEN', 'MRK']","[While it’s always a good idea to balance your portfolio with defensive stocks, the present chaos dramatically incentivizes this subsegment. As you’ve no doubt heard, the U.S. and the rest of the world presently reel from two major banks failing. Moreover, the main concern centers on the contagion spreading to other components of the global economy.What really adds weight to the drama here is of course the Federal Reserve. The central bank must decide how to navigate monetary policy in light of recent developments. If the Fed reacts with a more dovish stance, it would contradict its stated intentions of controlling inflation. However, if it continues with interest rate hikes, this hawkish framework could break more cogs in the flywheel.No matter what, the Fed faces a gargantuan task with serious consequences either way. Basically, it’s caught between a rock and a hard place. With investors deeply (and understandably) concerned, the most-established businesses probably make the most sense. In that spirit, below are the defensive stocks to buy during this chaotic spell.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsPGRProgressive$139.07SAPSAP$121.38MRKMerck$105.85APDAir Products &amp; Chemicals$279.21WENWendy’s$21.05TJXTJX Companies$75.40XOMExxon Mobil$102.45Progressive (PGR)Man holding stacks of money. Millionaire.Source: Epic Cure / ShutterstockAs an insurance stalwart, Progressive (NYSE:PGR) makes for an ideal candidate for defensive stocks to buy. Featuring an established and permanently relevant business, PGR features predictability in the financials and the technicals. Further, the chaos from the coronavirus pandemic – such as heightened traffic incidents and property crime – incentive financial protection programs.Most importantly, Progressive garners the most attention for its auto insurance. Required by the vast majority of states, drivers practically can’t go anywhere (legally) without coverage. Therefore, Progressive cynically benefits from a captive audience.Story continuesTo be fair, the company doesn’t deliver the most remarkably positive financials. However, it does enough to get the job done. For example, Progressive’s three-year revenue growth rate pings at 8.3%, above 59.45% of its peers. As well, the company enjoys a long history of consistent annual profitability. Finally, Wall Street analysts peg PGR as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target comes in at $147, implying nearly 8% upside potential.SAP (SAP)A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.Source: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.comA German multinational software company, SAP (NYSE:SAP) develops enterprise software to manage business operations and customer relations. Further, the company is the world’s leading enterprise resource planning software vendor. Given the size and influence of its business, SAP makes for an ideal choice for defensive stocks to buy. Even with various economic challenges, companies must continue to operate. More often than not, the large players use SAP.While the company features far-from-perfect financials, it offers plenty of substance to chew on. For example, SAP’s Altman Z-Score pings at 4.09, indicating low bankruptcy risk. Operationally, its three-year free cash flow (FCF) growth rate comes in at 21.9%, above 64.74% of the industry. As well, its net margin is 7.4%, ranked better than 70.91% of sector rivals. Also, investors may note that right now, the market prices SAP at a forward multiple of 20.41. As a discount to earnings, SAP ranks better than 60.98% of the field.Lastly, covering analysts peg SAP as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $137, implying 15% upside potential.Merck (MRK)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar billsSource: shutterstock.com/CC7A multinational pharmaceutical giant, Merck (NYSE:MRK) makes for an intriguing case for defensive stocks to buy. Basically, no matter what happens with the global markets, people will need access to therapeutics and vaccines. While MRK incurred a volatile ride in the year so far, in the past 365 days, it gained almost 32% of equity value. Better yet, there may still be extra room in the tank.Overall, Merck enjoys a solid fiscal profile. Notably, its Altman Z-Score comes in at 4.49, which indicates low bankruptcy risk. Operationally, the company posts a three-year revenue growth rate of 15.4%, above nearly 75% of the drug manufacturing industry. Also, its book growth rate during the same period is 21.1%, well above average. On the bottom line, Merck’s net margin pings at 24.49%. This stat helps undergird the company’s forward yield of 2.8%, noticeably above the healthcare sector’s average yield of 1.58%.In closing, analysts peg MRK as a consensus moderate buy. Further, their average price target stands at $119.95, implying over 15% upside potential.Air Products and Chemicals (APD)tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comAn industrial player, Air Products and Chemicals (NYSE:APD) specializes in selling gases and chemicals for industrial uses. Fundamentally, APD makes for a solid case for defensive stocks to buy because of its “backstage” utility. While Air Products may not be a Broadway star so to speak, its services undergird various applications. Without the company, infrastructural networks could fail.In fairness, APD went volatile this year, shedding over 10% since the January opener. However, in the trailing one-year period, APD gained almost 19% of its equity value. On the financial front, Air Products delivers the goods. Its three-year revenue growth rate pings at 12.3%, ranking better than 67.43% of the competition. Also, it’s a stable business, as its Altman Z-Score of 4.44 indicates. On the bottom line, Air Products features a net margin of 17.61%, above 86.52% of sector players. Also, these robust earnings support the company’s forward yield of 2.55%.Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg APD as a consensus moderate buy. Moreover, their average price target stands at $324.67, implying over 18% upside potential.Wendy’s (WEN)Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words ""buy"" and ""sell"" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image.Source: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.comA popular fast-food chain, Wendy’s (NASDAQ:WEN) makes a compelling case as one of the defensive stocks to buy. Though it’s tied to the consumer discretionary sector, Wendy’s benefits from the trade-down effect. Essentially, as economic conditions worsen, consumers will eschew fine-dining establishments for cheaper fare like Wendy’s. That’s one positive catalyst.The other tailwind centers on social normalization. As white-collar employees return to the office, Wendy’s coffee and breakfast menu could be appealing to worker bees. In addition, Wendy’s offerings would compete effectively on price with premium-label coffee shops.Generally speaking, WEN represents one of the defensive stocks to buy that features just enough positives. For instance, the underlying company’s three-year revenue growth rate stands at 10.1%, above 84.45% of the competition. On the bottom line, its net margin comes in at 8.46%, boxing out 83.33% of sector players. Plus, Gurufocus’ proprietary calculations for fair market value (FMV) indicate WEN is undervalued. Looking to the Street, covering analysts peg WEN as a consensus hold. However, their average price target stands at $24.78, implying over 20% upside potential.TJX Companies (TJX)picture of a man circling buy on a stock chartSource: ImageFlow/ShutterStock.comFor those that don’t mind adding a little risk to their defensive stocks to buy in exchange for greater reward potential, TJX Companies (NYSE:TJX) brings plenty to think about. A multinational off-price department store, TJX largely offers a relevant business profile. However, the disruption of the Covid-19 pandemic clouded the narrative. With workers operating remotely, a wardrobe upgrade wasn’t really necessary.However, TJX may enjoy two powerful upside catalysts. First, as stated above, the normalization of society should incentive an apparel upgrade. Second, should the economy weaken, off-price department stores will look much more attractive. Demand may rise, making TJX one of the top defensive stocks to buy.Also, the company features several compelling fiscal attributes. Its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 7.6%, above 64.25% of the (cyclical) retail industry. On the bottom line, its net margin pings at 7%, above 75.61% of sector players. Likely to catch people off guard, analysts peg TJX as a unanimous strong buy. What’s more, their average price target stands at $90.73, implying nearly 22% upside potential.Exxon Mobil (XOM)image of businessperson and bar graph with dollar signs to represent undervalued stocksSource: Wright Studio/Shutterstock.comDespite the political and ideological winds favoring renewable energy infrastructures, hydrocarbon specialists will likely remain relevant for years. That’s good news then for Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), one of the top defensive stocks to buy. While energy prices may suffer from rising interest rates, it’s also possible they could rise on geopolitical catalysts.Obviously, the big one centers on China. With its economic reopening, a gradual increase in commercial activity should accelerate resource consumption. Cynically, that’s a tailwind for XOM stock. Also, the aforementioned social normalization trend should see traffic volume on U.S. roadways rise. If so, this framework may spark inflation in the energy arena.After struggling during the early phase of the Covid-19 disaster, Exxon Mobil looks quite attractive financially. For example, its three-year revenue growth rate of 15.9% ranks above 70.88% of the oil and gas industry. Further, its net margin of nearly 14% beats out almost 66% of its rivals. Finally, Wall Street analysts peg XOM as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $128.17, implying over 28% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

90,138c931e-0841-3add-bfbc-dd093454e167,NEM,2023-03-24,7 Gold Stocks to Buy Amid Heightened Market Fears,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-gold-stocks-buy-amid-184919154.html,1679338159,STORY,"['HG=F', 'GC=F', 'SI=F', 'NEM', 'FNV', 'GOLD', 'RGLD', 'WPM']","[With market anxieties rising to the forefront, investors inherently seek protection, which bodes well for gold stocks to buy. To be fair, the yellow metal historically garnered criticism because, at the end of the day, it’s just a commodity. Gold doesn’t hire workers, it doesn’t generate earnings and most importantly, it has a yield (passive income) of 0%. What good is that during these difficult times?Well, with fears of a banking contagion spreading to other components of the global economy, investors shouldn’t be quick to dismiss gold stocks to buy. Underlining this specific mining sector is an asset that offers intrinsic value. Basically, no matter where you go, gold will command often great value. As well, gold obviously carries physical mass – it’s not going to disappear arbitrarily. Finally, mining enterprises offer a significant convenience over lugging around bullion bricks. With that in mind, below are the gold stocks to buy amid heightened market fears.WPMWheaton Precious Metals$46.15RGLDRoyal Gold$126.22FNVFranco-Nevada$145.11NEMNewmont Corp.$47.94GOLDBarrick Gold$18.29CGAUCenterra Gold$6.37SBSWSibanye Stillwater$8.43InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWheaton Precious Metals (WPM)An image of a rising bar graph on top of gold bars, representing gold stocksSource: Alexander Limbach / ShutterstockA Canadian multinational firm, Wheaton Precious Metals (NYSE:WPM) represents a precious metals streaming company. Per its public profile, Wheaton produces over 26 million ounces and sells over 29 million ounces of silver mined by other companies as a by-product of their main operations. Of course, it also commands a significant presence in the gold production market.What investors of gold stocks to buy will appreciate about WPM centers on operational predictability. With streaming, participants understand the costs associated with streaming contracts upfront, limiting variability. Specifically, Wheaton enjoys a three-year EBITDA growth rate of 34.2%. As well, its net margin is 63.19%. Both stats, particularly the latter, rank in the top half of the underlying industry.Story continuesIn terms of passive income, Wheaton isn’t the most generous with a forward yield of 1.32%. However, it does pay one with a low payout ratio of 44.53%, facilitating confidence in yield sustainability. Finally, Wall Street analysts peg WPM as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target comes in at $47.97, implying 6% upside potential.Royal Gold (RGLD)An image of multiple gold barsSource: ShutterstockAnother company that specializes in the streaming business model, Royal Gold (NASDAQ:RGLD) also commands a royalty business. Per its public profile, Royal Gold owns a large portfolio of producing, development, evaluation, and exploration stage streams and royalties on properties located in some of the world’s most prolific gold regions.As with Wheaton Precious Metals, Royal Gold benefits from greater predictability compared to pure-play gold stocks to buy. With parties signing contracts with terms disclosed ahead of time, RGLD provides at least a modicum of confidence for investors. Specifically, Royal’s three-year revenue growth rate comes in at 12.5%, outpacing 63.35% of the competition. Also, its book growth rate during the same period is 8.6%, an above-average figure.Now, Royal doesn’t provide the greatest forward yield at 1.2%. However, the company carries 21 years of consecutive annual dividend increases. Lastly, covering analysts peg RGLD as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target is $134.67, implying upside potential of over 7%.Franco-Nevada (FNV)A photo of a gold nugget on a table, being picked up by tweezers, with more gold behind it.Source: aerogondo2 / Shutterstock.comBased in Toronto, Ontario, Franco-Nevada (NYSE:FNV) is another Canada-based gold royalty and streaming firm. While many securities stumbled during the banking sector fallout, FNV (and other gold stocks to buy) performed remarkably well. For instance, in the trailing week, FNV gained over 5% of equity value. And while it’s down in the trailing year, FNV’s recent performance could reverse the losses.Again, similar to the top two gold stocks to buy, Franco-Nevada benefits from predictability in its business. Better yet, it’s paying off. For example, the company’s three-year revenue growth rate is 16.2%, above 82.76% of the industry. Also, its EBITDA growth rate during the same period is 18.5%, beating out 78.1% of sector players. Plus, the company’s net margin is 53.21%, which ranks extremely high. Unfortunately, the forward yield here is only 0.95%. I suppose it’s better than nothing.On a closing note, covering analysts peg FNV as a consensus moderate buy. Moreover, their average price target comes in at $160.58, implying 12% upside potential.Newmont (NEM)A gold bar along with some coins made of precious metals. gold stocksSource: allstars / Shutterstock.comBased in Greenwood Village, Colorado, Newmont (NYSE:NEM) owns the distinction of being the world’s largest gold-mining corporation. As with the other gold stocks to buy, life has been good for Newmont while other investment categories suffered. In the trailing week, NEM gained nearly 11%, an excellent figure, especially for such a large enterprise. While it’s down sharply in the past 365 days, it could be interesting days ahead for Newmont.Financially, the company brings a mixture of financial metrics, some good, some not so good. For the bad news, Newmont struggled throughout the new normal, leading to a negative three-year EBITDA growth rate. However, on the positive side, Newmont features an operating margin of 13.47%, outpacing 69% of the field.Another reason to consider NEM as one of the gold stocks to buy centers on the underlying passive income. Presently, Newmont’s forward yield is 3.32%, which ranks above the materials sector’s average yield of 2.82%. In closing, Wall Street analysts peg NEM as a consensus moderate buy. Further, their average price target stands at $54.70, implying almost 14% upside potential.Barrick Gold (GOLD)A photo of three gold barsSource: iStockA mining company that produces gold and copper, Barrick Gold (NYSE:GOLD) features 16 operating sites in 13 countries. Because of its commodities portfolio, Barrick offers flexibility among gold stocks to buy. Those primarily concerned about the banking sector fallout can bid up GOLD shares. On the other hand, copper production bodes well for compelling sectors such as electric vehicles.Carrying a similar profile to Newmont, Barrick financially offers a mixed bag. Again, the company suffered during the post-coronavirus new normal, leading to a negative entry for its three-year EBITDA growth rate. On the other hand, investors of gold stocks to buy will likely appreciate Barrick’s operating margin of 27.25%. This metric outpaces 85% of the competition. Interestingly, Barrick features a decent forward yield at 2.21%. Also, its payout ratio sits at 39.44%. Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg GOLD as a consensus moderate buy. In addition, their average price target stands at $21.74, implying 20% upside potential.Centerra Gold (CGAU)Gold nuggets on top of American paper money representing gold stocksSource: ShutterstockA Canadian mining enterprise, Centerra Gold (NYSE:CGAU) owns and operates the Mount Milligan copper-gold mine in British Columbia, Canada, and the Öksüt gold mine in Turkey. Given the enthusiasm for gold stocks to buy, CGAU handsomely benefitted. In the past week, it gained nearly 3%. For the year so far, it managed to swing up almost 19%.In fairness, in the past 365 days, CGAU dropped 34%, making it a high-risk proposition. Still, contrarian investors may want to consider giving shares a twirl with speculation-earmarked funds. Most notably, Centerra enjoys a solid balance sheet. In particular, its debt-to-EBITDA is 0.25 times, well below the sector median of 1.53 times.Further, Centerra appears undervalued. Presently, the market prices CGAU at a trailing book multiple of 0.77. As a discount to book value, the company ranks better than 80% of the competition. Looking to the Street, covering analysts peg Centerra shares as a consensus moderate buy. Moreover, their average price target stands at $7.75, implying nearly 22% upside potential.Sibanye Stillwater (SBSW)Closeup of a large gold nugget. stocks under $10Source: ShutterstockBased in resource-rich South Africa, Sibanye Stillwater (NYSE:SBSW) arguably commands the greatest upside potential among gold stocks to buy here. However, it’s also one of the riskiest enterprises that you can engage in, meaning investors should take necessary precautions. With Sibanye, it’s not just about the volatility of the underlying assets that pose problems. Increasingly, issues such as labor strikes impede progress.As evidence, look no further than SBSW’s trailing one-year loss of 53% of equity value. Compounding matters is that on a year-to-date basis, Sibanye dropped almost 24%. To pour salt on open wounds, investment resource Gurufocus warns its readers that the gold miner could be a possible value trap. On the other end, the company’s three-year revenue growth rate is 20%, above 79.19% of the industry. Also, its net margin comes in at 13.3%, beating out 76% of its peers. Finally, Wall Street analysts peg SBSW as a consensus moderate buy. As well, their average price target stands at $12.28, implying over 48% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Belgium’s Loena Hendrickx took bronze, edging 16-year-old American Isabeau Levito for a medal by 2.77 points.Sakamoto is the oldest women’s singles world champion since Mao Asada (2014), who is now the only Japanese skater with more world titles than Sakamoto.She appeared en route to a runaway victory until singling a planned triple flip late in her free skate, which put the victory in doubt. She can be thankful for a 5.62-point lead from Wednesday’s short program.Lee, who had the top free skate, became the second South Korean to win a world medal in any discipline after six-time medalist Yuna Kim.Hendrickx followed her silver from last year, when she became the first Belgian women’s singles skater to win a world medal.FIGURE SKATING WORLDS: Results | Broadcast ScheduleLevito, last year’s world junior champion, had a chance to become the youngest world medalist since 2014. After a solid short program, she fell on her opening triple Lutz in the free skate and left points on the table by performing two jump combinations rather than three.Levito entered worlds ranked fourth in the field by best score this season. She matched the best finish for a U.S. woman in her senior global championships debut (Olympics and world) since Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan took silver and bronze at the 1991 Worlds. Sasha Cohen, to whom Levito is often compared, also placed fourth in her Olympic and worlds debuts in 2002.American Amber Glenn was 12th in her worlds debut. Two-time U.S. champion Bradie Tennell was 15th.

He says Latin America’s largest producer should keep increasing fossil fuel output for decades to come.Most Read from BloombergDeutsche Bank Drops in Selloff Citi Describes as Irrational‘Zoom Towns’ Exploded in the Work-From-Home Era. Now New Residents Are Facing LayoffsRussia Seeks 400,000 More Recruits as Latest Ukraine Push StallsJack Dorsey’s Wealth Tumbles $526 Million After Hindenburg Short“We will get market share,” Prates, chief executive officer of Petrobras, said in an interview in Rio de Janeiro. “We may be the last to produce oil in the world.”His assertion of Brazil’s ambition echoes the policy of other oil exporters like Saudi Arabia, who argue that investing in fossil-fuel expansion is compatible with a global ambition to reach net zero carbon emissions. Many, including the International Energy Agency, disagree, claiming there’s no room for anyone to target increased crude output if the world is going to reach its climate goals.The world has found itself in a tight place as limited fossil fuel supply amid a lack of investment sparked a global energy crisis that raised consumer bills and worsened global inflation. Even leaders who position themselves as fighters against climate change such as US President Joe Biden have called for increases in oil output to help tame rising costs.Over the last 20 years, Brazil has emerged as a major oil producer, diverging from many of its Latin American peers. Drillers have exploited giant offshore oil fields, known as pre-salt, because the crude is trapped under a geological layer of salt. Petrobras operates most of those fields with international companies such as Shell Plc holding minority stakes.Appointed by President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva at the start of his third term earlier this year, Prates said that the oil production will remain the top priority. Investment in wind power and other renewable technologies at Petroleo Brasileiro SA, as the company is formally known, will be modest in comparison.Story continuesPrates’ comments may ease concerns among some minority investors that the new administration would prioritize non-core investment projects over the oil and gas business.While Lula has championed the fight against climate change, pledging to slow deforestation in the Amazon, he’s also been a supporter of Brazil’s oil industry. The boom in production provided growing tax revenue during Lula’s first two terms, helping to finance his ambitious social spending.Brazil’s output is set to reach a record 3.4 million barrels a day this year and will keep growing until 2030. After that, the country will need new discoveries to maintain and grow production.“We came out very late to this game as a big producer, but we have to keep the ball rolling,” said Prates, 54, who was a senator in Lula’s Workers’ Party before his appointment.He said the priority will be exploiting existing finds in the pre-salt areas and finding fresh ones, while looking to open up new basins in other parts of Brazil, including the so-called equatorial margin in the far north of the country. That region has similar geology as areas off nearby Guyana, where Exxon Mobil Corp. has found billions of barrels.Petrobras is ready to start exploration drilling in the region, but is awaiting approval from regulators. The area is host to ecosystems considered unique, which has made it a controversial location for drilling and drawn concern from Brazil’s environment minister, Marina Silva.“The state of Brazil will have to decide if that goes on or not,” Prates said. “All we are trying to do is to find oil.” If Petrobras gets the go-ahead, drilling could start on an exploration well as soon as April, he said.Petrobras will look at investments in offshore wind because the company has experience executing big projects in Brazil’s Atlantic Ocean. It’s exploring partnerships with European oil majors, including Norway’s Equinor, he said.“This is an environment we already know, and we have in Brazil undoubtedly the best environment for investment in offshore wind in the world because the climate is favorable,” he said. The rest of the Petrobras push into the energy transition will involve two areas where it already has expertise: carbon capture and biofuels.Prates said Petrobras — which paid a record dividend last year, driven by higher oil prices and a wide-ranging divestment program — should strike a better balance between channeling cash to shareholders, including the Brazilian state, and investment.“We should have a more balanced view of that, without neglecting the big attractiveness of having big dividends,” he said.--With assistance from Daniel Carvalho.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekWhat Happens When Sexting Chatbots Dump Their Human LoversHow to Keep Corporate Accounts Safe Amid Bank Collapse JittersIranian Activists Want Tech Companies to Ban the AyatollahChatGPT Advances Are Moving So Fast Regulators Can’t Keep UpA Visual Guide to How America Uses Freight Trains©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

According to the research firm, Rystad, spending on offshore oil investments exceeded $100 billion in 2022 for the first time in a decade, and will do so again in 2023 and 2024. Norway, the Scandinavian country that has positioned itself as a climate leader, is driving some of this boom. Norway is spending $21.4 billion on oil projects this year, an increase of 22% from the previous year.Norway’s investment in offshore oil is among the highest in the world this year, according to Rystad. It lands behind the $33 billion that will be spent on offshore projects in the Middle East, but ahead of countries like the US, which is putting $17 billion in offshore investments, and the UK with $7 billion.Read moreChatGPT is getting more nuancedChina is changing its tune on the mRNA vaccineA fresh idea for gathering remote and hybrid employees togetherOffshore projects are designed to pump oil for decades; investments that begin this year could continue to churn out oil well into the 2050s.Norway’s good deeds were always funded by oil and gasNorway’s fuzzy commitments to easing climate change feel like solutions to a problem that is, in no small part, of its own making. Norway is one of the world’s top exporters of oil. Since the 1990s, the country has funneled its oil revenues into the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund—which, with $1.4 trillion in assets, is now the world’s largest.The fund is among the biggest investors in the world, and it uses its considerable financial influence to advance its values. In recent years, it has dropped or put under close observation Thai, Israeli, Polish, Chinese and Indian companies over human rights abuses, and has wielded its power to bend companies toward net-zero goals.Some of the pro-climate positions that Norway has taken includes demanding transparency from Exxon to prevent the kind of corporate lobbying that leads to bad climate policies. Norway has also pushed Chevron to commit to taking responsibility for “Scope 3"" emissions—the broadest definition of the pollution that any company produces. This would include lowering customers’ emissions (as well as Chevron’s own), for example, by reducing the carbon intensity of its fossil fuel products.Story continuesIn 2022, Norway announced its goal to have every company in its portfolio reach net-zero emissions by 2050 and followed that up by voting against 61 directors at 18 companies for not doing enough to mitigate climate risk. This February, Norway said that it will continue to use its votes to push out directors and board members who fall short of climate goals.Norway is trying to put policy where its money isBut high oil prices are also inspiring other priorities, and Norway is joining a trend among flush oil companies and countries to refocus on fossil fuel extraction, sometimes at the expense of renewables.Norway has backed its refreshed interest in fossil fuel extraction with international policy. In the IPCC’s mammoth climate report released on March 20, Norway negotiated for wiggle room for its oil and gas investments, watering down language about limiting human-caused climate change from “deep, rapid and sustained” reductions, to “strong” emissions reductions—an imprecise word that accommodates its backtracking on North Sea projects More from QuartzThe split of the African plate could gift six landlocked countries a coastlineHow Credit Suisse’s demise strengthens Switzerland’s place in global financeSign up for Quartz's Newsletter.

Although crude began Friday trade with a loss, it was modestly up at the time of writing.West Texas Intermediate had recovered to top $70 per barrel at the time of writing and it was set for a weekly gain of more than 4%. On a monthly basis, however, WTI has lost about $3 per barrel.Brent crude also looked set to end the week with an overall gain: the benchmark started the week at around $70 per barrel and has since climbed to over $76 per barrel, although Brent remains much lower than it was a month ago, at over $82 per barrel.The main upward force in oil markets remains the expectation of returning Chinese demand, although most analysts believe the oil market won’t tighten until the second half of the year. A growing consensus that fears of a banking crisis were overblown and last week’s selloff was largely speculative has further helped oil markets recover. Finally, rumors that the Fed may end its string of interest rate hikes soon have provided some hope to markets.The recent slew of bearish catalysts for oil prices includes the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s latest weekly report, which estimated another inventory build, the Fed’s interest rate hike, and Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm’s statement on Thursday that the federal government will take its time with refilling the strategic petroleum reserve.It could take years to refill the SPR, Granholm said yesterday, dampening hopes for a demand spike from the refill effort, even though crude is currently trading close to the range set by the Energy Department for the start of the refill push.Last year, the federal government sold more than 220 million barrels of crude from the SPR to lower retail fuel prices. This took the SPR to the lowest level in 40 years, at around 372 million barrels. The administration’s refill plans are seen as bullish for oil prices and tricky for the administration itself because of that.Story continuesRecession fears in the U.S., meanwhile, remain high, adding pressure to oil prices, which seem set for their sharpest quarterly drop since 2020.

India’s transition from traditional gasoline and diesel-fueled transport is expected to lag other regions, whereas China’s adoption of electric vehicles is skyrocketing.While India is unlikely to replicate the mammoth scale of China’s expansive oil network — the nation’s daily crude consumption is triple that of its neighbor — traders and producers looking to tap into diminishing global demand growth will be betting on the South Asian nation into the next decade.“India was always going to exceed China in a matter of time in terms of being the global demand growth driver, mainly due to demographic factors like population growth,” said Parsley Ong, the head of Asia energy and chemicals research at JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. in Hong Kong.China’s economic awakening at the start of the century transformed the nation into a powerhouse consumer of commodities from crude to metals and grains, providing a boost to resource-rich countries across the world. For oil, the end of the boom times is approaching, with top refiner China National Petroleum Corp. recently calling a peak to Chinese oil consumption around 2030.The change of demand growth leader appears even closer.China’s ‘Last Hurrah’Industry veteran Ed Morse, the head of commodities research at Citigroup Inc., says China’s rebound from years of Covid restrictions will likely be the nation’s “last hurrah” for demand. Viktor Katona, the lead crude analyst at data intelligence firm Kpler, reckons India’s growth will surpass China from 2026. He also expects Indian oil demand to peak much later in 2036.Story continues“China’s role as a global oil demand growth engine is fading fast,” said Emma Richards, a senior analyst at Fitch Solutions Ltd. in London. Over the next decade, China’s share of total emerging market oil demand growth will slip to 15%, from almost 50%, while India’s share will double to 24%, she said.India is already playing a more prominent role in the oil market following the invasion of Ukraine more than a year ago. The South Asian nation has become a major consumer of Russian crude, turning the OPEC+ producer’s oil into fuels that are often shipped to other regions such as Europe and the US.It’s not the first time India has been talked about as the new center of oil demand growth, with similar predictions made in the middle of the last decade. Should it materialize this time, the transition to the top spot will likely be far from smooth and bogged down by bureaucracy.State-run refiners have been slow at modernizing their operations, and still rigidly follow the old and cumbersome process of issuing tenders for spot purchases of oil, rather than taking a more agile and flexible approach of negotiating and signing deals directly with counter-parties.Still, India’s fast-growing crude appetite will position the South Asian nation as an attractive opportunity for overseas traders and producers over the longer term, said Vandana Hari, the founder of Vanda Insights in Singapore.EV BoomIndia has lofty ambitions to transition its industries including transport to greener energy options, but the nation is lagging other major nations, meaning its reliance on fossil fuels is likely to endure for much longer.In contrast, China’s adoption of electric vehicles has been fast, an ominous sign for long-term gasoline demand in the world’s biggest car market. EV sales in China nearly doubled to 6.1 million units in 2022, compared with 48,000 vehicles for India, according to BloombergNEF.

Gas flares from the field light the night sky bright orange, spewing acrid smoke; when the wind picks up, the 40-year old’s clothes are coated black.For Iraq’s poorest, evidence of the country's monumental oil wealth is inescapable. So is the knowledge that very little of it trickles down to them.Jasim’s savings were depleted when he was diagnosed with cancer last year, a disease he is convinced was caused by the toxic plumes. Twenty years since the U.S.-led invasion toppled Saddam Hussein and remade Iraq’s political order with the promise of democracy and freedom, he has one wish: To find a way to leave.“There is no future here for my children,” he said.Basra province, which boasts most of Iraq’s oil reserves, is symbolic of the deep disparities that have endured since the 2003 invasion. Basra continually bewilders experts, envoys and residents: How can a relatively stable province so rich in resources rank among the poorest and most under-developed in the country?“Of course, I blame the corrupt Iraqi government,” said Jasim, a policeman, echoing a widespread view in the region. “But I blame the Americans too. They replaced our leaders with thieves.”Local leaders in Basra talk of the oil reserves as both a blessing and a curse. They say resources bring affluence but have also given rise to vicious competition between political elites and armed groups at the expense of the Iraqi people.The power-sharing system in place since 2003, which divides the state and its institutions along ethnic and sectarian lines, sucks oil wealth into a pool of corruption and patronage. The higher the oil price, the more entrenched this system becomes as sectarian-based parties claim lucrative ministry portfolios, appoint loyalists in key positions and dole out public jobs to ensure support. According to the International Monetary Fund, public sector employment tripled from 2004 to 2013, but service delivery in health, education and power sectors remained inadequate.Story continuesThe result is that elections keep establishment parties in power. Voter turnout has dropped to record lows.Apart from institutional failures, air pollution is extensive in Basra, and salinity levels arising from a severe fresh water crisis are leading causes of illness, according to local researchers. Unemployment is rampant, with more than half the population below the age of 25.Public anger gave rise to violent protests in 2018, the precursor to mass anti-government protests in the capital a year later. But a swift crackdown by security forces and assassinations by armed groups have created a climate of fear.“The killings silenced many activists,” said Basra activist Ammar Sarhan. “Business continues as usual.”The 2003 toppling of Saddam propelled the oil-rich country into the global economy, opening the doors to foreign investment. In pre-invasion planning, U.S. advisors and their Iraqi opposition allies in exile had envisioned a shock system of reforms that would revamp Iraq’s oil industry and fund post-war reconstruction.Instead, violence hobbled oil production for years. A charm offensive by then-Oil Minister Hussein al-Shahrestani paved the way for major oil contracts to be awarded in 2007 and 2009. Today exports reach over 3 million barrels a day, double the rate in the early 2000s. The state budget, which in 2021 reached up to $90 billion, is financed almost entirely by oil revenues. Still, the government fails to deliver essential services, including water and electricity.In Basra, conditions rank amongst the worst in the country. Unemployment stands at 21%, above the national average of 16% according to a 2022 study by the International Labor Organization. Statistics for poverty rates vary from 10-20% according to various studies and local economists. Meanwhile, the province boasts around 70% of the country's oil production capacity.The road leading to Jasim’s humble home is rocky and unpaved.In 2003, he was a young man bewitched by the Bush administration’s rhetoric of building a democratic Iraq, he said. “We were full of hope,” he recalled. Twenty years on, he is middle-aged, tired of rampant government corruption and recovering from cancer.The loan he had taken out to build a home was used up to pay for $30,000 in private medical bills. Basra’s decrepit public hospitals were overwhelmed and unable to provide treatment, he said.His is a common story in Nahran Omar, a village of fewer than 2,000 people adjacent to a state-run oil field where cancer rates are disproportionately high. Every family here has a story of illness and debt, said Bashir Jabir, the mayor.“After 2003, more and more oil was exported, and we expected to benefit from this,” he said. “Instead, it hurt us.”The government long played down the link between cancer rates in the south and oil production activity, saying cases are only marginally higher than the rest of the country. This changed in 2022, when then-Environment Minister Jassim al-Falahi acknowledged that pollution from the fields was the main reason for the rise in sickness.Nahran Omar highlights a tragic irony: The natural gas burned from the oil fields, if captured, could solve Iraq’s perennial electricity shortages and reduce pollution. But securing investment to do this has been set back by protracted contract negotiations, a common headache for most major foreign investors.The entry of foreign investors also exacerbated competition between tribes, said Sheikh Muhammed al-Zaidawi, who leads an assembly of southern tribal elders. Tribes, which often wield more influence than government institutions in the south, pressure foreign companies for jobs, compensation, training for youth and development of their villages.“Most of the problems between tribes today are caused by the presence of oil companies,” he said, “All of them want to benefit.” Tribal disputes often turn into deadly gun battles.Reliance on the oil industry has stifled private sector development. Nearly every prime minister since the invasion has repeated calls to diversify the economy and boost incentives for Iraqi businesses.Nidhal Musa is one success story.She grew up in a poor suburb of Basra city and was 35 when the U.S. invaded Iraq. She spent subsequent years taking care of her sick and disabled husband. Desperate to earn money, she began sewing clothes to sell in the local market.By 2013, she had gathered a group of women just like herself, beleaguered and in need of money to support their families. She pooled together enough funds to open a garment factory and became known for employing the poor.But not everyone welcomed her success.In 2022, Musa received a slew of death threats. “Be very careful,” one message read. She believes she is being targeted because she refused to use her local fame to back a powerful political party that asked her to promote their campaign in 2021 elections.“They try to keep us weak,” she said. “They know perfectly well, if the people are hungry, they will be preoccupied only by their hunger.”]"

The move brewed concerns over a further deterioration in U.S.-Iran relations, which in turn could disrupt crude supply from the Middle East.Brent oil futures were flat at $75.92 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate crude futures rose 0.1% to $70.00 a barrel by 02:24 ET (06:24 GMT). Both contracts had fallen as much as 0.5% each earlier in the session.Oil prices fell on Thursday after the U.S. downplayed plans to immediately refill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR), with U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm stating that it could take years for the government to refill the SPR.Her comments implied lesser buying action in oil markets over the near-term, and also offset prior signals from the Biden administration that it would begin replenishing the SPR if prices were consistently around $67 to $72 a barrel.Sales by the Biden administration had pushed the SPR to a near 50-year low in 2022. The government is also set to release an additional 26 million barrels from the reserve as part of a congressional mandate.Still, oil prices were set to rise between 3% and 5% this week, as they recovered from a recent tumble to 15-month lows. The collapse of several U.S. banks earlier this month pushed up concerns over an economic slowdown this year, which fed into fears that weak economic growth will dent crude demand.Concerns over a banking crisis were still in play, while a middling economic outlook from the Federal Reserve also dented markets.Uncertainty over a production cut by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies (OPEC+) also weighed on crude markets, after a Reuters report suggested that the cartel will keep production unchanged during a meeting in early-April.Story continuesRelated ArticlesOil pares losses as Middle East tensions rise after U.S. air strikeOil prices dip as U.S. holds off on restocking strategic reserveGold pinned near $2,000, overtakes dollar as premier safe haven]"

Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$3.70bUS$4.13bUS$4.31bUS$4.59bUS$4.74bUS$4.88bUS$5.00bUS$5.12bUS$5.24bUS$5.36bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x8Analyst x9Analyst x7Analyst x3Analyst x2Est @ 2.79%Est @ 2.58%Est @ 2.43%Est @ 2.32%Est @ 2.24% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.2% US$3.5kUS$3.6kUS$3.5kUS$3.5kUS$3.3kUS$3.2kUS$3.1kUS$2.9kUS$2.8kUS$2.7k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$32bWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.2%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$5.4b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (7.2%– 2.1%) = US$106bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$106b÷ ( 1 + 7.2%)10= US$53bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$85b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$220, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 29% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at General Dynamics as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.871. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for General DynamicsStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Aerospace &amp; Defense market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

Available to students of NRG employees, the scholarship honors Howard E. Cosgrove, NRG's first Chairman of the Board and dedicated champion of education.2022 scholarship winners:Darshan Lakshimarayanan, Physics at Rutgers UniversitySala Tran-Huu, Computer Science at the University of HoustonIn addition to awarding this year's winners, we followed up with several past recipients to hear how the award has impacted their lives.We also learned where former recipients are on their journeys.Zenetta HinojosaThe University of Texas at San AntonioBS in Psychology with Neuroscience / Biology MinorsGraduation Year: 2025Tell us a little about yourselfI'm originally from Corpus Christi, Texas. My favorite things to do when I have free time include painting, reading, and finding ways to make a better cup of chai tea.Tell us about your current career ambitions and/or accomplishmentsAfter I graduate from UTSA, I hope to gain admission into a Clinical Psychology Ph.D. program. My future goal is to have my own research lab at a university and a private practice. To foster these ambitions, I have joined two psychology labs at UTSA focusing on identity development in minority populations. Last summer, I had the opportunity to conduct behavioral neuroscience research at The University of Pennsylvania in the Laboratory for Cognition and Neural Stimulation.How has receiving the Chairman's Scholarship positively impacted you?The NRG Chairman's Scholarship has granted me mobility in not only my educational ambitions but also my educational curiosities. Often, people are hesitant to explore their dreams fearing failure and the implications these fears could have on moving forward. Although this scholarship is a source of assistance, the faith and reassurance it instills is a continuous source of support. I am now a better student, but more importantly, a stronger learner.Story continuesWhat advice do you have for those considering applying for the scholarship?For students applying for the scholarship, show that you have aspirations above being successful. How are your unique talents going to help people? Education is our unlimited potential. Remember that your work is valuable.How do you empower others to make progress in their journeys?As human beings, one of our greatest attributes is gratitude. Whenever I feel lost or overwhelmed, I write a list of things, large or small, that I can appreciate. If someone around me feels stuck, the first thing I recommend is to try encouraging or serving someone else. We often forget how much we inspire each other and how vital positivity can be on our journeys. In times of regret, intimidation, or worry, serving others is a safe haven.Sam DietrichHarvey Mudd CollegeBS Engineering with Electrical / Computer Engineering focusGraduation Year: 2017Tell us a little about yourselfI am from Houston, Texas, and recently moved to the Seattle area. I have a one-year-old son who loves to hike (when it isn't raining).Tell us about your current career ambitions and/or accomplishmentsAfter graduating, I spent four years in Los Angeles building hardware and software for experimental satellites and terrestrial research systems. I am currently at Microsoft developing programmable hardware accelerators for Azure. I hope to further develop my skills on both sides of the hardware/software divide.How has receiving the Chairman's Scholarship positively impacted you?The scholarship enabled me to attend my first-choice school, where I discovered my passion and found great professors and opportunities. It made the potentially hard decision of choosing a post-secondary school much easier.What advice do you have for those considering applying for the scholarship?It is hard to find the motivation to submit more applications on top of college applications, and I was hesitant to apply for some scholarships because the acceptance rates seemed low. The right scholarship is worth much more than the time spent applying. Don't filter yourself out of selection before it has even begun by not applying. Leave it up to the scholarship committee to determine if you are a good fit.How do you empower others to be innovative?Listening is the best way to empower people around you. Letting someone explain their ideas to you and asking meaningful questions helps their ideas fully develop. You often hear a new perspective you hadn't considered before that will broaden your horizons and become a tool for your own innovations.Bethany HoltzGettysburg College (BS), Saint Joseph's University (MS)BS and MS in BiologyGraduation Years: 2016, 2022Tell us a little about yourselfI'm from Medford Lakes, NJ, where I've lived my whole life. I love my hometown nestled in NJ's Pinelands. In fact, I ran (unsuccessfully) for a seat on the Borough Council. Growing up in a town filled with lakes helped develop my love for nature and water. In high school, I engaged in various environmental science activities like Envirothon and Science Olympiad. In college, I pursued a degree in Environmental Science and Art Studio. A winter break spent volunteering at Adventure Aquarium in Camden, NJ, solidified my desire to pursue a career in marine biology. While there, I encountered my first sea turtle, and my heart set. In my free time, I enjoy spending time with my family, surfing, flying my drone, posting interior design creations on Instagram, and tending to my marine habitat, a saltwater aquarium filled with clownfish, starfish, and various invertebrates.Tell us about your current career ambitions and/or accomplishmentsI am currently the Outreach Manager at SEE Turtles, a nonprofit geared toward conservation and connecting the general public with sea turtles. I work on various projects, including Sea Turtle Week, an international public awareness and education event that occurs each June. I've conducted sea turtle research along the southern Atlantic coast of the U.S. and the Caribbean. While building field laboratories, I've studied sea turtles and their nesting areas in remote locations. My field research has been published, and I have presented at international sea turtle conferences.To advance in my field and continue my research projects, I am looking to pursue a Ph.D. in marine biology. During this time, I hope to work on projects geared toward conserving these endangered animals. I also hope to engage and help educate the public about ocean conservation issues.How has receiving the Chairman's Scholarship positively impacted you?The NRG Chairman's Scholarship allowed me to go to a college of my choice. I was able to choose a small liberal arts school where I could pursue my love of science and art at the same time. Being in a smaller school without huge 400-student-sized lectures allowed me to connect personally with professors and develop meaningful relationships that have lasted to this day. One of these relationships with my professors led to my first research opportunity with sea turtles. This research question resulted in several projects I am still working on. Other relationships allowed me to develop my interest in photography, which I have used to photograph animals and ecosystems.What advice do you have for those considering applying for the scholarship?Applying for the NRG Chairman's Scholarship is like applying for anything else. I recommend putting your best foot forward and highlighting what makes you unique. Use the application to share what makes you an individual and what your passions are. Grades and extracurricular activities are important, but the Scholarship Committee wants to know they are investing in someone's future. Let the Scholarship Committee know what makes you different and what you hope to go on to pursue, and make that investment worthwhile.How do you empower others to make progress in their journey?Now that I have worked my way up in the science field, I try to provide others with what would have helped me at the beginning of my college career. For example, this past year, I was able to add an assistant to my field research project. I recruited a young woman who had taken care of my pet turtle and tortoise while I was traveling (she was in high school at the time). In her, I saw the same passion I had at her age. When the research assistant opportunity came along, she was a sophomore at Miami University on a marine biology track and my choice for the role. I brought her to St. Croix and introduced her to the unglamorous parts of being a field scientist - the long, hot sticky days and sandy nights. It was a real in-field experience, far from a classroom or university lab.At grad school, I helped my lab mates navigate state and federal permitting processes to research protected turtle species and develop research proposals. My NRG-funded Gettysburg College experience catapulted me ahead in my chosen field. I am grateful for where I am and try to share my knowledge and experiences when they are helpful.Catching up with the futureIt's inspiring to follow up with these talented young leaders-in-the-making as they move forward with focus, a good sense of themselves, and optimism for a world they will soon inherit.

The expected March 2023 volume would be aligned with the year-ago period (with the same number of selling days), reflecting that sales momentum will be difficult to sustain given current economic headwinds and tailwinds.March 2023 US auto sales are expected to translate to an estimated sales pace of 13.8 million units (seasonally adjusted annual rate: SAAR), down meaningfully from the January 2023 reading of 15.9 million units. However, that pace would bring the first quarter average sales rate to 14.9 million units. This would represent the strongest quarterly pace since the second quarter of 2021 – albeit nowhere near the SAAR reading of 16.7 million units at that time, when the auto market was still experiencing the pleasantness of stimulus checks and before supply chain issues began.US Light Vehicle SalesMar 23 (Est)Feb 23Mar 22Total Light VehicleUnits, NSA1,270,0001,136,3001,257,800In millions, SAAR13.814.913.6Light TruckIn millions, SAAR11.111.910.8Passenger CarIn millions, SAAR2.73.02.8Source: S&amp;P Global Mobility (Est), US Bureau of Economic Analysis""Incoming reports of sustained – but still muted - retail demand in March reflect that those auto consumers willing, ready, and able to enter into a new vehicle agreement are continuing to do so, even in light of rising interest rates and still-high vehicle price levels,"" said Chris Hopson, principal analyst at S&amp;P Global Mobility. ""New vehicle incentives are rising slowly from historically low levels as vehicle production advances. The specter of further hikes in interest rates, and acceptance of current unsettled economic conditions, may be providing impetus for those considering purchasing a new vehicle.""Story continuesS&amp;P Global Mobility projects calendar-year 2023 volume of 14.9 million units in the US, an 8% increase from the 2022 tally. Auto sales will be supported by advancing production levels, along with reports of sustained retail order books, recovering stock of vehicles, and improved fleet demand.Sustained development of battery-electric vehicle (BEV) sales remains a consistent assumption for 2023. BEV share has hovered around 8% over the course of the first two months of the year. At a projected level of 8.0% share is expected to remain strong. While Tesla's pricing adjustments were the first shot in a BEV price war, the reaction of other auto companies will determine whether the gains in the BEV mix level will be a blip in the trend or a dynamic tipping point in the electrification progress of the market. Beyond the pricing developments, a sustained churn of new and refreshed BEVs will continue to promote BEV sales as the year progresses.About S&amp;P Global MobilityAt S&amp;P Global Mobility, we provide invaluable insights derived from unmatched automotive data, enabling our customers to anticipate change and make decisions with conviction.

106,a5a4e51e-49dd-34db-85b0-abb3a2c72818,TSN,2023-03-24,"Tyson Foods plant closure raises antitrust concerns among US farmers, experts",Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tyson-foods-plant-closure-raises-101252484.html,1679652772,STORY,['TSN'],"[By Leah Douglas and Tom Polansek(Reuters) -Tyson Foods Inc gave its chicken suppliers two months' notice of its plan to shut a Virginia processing plant in May, raising concerns among farmers and legal experts about the company's compliance with antitrust regulations requiring it to give 90 days' notice before ending a contract.The planned closure of the plant has left dozens of Virginia chicken growers scrambling to find new buyers in a region with few other options. It could also expose Tyson to fines under the century-old Packers and Stockyards Act (PSA), the U.S. antitrust law requiring the minimum advance warning, according to Peter Carstensen, a professor of law emeritus at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Law School who previously served in the antitrust division at the U.S. Department of Justice.Tyson told Reuters the company is not canceling any farmers' contracts and instead has committed to paying the growers for the full-term of their remaining contracts, keeping in compliance with federal regulations.Antitrust issues, particularly in meatpacking, have been a priority for the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) under President Joe Biden, who in 2021 directed federal agencies to tackle consolidation. Four companies, including Tyson, control 55% to 85% of the beef, pork, and chicken markets.Tyson alerted Virginia farmers by phone on March 13 and later by mail that it will shut its Glen Allen plant on May 12, according to three poultry farmers who supply the plant. The company said there are 55 farmers with 73 contracts who supply the plant with chickens raised for meat.Tyson owns chickens it slaughters and pays the farmers to raise them. The company hatches baby birds and trucks them to farmers. The farmers then raise the birds for about six weeks, until they reach the size to be slaughtered and are trucked to the processing plant.Tyson spokesperson Alicia Buffer confirmed farmers received notice last week of the May 12 closing, and said Tyson intends to stop supplying them with chicks after March 28.Story continuesShe said that instead of canceling their contracts, Tyson is offering farmers a voluntary buyout package, or the option to retain them and be paid through their duration.The three farmers interviewed by Reuters have between three and 10 years left on their contracts.Farmers told Reuters they felt pressure to accept the buyout option because they were not sure how the contract could remain in force after the plant is shut and the chicks stop coming.Roger Reynolds, a farmer in Crewe, Virginia, said retaining his July 2012 contract with Tyson is not a viable option, in part because it would prevent him from selling to another poultry company if one entered the region.Another farmer with a contract to supply the plant, who asked not to be named, said they may eventually have to sell their third-generation farm as the buyout offer would not cover long-term expenses like property taxes.Carstensen, of the University of Wisconsin-Madison Law School, said it was unclear if Tyson's approach would absolve it of its requirement to provide farmers 90 days' notice before ending a purchase contract, because closing the plant means it won't be processing chickens there anymore.PSA violations can carry a $29,270 fine, according to the USDA website, and Carstensen said fines could apply for each contract.The USDA, which enforces the PSA, told Reuters it is ""closely monitoring"" Tyson's planned plant closure.'WE'RE DONE'Under normal circumstances, Tyson supplies farmers with chicks, while farmers assume the costs of land and chicken houses.Documents reviewed by Reuters show the company's proposed buyout package offers payment to farmers based on their average payment per flock in 2022.They also show that farmers opting to retain existing contracts instead of accepting the buyout would have to meet Tyson's contractual requirements for their facilities even after the company stops providing chicks.Tyson said those growers would have to perform ""routine and preventive maintenance"" to meet contract requirements and called the options generous.Farmers must choose between the options by the end of March, according to the document.On Monday, about 20 Tyson farmers and local government officials gathered in a fire station in Burkeville, Virginia, and raised concerns about Tyson's short timeline for closure of the plant, attendees said.Taylor Lee, a farmer in DeWitt, Virginia, who attended the meeting, said he built two new chicken houses in 2017 and raised about 400,000 birds annually for Tyson, and is unclear what will happen to his investment.""When we're done growing chickens (for Tyson), we're done, unless somebody else steps in,"" Lee said.The nearest chicken plants to Glen Allen are 100 to 150 miles away, outside the ideal radius of 60 miles, said Hobey Bauhan, Virginia Poultry Federation president. Longer distances hike transportation costs and health risks to chickens.(Reporting by Leah Douglas in Washington and Tom Polansek in Chicago; editing by Richard Valdmanis and Nick Zieminski)]"

According to the research firm, Rystad, spending on offshore oil investments exceeded $100 billion in 2022 for the first time in a decade, and will do so again in 2023 and 2024. Norway, the Scandinavian country that has positioned itself as a climate leader, is driving some of this boom. Norway is spending $21.4 billion on oil projects this year, an increase of 22% from the previous year.Norway’s investment in offshore oil is among the highest in the world this year, according to Rystad. It lands behind the $33 billion that will be spent on offshore projects in the Middle East, but ahead of countries like the US, which is putting $17 billion in offshore investments, and the UK with $7 billion.Read moreChatGPT is getting more nuancedChina is changing its tune on the mRNA vaccineA fresh idea for gathering remote and hybrid employees togetherOffshore projects are designed to pump oil for decades; investments that begin this year could continue to churn out oil well into the 2050s.Norway’s good deeds were always funded by oil and gasNorway’s fuzzy commitments to easing climate change feel like solutions to a problem that is, in no small part, of its own making. Norway is one of the world’s top exporters of oil. Since the 1990s, the country has funneled its oil revenues into the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund—which, with $1.4 trillion in assets, is now the world’s largest.The fund is among the biggest investors in the world, and it uses its considerable financial influence to advance its values. In recent years, it has dropped or put under close observation Thai, Israeli, Polish, Chinese and Indian companies over human rights abuses, and has wielded its power to bend companies toward net-zero goals.Some of the pro-climate positions that Norway has taken includes demanding transparency from Exxon to prevent the kind of corporate lobbying that leads to bad climate policies. Norway has also pushed Chevron to commit to taking responsibility for “Scope 3"" emissions—the broadest definition of the pollution that any company produces. This would include lowering customers’ emissions (as well as Chevron’s own), for example, by reducing the carbon intensity of its fossil fuel products.Story continuesIn 2022, Norway announced its goal to have every company in its portfolio reach net-zero emissions by 2050 and followed that up by voting against 61 directors at 18 companies for not doing enough to mitigate climate risk. This February, Norway said that it will continue to use its votes to push out directors and board members who fall short of climate goals.Norway is trying to put policy where its money isBut high oil prices are also inspiring other priorities, and Norway is joining a trend among flush oil companies and countries to refocus on fossil fuel extraction, sometimes at the expense of renewables.Norway has backed its refreshed interest in fossil fuel extraction with international policy. In the IPCC’s mammoth climate report released on March 20, Norway negotiated for wiggle room for its oil and gas investments, watering down language about limiting human-caused climate change from “deep, rapid and sustained” reductions, to “strong” emissions reductions—an imprecise word that accommodates its backtracking on North Sea projects More from QuartzThe split of the African plate could gift six landlocked countries a coastlineHow Credit Suisse’s demise strengthens Switzerland’s place in global financeSign up for Quartz's Newsletter.

Although crude began Friday trade with a loss, it was modestly up at the time of writing.West Texas Intermediate had recovered to top $70 per barrel at the time of writing and it was set for a weekly gain of more than 4%. On a monthly basis, however, WTI has lost about $3 per barrel.Brent crude also looked set to end the week with an overall gain: the benchmark started the week at around $70 per barrel and has since climbed to over $76 per barrel, although Brent remains much lower than it was a month ago, at over $82 per barrel.The main upward force in oil markets remains the expectation of returning Chinese demand, although most analysts believe the oil market won’t tighten until the second half of the year. A growing consensus that fears of a banking crisis were overblown and last week’s selloff was largely speculative has further helped oil markets recover. Finally, rumors that the Fed may end its string of interest rate hikes soon have provided some hope to markets.The recent slew of bearish catalysts for oil prices includes the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s latest weekly report, which estimated another inventory build, the Fed’s interest rate hike, and Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm’s statement on Thursday that the federal government will take its time with refilling the strategic petroleum reserve.It could take years to refill the SPR, Granholm said yesterday, dampening hopes for a demand spike from the refill effort, even though crude is currently trading close to the range set by the Energy Department for the start of the refill push.Last year, the federal government sold more than 220 million barrels of crude from the SPR to lower retail fuel prices. This took the SPR to the lowest level in 40 years, at around 372 million barrels. The administration’s refill plans are seen as bullish for oil prices and tricky for the administration itself because of that.Story continuesRecession fears in the U.S., meanwhile, remain high, adding pressure to oil prices, which seem set for their sharpest quarterly drop since 2020.

Gas flares from the field light the night sky bright orange, spewing acrid smoke; when the wind picks up, the 40-year old’s clothes are coated black.For Iraq’s poorest, evidence of the country's monumental oil wealth is inescapable. So is the knowledge that very little of it trickles down to them.Jasim’s savings were depleted when he was diagnosed with cancer last year, a disease he is convinced was caused by the toxic plumes. Twenty years since the U.S.-led invasion toppled Saddam Hussein and remade Iraq’s political order with the promise of democracy and freedom, he has one wish: To find a way to leave.“There is no future here for my children,” he said.Basra province, which boasts most of Iraq’s oil reserves, is symbolic of the deep disparities that have endured since the 2003 invasion. Basra continually bewilders experts, envoys and residents: How can a relatively stable province so rich in resources rank among the poorest and most under-developed in the country?“Of course, I blame the corrupt Iraqi government,” said Jasim, a policeman, echoing a widespread view in the region. “But I blame the Americans too. They replaced our leaders with thieves.”Local leaders in Basra talk of the oil reserves as both a blessing and a curse. They say resources bring affluence but have also given rise to vicious competition between political elites and armed groups at the expense of the Iraqi people.The power-sharing system in place since 2003, which divides the state and its institutions along ethnic and sectarian lines, sucks oil wealth into a pool of corruption and patronage. The higher the oil price, the more entrenched this system becomes as sectarian-based parties claim lucrative ministry portfolios, appoint loyalists in key positions and dole out public jobs to ensure support. According to the International Monetary Fund, public sector employment tripled from 2004 to 2013, but service delivery in health, education and power sectors remained inadequate.Story continuesThe result is that elections keep establishment parties in power. Voter turnout has dropped to record lows.Apart from institutional failures, air pollution is extensive in Basra, and salinity levels arising from a severe fresh water crisis are leading causes of illness, according to local researchers. Unemployment is rampant, with more than half the population below the age of 25.Public anger gave rise to violent protests in 2018, the precursor to mass anti-government protests in the capital a year later. But a swift crackdown by security forces and assassinations by armed groups have created a climate of fear.“The killings silenced many activists,” said Basra activist Ammar Sarhan. “Business continues as usual.”The 2003 toppling of Saddam propelled the oil-rich country into the global economy, opening the doors to foreign investment. In pre-invasion planning, U.S. advisors and their Iraqi opposition allies in exile had envisioned a shock system of reforms that would revamp Iraq’s oil industry and fund post-war reconstruction.Instead, violence hobbled oil production for years. A charm offensive by then-Oil Minister Hussein al-Shahrestani paved the way for major oil contracts to be awarded in 2007 and 2009. Today exports reach over 3 million barrels a day, double the rate in the early 2000s. The state budget, which in 2021 reached up to $90 billion, is financed almost entirely by oil revenues. Still, the government fails to deliver essential services, including water and electricity.In Basra, conditions rank amongst the worst in the country. Unemployment stands at 21%, above the national average of 16% according to a 2022 study by the International Labor Organization. Statistics for poverty rates vary from 10-20% according to various studies and local economists. Meanwhile, the province boasts around 70% of the country's oil production capacity.The road leading to Jasim’s humble home is rocky and unpaved.In 2003, he was a young man bewitched by the Bush administration’s rhetoric of building a democratic Iraq, he said. “We were full of hope,” he recalled. Twenty years on, he is middle-aged, tired of rampant government corruption and recovering from cancer.The loan he had taken out to build a home was used up to pay for $30,000 in private medical bills. Basra’s decrepit public hospitals were overwhelmed and unable to provide treatment, he said.His is a common story in Nahran Omar, a village of fewer than 2,000 people adjacent to a state-run oil field where cancer rates are disproportionately high. Every family here has a story of illness and debt, said Bashir Jabir, the mayor.“After 2003, more and more oil was exported, and we expected to benefit from this,” he said. “Instead, it hurt us.”The government long played down the link between cancer rates in the south and oil production activity, saying cases are only marginally higher than the rest of the country. This changed in 2022, when then-Environment Minister Jassim al-Falahi acknowledged that pollution from the fields was the main reason for the rise in sickness.Nahran Omar highlights a tragic irony: The natural gas burned from the oil fields, if captured, could solve Iraq’s perennial electricity shortages and reduce pollution. But securing investment to do this has been set back by protracted contract negotiations, a common headache for most major foreign investors.The entry of foreign investors also exacerbated competition between tribes, said Sheikh Muhammed al-Zaidawi, who leads an assembly of southern tribal elders. Tribes, which often wield more influence than government institutions in the south, pressure foreign companies for jobs, compensation, training for youth and development of their villages.“Most of the problems between tribes today are caused by the presence of oil companies,” he said, “All of them want to benefit.” Tribal disputes often turn into deadly gun battles.Reliance on the oil industry has stifled private sector development. Nearly every prime minister since the invasion has repeated calls to diversify the economy and boost incentives for Iraqi businesses.Nidhal Musa is one success story.She grew up in a poor suburb of Basra city and was 35 when the U.S. invaded Iraq. She spent subsequent years taking care of her sick and disabled husband. Desperate to earn money, she began sewing clothes to sell in the local market.By 2013, she had gathered a group of women just like herself, beleaguered and in need of money to support their families. She pooled together enough funds to open a garment factory and became known for employing the poor.But not everyone welcomed her success.In 2022, Musa received a slew of death threats. “Be very careful,” one message read. She believes she is being targeted because she refused to use her local fame to back a powerful political party that asked her to promote their campaign in 2021 elections.“They try to keep us weak,” she said. “They know perfectly well, if the people are hungry, they will be preoccupied only by their hunger.”]"

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best 5G Stocks To Buy Now. 5G players are experiencing remarkable success all over the world amid strong growth catalysts. In January 2023, Nokia Oyj (NYSE:NOK) exceeded its expected operating profit for the latest quarter and predicted increased sales in 2023. The Finnish telecommunications giant stated that it was able to increase its market share by taking advantage of the 5G deployment in nations like India. In addition, Nokia Oyj (NYSE:NOK) was able to broaden its range of customers beyond network service providers to industrial clients who established their own private 5G networks at locations such as power plants, utilities, and mines, among other places. However, Ericsson announced lower than anticipated core earnings for the fourth quarter and predicted a continued decline in margins in its Networks division during the first half of 2023. The company attributed this to weak sales of 5G equipment in markets such as the United States.Moreover, AWS, the provider of computing and data storage services owned by Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), has partnered with phone companies such as T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS) and Deutsche Telekom AG to offer exclusive wireless services to businesses. The company aims to promote advanced wireless networks as an alternative to Wi-Fi in office and work environments, and has teamed up with other partners including KDDI Corp. in Japan, Orange SA in France, and Telefonica SA in Spain. The private network sector is one of AWS's main areas of focus for expanding its cloud services and boosting revenue, as the business is responsible for most of  Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s profits, although sales growth slowed down last year. According to Jan Hofmeyr, an executive at AWS, the faster 5G wireless networks can now provide companies with improved in-house connectivity. Although Wi-Fi is adequate for current uses, it has certain limitations that can be overcome with 5G's precise location, low latency, and increased bandwidth, which are particularly useful for advanced applications such as autonomous robots in manufacturing.Story continuesIn our last year's article on 5G stocks, we cited Allied Market Research, which claimed that the global market for 5G technology was valued at $5.3 billion in 2020, and it is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 65.8% from 2021 to 2030, reaching a total value of $797.7 billion by 2030. Similarly, Precedence Research stated that the global market for 5G IoT will be worth around $297.1 billion by 2030, with a CAGR of 70.04% between 2022 and 2030. The market growth is primarily being driven by several factors, including the increasing need for fast internet, the continuous improvements in 5G technology, the surge of remote work, and the expansion of 5G network coverage.Companies specializing in cloud computing, edge computing, telecommunications, and semiconductors are leading players in the 5G sector. Some of the best 5G stocks to invest in include Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). Our Methodology For this article, we selected the top 5G stocks based on overall hedge fund sentiment. Most of these stocks are pure 5G companies, but some of them include cloud service providers, holding companies whose subsidiaries are involved in the 5G sector, and semiconductor firms supporting the growing 5G ecosystems. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 943 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2022. The list is arranged in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders in each firm. 13 Best 5G Stocks To Buy NowPhoto by Mario Caruso on UnsplashBest 5G Stocks To Buy Now13. Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 43Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS) designs, develops, manufactures, and markets proprietary semiconductor products. The company provides its products for the usage in aerospace, automotive, broadband, cellular infrastructure, connected home, entertainment and gaming, industrial, medical, military, smartphone, tablet, and wearable markets. KeyBanc Capital Markets predicts that Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) will experience a robust recovery in the second half of the year due to the global economy's unstable yet expanding state and the upcoming release of new smartphone models.On March 16, Susquehanna analyst Christopher Rolland upgraded Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS) to Positive from Neutral with a price target of $135, up from $110. In April 2021, Susquehanna predicted that the semiconductor cycle had peaked, but the firm now believes that the bottom has been reached for consumer, PC, and handset-related names. As 2023 is expected to be a weaker year for Apple's sell-through, Susquehanna sees Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS) shifting its focus to capture more premium Android customers. Additionally, the firm believes that Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS), with its expertise in RF integration, has numerous opportunities to add value to its products.According to Insider Monkey’s Q4 data, 43 hedge funds were bullish on Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS), compared to 39 funds in the prior quarter. D E Shaw held the largest stake in the company, consisting of 1.14 million shares worth $104.2 million. Like Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS) is one of the best 5G stocks to invest in. Here is what Heartland Advisors specifically said about Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Before the risk-on rebound early in the quarter, we were searching for opportunities to shift from our defensive stance, looking for beaten-down, high-quality “early cycle” leaders. Existing holding, Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS), represents one such opportunity that was added to on weakness.Skyworks is one of two leading providers of radio frequency system components to smartphone makers and electronics manufacturers. With every step-up in product complexity, over the past two decades, the competitive landscape has shrunk while gross margins have increased significantly. 5G represents another such step-up, which is likely to increase how much Skyworks can make per smartphone.Apple is a big customer, accounting for more than half of Skyworks’ sales. That customer concentration has depressed Skyworks’ valuation over time. More recently, fears surrounding a global recession and risk to consumer demand have further pressured valuation. However, the handset business is expected to benefit from 5G content, which may help offset some macroeconomic pressures. Away from the handset business, Skyworks’ growth is expected to accelerate thanks to other secular drivers such as WIFI 6 and growth of the industrial internet (i.e., “Internet of Things”).At a P/E of less than eight and a 2.3% dividend yield, SWKS rarely gets this cheap, making this high-quality stock compelling for longterm investors.”12. AT&amp;T Inc. (NYSE:T)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 55AT&amp;T Inc. (NYSE:T) provides telecommunications and technology services worldwide. The company operates through two segments, Communications and Latin America. It is one of the best 5G stocks to invest in. During the fourth quarter of 2022, AT&amp;T Inc. (NYSE:T) successfully reached its target of reducing costs by $5 billion to $6 billion. This was achieved in part by eliminating 30,000 positions within its communications business, with 7,000 of those job cuts taking place specifically in the fourth quarter.On January 26, Gregory Williams, an analyst at Cowen, increased the firm's price target on AT&amp;T Inc. (NYSE:T) to $25 from $24 and maintained a Market Perform rating on the shares. The analyst pointed out that the company had strong Q4 results and provided good 2023 guidance for EBITDA, slightly below expectations free cash flow, EPS that was lower than expected, and capex that was in line with predictions.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 55 hedge funds were bullish on AT&amp;T Inc. (NYSE:T), compared to 61 funds in the prior quarter. Cliff Asness’ AQR Capital Management is the largest position holder in the company, with 18 million shares worth $333.5 million. Here is what Chartwell Investment Partners has to say about AT&amp;T Inc. (NYSE:T) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“In the Dividend Equity accounts, the three best performers in Q2 include AT&amp;T (NYSE:T, 2.5%), up 17.1%. AT&amp;T completed the spin off of the WarnerMedia business (HBO, CNN, etc.), and the market seemed to like the “back-to-basics” approach. Also, the telco business is expected to do relatively well in an inflationary environment.”11. Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 56Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) specializes in communications, technology, information, and entertainment products and services to consumers, businesses, and governmental entities worldwide. It is one of the top 5G stocks to watch. On March 2, Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) declared a $0.6525 per share quarterly dividend, in line with previous. The dividend is payable on May 1, to shareholders of record on April 10. On January 25, Cowen analyst Gregory Williams maintained an Outperform rating on Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) but lowered the firm's price target on the shares to $49 from $55. The analyst observed that the company's Q4 results were mixed, and its initial 2023 guidance was unimpressive, as price increases, strong Fixed Wireless Access (FWA) and Business Wireless segments were unable to offset the cost pressures from promotion amortization and interest expenses.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 56 hedge funds were long Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ), compared to 62 funds in the prior quarter. Ric Dillon’s Diamond Hill Capital is a significant position holder in the company, with 6.7 million shares worth $267 million. Here is what Mawer Investment Management has to say about Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“There are a few other segments of our portfolios that displayed weakness in the quarter. Cable and telecommunication companies have been an area that has lagged the broader market as their worlds are increasingly colliding. Companies such as Verizon (NYSE:VZ) have been impacted as wireless operators are spending heavily to attract internet subscribers with fixed wired access and the cable companies are trying to build wireless businesses.”10. Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 58Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL) provides data infrastructure semiconductor solutions spanning the data center core to network edge. Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL) offers a wide range of solutions for Radio Access Network (RAN) and data center applications, including Digital Front End (DFE), baseband, compute, security, switching, and optical connectivity.

It is one of the best 5G stocks to invest in. On March 15, Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL) declared a $0.06 per share quarterly dividend, in line with previous. The dividend is payable on April 26, to shareholders of record on April 7. Harsh Kumar, an analyst at Piper Sandler, maintained an Overweight rating on Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL) but lowered the firm's price target on the shares to $50 from $55 on March 3. According to the analyst, the company's softer guidance was due to continued weakness in the storage business, which has impacted both the data center segment and the delay in custom cloud wins. However, the analyst believes that the worst has passed for the stock.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 58 hedge funds were bullish on Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL), and Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group held a significant position in the company, with 4.2 million shares worth $158.2 million. Carillon Tower Advisors made the following comment about Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL) provides infrastructure semiconductor solutions. Investors are concerned about the semiconductor cycle and how demand for Marvell’s products will fare in a slowing economic environment. We remain confident that the company’s portfolio of products is highly important in parts of the datacenter server market and note that the company recently has secured strong wins with large technology companies to use its products. The company also benefits from 5G wireless infrastructure build-outs that remain on pace and are generally insulated from macroeconomic pressures. With supply chain issues easing, we believe Marvell remains in a strong position to post healthy growth in 2023.”9. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 62Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) designs, develops, markets, and sells computing and related products worldwide.

D E Shaw is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 13.3 million shares worth $353.7 million. ClearBridge Large Cap Growth Strategy made the following comment about Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“A third approach to return generation is purchasing idiosyncratic businesses that largely control their own destiny. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), which we purchased in the first quarter on the premise that it would develop a leading domestic foundry business, has struggled with execution missteps and product delays. We are maintaining the position to provide ongoing exposure to semiconductors.”8. Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 72Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) designs, develops, and supplies semiconductor devices worldwide. Chipmakers such as Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) supply products to the market for 5G network equipment.

(NASDAQ:AVGO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Performance was also supported by communications chipmaker Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO), which has managed inventory better than peers and continues to generate healthy levels of free cash. Broadcom should benefit from a more balanced revenue mix between semiconductors and software upon the expected closing of its acquisition of VMware (VMW) in 2023.”7.

Despite solid gains in the Internet of Things and Auto segments, Qualcomm’s dominant business remains the smartphone market. We expect to see stabilization of the smartphone market in 2023, including a recovery in China.”6. T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 94T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS) provides mobile communications services in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the United States Virgin Islands. It is one of the most prominent 5G providers in the US.

(NASDAQ:TMUS)’s announcement of the acquisition of Ka'ena Corporation, which includes Mint Mobile, Ultra Mobile, and Plum, for a maximum of $1.35 billion in cash and stock. The analyst stated that the acquisition is logical, but he does not expect it to have a significant impact. T-Mobile is already Ka'ena's exclusive MVNO partner, so Morgan Stanley expects only a modest financial effect from the deal. Morgan Stanley maintained an Overweight rating on T-Mobile US, Inc.

Faced with these headwinds, and with pressure from other wireless carriers and cable companies that could cause the company to cede share in subscriber growth in 2022, we exited our position in the fourth quarter.”   Click to continue reading and see 5 Best 5G Stocks To Buy Now.  Suggested articles:12 Best Biotech Stocks To Buy Under $2010 Best ASX Stocks to Buy Now13 Best Consumer Discretionary Stocks To Buy Disclosure: None. 13 Best 5G Stocks To Buy Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

But on the bright side, if you buy shares in a high quality company at the right price, you can gain well over 100%. Long term QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) shareholders would be well aware of this, since the stock is up 124% in five years. Also pleasing for shareholders was the 12% gain in the last three months.The past week has proven to be lucrative for QUALCOMM investors, so let's see if fundamentals drove the company's five-year performance. Check out our latest analysis for QUALCOMM To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During the last half decade, QUALCOMM became profitable. Sometimes, the start of profitability is a major inflection point that can signal fast earnings growth to come, which in turn justifies very strong share price gains. Since the company was unprofitable five years ago, but not three years ago, it's worth taking a look at the returns in the last three years, too. Indeed, the QUALCOMM share price has gained 80% in three years. In the same period, EPS is up 44% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 22% average annual increase in the share price over the same three years. So you might conclude the market is a little more cautious about the stock, these days. This cautious sentiment is reflected in its (fairly low) P/E ratio of 11.67.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that QUALCOMM has improved its bottom line over the last three years, but what does the future have in store? This free interactive report on QUALCOMM's balance sheet strength is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.Story continuesWhat About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of QUALCOMM, it has a TSR of 157% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.A Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market lost about 13% in the twelve months, QUALCOMM shareholders did even worse, losing 20% (even including dividends). However, it could simply be that the share price has been impacted by broader market jitters. It might be worth keeping an eye on the fundamentals, in case there's a good opportunity. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 21%, each year, over five years. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand QUALCOMM better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 2 warning signs  with QUALCOMM , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.But note: QUALCOMM may not be the best stock to buy.

117,bd494b76-c95b-3f35-bdb6-08b1d4ffc07e,QCOM,2023-03-24,Resilient: From Curious in Cameroon to Three-Time Qualcomm Patent Holder [+Video],ACCESSWIRE,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/resilient-curious-cameroon-three-time-141500073.html,1679580900,STORY,['QCOM'],"[NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / March 23, 2023 / QualcommQualcomm, Thursday, March 23, 2023, Press release pictureAbout Qualcomm inventor, Dr. Kelly Tchambake: Kelly earned a PhD degree in electronics and communication from Télécom Paris. She graduated with a Master of Science in electrical engineering from Bordeaux Institute of Technology. In 2018, Kelly moved to Cambridge, United Kingdom to join Qualcomm, where she now designs cutting-edge circuits for our Bluetooth radios. Today, Kelly is one of our main contributors of a new digital-like analog-to-digital converter (ADC) architecture for audio applications, and she's been granted three approved patents, with five more pending approval.Three-time patent-granted Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. engineer, Dr. Kelly Tchambake, and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion manager, Tyrene Essell, came together to inform and inspire.And this is a conversation you won't want to miss: This astute inventor is putting her dreams, inspirations, obstacles, collaborations, resources, culture, and more on the table for you.Tyrene Essell (TE): Tell us a little bit about yourself; Where did you grow up, and what inspired your interest in engineering?Dr. Kelly Tchambake (KT): I was born and raised in Cameroon. I have three siblings, and my mother worked in a shipping company in Douala, Cameroon, Central Africa, where we lived. My father was a mechanical engineer who had a lot of ideas and created three startups back in Cameroon. And he had a real passion for technology, he used his phone a lot - like a lot. And he always mentioned about the heat he was experiencing from his phone. This motivated me to understand how mobile phones work, but also to understand and try to find a solution to the heating issue he had with his phone. Ultimately, this inspired me to become an engineer.After graduating in Cameroon, I pursued undergraduate and my graduate studies, respectively, in Toulouse and Bordeaux. Then I attended Texas Tech University for a research internship. After serving as an application engineer intern at Broadcom Inc. in the San Francisco Bay area, I went to France for my PhD at Télécom Paris.Story continuesThis is when things came full circle: My PhD subject was a new circuit to improve the efficiency of power amplifiers. Power amplifier is one of the most power-hungry components in our mobile phones. And this is one of the main heat sources that you may have experienced in your phone. And this is also - in part - why, after my PhD, I ultimately landed at Qualcomm in Cambridge.TE: Can we talk about how that was a lot? Black History Month's theme is resilience, and you are an inspiration to this value. You've worked at Qualcomm for five years that you've worked on radio frequency (RF) and analog design teams in Cambridge, England. Tell us about your work. What keeps you inspired and why Qualcomm?KT: I work as an engineer on the design team at Qualcomm, focusing on voice and music applications. We work on state-of-the-art circuits and chips for products like headphones. My work is mainly to design blocks of the Bluetooth radio. Let's say for example, in an ear bud, I design the Bluetooth subblocks inside this radio, which is pretty cool, to be honest. I particularly like the noise cancellation feature. So, we work on a lot of a lot of things.At Qualcomm I really like and am inspired by, firstly, environment, which is to be honest, really good. People are open and my colleagues are very, very talented and are very human, they understand yourself... it's great. Really, I really like my colleagues, to be honest.TE: Wow, that's great. It's important to like your colleagues, especially because we all spend so much time together. Qualcomm really is a special place. And I do think there are so many teams across the company, that are just super supportive, very innovative, and great listeners. And it seems like you've been able to find all three of those things within your teammates. TE: I'd love to hear more about your journey as an inventor. What advice would you give to aspiring women and underrepresented minority inventors.KT: When I interviewed at Qualcomm, I was inspired and impressed to see my colleagues' ideas on the Qualcomm patent wall, knowing the end-user products have a big impact in people's life. After joining the company, I started to work on a new analog-to-digital converter implementation, and after working several hours with two colleagues on this idea, we realized we had a new architecture that has not been implemented. That's when we knew it was time to start our patent application. We applied for a patent and a year after the patent was granted. So that's how I arrived at my first patent.TE: What advice do you have for other women investors or inventor-hopefuls?KT: To have a purpose. And to have a problem you would like to solve - this will be your drive. Plus, come up with new ideas: It's ideal to have a problem to solve because you want to impact people's lives.Number two is to be curious: be resilient and persistent. This is important when you have doubts or need to overcome setbacks and challenges.And number three - the most important one - is to reflect. Reflect on mistakes to avoid them in the future. But also reflect on successes to be more efficient the next time you face the same issue.TE: Being resilient, being curious, and then also learning ways to be more efficient: I love that. It's reflective, but it's also forward thinking. How would you explain to someone how your patents and inventions help them enjoy their everyday lives? The work you do is very cool, but at the end of the day, does touch people's everyday lives?KT: My patents are on new architectures of analog to digital converters ADC, a device which converts an analog signal, which is sometimes a sine wave into a digital signal, which is a series of zeros and ones. The purpose of converting the signal is to process the data and process the signal with our phone... In our phones we have, for example, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and radios. In each of these radios, we have ADC, so we use ADCs a lot.Nowadays we want to have smaller devices and devices that do not consume a lot of power. My invention allows people with earbuds, for example, to have a better sound quality, and to use a smaller device, which means that the buds can be even smaller.TE: I know I love the smaller earbuds, and it just makes it seamless, whether I'm walking or exercising, and most of the things that you all are thinking about the factors that you're considering when you're working on this technology. So, I appreciate the work that you're doing. TE: Let's talk more about Qualcomm and the culture here, and how it's supported your ability to invent and create new technologies.KT: Qualcomm truly has a culture of innovation - purposeful innovation, to ease people's life. We are encouraged to innovate and to express our ideas. And we have a lot of resources to find new ideas: we can go to conferences, we have internal conferences, and we have trainings. We also have a lot of resources to demystify the patent process, because patenting can be complicated if you don't know how it works. There are also workshops, formal mentorships, and role models, all with support from the management.In addition to that, we have a diverse team. For example, in my team, we have seven people from five different countries. So, when for example, someone comes up with a challenge, you can end up with at least three different ways to solve the problem. This diversity of culture encourages innovation.In addition, we value collaboration. We're encouraged to work with different teams; for example, we work with teams, other teams in Cambridge, but we also work with people in different countries - in the United States, France, Germany, India, and Taiwan. This inspires brainstorming to find new ideas. We are encouraged to express our ideas without any judgment. And that's excellent for innovation.TE: This speaks to Qualcomm's value of diversity, equity, and inclusion, and how inclusivity really fosters innovation and that collaborative community that is so central to Qualcomm's culture. Thank you for sharing that. I want you meet your teammates, because they sound amazing. Is there anything else you'd like to share about your resilience and what continues to keep you motivated?KT: I have a personal story about resilience: When I was in engineering school, we had mock interviews and identified real jobs we'd like to apply for. Weirdly, I went with two offers: one from Broadcom and the other from Qualcomm. I was dreaming of working for Qualcomm even back then.This goes to show that, when you have your dream, do not give up on it. Keep pushing, keep chasing, keep working hard, and definitely, definitely there's only one way to get success.TE: Kelly, I appreciate you. Thank you for you sharing your story. It's important for other inventors to hear it, especially women and underrepresented minority inventors. You're keeping us all inspired.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Qualcomm on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: QualcommWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/qualcommEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: QualcommView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/745435/Resilient-From-Curious-in-Cameroon-to-Three-Time-Qualcomm-Patent-Holder-Video]"

Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about PulteGroup (PHM).PulteGroup currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.83, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 12 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.83 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 12 recommendations that derive the current ABR, seven are Strong Buy, representing 58.3% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for PHMBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for PHMCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for PulteGroup here&gt;&gt;&gt;The ABR suggests buying PulteGroup, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Is PHM Worth Investing In?Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for PulteGroup, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $7.34.Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for PulteGroup. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for PulteGroup.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their returns over the years, and go directly to read 5 Future Dividend Kings in the Next 6 Years or Less. Dividend Kings are companies that have dividend growth streaks of 50 years or more. Investors are inclined toward these securities as these companies are financially stable and are more likely to raise their payouts in the future. Moreover, these stocks also offer regular income to shareholders along with the potential for capital appreciation as the stock price grows over time. Some of the best dividend kings that investors are paying attention to include The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) as these companies have strong cash flow generation which enabled them to raise their payouts for decades.The current inflationary environment has enhanced the importance of dividend growers. Analysts also recommend loading up on companies with strong dividend growth track records instead of those with high yields. According to a report by Nuveen, global dividend-payers with modest yields of around 3% generally exhibit better earnings potential and higher profit margins when compared with high-yielding dividend stocks. The report also mentioned that dividend growth stocks outperformed their peers during monthly periods of rising volatility. From December 2002 to December 2022, dividend growers delivered an average excess return of 0.7% when the monthly volatility increase was over 20%.In addition to shareholder return, dividend stocks also contributed significantly to the overall market return. According to a report by T. Rowe Price, compounded dividends have represented over 70% of global market returns. The report also mentioned the performance of dividend growers over the years. The S&amp;P Dividend Aristocrat Index, which tracks the performance of companies that have raised their payouts for 25 years or more, has outperformed the wider market by over 75% since 1989.Story continuesPayout ratios also play a vital part when considering investments in dividend growers. In one of our previous articles titled 10 Companies Likely to be Dividend Kings in the Future, we mentioned a research which says dividend growers returned 11.1% on average in a 12-month period starting after the rate hikes in 1994 through the third quarter of 2022, compared with a 9.2% return of the wider market. We also mentioned that payout ratios below 50% are considered healthy as these companies have stable cash flow generation for shareholder return.Healthy payout ratios show the financial position of the company which directly affects the sustainability of future dividends. Andrew Crowell, financial adviser and vice chairman of wealth management at D.A. Davidson, spoke to Wall Street Journal about dividend payout ratios and their importance. Here are some comments from the analyst:“The dividend payout ratio is a good indicator of a company’s dividend track record. It is the ratio of the total amount of dividends paid out to shareholders relative to the net income of the company.”He added:“The annual dividend payout ratio for dividend aristocrats is 30% to 50%. This allows them to retain enough cash if business stalls, or the economy turns downward.” Future Dividend Kings in the Next 6 Years or LessOur Methodology:For this list, we selected companies that have raised their dividend payouts for 44 years or more and are on a steady path to becoming dividend kings (companies which increase their dividends for 50 or more straight years). These companies would be achieving their Dividend King status in six years or less. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their consecutive years of dividend growth.12. The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW)Consecutive Years of Dividend Growth: 44The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW) is an Ohio-based paint and coating manufacturing company. On February 15, the company declared a 0.8% growth in its quarterly dividend to $0.605 per share. Through this increase, the company took its dividend growth streak to 44 years. The stock has a dividend yield of 1.15%, as of March 23.SHW is also favored by investors alongside some of the best dividend kings like The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), PepsiCo, Inc.

Shares have lost about 6.1% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Medtronic due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Medtronic Q3 Earnings Top Estimates, Margins ContractMedtronic reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.30 for third-quarter fiscal 2023, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.2%. However, adjusted earnings declined 4.4% from the year-ago quarter’s figure. Currency-adjusted earnings per share came in at $1.38 in the quarter.Without certain one-time adjustments — including restructuring and associated costs, amortization, acquisition-related costs and the new European Union medical device regulation charges, among others— GAAP earnings per share was 92 cents, down 16.4% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Total RevenuesWorldwide revenues in the reported quarter grossed $7.73 billion, up 4.1% on an organic basis (excluding the impacts of currency and contribution from the company's fiscal first-quarter acquisition of Intersect ENT) and flat year over year on a reported basis. The top line exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.1%.Third-quarter organic revenues, according to the company, reflect strong performances in the Cardiovascular and Neuroscience business, in international Diabetes markets and improved product availability across certain businesses. This was partially offset by unfavorable impacts from ventilator sales, given the strong year-ago comparable due to COVID-19 severity, and sales in China, given volume-based procurement (VBP) tenders and the impact of COVID-19 resurgence on procedure volumes.Q3 in DetailsIn the quarter under review, U.S. sales (52% of total revenues) were up 3% on a reported basis (up 2% on an organic basis) to $4.06 billion. Non-U.S. developed market revenues totaled $2.29 billion (30% of total revenues), down 6% on a reported basis (up 6% on an organic basis).Story continuesEmerging market revenues (18% of total revenues) amounted to $1.37 billion, down 1% on a reported basis (up 5% organically).Segment DetailsThe company generates revenues from four major segments, namely Cardiovascular Portfolio, Medical Surgical Portfolio, Neuroscience Portfolio and Diabetes.In the fiscal third quarter, Cardiovascular revenues increased 6.5% at CER to $2.77 billion, with all three divisions reporting organic growth this quarter.Cardiac Rhythm &amp; Heart Failure sales totaled $1.43 billion, up 7.5% year over year at CER. Revenues from Structural Heart &amp; Aortic were up 8.8% at CER to $760 million. Coronary &amp; Peripheral Vascular revenues were up 1.5% at CER to $581 million.In Medical Surgical, worldwide sales totaled $2.14 billion, down 1.6% year over year at CER. The company reported low-single-digit declines in both Surgical Innovations and Respiratory, Gastrointestinal &amp; Renal. Excluding the unfavorable impact of ventilator sales, and sales in China, given the unfavorable impact of provincial VBP tenders, Medical Surgical revenues increased 3% organic.In Neuroscience, worldwide revenues of $2.25 billion were up 8.5% year over year at CER, driven by a low-double-digit increase in Specialty Therapies and mid-single-digit increases in Neuromodulation and Cranial &amp; Spinal Technologies, all organically.Revenues in the Diabetes group rose 3% at CER to $570 million. Due to the lack of new product approvals, United States revenues declined in the mid-teens in Q3, offset by high-teens growth in non-U.S. developed markets and low-twenties growth in emerging markets. The company’s international sales were led by the high-teens growth of insulin pumps, mid-thirties growth of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) products on strong sales of the MiniMed 780G system and the associated increase in CGM attachment rates on the strength of the Guardian 4 sensor.MarginsGross margin in the reported quarter contracted 312 basis points (bps) to 65.2% on a 5% fall in gross profit to $5.04 billion.Research and development expenses were up 2.9% year over year at $688 million. Selling, general and administrative expenses rose 2.1% to $2.62 billion.Adjusted operating margin contracted 428 bps year over year to 22.5%.GuidanceMedtronic issued fiscal 2023 fourth-quarter guidance and updated its fiscal 2023 guidance.Fourth-quarter organic revenue growth is expected in the range of 4.5-5%. Per the FX rate as of the beginning of February, fourth-quarter revenues would be unfavorably affected by approximately $165 million to $215 million.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fiscal Q4 worldwide revenues is pegged at $7.97 billion.The full-year adjusted earnings per share projection has been updated to the range of $5.28 to $5.30 (reflecting an increase in the lower end of the earlier-projected band of $5.25 to $5.30), including an estimated 21 cents negative impact from foreign exchange. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the year’s adjusted earnings is $5.26.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, estimates review have trended downward during the past month.VGM ScoresAt this time, Medtronic has a subpar Growth Score of D, however its Momentum Score is doing a bit better with a C. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the second quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, Medtronic has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Performance of an Industry PlayerMedtronic belongs to the Zacks Medical - Products industry. Another stock from the same industry, Cardiovascular Systems (CSII), has gained 0.2% over the past month. More than a month has passed since the company reported results for the quarter ended December 2022.Cardiovascular Systems reported revenues of $61.45 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +3.9%.

127,057f57ef-1ead-323e-851f-fd4ca7498975,MDT,2023-03-24,Medtronic: Mira Sahney on Innovating in Women’s Health,ACCESSWIRE,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/medtronic-mira-sahney-innovating-women-174000501.html,1679506800,STORY,['MDT'],"[NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / March 22, 2023 / Mira Sahney admits she always had a curious mind and love for science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). But she discovered early in her career that engineering could foster a deeper calling: benefiting humanity.That realization continues to drive Sahney's work - including her commitment to expanding health care access, the drive to innovate, and elevating women and those with diverse backgrounds in their careers.Inspired by a mentorSahney's career experiences positioned her perfectly for her role at Medtronic: president of the company's Pelvic Health business. Her varied roles include working as a design engineer on military airplanes, serving as CEO of a startup, and co-founding a neuro-robotics company during her graduate studies at MIT. That company is now publicly traded.But there's one early career mentor who still sticks with Sahney.""Air Gun Annie"" was a well-respected female engineer leader in a male-dominated workplace who helped Sahney - a General Motors intern at the time - forge relationships with technicians and union workers who were all men. When she learned Sahney didn't know how to drive stick shift, ""Air Gun Annie"" taught her how on the GM test track afterhours.""She really included me in everything and that had a profound impact on me, my career, and my confidence,"" Sahney said.Moving to healthcare technologyLater in her career Sahney built a women's health business by working with physicians to develop and commercialize innovative products that was sold to Medtronic in 2016.Even before then, Medtronic was in the back of Sahney's mind. She still has a red, heart-shaped Medtronic stress ball from a career fair - now about 25 years old. When the opportunity to join Medtronic surfaced, it was a challenge she welcomed.""Medtronic already did the rocket science part of it, stimulating the sacral nerve to control the bladder and bowel function,"" she said of our product, InterStimTM. ""But to take that from something that's not well known, yet tremendously successful, and bring to the mainstream population - and the challenge to make the therapy even more appealing for physicians and patients - that was really exciting for me.""Story continuesDespite the widespread prevalence of bladder and bowel control problems (it's more common than asthma, diabetes, Alzheimer's, or breast cancer in the U.S.), it is largely absent from health conversations. People often go years before bringing it up to their doctor due to embarrassment and social stigma.Everyone working in the pelvic health field feels an obligation to raise awareness about life-changing health care for what can be a serious medical condition, Sahney said.Breaking down barriersPutting patients at the center not only helps Medtronic understand barriers to access, but it's also propelling the business forward, Sahney said.In 2022, the Pelvic Health Operating Unit launched a pivotal study of a new implantable tibial neuromodulation therapy in people with overactive bladder. The tibial implant, which is still investigational, could be done in a doctor's office rather than an operating room.""That would not only reduce the total cost of care to the system and has the potential to provide greater access globally. It also reduces the adoption barrier for patients,"" Sahney said.More than 25 years after ""Air Gun Annie"" took Sahney under her wing, the medtech leader remains committed to paying it forward.In 2022, Medtech Women honored Sahney with the Ferolyn Powell Leadership Award, which recognizes commitment to patients, mentoring others, and advancing diversity in the field.And Sahney remains committed to breaking down barriers for women on the home front; she was recently named co-chair of Medtronic Women's Network - a position she's ""thrilled"" to serve in. And perhaps one she's been working toward all along.To find out if you or a loved one may benefit from bladder or bowel control therapy, visit ControlLeaks.com.Medtronic, Wednesday, March 22, 2023, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Medtronic on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: MedtronicWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/medtronicEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: MedtronicView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/745268/Medtronic-Mira-Sahney-on-Innovating-in-Womens-Health]"

In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. In light of that, when we looked at Medtronic (NYSE:MDT) and its ROCE trend, we weren't exactly thrilled.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Medtronic:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.074 = US$5.9b ÷ (US$94b - US$14b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to January 2023).Therefore, Medtronic has an ROCE of 7.4%. In absolute terms, that's a low return and it also under-performs the Medical Equipment industry average of 9.9%. View our latest analysis for Medtronic roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Medtronic compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Medtronic here  for free.What Can We Tell From Medtronic's ROCE Trend?Over the past five years, Medtronic's ROCE and capital employed have both remained mostly flat. This tells us the company isn't reinvesting in itself, so it's plausible that it's past the growth phase. So don't be surprised if Medtronic doesn't end up being a multi-bagger in a few years time. This probably explains why Medtronic is paying out 52% of its income to shareholders in the form of dividends. Unless businesses have highly compelling growth opportunities, they'll typically return some money to shareholders.Story continuesOur Take On Medtronic's ROCEIn a nutshell, Medtronic has been trudging along with the same returns from the same amount of capital over the last five years. And investors may be recognizing these trends since the stock has only returned a total of 16% to shareholders over the last five years. As a result, if you're hunting for a multi-bagger, we think you'd have more luck elsewhere.While Medtronic doesn't shine too bright in this respect, it's still worth seeing if the company is trading at attractive prices.

130,cbbdafe6-ce2a-3286-b527-52becf7a2405,MRK,2023-03-24,7 Defensive Stocks to Buy During This Chaotic Spell,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-defensive-stocks-buy-during-223105438.html,1679351465,STORY,"['TJX', 'APD', 'PGR', 'XOM', 'WEN', 'MRK']","[While it’s always a good idea to balance your portfolio with defensive stocks, the present chaos dramatically incentivizes this subsegment. As you’ve no doubt heard, the U.S. and the rest of the world presently reel from two major banks failing. Moreover, the main concern centers on the contagion spreading to other components of the global economy.What really adds weight to the drama here is of course the Federal Reserve. The central bank must decide how to navigate monetary policy in light of recent developments. If the Fed reacts with a more dovish stance, it would contradict its stated intentions of controlling inflation. However, if it continues with interest rate hikes, this hawkish framework could break more cogs in the flywheel.No matter what, the Fed faces a gargantuan task with serious consequences either way. Basically, it’s caught between a rock and a hard place. With investors deeply (and understandably) concerned, the most-established businesses probably make the most sense. In that spirit, below are the defensive stocks to buy during this chaotic spell.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsPGRProgressive$139.07SAPSAP$121.38MRKMerck$105.85APDAir Products &amp; Chemicals$279.21WENWendy’s$21.05TJXTJX Companies$75.40XOMExxon Mobil$102.45Progressive (PGR)Man holding stacks of money. Millionaire.Source: Epic Cure / ShutterstockAs an insurance stalwart, Progressive (NYSE:PGR) makes for an ideal candidate for defensive stocks to buy. Featuring an established and permanently relevant business, PGR features predictability in the financials and the technicals. Further, the chaos from the coronavirus pandemic – such as heightened traffic incidents and property crime – incentive financial protection programs.Most importantly, Progressive garners the most attention for its auto insurance. Required by the vast majority of states, drivers practically can’t go anywhere (legally) without coverage. Therefore, Progressive cynically benefits from a captive audience.Story continuesTo be fair, the company doesn’t deliver the most remarkably positive financials. However, it does enough to get the job done. For example, Progressive’s three-year revenue growth rate pings at 8.3%, above 59.45% of its peers. As well, the company enjoys a long history of consistent annual profitability. Finally, Wall Street analysts peg PGR as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target comes in at $147, implying nearly 8% upside potential.SAP (SAP)A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.Source: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.comA German multinational software company, SAP (NYSE:SAP) develops enterprise software to manage business operations and customer relations. Further, the company is the world’s leading enterprise resource planning software vendor. Given the size and influence of its business, SAP makes for an ideal choice for defensive stocks to buy. Even with various economic challenges, companies must continue to operate. More often than not, the large players use SAP.While the company features far-from-perfect financials, it offers plenty of substance to chew on. For example, SAP’s Altman Z-Score pings at 4.09, indicating low bankruptcy risk. Operationally, its three-year free cash flow (FCF) growth rate comes in at 21.9%, above 64.74% of the industry. As well, its net margin is 7.4%, ranked better than 70.91% of sector rivals. Also, investors may note that right now, the market prices SAP at a forward multiple of 20.41. As a discount to earnings, SAP ranks better than 60.98% of the field.Lastly, covering analysts peg SAP as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $137, implying 15% upside potential.Merck (MRK)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar billsSource: shutterstock.com/CC7A multinational pharmaceutical giant, Merck (NYSE:MRK) makes for an intriguing case for defensive stocks to buy. Basically, no matter what happens with the global markets, people will need access to therapeutics and vaccines. While MRK incurred a volatile ride in the year so far, in the past 365 days, it gained almost 32% of equity value. Better yet, there may still be extra room in the tank.Overall, Merck enjoys a solid fiscal profile. Notably, its Altman Z-Score comes in at 4.49, which indicates low bankruptcy risk. Operationally, the company posts a three-year revenue growth rate of 15.4%, above nearly 75% of the drug manufacturing industry. Also, its book growth rate during the same period is 21.1%, well above average. On the bottom line, Merck’s net margin pings at 24.49%. This stat helps undergird the company’s forward yield of 2.8%, noticeably above the healthcare sector’s average yield of 1.58%.In closing, analysts peg MRK as a consensus moderate buy. Further, their average price target stands at $119.95, implying over 15% upside potential.Air Products and Chemicals (APD)tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comAn industrial player, Air Products and Chemicals (NYSE:APD) specializes in selling gases and chemicals for industrial uses. Fundamentally, APD makes for a solid case for defensive stocks to buy because of its “backstage” utility. While Air Products may not be a Broadway star so to speak, its services undergird various applications. Without the company, infrastructural networks could fail.In fairness, APD went volatile this year, shedding over 10% since the January opener. However, in the trailing one-year period, APD gained almost 19% of its equity value. On the financial front, Air Products delivers the goods. Its three-year revenue growth rate pings at 12.3%, ranking better than 67.43% of the competition. Also, it’s a stable business, as its Altman Z-Score of 4.44 indicates. On the bottom line, Air Products features a net margin of 17.61%, above 86.52% of sector players. Also, these robust earnings support the company’s forward yield of 2.55%.Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg APD as a consensus moderate buy. Moreover, their average price target stands at $324.67, implying over 18% upside potential.Wendy’s (WEN)Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words ""buy"" and ""sell"" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image.Source: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.comA popular fast-food chain, Wendy’s (NASDAQ:WEN) makes a compelling case as one of the defensive stocks to buy. Though it’s tied to the consumer discretionary sector, Wendy’s benefits from the trade-down effect. Essentially, as economic conditions worsen, consumers will eschew fine-dining establishments for cheaper fare like Wendy’s. That’s one positive catalyst.The other tailwind centers on social normalization. As white-collar employees return to the office, Wendy’s coffee and breakfast menu could be appealing to worker bees. In addition, Wendy’s offerings would compete effectively on price with premium-label coffee shops.Generally speaking, WEN represents one of the defensive stocks to buy that features just enough positives. For instance, the underlying company’s three-year revenue growth rate stands at 10.1%, above 84.45% of the competition. On the bottom line, its net margin comes in at 8.46%, boxing out 83.33% of sector players. Plus, Gurufocus’ proprietary calculations for fair market value (FMV) indicate WEN is undervalued. Looking to the Street, covering analysts peg WEN as a consensus hold. However, their average price target stands at $24.78, implying over 20% upside potential.TJX Companies (TJX)picture of a man circling buy on a stock chartSource: ImageFlow/ShutterStock.comFor those that don’t mind adding a little risk to their defensive stocks to buy in exchange for greater reward potential, TJX Companies (NYSE:TJX) brings plenty to think about. A multinational off-price department store, TJX largely offers a relevant business profile. However, the disruption of the Covid-19 pandemic clouded the narrative. With workers operating remotely, a wardrobe upgrade wasn’t really necessary.However, TJX may enjoy two powerful upside catalysts. First, as stated above, the normalization of society should incentive an apparel upgrade. Second, should the economy weaken, off-price department stores will look much more attractive. Demand may rise, making TJX one of the top defensive stocks to buy.Also, the company features several compelling fiscal attributes. Its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 7.6%, above 64.25% of the (cyclical) retail industry. On the bottom line, its net margin pings at 7%, above 75.61% of sector players. Likely to catch people off guard, analysts peg TJX as a unanimous strong buy. What’s more, their average price target stands at $90.73, implying nearly 22% upside potential.Exxon Mobil (XOM)image of businessperson and bar graph with dollar signs to represent undervalued stocksSource: Wright Studio/Shutterstock.comDespite the political and ideological winds favoring renewable energy infrastructures, hydrocarbon specialists will likely remain relevant for years. That’s good news then for Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), one of the top defensive stocks to buy. While energy prices may suffer from rising interest rates, it’s also possible they could rise on geopolitical catalysts.Obviously, the big one centers on China. With its economic reopening, a gradual increase in commercial activity should accelerate resource consumption. Cynically, that’s a tailwind for XOM stock. Also, the aforementioned social normalization trend should see traffic volume on U.S. roadways rise. If so, this framework may spark inflation in the energy arena.After struggling during the early phase of the Covid-19 disaster, Exxon Mobil looks quite attractive financially. For example, its three-year revenue growth rate of 15.9% ranks above 70.88% of the oil and gas industry. Further, its net margin of nearly 14% beats out almost 66% of its rivals. Finally, Wall Street analysts peg XOM as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $128.17, implying over 28% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

131,b2583588-0ddc-3dbc-b278-7848c5d4d9b5,MOS,2023-03-24,A Look At The Fair Value Of The Mosaic Company (NYSE:MOS),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/look-fair-value-mosaic-company-123627339.html,1679661387,STORY,['MOS'],"[Key InsightsMosaic's estimated fair value is US$36.02 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to EquityCurrent share price of US$42.98 suggests Mosaic is potentially trading close to its fair value The US$54.69 analyst price target for MOS is 52% more than our estimate of fair valueHow far off is The Mosaic Company (NYSE:MOS) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Mosaic The MethodWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.01bUS$1.82bUS$1.20bUS$1.09bUS$875.0mUS$755.0mUS$687.2mUS$648.3mUS$626.6mUS$615.8mGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x10Analyst x11Analyst x5Analyst x2Analyst x1Est @ -13.71%Est @ -8.98%Est @ -5.66%Est @ -3.34%Est @ -1.72% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.3% US$1.9kUS$1.6kUS$949US$796US$588US$469US$394US$343US$307US$278(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$7.5bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.3%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$616m× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (8.3%– 2.1%) = US$10bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$10b÷ ( 1 + 8.3%)10= US$4.6bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$12b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$43.0, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Mosaic as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.043. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for MosaicStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is not viewed as a risk.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Chemicals market.OpportunityGood value based on P/E ratio compared to estimated Fair P/E ratio.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to decline for the next 3 years.Looking Ahead:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result.

Higher agricultural commodity prices and attractive farm economics are driving demand for fertilizers globally. Farmer economics remains attractive in most global growing regions on strong crop demand, affordable inputs, and favorable weather.Demand for grains and oilseeds remains high along with strong farm economics. Strong agricultural commodity pricing trends and improved farmer affordability are likely to drive demand for fertilizers in 2023. Higher prices are also likely to drive sales across the company’s phosphate and potash units.The company, last month, noted that it expects strong agricultural commodity pricing trends to drive the recovery of demand in the fertilizers market in 2023. Mosaic also said that the demand for grains and oilseeds is high. Higher biofuel consumption, crop production and concerns over food security are expected to continue to drive elevated crop prices through this year and potentially beyond, resulting in higher global fertilizer demand during the year.Mosaic is also taking actions to reduce costs amid a still-challenging operating environment. Its actions to improve its operating cost structure through transformation plans are expected to boost profitability. Transformational savings are also expected to drive margins in its Mosaic Fertilizantes segment.A Few HeadwindsMosaic faces headwinds from high prices of key raw material. Prices of sulfur and ammonia remain elevated, made worse by the uncertainties over the supply from Russia amid the war. Plant shutdowns and maintenance have also led to a tight supply of raw materials. The company is expected to face margin pressure associated higher input costs. Some impacts of input cost inflation are expected to continue in the first quarter of 2023.Higher costs are also likely to continue to impact margins in the Mosaic Fertilizantes segment in the first quarter. Gross margin in this unit declined around 88% year over year in the fourth quarter of 2022, hut by a decline in prices that impacted distribution and production businesses. Higher input costs also impacted margins in these businesses.

If you want to see more companies in this selection, go to the 5 Biggest Potash Companies in the World.According to the United Nations (UN), the global population is projected to reach 8.6 billion by the end of this decade, 9.8 billion by 2050, and 11.2 billion by 2100. With the growing population, there will be an increased demand for agricultural products, which will result in a higher demand for potash, a critical input for producing agricultural goods. Urbanization will also reduce the availability of farmland, making it necessary to enhance crop output. Potash fertilizer is known for providing nutrients to crops, enhancing water retention abilities, and strengthening roots and stems, making it essential for increasing crop productivity. Additionally, potash is crucial in the burgeoning cannabis industry. Currently, 95% of global potash production is used for growing food, and there are no substitutes for potash as an essential crop nutrient.The global potash industry is estimated to have produced around 40 million tonnes of potash in 2022, representing a YoY decline of 13.6%. The onset of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine in February 2022 has adversely impacted the potash market. The US and EU imposed economic sanctions on Russia and Belarus for their involvement in the conflict, resulting in significant declines in potash production in both countries. Russia, which is the second-largest producer of potash globally, saw its annual production drop from 9.1 million tonnes in 2021 to 5 million tonnes in 2022, while Belarus, the third-largest producer, experienced a drop from 7.6 million tonnes to 3 million tonnes in the same period. Despite these challenges, Brazil remains the biggest export market for Russian potash, although it plans to reduce its reliance on imported fertilizer from 85% to 45% by 2050. Despite the negative impacts of the conflict, the potash industry remains essential to global agriculture and food production.Story continuesCommodity Prices Trading Above Average Historical Levels BHP Group Limited (NYSE:BHP), Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile S.A. (NYSE:SQM), and Nutrien Ltd. (NYSE:NTR) are some of the biggest potash companies in the world. Nutrien Ltd. (NYSE:NTR), based in Saskatoon, Canada, is the world's largest producer of potash, with an estimated annual capacity of 20 million tonnes. As the largest producer of potash globally, Canada is well-positioned to meet the demand for this essential agricultural input. In response to the economic sanctions imposed on Russia and Belarus, Canada has increased its potash production from 14.2 million tonnes in 2021 to 16 million tonnes in 2022 to offset the shortage in the market. In recent years, the potash market has been oversupplied, leading to low prices and pressure on producers. However, according to the World Bank, fertilizer prices increased by 30% in 2022 due to the disruption caused by the Russia-Ukraine conflict.During Nutrien Ltd.'s (NYSE:NTR) Q4 2022 earnings call, CEO Ken Seitz highlighted that the inventory of grains is at its lowest level in 25 years, and it would require multiple crop cycles to restore the inventory to normal levels. He also shared that ""crop commodity prices are trading well above historical average levels."" He added there is an expected increase in planted acreage and crop input demand in North America and Brazil.Photo by CDC on UnsplashOur MethodologyWe shortlisted the 15 biggest potash companies in the world by analyzing their market share, production capacity, diversity of product lines, geographical distribution, and other relevant factors of major players in the potash industry.

And then you take that leap of faith. So the time has come now,"" Scindia said in an interview, adding such decisions would not necessarily be tied to specific jet orders.""Now is the time for these companies to look at planting their feet on the ground in India,"" he said.India has been lobbying quietly for jet assembly for several years but ratcheted up pressure behind the scenes during the past 12 months, two people familiar with the matter said.Story continuesThe push comes at a time when the two global plane giants are juggling the need for capacity to meet soaring demand with pressure on global supply chains and geopolitical instability.Their strategies differ, with Boeing keeping benchmark 737 production in the Seattle area, while Airbus runs four sets of competing A320 lines in Europe, the United States and China.EXISTING INVESTMENTSFor now, both appear to have resisted India's calls for civil final assembly lines (FAL), while playing up existing investments in engineering, supply chain and maintenance. Boeing said it buys $1 billion a year in parts and services from India, while Airbus said it buys $700 million.Local assembly is restricted to defence projects, where the cost of meeting national security concerns can be built in.""There's a desire in every country to have as much manufacturing as possible ... and final assembly is a desire that you see all around the world,"" Salil Gupte, president of Boeing India, told Reuters.""The volumes that you would require for final assembly on the commercial part of the business are just far, far greater,"" he said.A final decision comes down to the business case, and Boeing is always looking at opportunities to do more in India, he added.Boeing this month announced a Hyderabad plant to convert 737 passenger planes into dedicated freighters and both planemakers have engineering plants and thousands of employees in India.""Even without the C295 FAL, the Airbus industrial footprint in India already generates more foreign exchange value and jobs for the country than any modern assembly activity would,"" said Remi Maillard, president of Airbus India &amp; South Asia, by email.Still, Scindia said such an ecosystem would give planemakers ""the confidence in the years to come that they need to put a plant here, because everything is working for it"".Aerospace analysts say assembly represents just 5% to 7% of a plane's value, yet is often seen as a political win.""The reason is it puts you on the map; it shows that you are the up-and-coming economy in Asia and the world,"" said Jerrold Lundquist, managing director of The Lundquist Group.Airbus opened an A320 line in northern China in 2008 in return for an agreed volume of planes for local airlines at a time when its share of the Chinese market was only about 30%.But while Chinese authorities must approve airplane orders, analysts say the New Delhi government has little formal leverage over ordering by its cost-conscious private-sector airlines.Boeing has never put a commercial assembly line outside the United States, though McDonnell Douglas assembled a handful of jets in China before being acquired by Boeing in 1997. In 2018, it opened a 737 cabin-completion centre in Zhoushan, China.(Reporting by Tim Hepher and Aditi Shah; Additional reporting by Krishn Kaushik; Editing by Alexander Smith and Jamie Freed)]"

She did not provide further details about reasons for the delay.Starliner's debut crewed mission, which will carry commander Butch Wilmore and pilot Suni Williams, to the International Space Station will be a crucial moment for Boeing's space unit. It represents the spacecraft's final testflight before joining rival SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule as the second NASA-approved ride to orbit.Steve Stich, head of NASA's Commercial Crew Program, said in an interview with Reuters before the delay was announced that the certification process for the spacecraft had taken ""a little longer than we expected"" and was ""a whole lotta work.""A successful 10-day test mission with Starliner docked to the space station, an orbital research lab some 250 miles high in Earth's orbit, would mark a crucial milestone. Boeing has struggled to compete with Elon Musk's SpaceX in the nascent market for private astronaut flights.Finding a new launch date after April is complicated by heavy traffic at the space station over the next few months and a tight schedule for Starliner's launch provider, the Boeing-Lockheed joint venture United Launch Alliance, Boeing and NASA officials have said.The delay comes as Boeing and NASA performed extra testing on several areas of the spacecraft.Boeing software engineers are running tests with Starliner's manual flight system used as a backup in case the spacecraft's automated flight software fails, Stich said.Story continuesA Boeing spokesman said the focus for that testing is for ""added redundancy in cases of emergency.""Deliberations about mission-critical lithium ion batteries and the low chance they overheat while the spacecraft is docked to the station also took more time than expected, Stich said.In a recent pre-flight technical meeting with Boeing and NASA officials, the space station's chief safety officer and representatives from NASA's astronaut office disagreed with Boeing's plans to proceed with the mission citing concerns over the batteries, according to a person who attended the meetings.But those NASA officials eventually agreed with Boeing and others at the federal space agency that the chances of a battery mishap that would endanger the crew were low, said the person who requested anonymity to discuss preflight deliberations.Boeing also is weighing battery redesigns and a plan to add shielding in case one overheats, Stich said. SpaceX, which has already flown seven crewed missions for NASA since 2020, redesigned its spacecraft's batteries at one point, he said.""Of course, they have the luxury of having a lot of battery expertise at Tesla,"" Stich said, referring to the electric carmaker Musk leads.Boeing in a statement said on Wednesday it has had no issues with Starliner's batteries during tests.""Boeing has conducted more than a dozen Starliner battery thermal runaway tests, stressing the battery cells beyond their intended limit. No issue has surfaced,"" the company said.Stich acknowledged there had been ""a little disagreement"" during the meetings over how a potential failure of one of the battery's cells could spread to other cells. He said there have been no test failures, but added sometimes a cell got ""a little out of balance"" during past tests.The Starliner battery concerns and expected upgrades, which had not been previously reported, would add to a growing to-do list of tests and redesigns Boeing has faced before it embarks on the long-awaited operational phase of its NASA contract: six astronaut missions over the next few years.NASA has overseen Starliner's development under a $4.5 billion contract awarded in 2014. Some 80 software failures cut short an initial, uncrewed Starliner test flight in 2019. The capsule made a successful repeat of that mission in 2022.Boeing also plans to redesign a system that separates Starliner's main crew module from its service module, a trunk section containing thrusters that is ditched before the spacecraft returns to Earth, Stich said.Federal procurement data shows NASA has agreed to pay Boeing at least $24.8 million for the upgrade of that system.Boeing last year also opted to redesign valves on Starliner's propulsion system to prevent them from sticking shut prior to launch, which caused a lengthy delay in 2021.NASA and Boeing's aim to have the valves redesigned for future missions initiated a dispute with Boeing's propulsion system supplier. Aerojet Rocketdyne blamed Boeing for the problems, refusing to pay for the redesign, Reuters reported last year.Boeing has now cut Aerojet from the redesign process and is working directly with Aerojet's valve supplier, New Jersey-based company Marotta, said a person involved in the process who asked not to be identified.Aerojet and Marotta declined to comment. Boeing said ""we are working with Marotta on a valve redesign."" (Reporting by Joey Roulette, editing by Ben Klayman and Diane Craft)]"

Projected FFO per share growth rates for the first quarter and 2023 are 14.7% and 7.9%, respectively.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMAA’s well-diversified Sunbelt-focused portfolio is set to gain from healthy operating fundamentals. The pandemic has accelerated employment shifts and a population inflow into the company’s markets as renters seek more business-friendly, lower-taxed and low-density cities. These favorable longer-term secular dynamic trends are increasing the desirability of its markets.This Sunbelt-focused apartment REIT opts for opportunistic investments to maintain the right product mix and raise the number of apartment communities in dynamic markets. MAA projects development investments of $250 to $350 million and acquisitions of $350 to $450 million for 2023. Such efforts are likely to improve portfolio quality and propel the company’s growth over the long term.MAA continues to implement its three internal investment programs — interior redevelopment, property repositioning projects and Smart Home installations. The programs will help the company capture the upside potential in rent growth, generate accretive returns and boost earnings from its existing asset base.In 2022, the company completed 6,574 interior unit upgrades and installed 24,029 Smart Home packages. As of Dec 31, 2022, the total number of smart units is more than 71,000, and management expects to finish the rest of the portfolio in 2023.Along with the healthy operating fundamentals of Sunbelt markets and a robust development pipeline, the prospects of MAA’s redevelopment program and progress in technology measures are likely to drive margin expansion.MAA enjoys a solid balance sheet, with low leverage and ample availability under its revolving credit facility. As of Dec 31, 2022, MAA had a strong balance sheet with $1.3 billion in combined cash and capacity available under its unsecured revolving credit facility. It generated 95.2% unencumbered NOI in the fourth quarter of 2022, providing the scope for tapping additional secured debt capital if required.Solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticements for REIT shareholders, and MAA remains committed to that. In the last five years, MAA has increased its dividend six times, and its five-year annualized dividend growth rate is 5.45%. Check Mid-America Apartment’s dividend history here.However, with a robust development environment and continued supply-chain issues, personnel and repair and maintenance and material costs are expected to climb up. Moreover, real estate taxes and insurance costs are expected to produce significant cost pressure.  A hike in the interest rate is a concern for MAA. Rising rates imply a higher borrowing cost for the company, which will affect its ability to purchase or develop real estate. Moreover, the dividend payout might also become less attractive than yields on fixed income and money market accounts.MAA currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here.Story continuesStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the REIT sector are Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best 5G Stocks To Buy Now. 5G players are experiencing remarkable success all over the world amid strong growth catalysts. In January 2023, Nokia Oyj (NYSE:NOK) exceeded its expected operating profit for the latest quarter and predicted increased sales in 2023. The Finnish telecommunications giant stated that it was able to increase its market share by taking advantage of the 5G deployment in nations like India. In addition, Nokia Oyj (NYSE:NOK) was able to broaden its range of customers beyond network service providers to industrial clients who established their own private 5G networks at locations such as power plants, utilities, and mines, among other places. However, Ericsson announced lower than anticipated core earnings for the fourth quarter and predicted a continued decline in margins in its Networks division during the first half of 2023. The company attributed this to weak sales of 5G equipment in markets such as the United States.Moreover, AWS, the provider of computing and data storage services owned by Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), has partnered with phone companies such as T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS) and Deutsche Telekom AG to offer exclusive wireless services to businesses. The company aims to promote advanced wireless networks as an alternative to Wi-Fi in office and work environments, and has teamed up with other partners including KDDI Corp. in Japan, Orange SA in France, and Telefonica SA in Spain. The private network sector is one of AWS's main areas of focus for expanding its cloud services and boosting revenue, as the business is responsible for most of  Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s profits, although sales growth slowed down last year. According to Jan Hofmeyr, an executive at AWS, the faster 5G wireless networks can now provide companies with improved in-house connectivity. Although Wi-Fi is adequate for current uses, it has certain limitations that can be overcome with 5G's precise location, low latency, and increased bandwidth, which are particularly useful for advanced applications such as autonomous robots in manufacturing.Story continuesIn our last year's article on 5G stocks, we cited Allied Market Research, which claimed that the global market for 5G technology was valued at $5.3 billion in 2020, and it is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 65.8% from 2021 to 2030, reaching a total value of $797.7 billion by 2030. Similarly, Precedence Research stated that the global market for 5G IoT will be worth around $297.1 billion by 2030, with a CAGR of 70.04% between 2022 and 2030. The market growth is primarily being driven by several factors, including the increasing need for fast internet, the continuous improvements in 5G technology, the surge of remote work, and the expansion of 5G network coverage.Companies specializing in cloud computing, edge computing, telecommunications, and semiconductors are leading players in the 5G sector. Some of the best 5G stocks to invest in include Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). Our Methodology For this article, we selected the top 5G stocks based on overall hedge fund sentiment. Most of these stocks are pure 5G companies, but some of them include cloud service providers, holding companies whose subsidiaries are involved in the 5G sector, and semiconductor firms supporting the growing 5G ecosystems. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 943 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2022. The list is arranged in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders in each firm. 13 Best 5G Stocks To Buy NowPhoto by Mario Caruso on UnsplashBest 5G Stocks To Buy Now13. Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 43Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS) designs, develops, manufactures, and markets proprietary semiconductor products. The company provides its products for the usage in aerospace, automotive, broadband, cellular infrastructure, connected home, entertainment and gaming, industrial, medical, military, smartphone, tablet, and wearable markets. KeyBanc Capital Markets predicts that Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) will experience a robust recovery in the second half of the year due to the global economy's unstable yet expanding state and the upcoming release of new smartphone models.On March 16, Susquehanna analyst Christopher Rolland upgraded Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS) to Positive from Neutral with a price target of $135, up from $110. In April 2021, Susquehanna predicted that the semiconductor cycle had peaked, but the firm now believes that the bottom has been reached for consumer, PC, and handset-related names. As 2023 is expected to be a weaker year for Apple's sell-through, Susquehanna sees Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS) shifting its focus to capture more premium Android customers. Additionally, the firm believes that Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS), with its expertise in RF integration, has numerous opportunities to add value to its products.According to Insider Monkey’s Q4 data, 43 hedge funds were bullish on Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS), compared to 39 funds in the prior quarter. D E Shaw held the largest stake in the company, consisting of 1.14 million shares worth $104.2 million. Like Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS) is one of the best 5G stocks to invest in. Here is what Heartland Advisors specifically said about Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Before the risk-on rebound early in the quarter, we were searching for opportunities to shift from our defensive stance, looking for beaten-down, high-quality “early cycle” leaders. Existing holding, Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS), represents one such opportunity that was added to on weakness.Skyworks is one of two leading providers of radio frequency system components to smartphone makers and electronics manufacturers. With every step-up in product complexity, over the past two decades, the competitive landscape has shrunk while gross margins have increased significantly. 5G represents another such step-up, which is likely to increase how much Skyworks can make per smartphone.Apple is a big customer, accounting for more than half of Skyworks’ sales. That customer concentration has depressed Skyworks’ valuation over time. More recently, fears surrounding a global recession and risk to consumer demand have further pressured valuation. However, the handset business is expected to benefit from 5G content, which may help offset some macroeconomic pressures. Away from the handset business, Skyworks’ growth is expected to accelerate thanks to other secular drivers such as WIFI 6 and growth of the industrial internet (i.e., “Internet of Things”).At a P/E of less than eight and a 2.3% dividend yield, SWKS rarely gets this cheap, making this high-quality stock compelling for longterm investors.”12. AT&amp;T Inc. (NYSE:T)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 55AT&amp;T Inc. (NYSE:T) provides telecommunications and technology services worldwide. The company operates through two segments, Communications and Latin America. It is one of the best 5G stocks to invest in. During the fourth quarter of 2022, AT&amp;T Inc. (NYSE:T) successfully reached its target of reducing costs by $5 billion to $6 billion. This was achieved in part by eliminating 30,000 positions within its communications business, with 7,000 of those job cuts taking place specifically in the fourth quarter.On January 26, Gregory Williams, an analyst at Cowen, increased the firm's price target on AT&amp;T Inc. (NYSE:T) to $25 from $24 and maintained a Market Perform rating on the shares. The analyst pointed out that the company had strong Q4 results and provided good 2023 guidance for EBITDA, slightly below expectations free cash flow, EPS that was lower than expected, and capex that was in line with predictions.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 55 hedge funds were bullish on AT&amp;T Inc. (NYSE:T), compared to 61 funds in the prior quarter. Cliff Asness’ AQR Capital Management is the largest position holder in the company, with 18 million shares worth $333.5 million. Here is what Chartwell Investment Partners has to say about AT&amp;T Inc. (NYSE:T) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“In the Dividend Equity accounts, the three best performers in Q2 include AT&amp;T (NYSE:T, 2.5%), up 17.1%. AT&amp;T completed the spin off of the WarnerMedia business (HBO, CNN, etc.), and the market seemed to like the “back-to-basics” approach. Also, the telco business is expected to do relatively well in an inflationary environment.”11. Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 56Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) specializes in communications, technology, information, and entertainment products and services to consumers, businesses, and governmental entities worldwide. It is one of the top 5G stocks to watch. On March 2, Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) declared a $0.6525 per share quarterly dividend, in line with previous. The dividend is payable on May 1, to shareholders of record on April 10. On January 25, Cowen analyst Gregory Williams maintained an Outperform rating on Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) but lowered the firm's price target on the shares to $49 from $55. The analyst observed that the company's Q4 results were mixed, and its initial 2023 guidance was unimpressive, as price increases, strong Fixed Wireless Access (FWA) and Business Wireless segments were unable to offset the cost pressures from promotion amortization and interest expenses.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 56 hedge funds were long Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ), compared to 62 funds in the prior quarter. Ric Dillon’s Diamond Hill Capital is a significant position holder in the company, with 6.7 million shares worth $267 million. Here is what Mawer Investment Management has to say about Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“There are a few other segments of our portfolios that displayed weakness in the quarter. Cable and telecommunication companies have been an area that has lagged the broader market as their worlds are increasingly colliding. Companies such as Verizon (NYSE:VZ) have been impacted as wireless operators are spending heavily to attract internet subscribers with fixed wired access and the cable companies are trying to build wireless businesses.”10. Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 58Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL) provides data infrastructure semiconductor solutions spanning the data center core to network edge. Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL) offers a wide range of solutions for Radio Access Network (RAN) and data center applications, including Digital Front End (DFE), baseband, compute, security, switching, and optical connectivity. Marvell's silicon portfolio is designed specifically for cloud-native 5G and has been successfully implemented at scale. It is one of the best 5G stocks to invest in. On March 15, Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL) declared a $0.06 per share quarterly dividend, in line with previous. The dividend is payable on April 26, to shareholders of record on April 7. Harsh Kumar, an analyst at Piper Sandler, maintained an Overweight rating on Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL) but lowered the firm's price target on the shares to $50 from $55 on March 3. According to the analyst, the company's softer guidance was due to continued weakness in the storage business, which has impacted both the data center segment and the delay in custom cloud wins. However, the analyst believes that the worst has passed for the stock.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 58 hedge funds were bullish on Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL), and Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group held a significant position in the company, with 4.2 million shares worth $158.2 million. Carillon Tower Advisors made the following comment about Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL) provides infrastructure semiconductor solutions. Investors are concerned about the semiconductor cycle and how demand for Marvell’s products will fare in a slowing economic environment. We remain confident that the company’s portfolio of products is highly important in parts of the datacenter server market and note that the company recently has secured strong wins with large technology companies to use its products. The company also benefits from 5G wireless infrastructure build-outs that remain on pace and are generally insulated from macroeconomic pressures. With supply chain issues easing, we believe Marvell remains in a strong position to post healthy growth in 2023.”9. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 62Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) designs, develops, markets, and sells computing and related products worldwide. It operates through Client Computing Group, Data Center and AI, Network and Edge, Accelerated Computing Systems and Graphics, Intel Foundry Services, and Other segments.

D E Shaw is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 13.3 million shares worth $353.7 million. ClearBridge Large Cap Growth Strategy made the following comment about Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“A third approach to return generation is purchasing idiosyncratic businesses that largely control their own destiny. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), which we purchased in the first quarter on the premise that it would develop a leading domestic foundry business, has struggled with execution missteps and product delays. We are maintaining the position to provide ongoing exposure to semiconductors.”8. Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 72Broadcom Inc.

(NASDAQ:AVGO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Performance was also supported by communications chipmaker Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO), which has managed inventory better than peers and continues to generate healthy levels of free cash. Broadcom should benefit from a more balanced revenue mix between semiconductors and software upon the expected closing of its acquisition of VMware (VMW) in 2023.”7.

151,96c9ed11-d168-30c4-baa2-d734e2324b2f,NOC,2023-03-24,‘Our Best Long-Term Picks’: Morgan Stanley Suggests 3 High-Quality Stocks to Buy Now,TipRanks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/best-long-term-picks-morgan-135914082.html,1679579954,STORY,"['MS', 'LLY', 'NOC', 'BX']","[Stock experts often tout the merit of taking the long-term view rather than looking for short term gains. It’s a strategy that gets the thumbs up from Morgan Stanley’s US Equity Strategy team, led by Mike Wilson.Wilson has been one of the Street’s most vocal bears for a while, but while he does not see the bear market as over just yet, he forecasts a “stronger earnings picture” by next year. A friendlier monetary policy, high inflation receding, pent-up demand in investment/capex and in specific segments of consumer services, plus a recovery in global economic growth could all drive the next bull run.As for the stocks that will lead the charge, Wilson has an idea about them too: “Our best long-term picks are based on the sustainability and quality of the business model, and opportunity to widen their competitive advantage.”With this in mind, Wilson and his team have prepared a list called ‘30 for 2025’ filled with names that reflect those attributes – stocks that are ripe for the picking right now and set to generate handsome returns for the patient investor. We ran 3 of them through the TipRanks database to see what the rest of the Street makes of them. Here’s the lowdown.Blackstone Group (BX)Morgan Stanley’s recommended list is packed with market giants and the first name we’ll look at is certainly that. With $975 billion in assets under management (AUM), Blackstone is the world’s biggest alternative asset manager. As a financial product enabler, the company takes a diverse approach, and has over 12,000 real estate assets and 250 portfolio companies, whilst specializing in private equity, credit, hedge fund solutions, public debt and equity, amongst others.As private investment companies, institutional investors and the wealthy look for different options beyond traditional investment routes, there’s a growing appetite for alternative assets.Despite an overall drop in revenue, the company delivered a strong Q4 report against a backdrop of economic uncertainty. In the quarter, the company generated $43.1 billion of fund inflows, resulting in a total to $226 billion for the full year. As such, assets under management increased by 11% to $975 billion. Blackstone’s major source of income, fee-related earnings, saw a 9% uptick to reach $4.4 billion. Additionally, total distributable earnings climbed by 7% to $6.6 billion.Story continuesThat has all helped Blackstone pay a juicy dividend. The quarterly payout currently stands at $0.91, which translates to a robust 5.3% yield.While the shares have outperformed year-to-date – up 16% vs. the S&amp;P 500’s 3% return – Morgan Stanley analyst Michael Cyprys thinks they are still way undervalued.“We see a compelling entry point with shares trading at low-teens P/E on normalized earnings for a best-in-class franchise with unrivalled product breadth and distribution capabilities that can grow earnings faster than the market expects,” Cyprys explained. “BX’s long duration locked-up capital and $187b of dry powder enable BX to patiently wait for opportunities and time their exits. This yields significant firepower and staying power, which combined with their enviable brand should enable BX to navigate through cycle and come out stronger.”These comments underpin Cyprys’ Overweight (i.e. Buy) rating while his $115 price target makes room for 12-month gains of 35%. (To watch Cyprys’ track record, click here)Elsewhere on Wall Street, the stock garners an extra 9 Buys, 4 Holds and 1 Sell, for a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The average target stands at $102.31, suggesting the shares will climb ~20% higher in the year ahead. (See BX stock forecast)Northrop Grumman (NOC)From one industry giant to another. With a market cap of $69 billion, over 90,000 employees and annual revenue above $35 billion, Northrop Grumman is one of the biggest A&amp;D (aerospace and defense) companies in the world. The firm specializes in weapon manufacturing and is a provider of military technology, building defense vehicles, aircrafts, ships and space systems, amongst them the world’s most powerful space telescope – the James Webb Space Telescope.It’s a recipe that served the company well in its most recent earnings – for 4Q22. Revenue rose by 16.6% year-over-year to of $10.03 billion, beating the Street’s forecast by $390 million. Adjusted earnings climbed 25% from the same period a year ago to $7.50, coming in well ahead of the $6.57 consensus estimate. Looking ahead to FY23, the company called for revenue in the range between $38 to $38.4 billion. Consensus had $37.85 million.That said, the strong quarterly performance has been overshadowed in recent times by fears around the costs related to one of the company’s flagship programs – the development of the B-21 Raider stealth bomber. However, Morgan Stanley analyst Kristine Liwag says the concerns might be “overdone.” In fact, Liwag thinks the stock is one made for these “uncertain times.”“We see NOC as the Defense ballast to own,” Liwag said. “Peer-high growth in 2023 and a &gt;20% FCF growth CAGR through 2025 offer conviction… Space is a continued standout in the portfolio and we see management’s surprise at the extent of competitive program wins in this domain as a good problem to have. While NOC’s margins are not immune to macro pressures in 2023 and YoY pension headwinds weigh on non-cash earnings, the long-term story for NOC remains intact.”Accordingly, Liwag rates NOC an Overweight (i.e. Buy), backed by a $601 price target. The implication for investors? Upside of ~36% from current levels. (To watch Liwag’s track record, click here)Turning now to the rest of the Street, where 6 additional Buys and Holds, each, plus 1 Sell, provide the stock with a Moderate Buy consensus rating. Given the average target currently stands at $506.83, the analysts see shares rising ~15% in the year ahead. As an added bonus, Norhtrop also pays a $1.73/share quarterly dividend, which currently yields 1.56%. (See NOC stock forecast)Eli Lilly &amp; Co (LLY)The last Morgan Stanley pick we’ll look at also belongs in the giant group. Eli Lilly is a multi-national pharmaceutical firm, and in fact, with a market-cap of almost $315 billion, is bigger than both the above companies combined.With an almost 150-year-old history and with its products sold in around 125 countries, LLY has a storied background, being the first company to mass-produce the polio vaccine and one of the first to produce human insulin using recombinant DNA. Its famous products include depression drug Prozac and diabetes drugs Humalog (insulin lispro) and Trulicity. The latter was Eli Lilly’s biggest revenue generator last year, raking in ~$7.4 billion.However, in the recently reported Q4 earnings, Trulicity fell short of Street estimates, delivering $1.9 billion in revenue – amounting to ~3% year-over-year growth. Additionally, with its COVID antibody therapies adding just $38 million in sales vs. $1 billion+ in the year ago period, revenues fell by 9% y/y to $7.3 billion, falling short of the Street’s call by $74 million. However, the company posted a strong beat on the bottom-line, as adj. EPS of $2.09 came in ahead of the $0.85 forecast.LLY also has an active drug development pipeline. With results expected during H123 from both the Phase 3 study of Alzheimer’s candidate donanemab and from the Phase 3 trials of Mounjaro for obesity, Morgan Stanley’s Terence Flynn thinks there could be volatility in LLY shares. Yet, while projecting a 60% probability of success for the former, for the latter Flynn does not expect any surprises and anticipates the data will “support a filing/approval of the drug in obesity.”All told, Flynn considers LLY a Top Pick and explaind why he thinks the stock deserves a lofty valuation. He writes: “Our thesis on the stock is unchanged as we continue to expect Mounjaro and LLY’s other new product cycles (Pirto for CLL,Lebri for AD and Miri for IBD) to drive a best-in-industry rev/EPS growth profile (2023-2030 rev/EPS CAGR of 10%/18%) and operating margin expansion with 2025 EPS of &gt;$16 vs. ~$8 in 2022, deserving of a premium P/E multiple vs. the industry 2024 average of ~15x.”What it all boils down to is an Overweight (i.e. Buy) rating that sits alongside a $444 price target. Should the figure be met, investors will be pocketing returns of ~33% a year from now. (To watch Flynn’s track record, click here)Most on the Street agree with Flynn; based on a total of 11 Buys, 3 Holds and 1 Sell, the analyst consensus rates this stock a Moderate Buy.

We delivered another strong quarter in Q3, with revenue growth of 14% on a reported basis and 19% on a currency-neutral basis, exceeding our plan. Our growth this quarter was broad-based across our brands, channels and geographies. We had strong digital growth of 24%, which once again was fueled by double-digit increases in traffic on mobile and our apps. And while Direct, led by Digital, remains strong and will continue to drive our growth, our wholesale channel continues to be an important part of our strategy as we access key consumer segments and achieve distribution scale across the marketplace. Wholesale grew 18% in Q3, reflecting strong retail sales with growth that over-indexed across our strategic partners.Story continuesThis quarter continued our positive currency-neutral growth in all four of our geographies. North America, EMEA and APLA all delivered double-digit revenue growth. Greater China grew 1% despite a very challenging December following the shift in the country's COVID policies. And we're making great progress on inventory with our inventory dollars down sequentially versus last quarter. In Q3, we had inventory growth of 16% year-over-year. Our decisive actions are enabling us to navigate through the shifting dynamics with continued improved efficiency. These results demonstrate yet again that we're on track to hit our fiscal '23 priorities of getting inventory in a healthy position and delivering revenue consistent with the financial goals we set earlier in the year.In an environment of increasing macro volatility, the distinction of our brands and our Consumer Direct Acceleration strategy set NIKE apart. Looking ahead, CDA continues to unlock our future growth potential by powering up our holistic offense across innovation, brand engagement and marketplace, all fueled by consumer insight. As we know, consumers today have rising expectations and changing behaviors. What creates separation for NIKE in this dynamic environment is our innovative product, brand scale and direct connections we have with our consumers. It's these connections that serve as one of our greatest competitive advantages as we translate insight into innovation. Thanks to our consumers' love of our brand, we enjoy a high rate of engagement, fueling richer, deeper understanding.Across the company, our insights model creates confidence in growth in ways that are uniquely NIKE as we make the entire enterprise faster, more efficient and more targeted in the growth opportunities that we go after. So today, I thought we'd go through three areas where we leveraged our insights model this quarter. You may have heard us say before that running is the heart of NIKE and basketball is the soul. I'll discuss these two businesses, and then I'll talk about a product franchise that's a multibillion dollar business in its own right, Air Max. So first, let's start with Running. Since our founding, we've used elite athlete insight to innovate at the edges of human potential. And that's led to platforms like NEXT%, which remains at the front of the pack in the world of distance running.And then we use these insights and innovations to serve everyday consumers no matter where they are in their running journey. Today, we leverage our direct relationships with runners worldwide, fueled by insight from our Nike Run Club app, along with consumer feedback across brand and marketplace touch points to know how our consumers are using our product and what pain points we can solve to keep them moving. For example, we saw our Invincible consumers pushing more distance on their runs, which requires better support and protection. So this quarter, we introduced the Invincible 3, which is designed to provide maximum cushioning and comfort. It also offers a wider fit than some of our past running footwear and uses the most ZoomX foam of any of our road running shoes.It's a shoe that demonstrates how NIKE isn't just innovating for performance, but also designing to drive the lifestyle of running. Consumer response to the Invincible 3 was strong across our geos and throughout NIKE Direct, strategic wholesale partners and running specialty doors. And what really sets Invincible 3 apart is how we executed across the marketplace, driving consistent storytelling across channels, working closely with our partners to elevate our own retail presentation and theirs, all with a sharp focus on helping consumers find the right shoe for them. This approach will be accelerating as we focus on positioning ourselves for share gains in this important category. Our research with runners also leads us to launch product in complementary categories, such as trail running, which is our fastest-growing running segment.This fueled the launch in Q3 of the Pegasus Trail 4. The Peg Trail 4, which has seen over-indexing strength with female consumers, takes many of the well-loved attributes of the Peg and adds rugged features that let runners keep the pace even on looser terrain. The combination of React foam and underfoot traction has proven to be a perfect crossover shoe for runners looking to split time between road and trail. Thanks to our ability to use analytics and insight to discover opportunities for growth in running, we continue to connect to the grassroots of this global community, and we remain confident we can take full advantage of these opportunities over the long term. Next, our Basketball category is in the strongest position it's ever been as we continue to grow the energy of the game globally.Across NIKE Basketball, Jordan Brand and Converse, we've strengthened our signature athlete portfolio, adding Gen Z superstars while still being anchored by some of the game's greatest players. Last month, LeBron James set the all-time NBA scoring record in a thrilling game in L.A. I was fortunate enough to be there with our Co-Founder, Phil Knight. After the game, Phil turned to me and said, that moments and athletes like this are why we got into this business, and he's right. And as I said last quarter, the LeBron 20 was the strongest LeBron launch in years, fueled by storytelling and the blend of innovation with sportswear design. This created greater commercial appeal, as seen in Q3 with very strong sell-through throughout the marketplace, in full family sizing.This is approach we use across the portfolio, across our Nike Basketball product construct. Thanks to our ongoing dialogue with athletes from the elite to the everyday we design around three key aspects of the game: cutting fast, playing long and jumping high, all while emphasizing off-the-court style. So when we began work on a signature shoe for a playmaker and generational talent like Sabrina Ionescu, we knew the shoe would focus on cutting: helping her stop on a dime and accelerate back again. The Sabrina 1 uses research from thousands of athletes, both female and male, to create a unique traction pattern and a low-to-the-ground design that has lifestyle appeal we're thrilled about. We're excited about the potential with the Sabrina 1, and the continued power of our increased focus on Women's coming out of CDA.Over in Jordan Brand, Q3 saw the release of its own young signature shoe. Jayson Tatum debuted the Tatum 1 last month at the NBA All-Star game with fireworks, breaking the all-star record for points scored. The Tatum 1 joins the Luka, Zion, Westbrook and Game Shoe franchises for the strongest signature portfolio in Jordan Brand's history, helping fuel robust growth for the brand alongside of its consistent strength in retro. Crafted with efficiency in mind, the Tatum 1 is Jordan Brand's lightest basketball shoe and has a large volume Zoom Air bag in the forefront for energy-returning stability. Special care was given to the Tatum 1 Kids design. The kids-specific model has specialized zonal rubber on the outsole for the durability needed for young kid's style of play.But the biggest innovation in the kids design came directly from parents, including Jayson himself, who asked for an easy-on, easy-off system. In preschool and grade school versions, designers came up with a new innovative tailgate system. And in toddler sizing, there's an even simpler collapsible entry technology. The Tatum 1 represents an evolution for the Jordan Brand, shifting from serving in an individual athlete to also serving the next generation to come as well. The potential here to bring innovation into our kids business is vast as we build lifelong relationships with younger generations. Third, let's discuss NIKE's Air Max franchise. Our Air Max business continues to expand, growing double digits in Q3. Like Air Jordan, Air Max is a great example of how we build significantly scaled businesses off our greatest performance innovations.Looking again at our Insights model, Air Max also exemplifies how we brief new product by leveraging qualitative and quantitative member data science to have a sharper and more targeted focus. We're able to ask ourselves, who are the consumers we want to serve and what are they looking for. For example, the 270 has been a top 5 Air Max franchise for the past five years. But we heard from younger age groups that they want their own version, a more street-engineered durable shoe, one with a new lifestyle identity. This vision of building a future franchise for the next generation led us to create the Air Max Pulse with the broader goal of creating an entire portfolio of Classics for this generation. The Pulse connects the 270 style Air bag with a brand-new upper, bold and versatile styling and new Air Max branding.The Pulse launches on Air Max Day next week, and we can't wait for consumers to give it a try. Another Air Max model launching next week is the Design by Japan Air Max 1 '87. This women's exclusive model represents the first time our members influence product creation using polling on the SNKRS App as well as local member polling data. With just a year from conception to delivery, we relied on our Express Lane capabilities to make and deliver the product in such a short turnaround. Members who participated will be the first targeted for the shoe, creating NIKE's first full circle insights-to-shopping experience. And this is only the first example of this kind of product creation, and we look forward to seeing what we can do next. Overall, we're excited by how our focused approach to insights will fuel future growth.Nike, Brand, ShoePhoto by wu yi on UnsplashWe're still in the early innings, and we're thrilled by the possibility ahead of us as we stay dedicated to listening to the athlete and leveraging membership data to inform future products and consumer experiences. Before I close, I want to mention that in two days, on March 23, we'll release our fiscal '22 Impact report. As you know, at NIKE, purpose is deeply ingrained in everything we do. For example, you read that we've given more than 375,000 girls expanded access to sport through our community partners. In addition, we've maintained one-to-one pay equity for women and U.S. racial and ethnic minorities internally, while also helping the first of our suppliers' facilities achieve a gender equitable workplace with upward mobility for women.As you recall, two years ago, we set new quantifiable ESG targets, focusing on a wide range of priorities across people, planet and play. I encourage everyone to learn about the measurable progress we've made at purpose.nike.com as we continue to create long-term value by shaping a better future through sport. In the end, we're redefining what's possible, thanks to our close connections with consumers and how those relationships make us better again and again. We're supercharging how we serve athletes around the world with innovative product, brand engagement and experiences at retail. This promises to be yet another incredible year for sport and there's never been a better time to be in the business we're in. I could not be more excited about our future.And with that, I'll turn the call over to Matt.Matthew Friend: Thanks, John, and hello to everyone on the call. NIKE's third quarter showed that in a dynamic environment, strong brands set the pace. Two quarters ago, we took clear and decisive action in response to changing marketplace and supply chain conditions. Our top priority was to strategically manage excess inventory and drive a quicker return to a healthy pull market, and our Q3 results prove that NIKE is leading the way. NIKE is more agile, responsive and resilient than before the pandemic with operational capabilities and an experienced team that enable us to create competitive separation. While we may continue to face heightened volatility, we are confident in our ability to drive sustainable and more profitable growth.Consumer demand for our portfolio of brands remains uniquely strong, fueling unit growth of approximately 10% despite increased macro uncertainty. NIKE, Jordan and Converse, all drove double-digit currency-neutral growth this quarter. NIKE Direct outperformed with member buying frequency increasing and store sales growing across all geographies. Another quarter of industry-leading digital growth, up 24% in Q3, drove our digital share of business up to 27%. Our wholesale channel delivered a second straight quarter of outsized growth with a planned recapture of retail partner open to buy on improved inventory supply versus the prior year and strong consumer sell-through. Revenue from performance dimensions grew double digits versus the prior year with strong momentum from the Phantom GX, Invincible 3, LeBron 20 and other new product innovations.Revenue from lifestyle dimensions also remained strong as consumers continue to shift wallet share towards sport-inspired products that provide innovation, comfort and style. NIKE has been fueling this shift for more than 50 years, built on our passion for serving athletes. We have created the lifestyle around sport and have forged a deep connection to youth culture through our most iconic footwear franchises. Time and again, we take the consumer somewhere new. This quarter, we introduced new iterations of the Air Force 1 with Tiffany's Undefeated and Drake. We drove energy around our top Jordan franchises with our latest Travis Scott AJ1 and a women's exclusive AJ4. We welcomed the Year of the Rabbit with a Dunk inspired by the iconic White Rabbit candy.We celebrated the NBA All-Star Game with an Air Force 1, Dunk and Blazer collection inspired by its host city. And we connected consumers to the Air Max 1 through craftsmanship, heritage storytelling and new modern renditions. The energy that we are creating for the consumer continues to set NIKE apart. Even in a promotional environment, full price sales remain strong. And for the seventh consecutive quarter, ASP growth was positive for NIKE, Inc. with benefits from strategic pricing, product mix and our shift to direct more than offsetting the short-term cost of promotions to liquidate excess inventory. In addition to driving strong top line results, we are making tremendous progress on inventory. Let me walk through a few key points. First, inventory dollars and units are down meaningfully from last quarter.In the third quarter, total inventory dollar growth was 16% year-over-year. In North America, inventory dollar growth was 14%. In Greater China, inventory dollars declined 4% versus the prior year, positioning us well for the momentum that we are creating in the China marketplace. Next, we are making even greater progress where we are focused most. In Q3, total apparel units were down year-over-year as we continue our sharp focus on liquidating excess apparel inventory. In North America, apparel units were down high single digits. Finally, we are confident looking ahead with strong traffic and retail sales growth and reduced inventory buys for the spring and summer seasons, we are increasingly confident that we will exit the year with healthy inventories across the marketplace.In fact, given our brand momentum, we now intend to move through even more units by year-end than we had previously considered. Both transit and buying time lines continue to tighten towards pre-pandemic levels, and free cash flow accelerated this quarter through improvements in working capital. Along with an improving flow of seasonal supply, our decisive actions will enable NIKE to compete at its best, driving consumer energy through new product, seasonally relevant assortments and fresh storytelling and premium retail experiences. Regardless of the near-term uncertainty facing consumers, we will be prepared to lead and to operate from a position of strength. Now let me turn to our NIKE Inc. third quarter financial results. In Q3, NIKE, Inc.revenue grew 14% and 19% on a currency-neutral basis, with broad-based growth across brands, channels and geographies. NIKE Direct grew 22%, led by 24% growth in NIKE Digital and 19% growth in NIKE stores. Wholesale grew by 18%, driven by strong partner demand based on accelerating retail sales, higher shipments based on earlier supply availability and lower shipments in the prior year given supply constraints. Third quarter reported gross margins declined 330 basis points to 43.3% due to higher markdowns, increased product input costs, elevated freight and logistics expenses, including higher supply chain network costs in North America, partially offset by strategic pricing actions. This also includes approximately 140 basis points of impact from unfavorable changes in net foreign currency exchange rates.SG&amp;A grew 15% in Q3, primarily due to wage-related expenses, variable NIKE Direct costs and increased demand creation expenses. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 16% and substantially consistent to the same period as last year. Third quarter diluted earnings per share was $0.79. Now let's review the operating segment results. In North America, we drove strong holiday sales with momentum continuing into the new calendar year. Q3 revenue grew 27% on a currency-neutral basis, with NIKE Direct up 23% and NIKE Digital up 25%. EBIT grew 23% on a reported basis. Consumer demand drove strong growth across performance and lifestyle. LeBron, Giannis and Luka grew high double digits, fueling market share gains in basketball. A strong Invincible 3 launch energized the marketplace, doubling digital sales compared to the Invincible 2.Air Max grew double digits, and the Jordan Brand kicked off its 23rd year, also known as Jordan Year with strong double-digit growth, incredible momentum, especially with women consumers and even greater potential with a path toward becoming the #2 footwear brand in North America. Across the marketplace, we continue to capture opportunity with our growing digital advantage. Member moments throughout the quarter drove double-digit growth in repeat member buying. On the NIKE app, we integrated personalized product recommendations for members using available inventory to increase sell-through of key products. In addition, return on ad spend improved for another quarter as we test personalization and consumer experiences with activity and preference data.In EMEA, we saw strong growth across all Western European markets, including positive trends in the UK. Q3 revenue grew 26% on a currency-neutral basis, with NIKE Direct up 39% and NIKE Digital up 43%. EBIT grew 10% on a reported basis. New product innovation resonated deeply. Invincible 3 drove strong sell-through in NIKE Direct and with our retail partners. Our statement Go Leggings delivered positive early results with strong sales in NIKE Live and NIKE Rise Doors where we've been able to create a unique retail experience for her. In football, we are gaining share with a very successful launch of the Phantom GX plus sustained momentum in the Mercurial franchise. We saw strong consumer response as we continue to transform the consumer journey in Digital.Traffic grew double digits with average order value growing mid-single digits, and NIKE.com leading new member acquisition. On the NIKE App, member engagement grew double digits with the new Jordan member home button driving the highest click-through rate ever on the app. We also continue to drive convenience and improve NIKE Digital profitability by expanding O2O services, optimizing last-mile delivery and reducing digital split shipments. In Greater China, we drove top line growth despite another quarter of volatility. Q3 revenue grew 1% on a currency-neutral basis, declining 8% on a reported basis. NIKE Direct grew 3% on a currency-neutral basis with NIKE Digital declining 11% as consumer buying shifted to brick-and-mortar with the countries reopening.EBIT declined 10% on a reported basis. In December, we managed through disruption from the country's shift in COVID policies with widespread door closures. Starting in January, we began to see a rebound in brick-and-mortar traffic with strong retail momentum around Chinese New Year, accelerating into February, especially as our clean inventory position enabled us to serve consumers with fresh seasonal assortments. Throughout the quarter, we gained traction in some of our most important business dimensions: performance footwear outpace lifestyle with running up double digits, led by the Invincible 3. Meanwhile, in basketball, LeBron 20 and the GT Series resonated deeply with energy around our local Space Maker Summit and Jordan Brand's China High School Basketball League All-Star Weekend.Growth in kids surpassed other consumer segments with positive response to Hyperlocal collections, such as our Chinese New Year Leap High Express Lane pack. We are optimistic as our business momentum continues to build. In Beijing, NIKE's brand strength is deepening, extending our lead as the #1 cool and favorite brand. We are also seeing the benefits of a more local operating model as we have made investments over the past two years to serve the marketplace's unique needs. Long term, we are confident that the fundamentals of growth for NIKE in China remains strong. Finally, in APLA, NIKE's brand momentum continues to fuel strong growth. Q3 revenue grew 15% on a currency-neutral basis, including approximately 8 percentage points of headwind due to the first full quarter of impact from the transition of our Chile, Argentina and Uruguay businesses to a distributor model.NIKE Direct was up 22% with NIKE Digital growing 23%. EBIT grew 1% on a reported basis. Football grew double digits with a successful Phantom GX launch, strong sales for the Men's World Cup in December, and excitement building for the Women's World Cup this summer. In Running, we saw strong momentum across our top footwear franchises, including double-digit growth for Invincible, Infinity and Pegasus. And in fitness, the Metcon Free continues to win with consumers, growing triple digits. We also continue to accelerate opportunity in this geography through marketplace innovation. This quarter, we expanded Express Lane to bring more Hyperlocal product to consumers. In March, we introduced the NIKE App in Korea, which launched as the #1 free shopping app in one of our most digitally connected markets.And later this week, we'll open our newest World of Flight door in Tokyo, expanding the Jordan Brand's international growth. I will now turn to our financial outlook for fiscal '23. To date, we continue to see uniquely strong consumer demand as our product innovation, brand storytelling and consumer connections drive distinction and growth in the marketplace. That being said, we are closely monitoring the building pressure on consumer confidence and the uncertainties of the macro environment. We continue to take a cautious approach in planning our business, leading with intentional financial and operational guardrails. And looking ahead, we will continue to transform our operating model, unlocking speed, agility and efficiency with an improved marginal cost of growth.As a result of our strong Q3 performance, we now expect fiscal '23 reported revenue to grow high single digits, an improvement from mid-single-digit guidance in the prior quarter with approximately 600 basis points of foreign exchange headwinds. For the fourth quarter, this translates into flat to low single-digit revenue growth. Remember, more than six months ago, we strategically reduced our inventory commitments for the spring and summer seasons to ensure that both NIKE and our partners can work through excess and early arriving inventory. As a result, we expect wholesale revenue growth to moderate for the next few quarters. We expect fiscal '23 gross margin to decline approximately 250 basis points at the low end of our previous guidance range.This reflects ongoing and accelerated actions to reduce inventory by year-end, elevated freight and logistics expenses, including higher supply chain network costs in North America and 100 basis points of foreign exchange headwinds. For the full year, we expect SG&amp;A to grow approximately 10%. We continue to expect our tax rate to be in the high teens range. And consistent with my approach over the past few years, I will provide specific guidance for fiscal '24 on our next earnings call. In this environment, what sets NIKE apart is our portfolio of leading brands, our proven playbook and a team and culture of innovation that continues to deliver. We have managed through cycles like this before, and we will be well prepared for the volatility that is in front of us.With that, let's open up the call for questions.Operator: We will go first to Matthew Boss, JPMorgan.See also 10 Most Undervalued Defense Stocks to Buy and 13 Best Bank Dividend Stocks to Buy.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

This move lagged the S&amp;P 500's daily gain of 0.3%. Meanwhile, the Dow gained 0.24%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 0.34%.Heading into today, shares of the biggest U.S. mortgage lender had lost 19.15% over the past month, lagging the Finance sector's loss of 8.5% and the S&amp;P 500's loss of 1.21% in that time.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Wells Fargo as it approaches its next earnings report date. In that report, analysts expect Wells Fargo to post earnings of $1.19 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 35.23%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $20.41 billion, up 16.02% from the year-ago period.WFC's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $4.81 per share and revenue of $80.17 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +53.18% and +8.65%, respectively.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Wells Fargo should also be noted by investors. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate remained stagnant. Wells Fargo is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Valuation is also important, so investors should note that Wells Fargo has a Forward P/E ratio of 7.73 right now. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 7.4, so we one might conclude that Wells Fargo is trading at a premium comparatively.Story continuesWe can also see that WFC currently has a PEG ratio of 0.76. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. WFC's industry had an average PEG ratio of 1.08 as of yesterday's close.The Banks - Major Regional industry is part of the Finance sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 161, putting it in the bottom 37% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our individual industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Wells Fargo (WFC).Wells Fargo currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.90, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 15 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.90 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 15 recommendations that derive the current ABR, seven are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 46.7% and 13.3% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for WFCBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for WFCCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Wells Fargo here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying Wells Fargo, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABRIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Is WFC a Good Investment?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Wells Fargo, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $4.81.Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Wells Fargo. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for Wells Fargo.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Bernie Sanders over the company's decision to raise its COVID-19 vaccine price Wednesday as the company prepares to enter the commercial market after the public health emergency is declared over in May.Sanders, who chairs the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) committee, noted that the company received significant funding from the U.S. government to develop its vaccine yet is now charging the government multiple times more than during the pandemic — including for the Department of Veterans Affairs, Indian Health Services and Medicare and Medicaid.“And here is the thank you that the taxpayers of this country received from Moderna for that huge investment,"" Sanders said.“So all of us who are concerned about the deficit, the national debt – billions more goes to Moderna,"" he added.Moderna is raising the dose price from around $26 for the government during the pandemic to $130 per dose when it enters the commercial market later this year. Rival Pfizer (PFE) has also set a similar price for its vaccine, but notably did not rely on government funding for its development.Senator Bernie Sanders, an Independent from Vermont, speaks to Stephane Bancel, CEO and director of Moderna, Inc., during the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee on the price of Covid vaccines, on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC, on March 22, 2023. (Photo by Stefani Reynolds / AFP) (Photo by STEFANI REYNOLDS/AFP via Getty Images)Sanders said the move is evidence of corporate greed, as the hundreds of millions of doses purchased by the U.S. government filled the coffers of companies like Moderna, Pfizer (PFE) and Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ). A staff report from Sanders' team found these companies, along with other pharmaceutical giants, made record profits last year. Pfizer also brought in $100 billion in revenue for the first time in its history last year, with net income totaling $31.4 billion.But Bancel told the committee that there are several complex factors that are contributing to the increased price. Still, after several rounds of questioning, Bancel acknowledged that Moderna is still negotiating with insurers and various government agencies on the final price, so it could be different from $130.Story continuesHeated exchangeWhen asked by Sanders if the company would consider ""substantially charging less"" for consumers considering the taxpayer funding of the vaccine's development, Bancel balked, pointing to production costs and uncertainty of what demand for the vaccine will be this fall.""You have complexity, but you have money for stock buybacks by the billions, and you guys became billionaires, that doesn't seem too complex to me,"" Sanders said.Raising pricesBancel defended the move to raise prices saying that there was no discussion, when it first received $1.7 billion from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the Health and Human Services Department, to develop the vaccine, about the commercial market, and the price it has chosen includes additional costs it is incurring as a result of moving away from a government-controlled system.The company expects increased costs as it takes over distribution from the government — even if it uses large distributors like McKesson, Cardinal, and AmerisourceBergen, as the government did during the pandemic.""During the pandemic, we only shipped trucks to three warehouses in the U.S., when the CDC was taking the responsibility and the cost of getting the vaccines to the hospitals and the pharmacies,"" Bancel said.Moderna also expects added costs from shifting from a 10-dose vial to single doses or pre-filled syringes, as requested by pharmacies and doctors, according to Bancel.In addition, the company expects a 90% decrease in demand with an uncertain forecast for doses in the fall, compared to the millions of doses ordered by the government which helped guarantee revenue. It also will incur costs of unused or expired doses, which is currently borne by the government.All those factored into the price increase, Bancel said.The company has said taxpayers will not pay out-of-pocket costs for the vaccines. But lawmakers pointed out that there could still be a cost of administration for government agencies — a point Bancel said he was not sure about — and the list price borne by government agencies is still a charge to taxpayers.In addition, insurers bearing the cost of administration and the list price could contribute to higher premiums, lawmakers said.""Some of us have a hard time understanding how a company that made $21 billion in profit...now comes before the public and says, 'Oh by the way, we want to quadruple prices,'"" Sanders said.Bancel said that, as in any other industry, ""When you get a very large volume, you get a very big discount. That's actually what we did.""Moderna CEO and Director Stephane Bancel arrives to testify to the Senate HELP Committee on the price of the COVID-19 vaccine, Wednesday, March 22, 2023, on Capitol Hill in Washington. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)Capitalism or greed?With the loss of the large-volume government orders for its sole commercial product, the company is facing a steep reduction in revenue for 2023.""This year, if we get 30 or 50 (million doses purchased), that would be great. Actually this year, if you look at analysts' consensus, the company might be at a loss this year,"" Bancel said.During his testimony Wednesday, Bancel tried to turn the argument of wasted taxpayer dollars around on the government, pointing to the loss of taxpayer money from the government's purchases of doses in the recent booster cycle. Of the 160 million doses ordered, only 50 million have been used.""So the true cost to the taxpayer was more than $26,"" Bancel said.IMAGE DISTRIBUTED FOR AIDS HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION -Citizens held a protest and 'die in' in front of the world headquarters of COVID-19 vaccine maker Moderna, on Tuesday, August 31, 2021, in Cambridge, Mass. as part of a ""Vaccinate Our World"" campaign. Advocates charged Moderna with 'pandemic profiteering' – the company sells one of the most expensive COVID-19 vaccines in the world. (Bruce Gilbert AP Images for AIDS Healthcare Foundation.)Other lawmakers on the Senate committee either questioned or supported the business case Moderna was trying to make for its increased vaccine prices.Sen. Tammy Baldwin asked if Bancel's performance and pay package is tied to the vaccine's price, and if Moderna having spent billions on stock buybacks paired with a lower stock price than during the peak of the pandemic is pressuring the company to raise the price.Bancel claimed that neither his performance nor the company's stock price play a role in the pricing of the vaccine. He also pointed to other vaccines that are more than $200, saying he believes the company found a middle ground price.Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT) spent his allotted minutes defending the idea of the risk that Moderna and its team took in raising capital from the markets to help further fund the development of the vaccine — a total of $3.8 billion.""I recall understanding that at one point you indicated to your family that you thought there was a 5% chance it would work. So if I'm an investor, putting $3.8 billion in an enterprise that has a 5% chance of working, I got to expect that if it does work, I'm going to make an awful lot of money. Now, I've heard people say, 'Well, that's corporate greed.' Yeah, that's kind of how it works,"" Romney said.Sen. Mike Braun (R-IN), meanwhile, said the industry operates ""like an unregulated utility. You don't embrace competition, you don't embrace transparency.""Final price TBDFor now, the company has said it is still in negotiations and is waiting on the Food and Drug Administration to determine which formula will be used for the fall booster season. That will be what the company focuses on producing through the summer — and predicting how much to make.""We're trying to guess the volume that is needed, which is the manufacturing challenge we have — especially as a small company, we don't do the filling in the vials ourselves, we have to contract that to outside companies,"" Bancel said.""That is part of the cost of running a seasonal respiratory vaccine franchise,"" he added.Follow Anjalee on Twitter @AnjKhemClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"
159,de137ff9-0945-487e-b51d-dccb79a5b96d,PYPL,2023-03-24,Wall Street reacts to Hindenburg's report on Block: 'We find it highly unlikely',Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-reacts-to-hindenburgs-report-on-block-we-find-it-highly-unlikely-110047083.html,1679655647,STORY,"['SQ', 'PYPL']","[Block (SQ) is still being put in a square penalty box by Hindenburg Research.Block stock fell another 2% in early trading on Friday, after falling 15% on Thursday, as Wall Street continued to sift through a new piece of short-seller research out of Hindenburg. The digital payments outfit remains a top five trending ticker on the Yahoo Finance platform.Hindenburg Research levied accusations of fraud against the company, which was founded and led by billionaire Jack Dorsey.The research accused Block of a ""willingness to facilitate fraud against consumers and the government, avoid regulation, dress up predatory loans and fees as revolutionary technology, and mislead investors with inflated metrics.""Block hit back, but not as hard as investors wanted — which kept questions on the company's business swirling.""We intend to work with the SEC and explore legal action against Hindenburg Research for the factually inaccurate and misleading report they shared about our Cash App business today. Hindenburg is known for these types of attacks, which are designed solely to allow short sellers to profit from a declined stock price. We have reviewed the full report in the context of our own data and believe it’s designed to deceive and confuse investors. We are a highly regulated public company with regular disclosures, and are confident in our products, reporting, compliance programs, and controls. We will not be distracted by typical short seller tactics,"" Block said in a statement.Dr. Greg Werner poses for a picture with his Square (now Block) credit card reader at his office in New York on Jan. 5, 2015.(AP Photo/Seth Wenig, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)Dorsey didn't return Yahoo Finance's request for comment. Hindenburg Research didn't reply to repeated attempts to discuss its new research.Here is the vibe on Wall Street:Truist analyst Andrew Jeffrey: ""We have known Block's management team for years and have confidence in the way the [company] discusses, manages and discloses details about its Cash App business. While we think Cash App incurs some fraud, like any other P2P payments app, we find it highly unlikely that one of the most sophisticated FinTechs in the US is running rampant with systemic fraud. We also highlight that the majority of Cash App gross profit is generated by Cash Card (5x gross profit $), which requires a legitimate bank account. While anyone can order a card, it still needs to be authenticated like any bank card — including verification of an SSN and/or drivers license. To our knowledge, it is not possible to gain access to the full functionality of Cash App by using a fake SSN. To the extent Cash App fraud exists, we think authentication requirements are enough to assure that core profitability is not materially impacted. In addition to fraud assertions, the negative piece repeats a well-trodden argument that the Durbin carve out for small banks will come under scrutiny. Any change to the Durbin exemption could adversely affect Cash App's interchange revenue. That said, we don't see policymakers eliminating the Durbin carve out because it would marginalize thousands of small [financial institutions] and the communities they serve. Despite the foregoing, we recognize that increased scrutiny of fraud at any neobanking platform may result in a review of business practices and could slow user growth. We contend this is materially reflected in yesterday's 15% sell off (SPX +30bp) and SQ's ~20x estimated 2024 EBITDA multiple.""Story continuesCiti analyst Peter Christiansen: ""We've read through the activist short-seller report alleging improper compliance standards as it relates to Cash App account establishment and ongoing fraud monitoring, among other items. While Block, like any other financial institution, cannot control what people do with their money, the report raises two important lines of questioning: (i) Are (or were) Cash App fraud/KYC controls up to both regulatory and industry standards; and (ii) if not, are Cash App's growth profile, revenue retention, and user engagement the result of a mass user perception that the platform has inadequate fraud/KYC controls (i.e. are lax fraud/KYC controls perceived as a product feature). Further, given Block's mission to serve the underserved, proportionality is also a highly relevant consideration. We had hoped Block's response/refutation would be more detailed and believe 'exploring legal action' will likely not be enough to settle investors' concerns.""Keybanc analyst Josh Beck: ""In summary, we see no merit to the disparaging claims and rather view the report as observations from a relatively novice industry outsider who is not familiar with standard operating practices and principles within the FinTech industry or the broader regulatory construct. 1) Key metrics related to Cash App are defined in a logical way comparable to the broader technology universe. MAU were 51M exiting 2022, which are defined as a transacting active that has had at least one financial transaction using any product or service within Cash App, consistent with peers and other third-party data sources (that tend to only track app-based activity, not pure financial activity such as a card transaction). 2) Fees generated from sources such as interchange or instant deposit fees are standard industry practices. Cash App has ~18M card users, with a revenue model premised on interchange, a standard model across the financial services and FinTech industry. Instant deposit fees provide users with faster access to funds, an intrinsic money movement across the industry. 3) Block compliance processes are robust and consistent with industry standards. As a financial services provider, Block is subject to numerous laws and regulation including, but not limited to, payment regulation (e.g., registered with Treasury's FinCen), CFPB, AML (a collection of policies, procedures, reports and controls spearheaded by Block's chief compliance office) and clearly articulated acceptable use policy. We believe Block fully complies with applicable regulations and laws and prevents the maximal amount of fraud possible within a business that is inherently subject to, while not immune to, any instances of fraud, which is simply the reality of being a financial services provider as highlighted by the well-respected Nilson Report issue, which cited $32.3B of card fraud across issuers, merchants and acquirers in 2021.""Yahoo Finance's Ines Ferre contributed to this story.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

160,7fb60aae-0467-3dae-9b35-3e78fc0108da,IBM,2023-03-24,IBM and Cleveland Clinic are deploying the first on-site quantum computer in health care as tech promises to accelerate scientific breakthroughs,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ibm-cleveland-clinic-deploying-first-175900967.html,1679594340,STORY,['IBM'],"[Today, when researchers set out to design new drugs for diseases like cancer or Alzheimer’s, they know the process will be slow and sporadic at best. Traditional approaches to scientific research face bottlenecks arising from the process, cost, and complexity of the work, along with the amount of time it takes for classical computers to analyze massive amounts of data.But what if instead of attempting to discover and design new drugs and medicines using simple binary digits, we could use something that dramatically changes how we analyze data and what can be discovered from it? Something that could bring new therapies and cures much faster to patients in need.Technological advances lead to conceptual leaps in knowledge and the discovery of previously unimagined new paradigms. That’s one of the promises of quantum computing, a rapidly emerging technology that harnesses the laws of quantum mechanics to explore problems that are too complex for classical computers to solve. Quantum computers hold the potential to run vast simulations to design better drugs and treatments at breathtaking speeds.When most Americans learn about technologies like quantum computing, they probably assume that it comes from Silicon Valley. After all, we’re accustomed to innovation taking the form of digital apps and platforms designed by programmers who work in front of a keyboard. That model has produced countless advancements in recent years–but it isn’t the only way groundbreaking progress can be made.The truth is that many of our most vital breakthroughs in health and medicine have emerged not from the coasts, but from the heartland–where, for more than a century, Cleveland Clinic has stood at the forefront of innovation. From discovering serotonin in the 1940s and pioneering bypass surgery in the 1960s to identifying how the microbiome benefits human health in the past decade, Cleveland Clinic teams of researchers and clinicians have investigated the problems of our patients and innovated solutions.Story continuesThese discoveries have impacted health care. But they have come with a steep cost: Time. On average, it takes more than 15 years for a scientific discovery in a biomedical research lab to become a tangible therapy or diagnostic test available to patients. Not to mention, this process can take up to $100 million. With emerging technologies such as quantum computing, artificial intelligence, and cloud, we can change this. What once took decades could now be achieved in months and can become more affordable and less time-intensive for research teams.That’s why IBM is partnering with Cleveland Clinic to introduce the first quantum computer ever deployed on site in the private sector–and the first in the world dedicated to biomedical and health research. Unveiled this week at its permanent home on Cleveland Clinic’s campus in Ohio, IBM Quantum System One is part of a groundbreaking effort to significantly speed up the pace of scientific breakthroughs.For researchers at Cleveland Clinic, it means the chance to develop more precise, targeted, and effective medicines–and more accurately predict which patients will encounter life-threatening and chronic diseases.For people across the country, it means the potential to make major leaps forward in the fight against complex diseases–and a new technology platform that can serve as a model for every region to make breakthroughs of their own.For Clevelanders and Northeast Ohioans, it means well-paying jobs in cutting-edge fields. It strengthens the city’s position as a globally recognized hub of innovation. And it sends a clear message to the nation and the world that the American heartland is a place where the future is being written.We don’t yet know precisely which breakthroughs quantum computing will help us achieve–and which medicines, models, vaccines, and therapies they could make possible.But we do know that by working to dramatically reduce the time it takes to investigate the most complex mysteries of human health, this effort will close the gap between imagination and discovery–between the impossible and the possible. Quantum and other advanced computing technologies will help us expedite progress toward new treatments and cures for our patients.We are grateful to the city of Cleveland, the state of Ohio, and all of the local, state, and national leaders who have made this work possible by investing in pioneering research and in our scientific infrastructure.We are excited to embark on this journey of discovery–delivering more jobs to the heartland, more opportunities to the nation, and more medical breakthroughs to the world.Serpil Erzurum, M.D., is Cleveland Clinic's chief research and academic officer.

161,ba161494-a936-30d6-9151-1cf7df0b44c8,IBM,2023-03-24,How Technology Can Help Save Our Water Supply,ACCESSWIRE,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/technology-help-save-water-supply-142000771.html,1679581200,STORY,['IBM'],"[NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / March 23, 2023 / IBMIBM, Thursday, March 23, 2023, Press release pictureIBM BlogA 2021 United Nations report finds that 2.3 billion people live in water-stressed countries which, according to the World Health Organization, is expected to be exacerbated in some regions due to climate change and population growth.To sustain lives on Earth, we must protect the health of its water resources and be efficient in our consumption, including minimizing waste in water distribution. These tasks involve a variety of equipment, assets, and people, and at IBM, we have deep experience in using technology to bring together data and systems to assist. We know how to connect and contextualize information from various sources, and how to leverage AI to translate such data into actionable insights-ones that can make a true difference in solving sustainability challenges like these.Our sustainability solutions enable organizations to marry data with AI insights so they can better manage operations and optimize them. With data-driven technology, we can help organizations reduce waste and protect our precious water resources to meet the needs of current and future generations.Eliminating WasteOne type of waste is unaccounted-for or non-revenue water (NRW)-water that has been produced but is ""lost"" before it reaches the user. The World Bank estimates that some 45 million cubic meters of water are lost daily due to issues like leaks and pipe bursts-adding up to a value of over US$3 billion per year. Merely cutting the amount of NRW in developing countries by half would translate to enough fresh water to serve around 90 million people.The first step in cutting NRW is knowing where it is occurring, and that's where IBM's sustainability solutions can help. For example, the IBM Maximo Application Suite incorporates various sources of information from Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems, and visual inspection data, and applies AI to detect anomalies in pipes or pumps. If the system pressure drops and flow levels surge, operators will receive a real-time alert that a pipe burst has occurred. Maximo is also effective at detecting smaller changes that are indicative of minor leaks or malfunctions in pumping equipment.Story continuesAnother way to cut NRW involves better management of the overall health of water distribution systems. Many municipalities and companies operate infrastructure with aging components. Even in developed countries, water and sewer pipes can remain in use for well over a century. To maintain these systems, organizations will often schedule routine maintenance work based on the age of components. Yet the oldest pipes in a system might not necessarily be the ones that are in the worst condition.Maximo-and the IBM TRIRIGA Application Suite-can help monitor and manage water infrastructure and provide predictive insights that enable more informed decisions. Maximo comes with out-of-the-box tools designed specifically for the water industry to predict where issues will likely arise based on the analysis of KPIs. With a range of custom predictive analytics tools, engineers and operators can have improved visibility to the integrity of their infrastructure and reduce NRW events. Utility companies can also avoid expenses associated with unnecessary maintenance on infrastructure that is performing perfectly fine.To help improve access to safe drinking water to all, IBM is committed to continuing to offer our technology to support this cause. This year, the new cohort of our IBM Sustainability Accelerator-our global, pro bono social impact program-will apply IBM technologies and expertise to scale innovative water management solutions. IBM will look to support projects that help improve equitable access to safe drinking water for all, improve water quality by reducing pollution, increase water-use efficiency across all sectors, protect and restore water-related ecosystems, increase sanitation management, and reduce the number of people suffering from water scarcity - among other purposes.Protecting QualityIn addition to minimizing water waste, we must also protect the quality of water resources. For example, for the past 10 years, IBM has been working with Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and the Lake George Association, a non-profit lake advocacy group, at Lake George in upstate New York. Our shared goal has been to monitor anthropogenic changes to the lake, or those environmental changes influenced directly or indirectly by people. The project employs a sophisticated system of IoT sensors, AI, analytics technologies, and predictive computer models to paint a detailed, real-time, and ongoing picture of the water's quality and movement. When a health and public safety issue emerges-like a harmful algal bloom (HAB), which can render water undrinkable for humans and animals-this project helps us understand the cause.At Lake George, IBM Research's scientists and engineers developed an integrated platform to perform visualization and analytics of nearly every important aspect of the lake and its surrounding watershed. This platform pulled in detailed weather data from IBM at a 330-meter resolution and 10-minute intervals, including: temperature, precipitation, wind speed, air pressure, and solar radiation. The data is then fed into a hydrological model with information on rainfall and snow melt, so the team can understand the rate and direction of the water flowing into the lake. This combined data in turn feeds a hydrodynamic model, which explains how water is moving within the lake itself.The result of this work is a picture of how the lake's physics, chemistry, and biology are changing-from the rise in chloride levels caused by the runoff of anti-icing salt used on the surrounding roadways, to the presence of nutrients from septic systems, wastewater treatment plants, and fertilizers that could be contributing to HABs. The team then runs computer models to calculate how these alterations can be reversed through better controls and advises the local municipality on best practices for their remediation. In response to models that showed the lake's resiliency, or, its ability to return to more pristine conditions should salinated runoff be curbed, the Lake George Association launched The Lake George Road Salt Reduction Initiative.The open-source technology has already had its foundation applied to other lakes around the country, including Chautauqua Lake in Western New York and Skaneateles Lake in the Finger Lakes district in New York.Improving OperationsSignificant challenges exist toward meeting the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals of water and sanitation for everyone by 2030, and achieving these goals will need all of the good ideas and collaboration we can muster, aided by technology. Fortunately, collecting the underlying data necessary to assess our progress against sustainability goals is increasingly a priority for businesses and governments, and technology has not only enabled improved insights from, but also greater transparency of data. These insights and new transparency have allowed businesses, governments, and local communities to partner in new way through more holistic decision making that meet their collective needs.For example, in Melbourne, Australia, the government-owned authority that protects and manages major water resources for the city, Melbourne Water, treats about 90% of sewage at their Eastern and Western Treatment Plants. One of Melbourne Water's primary expenses is its energy consumption, which is required to support activities of water management. Their energy consumption accounts for about half the total carbon emissions of the state's water sector. Mindful of the water-energy nexus, Melbourne Water is using the IBM Envizi ESG Suite to help proactively manage its portfolio of transactional energy data and to eliminate the data retention and reporting challenges hindering improvements in operational efficiency and advancements against sustainability goals.Now, Melbourne Water stakeholders have a direct view into a single source of data for all of the organization's energy and emissions metrics. Using Envizi reporting tools and leveraging the value of data to support its sustainability efforts, Melbourne Water has been able to focus on protecting the public water supply and meeting the needs of its customers while lowering its operational impact on climate.While there are numerous important issues facing communities around the globe, IBM has been committed to environmental responsibility for more than 50 years. As indicated in its 2021 ESG Report, IBM views environmental leadership as a long-term strategic imperative, demonstrated today as we continue to set ambitious goals and apply our technologies to accelerate solutions to global environmental challenges. For example, as part of its 21 goals for environmental sustainability, IBM's water conservation goal is to achieve year-to-year reductions in water withdrawals at larger IBM locations in water-stressed regions.As we observe World Water Day this year, we are highlighting these examples to show how applying technology to solve the most pressing challenges like the global water crisis can help us make meaningful and demonstrable progress toward achieving our sustainability goals.Learn more about IBM Sustainability solutionsView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from IBM on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: IBMWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/ibmEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: IBMView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/745436/How-Technology-Can-Help-Save-Our-Water-Supply]"

WAL stock has tumbled over the last week amid fears triggered by the failures of a few other U.S. regional banks. Even after rebounding in the latter part of last week, the shares are still down over 50% from their Feb. 2 high of $80.60.But unlike the American regional banks that went under, WAL has very little of its funds in fixed-income assets, it has invested a meaningful portion of its assets in highly rated securities, and the mean duration of its assets is a relatively short 5.5 years.Also noteworthy is that the bank’s “unrealized losses” are quite low, while there’s no evidence that it is a major player in the highly volatile crypto place.What’s more, Western Alliance should be boosted by the tremendous number of companies opening up factories in Arizona. Even if WAL doesn’t make lucrative loans to these companies directly, it should be able to provide highly profitable loans to its suppliers and provide mortgages to its employees.Story continuesFinally, UBS views WAL as the best regional bank stock and placed an $85 price target on the name, while Citadel, a highly successful hedge fund owned by the highly admired veteran investor Ken Griffin, recently “disclosed a passive stake of about 5.4%” in WAL, Seeking Alpha reported.The forward price-earnings ratio of WAL stock is a tiny and very attractive seven (at the time of writing).All of these characteristics make WAL one of the best value stocks to buy.General Motors (GM)Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comGM (NYSE:GM) is continuing to execute well and deliver strong results. After the automaker reported that its fourth-quarter revenue had soared 28% year-over-year and predicted that its 2023 “Net automotive cash provided by operating activities” would come in at a very impressive $16 billion to $20 billion, Bloomberg quoted its CEO recently as saying that the automaker’s Q1 sales were exceeding its expectations. Moreover, the company’s selling prices are not falling, the CEO, Mary Barra, reported.On Feb. 2, Citi increased its price target on GM to $82 from $81, saying that the stock’s risk/reward ratio was much better than in recent history. Expressing pleasure with the company’s Q4 results, the firm kept a “buy “rating on the shares and named GM stock as one of its top picks.Meanwhile, the automaker is employing a strategy of selling multiple, affordable EVs under $30,000. As more consumers become aware of the strength of GM’s EVs through buying these affordable vehicles, they’re likely to purchase the automaker’s more expensive, profitable EVs.GM’s EV deliveries jumped 57% last year to over 39,000. It’s introducing four new EVs in 2023, including electric versions of the Silverado, the Equinox, and the Blazer, and it is taking steps to ramp up its EV production in general.GM’s forward price-earnings ratio is a tiny, extremely attractive 6.6x.IBM (IBM)Quantum computing stocks: Sign of IBM with Canada Head Office Building in background in Markham, Ontario, Canada. IBM is an American multinational technology company.Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comMany investors may not realize that IBM (NYSE:IBM) is a solid play on two very powerful tech trends — AI and the cloud –, but the company is indeed becoming a leading player in both sectors.On the artificial intelligence front, IBM is using AI to “help [companies] more effectively monetize and optimize investments in their [5G] networks.”For businesses, IBM’s hybrid cloud approach makes sense because depending on one cloud provider can lead to “significant periods of downtime” that, in turn, result in a great deal of lost revenue. So it’s not surprising that IBM recently reported that companies’ utilization of “hybrid multicloud environments” is rapidly increasing.Also noteworthy is that, under CEO Arvind Krishna, who began the job in 2021, IBM has greatly emphasized partnering with other major firms. For example, the company has launched collaborations with Nokia (NYSE:NOK) and Juniper (NYSE:JNPR), two major players in the telecom technology space.In the hybrid cloud sector alone, under Krishna, IBM has launched “four to five different partnerships that” generate over $1 billion of sales annually, CFO James Kavanaugh reported recently.IBM’s strategies appear to be working as analysts, on average, expect the company’s earnings per share to climb to $9.48 this year and $10.10 in 2024.The shares trade at a very low forward price-earnings ratio of 13.5x.Lennar (LEN)len stockSource: madamF / Shutterstock.comA few macro trends are working in Lennar’s (NYSE:LEN) favor. Specifically, the homebuilder should benefit from America’s housing shortage, interest rates that have fallen sharply in recent days amid a few bank failures, and the continued, strong American labor market.Encouragingly, on the company’s recent fourth-quarter earnings call, Executive Chairman Stuart Miller said, “the housing supply shortage… continues to drive customers to stretch their wallet {and} the housing market is beginning to find a point of stabilization and customers, both primary and institutional are coming to grips with the new normal of higher but acceptable interest rates.”Meanwhile, the 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage rate dropped to 6.6% during the week of March 13 versus 6.73% during the previous week.And very impressively, Lennar’s home deliveries actually increased 9% year-over-year last quarter, while its earnings per share rose to $2.06 from $1.69.The forward price-earnings ratio of LEN stock is a very low 10.5x.Adobe (ADBE)Adobe logo on the smartphone screen is placed on the Apple macbook keyboard on red desk background. ADBE stock.Source: Tattoboo / ShutterstockAdobe (NASDAQ:ADBE), which develops software that helps companies create digital content, recently reported strong fourth-quarter results, as its top line climbed 9.2% year-over-year to $4.66 billion, and its earnings per share increased to $2.71 from $2.66.Moreover, the company actually increased its 2023 EPS guidance range to $15.30 to $15.60 from $15.15 to $15.45.Adobe reported benefiting from the strong adoption of its Substance 3D software, which equips its users with a “virtual studio.” Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Louis Vuitton are among its corporate users. ADBE is also benefiting from the increased use of digital technology to disseminate and sign legal documents, as the revenue of its Documents Cloud business climbed 16% year-over-year to a record $634 million.Finally, Adobe recruited several very impressive new corporate clients last quarter, including Disney (NYSE:DIS), IBM, and Nintendo (OTCMKTS:NTDOY).Trading at a very reasonable price-earnings ratio of 22.4x, ADBE stock is very attractive at its current levels.Bank of America (BAC)The logo of Bank of America (BAC) in modern office building in Beverly Hills, CaliforniaSource: Tero Vesalainen/ShutterstockAmid the failure of a few narrowly focused banks, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) stock tumbled 18% in the month that ended on March 16.Many pundits are saying or suggesting that the banks’ failures and the troubles faced by Credit Suisse (NYSE:CS) were caused by the Fed’s interest rate hikes. But I believe that they were caused primarily by stupid decisions made by those banks.As I wrote on Stocktwits on March 17, “Signature, Silvergate, and SVB either made very stupid bond purchases or got caught up in the crypto bubble or both. $CS got caught doing [allegedly] illegal activities. Blaming their failures/problems on the macro economy is like saying that a slightly bumpy road caused a driver to get into a bad accident while he was texting. ” Obviously, it was the driver’s stupid decision to text while driving, not the slightly bumpy road, that caused the accident.Actually, the American economy is strong, as the Atlanta Fed estimates that U.S. GDP will grow at a huge, inflation-adjusted, annualized 3%, while the labor market remains very strong. Meanwhile, interest rates remain high, but the Fed will stop raising rates before they get high enough to stop economic growth.In this environment, Bank of America and other large, well-run U.S. banks can make a great deal of money by providing loans at high rates to thriving businesses. Moreover, with many smaller banks pulling back on their loans and the deposits of BAC and its peers jumping amid fears about smaller banks, the large banks, including BAC, should be able to generate very strong, profitable loan growth going forward.BAC stock has a very low forward price-earnings ratio of 8.6x.MGM (MGM)A photo of the MGM logo on the MGM casino building.Source: Michael Neil Thomas / Shutterstock.comI’ve long been very bullish on MGM (NYSE:MGM), which gives investors tremendous exposure to the thriving city of Las Vegas and the rapidly growing phenomenon of internet sports betting.My optimism about MGM has proved to be justified, as the stock has climbed 24% in 2023 and about 50% since its June low.On Feb. 24, British bank Barclays also became upbeat about MGM stock, starting coverage of the name with a “buy” rating and a hefty $59 price target.“MGM has attractive premium positioning in both Las Vegas and U.S. regionals, with any near to medium “cooling off” risk more than offset by upside from Macau’s ongoing recovery, though Las Vegas shows no signs of slowing,” the bank wrote.Macau is China’s gambling hub, where MGM has a significant, although not very large, presence. In February, Macau’s gross gaming revenue jumped 33% year-over-year and 40% from 2019 levels.Finally, Bank of America recently named MGM as a stock that thrives during an era of high interest rates.MGM has a very attractive trailing price-sales ratio of 1.4x.As of the date of publication, Larry Ramer owned shares of WAL and MGM.

Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Molson Coors Q4 Earnings Beat, Sales Lag EstimatesMolson Coors reported fourth-quarter 2022 results, wherein the bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, while the top line missed the same. Both metrics improved year over year. Results gained from strength in core brands, particularly Coors Light and Miller Lite, as well as the above premium portfolio and contributions from its Revitalization Plan.The company’s adjusted earnings of $1.30 per share surged 61% year over year and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.06.Net sales inched up 0.4% to $2,629.5 million and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,669 million. On a constant-currency basis, net sales rose 3.8% due to positive pricing, and a favorable sales mix stemming from portfolio premiumization, offset by a decline in financial volumes.Quarterly DetailsNet sales per hectoliter increased 11.4% on a financial-volume basis, driven by strong net pricing, a positive channel mix and a favorable sales mix from portfolio premiumization.Molson Coors’ worldwide brand volumes fell 5.2% to 18.7 million due to sluggishness in the America segment, stemming from a sluggish industry performance. Financial volumes declined 6.9% to 19.7 million hectoliters due to lower volumes in the Americas, partly offset by increased EMEA and APAC volumes.Underlying (non-GAAP) earnings before income taxes (EBT) advanced 52.5% year over year to $328.6 million. On a constant-currency basis, EBT rose 51.1%.Story continuesSegmental InformationMolson Coors operates under the following geographical segments.Americas: Net sales in the segment decreased 0.7% to $2,131.3 million on a reported basis but rose 0.4% on a constant-currency basis due to favorable pricing and the positive sales mix, offset by a decline in financial volumes. Financial volumes dipped 10.5% year over year on reduced Canada shipments and an 11.2% decrease in U.S. domestic shipments.Brand volume for the segment dropped 6.6% on a 6.8% decline in the United States, owing to softer industry performance and a 5% dip in Canada due to the weak beer industry and a 6.9% decline in Latin America.Net sales per hectoliter, on a brand volume basis, rose 12.1% on a constant-currency basis due to a favorable sales mix and higher net pricing. Underlying EBT improved 31% and 30% on a reported and constant-currency basis, respectively, to $346.5 million. The increase can be attributed to higher pricing, favorable sales mix and lower MG&amp;A expenses, offset by cost inflation on materials, transportation and energy costs.EMEA &amp; APAC: The segment’s net sales (on a reported basis) grew 6.2% to $503.2 million and improved 20.3% on a constant-currency basis. Higher constant-currency sales resulted from financial volume growth, favorable pricing and a positive sales mix. Net sales per hectoliter (on a brand volume basis) for the segment advanced 14.9% on a constant-currency basis, resulting from a favorable sales mix, as well as higher pricing.The segment’s financial volumes rose 4.7% due to growth in the above-premium portfolio. Brand volume decreased 1% due to volume declines resulting from the Russia-Ukraine conflict, somewhat offset by volume growth.The segment’s underlying EBT increased significantly from $4.6 million to $28.1 million on a reported basis and improved $23.7 on a constant-currency basis, driven by higher financial volumes, favorable pricing and sales mix, which offset cost inflation, particularly in materials, transportation and energy costs.Other Financial UpdatesMolson Coors ended the fourth quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $600 million. At the end of fourth-quarter 2022, the company had a total debt of $6,562.3 million, resulting in net debt of $5,962.3 million.As of Dec 31, 2022, the company provided $1,502 million in cash by operating activities, resulting in an underlying free cash flow of $852.9 million. For 2023, capital expenditure is likely to be $700 million, plus or minus 5%In the quarter under review, the company declared and paid out cash dividends of 38 cents per share, with the CAD equivalent totaling C$1.95 per share.

As of Dec 31, 2022, TAP repurchased 995,000 shares for $51.5 million.OutlookDespite continued inflationary pressures and weakness in the beer industry, management issued the 2023 view. Net sales are projected to grow year over year in the low-single digits on a constant-currency basis. Underlying EBT is likely to grow year over year in the low-single digits on a constant-currency basis.Underlying depreciation and amortization are projected to be $690 million, plus or minus 5%. The company expects an underlying effective tax rate of 21-23%. Consolidated net interest expenses are anticipated to be $240 million, plus or minus 5%. Underlying free cash flow is likely to be $1 billion, plus or minus 10%.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in estimates revision.The consensus estimate has shifted -9.75% due to these changes.VGM ScoresCurrently, Molson Coors has a nice Growth Score of B, however its Momentum Score is doing a bit better with an A.

Notably, the company's current ratio, a measure of liquidity, was pegged at 1.32 at the end of third-quarter fiscal 2023.

Launched Jan. 1, 2022, PNC's Community Benefits Plan pledges to provide $88 billion in loans, investments and other financial support to bolster economic opportunity for low- and moderate-income (LMI) individuals, communities and people of color.The one-year report (see documents to view full report) provides an overview of PNC's first year (Jan. 2022-Jan. 2023) of performance, approach and progress in supporting affordable homeownership, small business, neighborhood revitalization and charitable giving. By leveraging PNC's national scale, we're driving patient capital into local communities and building a more inclusive financial system. One year into its four-year Plan, PNC has deployed $35.1* billion to bring this commitment to life.""In our first year under the plan, PNC delivered more than $35.1 billion*--that's transformational lending and investing that is expanding access to affordable housing, creating generational wealth, advancing small business and minority entrepreneurs, and supporting community development and revitalization,"" said Richard Bynum, chief corporate responsibility officer for PNC. ""I'm proud of the very real impact we are making in communities across our footprint.""Key Highlights Supporting Home Lending and Affordable Homeownership: Building on our efforts to drive meaningful homeownership growth, affordability and wealth creation in the communities where our customers live, work and play, PNC is investing in down-payment and closing cost assistance as well as other home-buying resources to advance home ownership and to reduce the wealth gap in low to moderate income (LMI) and majority-minority census tracts.Expanded Access to Capital for Entrepreneurs and Small Businesses: Consistent with PNC's efforts to reduce barriers to banking and increase access to credit, we have deepened our commitment to small business by collaborating enterprise-wide to help deliver financial solutions that position LMI, minority-owned and micro (less than $1 million in annual revenues) businesses for effective growth, development, and sustainability.Story continuesLending and Investing in Impactful Community Development Initiatives: Investments in affordable rental housing, workforce development, and economic revitalization in LMI neighborhoods and communities of color continues to be a priority for PNC as we continue the work to move all forward financially.Purpose-Driven Philanthropy: PNC's commitment to building stronger communities goes beyond loans and investments. Through our national main street bank model, PNC employees deliver time, talent and financial resources to local community organizations and nonprofits dedicated to engaging and empowering people and communities in need.Closing Gaps in Community Wealth With Clear Solutions: Many communities lack access to traditional banking services that often are the catalyst for financial stability and community wealth-building.

""When a child is in that online world, it's like they're alone; they don't have a parent or guardian to watch out for them. I had a couple of experiences with predators, people trying to get your personal information. By the time you click on something, it's too late.""Fortunately, Hamilton's parents, Joseph and Tracy, had warned him of the dangers and he was able to keep himself safe. ""A lot of my ideals come from my parents,"" he said. ""They taught me from a young age that it's important to be the difference in the ways that you can.""True to that mindset, Hamilton thought about the online safety issues and the potential for a responsible game development company to make a positive difference. So, he created IX Studio.""IX Studio creates immersive role-playing games for people of all ages to enjoy,"" Hamilton said. ""What separates us from other game design companies is that we try to take accountability for the dangers our games could present through the Internet. We develop relationships with our gamers on [social platform] Discord to minimize the threats accessible to the kids. I feel it's our responsibility to take safety seriously.""On Feb. 3, Hamilton's business idea placed first at the inaugural PNC North Carolina HBCU Initiative Pitch Competition, where the student-entrepreneur won a $2,500 cash prize for his pitch, IX Studio: Empowering others, through gaming. He competed against eight other teams, with entrants from Elizabeth City State University and Winston-Salem State University finishing second and third, respectively.The competition, judged by a multi-disciplinary panel on attributes like innovation, feasibility and professionalism, builds on the Feb. 2022 launch of the PNC North Carolina HBCU Initiative, an effort designed to enrich the future of entrepreneurship and workforce opportunities for students at the five N.C. Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) represented at the competition, which also included Fayetteville State University and Johnson C. Smith University.Story continuesA total of more than $2 million in grant funding from PNC Foundation is being awarded to these five institutions over a three-year period to support the development and delivery of entrepreneurship resources and programming.A business owner at age 19Hamilton learned of the pitch competition with just days to prepare. Collis Arrick, executive director of the Center for Entrepreneurship and Economic Development at North Carolina Central, recommended him for the event after becoming an informal advisor to Hamilton, an IT major who needed some business advice.""My company was already generating revenue, and someone was trying to buy it for $60K,"" Hamilton said. ""I have no business experience, and my dad and uncle gave me the advice to find someone in my business department who knows business.""I met Mr. Arrick, who said he was going to have his son play one of my games that same night. The next day he called and told me about the pitch competition, saying, ‘You have four days. If you think you can do it, I want you to go.' I immediately took the opportunity; win or lose, I'm here for the experience.""Hamilton called the pitch competition a ""very unique experience"" that he never expected to win, especially when many other competitors had several months to prepare and had participated in pitch competitions at their respective institutions. ""It was such a good environment, and I never saw such a group of creative ideas and bright minds,"" he said. ""The judges had great insights and offered everyone feedback.""""The competition provided a forum for North Carolina's future business leaders to share their unique approaches to entrepreneurship and the creation of innovative products, services and solutions - while demonstrating skills and learnings from entrepreneurship programming and resources made possible through the PNC North Carolina HBCU Initiative,"" said Weston Andress, PNC regional president for Western Carolinas.""Based on the student presentations we saw during the competition and the meaningful learnings and advancements taking place in these institutions' classrooms and communities every day, it's clear that the future is bright for innovation and entrepreneurship in North Carolina,"" added Jim Hansen, PNC regional president for Eastern Carolinas.True to his valuesFor Hamilton, growing as an entrepreneur pays off not just for him, but for a community of about 30 developers he has working with him from around the U.S. as contractors.""Discord [a VoIP and instant messaging social platform] has a talent hub, and they reach out to me with their portfolios,"" he said. ""I try to help everybody increase their exposure, earn money and make sure they have a seat at the table. When I don't know the answer, someone on the team knows the answer. It's a great workspace where everybody is humble, collaborative and diverse.""The value he places on diversity is one reason why attending an HBCU was important to Hamilton, a Charlotte native.""Often we can't get into spaces because we don't understand those spaces, and a lot of students don't understand the opportunities that college presents to them,"" he said. ""I want to try to get my hands into a little bit of everything and set a high standard that inspires my peers, so that they can go on to inspire their peers.""""Jahmir's goals are reflective of how HBCUs and their student-entrepreneurs are contributing to Black economic mobility in communities across the country,"" said Gina Coleman, PNC's chief diversity officer. ""HBCUs have a rich history dating back to the 19th century, with many already engaged in activities designed to enhance Black entrepreneurship. The added investment of support and resources helps to propel these future business leaders, as they complete their higher education journey within these historic institutions.""As for Hamilton's business, he plans to put his $2,500 prize money right back into his games.""I want to build at least two more games by the time I graduate in 2025 and help our platform get more reach to these kids, and not just for monetary gain,"" said Hamilton.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this retailer have returned -5%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -1.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Retail - Discount Stores industry, which Target falls in, has lost 4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Target is expected to post earnings of $1.76 per share, indicating a change of -19.6% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -16.9% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $8.45 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +40.4%. This estimate has changed -11.9% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.54 indicates a change of +24.8% from what Target is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -6.4%.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Target.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for TGT _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Target, the consensus sales estimate of $25.36 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +0.8%. The $111.27 billion and $113.7 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +2% and +2.2%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryTarget reported revenues of $31.4 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +1.3%. EPS of $1.89 for the same period compares with $3.19 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $30.69 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.29%. The EPS surprise was +35.97%.Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Target is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Target. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NASDAQ:ISRG)?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/now-opportune-moment-examine-intuitive-120205763.html,1679659325.0,STORY,['ISRG'],"[Let's talk about the popular Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG). The company's shares saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NASDAQGS, rising to highs of US$282 and falling to the lows of US$225. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Intuitive Surgical's current trading price of US$244 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Intuitive Surgical’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. See our latest analysis for Intuitive Surgical What's The Opportunity In Intuitive Surgical?Intuitive Surgical is currently expensive based on my price multiple model, where I look at the company's price-to-earnings ratio in comparison to the industry average. In this instance, I’ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock’s cash flows. I find that Intuitive Surgical’s ratio of 64.76x is above its peer average of 36.3x, which suggests the stock is trading at a higher price compared to the Medical Equipment industry. But, is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Given that Intuitive Surgical’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.Can we expect growth from Intuitive Surgical?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Intuitive Surgical's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 54%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? ISRG’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading above industry price multiples. However, this brings up another question – is now the right time to sell? If you believe ISRG should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards the industry PE ratio can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on ISRG for a while, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its industry peers, which means it is likely that there is no more upside from mispricing. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for ISRG, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.Diving deeper into the forecasts for Intuitive Surgical mentioned earlier will help you understand how analysts view the stock going forward.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best 5G Stocks To Buy Now. 5G players are experiencing remarkable success all over the world amid strong growth catalysts. In January 2023, Nokia Oyj (NYSE:NOK) exceeded its expected operating profit for the latest quarter and predicted increased sales in 2023. The Finnish telecommunications giant stated that it was able to increase its market share by taking advantage of the 5G deployment in nations like India. In addition, Nokia Oyj (NYSE:NOK) was able to broaden its range of customers beyond network service providers to industrial clients who established their own private 5G networks at locations such as power plants, utilities, and mines, among other places. However, Ericsson announced lower than anticipated core earnings for the fourth quarter and predicted a continued decline in margins in its Networks division during the first half of 2023. The company attributed this to weak sales of 5G equipment in markets such as the United States.Moreover, AWS, the provider of computing and data storage services owned by Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), has partnered with phone companies such as T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS) and Deutsche Telekom AG to offer exclusive wireless services to businesses. The company aims to promote advanced wireless networks as an alternative to Wi-Fi in office and work environments, and has teamed up with other partners including KDDI Corp. in Japan, Orange SA in France, and Telefonica SA in Spain. The private network sector is one of AWS's main areas of focus for expanding its cloud services and boosting revenue, as the business is responsible for most of  Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s profits, although sales growth slowed down last year. According to Jan Hofmeyr, an executive at AWS, the faster 5G wireless networks can now provide companies with improved in-house connectivity. Although Wi-Fi is adequate for current uses, it has certain limitations that can be overcome with 5G's precise location, low latency, and increased bandwidth, which are particularly useful for advanced applications such as autonomous robots in manufacturing.Story continuesIn our last year's article on 5G stocks, we cited Allied Market Research, which claimed that the global market for 5G technology was valued at $5.3 billion in 2020, and it is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 65.8% from 2021 to 2030, reaching a total value of $797.7 billion by 2030. Similarly, Precedence Research stated that the global market for 5G IoT will be worth around $297.1 billion by 2030, with a CAGR of 70.04% between 2022 and 2030. The market growth is primarily being driven by several factors, including the increasing need for fast internet, the continuous improvements in 5G technology, the surge of remote work, and the expansion of 5G network coverage.Companies specializing in cloud computing, edge computing, telecommunications, and semiconductors are leading players in the 5G sector. Some of the best 5G stocks to invest in include Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). Our Methodology For this article, we selected the top 5G stocks based on overall hedge fund sentiment. Most of these stocks are pure 5G companies, but some of them include cloud service providers, holding companies whose subsidiaries are involved in the 5G sector, and semiconductor firms supporting the growing 5G ecosystems. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 943 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2022. The list is arranged in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders in each firm. 13 Best 5G Stocks To Buy NowPhoto by Mario Caruso on UnsplashBest 5G Stocks To Buy Now13. Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 43Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS) designs, develops, manufactures, and markets proprietary semiconductor products. The company provides its products for the usage in aerospace, automotive, broadband, cellular infrastructure, connected home, entertainment and gaming, industrial, medical, military, smartphone, tablet, and wearable markets. KeyBanc Capital Markets predicts that Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) will experience a robust recovery in the second half of the year due to the global economy's unstable yet expanding state and the upcoming release of new smartphone models.On March 16, Susquehanna analyst Christopher Rolland upgraded Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS) to Positive from Neutral with a price target of $135, up from $110. In April 2021, Susquehanna predicted that the semiconductor cycle had peaked, but the firm now believes that the bottom has been reached for consumer, PC, and handset-related names. As 2023 is expected to be a weaker year for Apple's sell-through, Susquehanna sees Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS) shifting its focus to capture more premium Android customers. Additionally, the firm believes that Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS), with its expertise in RF integration, has numerous opportunities to add value to its products.According to Insider Monkey’s Q4 data, 43 hedge funds were bullish on Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS), compared to 39 funds in the prior quarter. D E Shaw held the largest stake in the company, consisting of 1.14 million shares worth $104.2 million. Like Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS) is one of the best 5G stocks to invest in. Here is what Heartland Advisors specifically said about Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Before the risk-on rebound early in the quarter, we were searching for opportunities to shift from our defensive stance, looking for beaten-down, high-quality “early cycle” leaders. Existing holding, Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS), represents one such opportunity that was added to on weakness.Skyworks is one of two leading providers of radio frequency system components to smartphone makers and electronics manufacturers. With every step-up in product complexity, over the past two decades, the competitive landscape has shrunk while gross margins have increased significantly. 5G represents another such step-up, which is likely to increase how much Skyworks can make per smartphone.Apple is a big customer, accounting for more than half of Skyworks’ sales. That customer concentration has depressed Skyworks’ valuation over time. More recently, fears surrounding a global recession and risk to consumer demand have further pressured valuation. However, the handset business is expected to benefit from 5G content, which may help offset some macroeconomic pressures. Away from the handset business, Skyworks’ growth is expected to accelerate thanks to other secular drivers such as WIFI 6 and growth of the industrial internet (i.e., “Internet of Things”).At a P/E of less than eight and a 2.3% dividend yield, SWKS rarely gets this cheap, making this high-quality stock compelling for longterm investors.”12. AT&amp;T Inc. (NYSE:T)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 55AT&amp;T Inc. (NYSE:T) provides telecommunications and technology services worldwide. The company operates through two segments, Communications and Latin America. It is one of the best 5G stocks to invest in. During the fourth quarter of 2022, AT&amp;T Inc. (NYSE:T) successfully reached its target of reducing costs by $5 billion to $6 billion. This was achieved in part by eliminating 30,000 positions within its communications business, with 7,000 of those job cuts taking place specifically in the fourth quarter.On January 26, Gregory Williams, an analyst at Cowen, increased the firm's price target on AT&amp;T Inc. (NYSE:T) to $25 from $24 and maintained a Market Perform rating on the shares. The analyst pointed out that the company had strong Q4 results and provided good 2023 guidance for EBITDA, slightly below expectations free cash flow, EPS that was lower than expected, and capex that was in line with predictions.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 55 hedge funds were bullish on AT&amp;T Inc. (NYSE:T), compared to 61 funds in the prior quarter. Cliff Asness’ AQR Capital Management is the largest position holder in the company, with 18 million shares worth $333.5 million. Here is what Chartwell Investment Partners has to say about AT&amp;T Inc. (NYSE:T) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“In the Dividend Equity accounts, the three best performers in Q2 include AT&amp;T (NYSE:T, 2.5%), up 17.1%. AT&amp;T completed the spin off of the WarnerMedia business (HBO, CNN, etc.), and the market seemed to like the “back-to-basics” approach. Also, the telco business is expected to do relatively well in an inflationary environment.”11. Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 56Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) specializes in communications, technology, information, and entertainment products and services to consumers, businesses, and governmental entities worldwide. It is one of the top 5G stocks to watch. On March 2, Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) declared a $0.6525 per share quarterly dividend, in line with previous. The dividend is payable on May 1, to shareholders of record on April 10. On January 25, Cowen analyst Gregory Williams maintained an Outperform rating on Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) but lowered the firm's price target on the shares to $49 from $55. The analyst observed that the company's Q4 results were mixed, and its initial 2023 guidance was unimpressive, as price increases, strong Fixed Wireless Access (FWA) and Business Wireless segments were unable to offset the cost pressures from promotion amortization and interest expenses.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 56 hedge funds were long Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ), compared to 62 funds in the prior quarter. Ric Dillon’s Diamond Hill Capital is a significant position holder in the company, with 6.7 million shares worth $267 million. Here is what Mawer Investment Management has to say about Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“There are a few other segments of our portfolios that displayed weakness in the quarter. Cable and telecommunication companies have been an area that has lagged the broader market as their worlds are increasingly colliding. Companies such as Verizon (NYSE:VZ) have been impacted as wireless operators are spending heavily to attract internet subscribers with fixed wired access and the cable companies are trying to build wireless businesses.”10. Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 58Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL) provides data infrastructure semiconductor solutions spanning the data center core to network edge. Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL) offers a wide range of solutions for Radio Access Network (RAN) and data center applications, including Digital Front End (DFE), baseband, compute, security, switching, and optical connectivity. Marvell's silicon portfolio is designed specifically for cloud-native 5G and has been successfully implemented at scale. It is one of the best 5G stocks to invest in. On March 15, Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL) declared a $0.06 per share quarterly dividend, in line with previous. The dividend is payable on April 26, to shareholders of record on April 7. Harsh Kumar, an analyst at Piper Sandler, maintained an Overweight rating on Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL) but lowered the firm's price target on the shares to $50 from $55 on March 3. According to the analyst, the company's softer guidance was due to continued weakness in the storage business, which has impacted both the data center segment and the delay in custom cloud wins. However, the analyst believes that the worst has passed for the stock.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 58 hedge funds were bullish on Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL), and Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group held a significant position in the company, with 4.2 million shares worth $158.2 million. Carillon Tower Advisors made the following comment about Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL) provides infrastructure semiconductor solutions. Investors are concerned about the semiconductor cycle and how demand for Marvell’s products will fare in a slowing economic environment. We remain confident that the company’s portfolio of products is highly important in parts of the datacenter server market and note that the company recently has secured strong wins with large technology companies to use its products. The company also benefits from 5G wireless infrastructure build-outs that remain on pace and are generally insulated from macroeconomic pressures. With supply chain issues easing, we believe Marvell remains in a strong position to post healthy growth in 2023.”9. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 62Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) designs, develops, markets, and sells computing and related products worldwide. It operates through Client Computing Group, Data Center and AI, Network and Edge, Accelerated Computing Systems and Graphics, Intel Foundry Services, and Other segments.

D E Shaw is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 13.3 million shares worth $353.7 million. ClearBridge Large Cap Growth Strategy made the following comment about Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“A third approach to return generation is purchasing idiosyncratic businesses that largely control their own destiny. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), which we purchased in the first quarter on the premise that it would develop a leading domestic foundry business, has struggled with execution missteps and product delays. We are maintaining the position to provide ongoing exposure to semiconductors.”8. Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 72Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) designs, develops, and supplies semiconductor devices worldwide. Chipmakers such as Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) supply products to the market for 5G network equipment.

(NASDAQ:AVGO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Performance was also supported by communications chipmaker Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO), which has managed inventory better than peers and continues to generate healthy levels of free cash. Broadcom should benefit from a more balanced revenue mix between semiconductors and software upon the expected closing of its acquisition of VMware (VMW) in 2023.”7.

Despite solid gains in the Internet of Things and Auto segments, Qualcomm’s dominant business remains the smartphone market. We expect to see stabilization of the smartphone market in 2023, including a recovery in China.”6. T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 94T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS) provides mobile communications services in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the United States Virgin Islands. It is one of the most prominent 5G providers in the US.

VZ recently announced the launch of BlueJeans Basic, a free virtual video conferencing plan for users that allows attendees to meet as long as they want. The new feature by Verizon subsidiary BlueJeans, which offers an interoperable cloud-based video conferencing service across a wide range of devices and conferencing platforms, is aimed to facilitate a seamless transition to a hybrid workplace with a spontaneous and engaging interactive digital platform.BlueJeans Basic allows up to 25 persons to meet on a single platform equipped with HD video, spatial audio, industry-leading noise reduction and dynamic leveling for impeccable call quality. Leveraging AES 256-bit encryption, BlueJeans Basic also includes enterprise-grade security features like Waiting Room, Screen Sharing Controls and the option to Hard Mute participants individually or upon entering the meeting.It is likely to create an immersive virtual office to facilitate organic conversations in a hybrid work environment and simulate a real-life experience in a digital workplace. Such technological innovations are likely to provide flexibility to remote workers and unlock workplace productivity and happiness. By creating a virtual space that simulates a real-life office environment where distributed teams can collate together to brainstorm, organize and socialize, BlueJeans aims to address a major hurdle in today’s hybrid work reality.With one of the most efficient wireless networks in the United States, Verizon deploys the latest 4G LTE Advanced technologies to deliver faster peak data speeds and capacity for customers, driven by customer-focused planning, disciplined engineering and constant strategic investment. The company remains focused on making necessary capital expenditures due to the expansion of 5G mmWave in new and existing markets, the densification of the 4G LTE wireless network to cater to huge traffic demands across multiple verticals and the continued deployment of the fiber infrastructure.Verizon’s 5G mobility service offers an unparalleled experience that impacts industries as diverse as public safety, health care, retail and sports. The company’s 5G network hinges on three fundamental drivers to deliver the full potential of next-generation wireless technology. These are massive spectrum holdings, particularly in the millimeter-wave bands for faster data transfer, end-to-end deep fiber resources and the ability to deploy a large number of small cells. To expand coverage and improve connectivity, Verizon has acquired 161MHz of mid-band spectrum in the C-Band auction for a total consideration of $45.5 billion. These airwaves offer significant bandwidth with better propagation characteristics for optimum coverage in rural and urban areas.The stock has lost 26.9% over the past year compared with the industry’s decline of 13.8%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchVerizon carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Key PicksArista Networks, Inc.

Tech stocks have been the biggest beneficiary, with the Nasdaq 100 (^NDX) up 7.6%.Nasdaq 100 Components — 9-Day ReturnsLong-term rates crashed over these nine trading sessions, which fueled rallies in megacaps like Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), Tesla (TSLA), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), and Meta (META) — which all rallied double-digits. Chipmakers Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) led the way — up 19% and 23%, respectively.Yet the rally was not broad-based. Not surprisingly, financials suffered additional damage from the bank panic. The S&amp;P 500 Select Financial SPDR Fund (XLF) erased the last of its pandemic gains Thursday. Meanwhile, the SPDR S&amp;P Regional Bank ETF (KRE) sank to a new crisis low — the lowest level since November 2020.Story continuesPutting the narrow breadth of the latest rally aside for a minute, even the technicals on the tech trade are showing some cracks.Zooming out on the Nasdaq 100 reveals it has been stuck in a giant trading range over the last year — roughly 10,500 to 13,000. And it is once again testing that upper bound, having failed there as recently as early February.The catalyst of lower rates and a weaker dollar are also approaching some big levels, with the U.S. 10-year Treasury-note (^TNX) hugging the 3.4% level by the 2023 lows.Even the greatest bellwether stock of all, Apple, is up against some tough technicals that suggest its rally may need a ""pause"" before rallying materially above $165.Apple (AAPL) has rallied to big, long-term levels of interestWithout a fresh catalyst and narrative, investors chasing momentum and breakouts are more likely to be punished than rewarded.In the meantime, Kenneth Rogoff, Maurits C. Boas chair of International Economics at Harvard University, has a message for investors who are betting on the banking crisis abating.""If we're looking at the world as a whole, I believe we're just experiencing the first wave of this, and there are more to come,"" said Rogoff on Yahoo Finance Live Thursday.What to Watch TodayEconomyDurable goods orders, February; S&amp;P flash U.S. composite PMIEarningsExpress (EXPR)—Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceDownload the Yahoo Finance app for Apple or AndroidFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, and YouTube]"

200,cbbdafe6-ce2a-3286-b527-52becf7a2405,APD,2023-03-24,7 Defensive Stocks to Buy During This Chaotic Spell,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-defensive-stocks-buy-during-223105438.html,1679351465,STORY,"['TJX', 'APD', 'PGR', 'XOM', 'WEN', 'MRK']","[While it’s always a good idea to balance your portfolio with defensive stocks, the present chaos dramatically incentivizes this subsegment. As you’ve no doubt heard, the U.S. and the rest of the world presently reel from two major banks failing. Moreover, the main concern centers on the contagion spreading to other components of the global economy.What really adds weight to the drama here is of course the Federal Reserve. The central bank must decide how to navigate monetary policy in light of recent developments. If the Fed reacts with a more dovish stance, it would contradict its stated intentions of controlling inflation. However, if it continues with interest rate hikes, this hawkish framework could break more cogs in the flywheel.No matter what, the Fed faces a gargantuan task with serious consequences either way. Basically, it’s caught between a rock and a hard place. With investors deeply (and understandably) concerned, the most-established businesses probably make the most sense. In that spirit, below are the defensive stocks to buy during this chaotic spell.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsPGRProgressive$139.07SAPSAP$121.38MRKMerck$105.85APDAir Products &amp; Chemicals$279.21WENWendy’s$21.05TJXTJX Companies$75.40XOMExxon Mobil$102.45Progressive (PGR)Man holding stacks of money. Millionaire.Source: Epic Cure / ShutterstockAs an insurance stalwart, Progressive (NYSE:PGR) makes for an ideal candidate for defensive stocks to buy. Featuring an established and permanently relevant business, PGR features predictability in the financials and the technicals. Further, the chaos from the coronavirus pandemic – such as heightened traffic incidents and property crime – incentive financial protection programs.Most importantly, Progressive garners the most attention for its auto insurance. Required by the vast majority of states, drivers practically can’t go anywhere (legally) without coverage. Therefore, Progressive cynically benefits from a captive audience.Story continuesTo be fair, the company doesn’t deliver the most remarkably positive financials. However, it does enough to get the job done. For example, Progressive’s three-year revenue growth rate pings at 8.3%, above 59.45% of its peers. As well, the company enjoys a long history of consistent annual profitability. Finally, Wall Street analysts peg PGR as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target comes in at $147, implying nearly 8% upside potential.SAP (SAP)A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.Source: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.comA German multinational software company, SAP (NYSE:SAP) develops enterprise software to manage business operations and customer relations. Further, the company is the world’s leading enterprise resource planning software vendor. Given the size and influence of its business, SAP makes for an ideal choice for defensive stocks to buy. Even with various economic challenges, companies must continue to operate. More often than not, the large players use SAP.While the company features far-from-perfect financials, it offers plenty of substance to chew on. For example, SAP’s Altman Z-Score pings at 4.09, indicating low bankruptcy risk. Operationally, its three-year free cash flow (FCF) growth rate comes in at 21.9%, above 64.74% of the industry. As well, its net margin is 7.4%, ranked better than 70.91% of sector rivals. Also, investors may note that right now, the market prices SAP at a forward multiple of 20.41. As a discount to earnings, SAP ranks better than 60.98% of the field.Lastly, covering analysts peg SAP as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $137, implying 15% upside potential.Merck (MRK)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar billsSource: shutterstock.com/CC7A multinational pharmaceutical giant, Merck (NYSE:MRK) makes for an intriguing case for defensive stocks to buy. Basically, no matter what happens with the global markets, people will need access to therapeutics and vaccines. While MRK incurred a volatile ride in the year so far, in the past 365 days, it gained almost 32% of equity value. Better yet, there may still be extra room in the tank.Overall, Merck enjoys a solid fiscal profile. Notably, its Altman Z-Score comes in at 4.49, which indicates low bankruptcy risk. Operationally, the company posts a three-year revenue growth rate of 15.4%, above nearly 75% of the drug manufacturing industry. Also, its book growth rate during the same period is 21.1%, well above average. On the bottom line, Merck’s net margin pings at 24.49%. This stat helps undergird the company’s forward yield of 2.8%, noticeably above the healthcare sector’s average yield of 1.58%.In closing, analysts peg MRK as a consensus moderate buy. Further, their average price target stands at $119.95, implying over 15% upside potential.Air Products and Chemicals (APD)tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comAn industrial player, Air Products and Chemicals (NYSE:APD) specializes in selling gases and chemicals for industrial uses. Fundamentally, APD makes for a solid case for defensive stocks to buy because of its “backstage” utility. While Air Products may not be a Broadway star so to speak, its services undergird various applications. Without the company, infrastructural networks could fail.In fairness, APD went volatile this year, shedding over 10% since the January opener. However, in the trailing one-year period, APD gained almost 19% of its equity value. On the financial front, Air Products delivers the goods. Its three-year revenue growth rate pings at 12.3%, ranking better than 67.43% of the competition. Also, it’s a stable business, as its Altman Z-Score of 4.44 indicates. On the bottom line, Air Products features a net margin of 17.61%, above 86.52% of sector players. Also, these robust earnings support the company’s forward yield of 2.55%.Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg APD as a consensus moderate buy. Moreover, their average price target stands at $324.67, implying over 18% upside potential.Wendy’s (WEN)Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words ""buy"" and ""sell"" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image.Source: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.comA popular fast-food chain, Wendy’s (NASDAQ:WEN) makes a compelling case as one of the defensive stocks to buy. Though it’s tied to the consumer discretionary sector, Wendy’s benefits from the trade-down effect. Essentially, as economic conditions worsen, consumers will eschew fine-dining establishments for cheaper fare like Wendy’s. That’s one positive catalyst.The other tailwind centers on social normalization. As white-collar employees return to the office, Wendy’s coffee and breakfast menu could be appealing to worker bees. In addition, Wendy’s offerings would compete effectively on price with premium-label coffee shops.Generally speaking, WEN represents one of the defensive stocks to buy that features just enough positives. For instance, the underlying company’s three-year revenue growth rate stands at 10.1%, above 84.45% of the competition. On the bottom line, its net margin comes in at 8.46%, boxing out 83.33% of sector players. Plus, Gurufocus’ proprietary calculations for fair market value (FMV) indicate WEN is undervalued. Looking to the Street, covering analysts peg WEN as a consensus hold. However, their average price target stands at $24.78, implying over 20% upside potential.TJX Companies (TJX)picture of a man circling buy on a stock chartSource: ImageFlow/ShutterStock.comFor those that don’t mind adding a little risk to their defensive stocks to buy in exchange for greater reward potential, TJX Companies (NYSE:TJX) brings plenty to think about. A multinational off-price department store, TJX largely offers a relevant business profile. However, the disruption of the Covid-19 pandemic clouded the narrative. With workers operating remotely, a wardrobe upgrade wasn’t really necessary.However, TJX may enjoy two powerful upside catalysts. First, as stated above, the normalization of society should incentive an apparel upgrade. Second, should the economy weaken, off-price department stores will look much more attractive. Demand may rise, making TJX one of the top defensive stocks to buy.Also, the company features several compelling fiscal attributes. Its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 7.6%, above 64.25% of the (cyclical) retail industry. On the bottom line, its net margin pings at 7%, above 75.61% of sector players. Likely to catch people off guard, analysts peg TJX as a unanimous strong buy. What’s more, their average price target stands at $90.73, implying nearly 22% upside potential.Exxon Mobil (XOM)image of businessperson and bar graph with dollar signs to represent undervalued stocksSource: Wright Studio/Shutterstock.comDespite the political and ideological winds favoring renewable energy infrastructures, hydrocarbon specialists will likely remain relevant for years. That’s good news then for Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), one of the top defensive stocks to buy. While energy prices may suffer from rising interest rates, it’s also possible they could rise on geopolitical catalysts.Obviously, the big one centers on China. With its economic reopening, a gradual increase in commercial activity should accelerate resource consumption. Cynically, that’s a tailwind for XOM stock. Also, the aforementioned social normalization trend should see traffic volume on U.S. roadways rise. If so, this framework may spark inflation in the energy arena.After struggling during the early phase of the Covid-19 disaster, Exxon Mobil looks quite attractive financially. For example, its three-year revenue growth rate of 15.9% ranks above 70.88% of the oil and gas industry. Further, its net margin of nearly 14% beats out almost 66% of its rivals. Finally, Wall Street analysts peg XOM as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $128.17, implying over 28% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

202,f3665e71-8abf-3e21-99f8-fec53fcfb54e,CMI,2023-03-24,Investors Heavily Search Cummins Inc. (CMI): Here is What You Need to Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-cummins-inc-130001816.html,1679576401,STORY,['CMI'],"[Cummins (CMI) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this engine maker have returned -8.2%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -1.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Automotive - Internal Combustion Engines industry, which Cummins falls in, has lost 7.6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Cummins is expected to post earnings of $4.70 per share, indicating a change of +16.3% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.1% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $18.95 points to a change of +25.3% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $19.53 indicates a change of +3% from what Cummins is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Cummins.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for CMI _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Cummins, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $8 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +25.3%. For the current and next fiscal years, $32.06 billion and $32.07 billion estimates indicate +14.2% and +0% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryCummins reported revenues of $7.77 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +32.8%. EPS of $4.52 for the same period compares with $2.85 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.36 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +5.6%. The EPS surprise was -3%.Over the last four quarters, Cummins surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Cummins is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Cummins. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

203,2c774b8c-05ba-38b8-b418-60fdb9cf2d30,DIS,2023-03-24,Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) Has A Pretty Healthy Balance Sheet,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walt-disney-nyse-dis-pretty-120158372.html,1679659318,STORY,['DIS'],"[David Iben put it well when he said, 'Volatility is not a risk we care about. What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. We note that The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) does have debt on its balance sheet. But the more important question is: how much risk is that debt creating?When Is Debt A Problem?Generally speaking, debt only becomes a real problem when a company can't easily pay it off, either by raising capital or with its own cash flow. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, debt can be an important tool in businesses, particularly capital heavy businesses. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together. See our latest analysis for Walt Disney What Is Walt Disney's Debt?The image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that Walt Disney had debt of US$48.4b at the end of December 2022, a reduction from US$54.1b over a year. On the flip side, it has US$8.47b in cash leading to net debt of about US$39.9b.debt-equity-history-analysisA Look At Walt Disney's LiabilitiesZooming in on the latest balance sheet data, we can see that Walt Disney had liabilities of US$27.1b due within 12 months and liabilities of US$66.2b due beyond that. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of US$8.47b as well as receivables valued at US$14.0b due within 12 months. So its liabilities total US$70.8b more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables.This deficit isn't so bad because Walt Disney is worth a massive US$175.1b, and thus could probably raise enough capital to shore up its balance sheet, if the need arose. But it's clear that we should definitely closely examine whether it can manage its debt without dilution.Story continuesIn order to size up a company's debt relative to its earnings, we calculate its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) divided by its interest expense (its interest cover). This way, we consider both the absolute quantum of the debt, as well as the interest rates paid on it.Walt Disney's debt is 3.4 times its EBITDA, and its EBIT cover its interest expense 4.4 times over. This suggests that while the debt levels are significant, we'd stop short of calling them problematic. On the other hand, Walt Disney grew its EBIT by 23% in the last year. If sustained, this growth should make that debt evaporate like a scarce drinking water during an unnaturally hot summer. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Walt Disney's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.Finally, a company can only pay off debt with cold hard cash, not accounting profits. So it's worth checking how much of that EBIT is backed by free cash flow. Looking at the most recent three years, Walt Disney recorded free cash flow of 32% of its EBIT, which is weaker than we'd expect. That's not great, when it comes to paying down debt.Our ViewOn our analysis Walt Disney's EBIT growth rate should signal that it won't have too much trouble with its debt. But the other factors we noted above weren't so encouraging. For instance it seems like it has to struggle a bit handle its debt, based on its EBITDA,. When we consider all the factors mentioned above, we do feel a bit cautious about Walt Disney's use of debt. While debt does have its upside in higher potential returns, we think shareholders should definitely consider how debt levels might make the stock more risky. Over time, share prices tend to follow earnings per share, so if you're interested in Walt Disney, you may well want to click here to check an interactive graph of its earnings per share history.When all is said and done, sometimes its easier to focus on companies that don't even need debt.

(AP) — Unions for service workers at Walt Disney World reached a tentative deal with the company on Thursday that would raise the starting minimum wage from $15 to $18 an hour by the end of the year in a pact that could set the basement for starting pay throughout central Florida's sprawling tourism industry.Disney World service workers who are in the six unions that make up the Service Trades Council Union coalition planned to vote next Wednesday on the contract proposal after rejecting an earlier offer that fell short of the $18 hourly minimum wage last month. The agreement covers around 45,000 service workers at the Disney theme park resort outside Orlando. Workers could see their hourly wages rise between $5.50 and $8.60 by the end of the five-year contract if it's approved, union leaders said.""Securing an $18 minimum hourly rate this year, increasing the overall economic value of Disney’s original offer, and ensuring full back pay for every worker are the priorities union members were determined to fight for,” said Matt Hollis, head of the coalition of unions. “Today, we won that fight.”Disney said in a statement that the tentative deal also included “industry-leading” benefits in health insurance coverage and tuition reimbursement.“Our cast members are central to Walt Disney World’s enduring magic, which is why we are pleased to have reached this tentative agreement,"" Jeff Vahle, president of Walt Disney World Resort, said in the statement.The contract with the service workers covers the costumed performers who perform as Mickey Mouse and other Disney characters, bus drivers, culinary workers, lifeguards, theatrical workers and hotel housekeepers, representing more than half of the 70,000-plus workforce at Disney World. The contract approved five years ago made Disney the first major employer in central Florida to agree to a minimum hourly wage of $15, setting the trend for other workers in the region dominated by hospitality jobs.Story continuesThe contract proposal with the largest group of workers at the resort comes at a precarious time for Disney World. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and the GOP-controlled Florida Legislature recently passed legislation giving the Republican governor the power to appoint the governing board of the district that oversees government services for the 27,000-acre (11,000-hectare) resort. The board previously had been controlled by Disney.The takeover of the Disney district began last year when the entertainment giant, facing intense pressure, publicly opposed the so-called “Don’t Say Gay"" legislation, which bars instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity in kindergarten through third grade and lessons deemed not age-appropriate.DeSantis has built a national reputation as a culture warrior ahead of an expected GOP presidential run.___Follow Mike Schneider on Twitter at @MikeSchneiderAP]"

214,47c6373a-ba65-3af7-8dfb-4712325a1395,CL,2023-03-24,Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) Seems To Use Debt Quite Sensibly,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/colgate-palmolive-nyse-cl-seems-140041667.html,1679580041,STORY,['CL'],"[The external fund manager backed by Berkshire Hathaway's Charlie Munger, Li Lu, makes no bones about it when he says 'The biggest investment risk is not the volatility of prices, but whether you will suffer a permanent loss of capital.' So it seems the smart money knows that debt - which is usually involved in bankruptcies - is a very important factor, when you assess how risky a company is. As with many other companies Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) makes use of debt. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.When Is Debt A Problem?Debt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more common (but still painful) scenario is that it has to raise new equity capital at a low price, thus permanently diluting shareholders. By replacing dilution, though, debt can be an extremely good tool for businesses that need capital to invest in growth at high rates of return. The first step when considering a company's debt levels is to consider its cash and debt together. See our latest analysis for Colgate-Palmolive How Much Debt Does Colgate-Palmolive Carry?You can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that as of December 2022 Colgate-Palmolive had US$8.72b of debt, an increase on US$7.22b, over one year. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$950.0m, its net debt is less, at about US$7.77b.debt-equity-history-analysisHow Strong Is Colgate-Palmolive's Balance Sheet?Zooming in on the latest balance sheet data, we can see that Colgate-Palmolive had liabilities of US$4.00b due within 12 months and liabilities of US$10.9b due beyond that. On the other hand, it had cash of US$950.0m and US$1.50b worth of receivables due within a year. So its liabilities total US$12.5b more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables.Story continuesWhile this might seem like a lot, it is not so bad since Colgate-Palmolive has a huge market capitalization of US$59.9b, and so it could probably strengthen its balance sheet by raising capital if it needed to. But it's clear that we should definitely closely examine whether it can manage its debt without dilution.We use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.We'd say that Colgate-Palmolive's moderate net debt to EBITDA ratio ( being 1.9), indicates prudence when it comes to debt. And its commanding EBIT of 23.6 times its interest expense, implies the debt load is as light as a peacock feather. Sadly, Colgate-Palmolive's EBIT actually dropped 5.7% in the last year. If that earnings trend continues then its debt load will grow heavy like the heart of a polar bear watching its sole cub. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Colgate-Palmolive can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.Finally, while the tax-man may adore accounting profits, lenders only accept cold hard cash. So we always check how much of that EBIT is translated into free cash flow. During the last three years, Colgate-Palmolive produced sturdy free cash flow equating to 71% of its EBIT, about what we'd expect. This cold hard cash means it can reduce its debt when it wants to.Our ViewColgate-Palmolive's interest cover suggests it can handle its debt as easily as Cristiano Ronaldo could score a goal against an under 14's goalkeeper. But truth be told we feel its EBIT growth rate does undermine this impression a bit. All these things considered, it appears that Colgate-Palmolive can comfortably handle its current debt levels. Of course, while this leverage can enhance returns on equity, it does bring more risk, so it's worth keeping an eye on this one. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. For example - Colgate-Palmolive has   2 warning signs   we think you should be aware of.When all is said and done, sometimes its easier to focus on companies that don't even need debt.

By boring, we’re not necessarily talking about the adjective in the literal sense. Rather, the focus centers on the resilience and most importantly predictability of the underlying businesses.Think about the everyday products and services that you require. Is the concept of paying your utility bills a sexy one? Is anyone doing TikToks about waiting in line at the grocery store? Probably not. However, these activities undergird several enterprises that we take for granted. Better yet, these enterprises command relevance irrespective of what’s going on with the economy.To be perfectly blunt, no one knows what’s going to happen in the next few days, weeks, and months. Maybe the market melts down further or maybe we jump higher – who knows? What we do know is that we need to eat, sleep and take care of ourselves. With that, below are the boring stocks to buy to shield against banking chaos.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsCLColgate-Palmolive$73.08DUKDuke Energy$97.31MCDMcDonald’s$270.74GOGrocery Outlet$27.16LOWLowe’s$196.79ULUnilever$49.99MCYMercury General$30.20Colgate-Palmolive (CL)Man holding stacks of money. Millionaire.Source: Epic Cure / ShutterstockA multinational consumer products firm, Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) fundamentally benefits from everyday pertinence. While economic pressures may force people to sacrifice services such as medical or dental, products such as toothbrushes and toothpaste don’t cost much. However, through their frequent use, they can save consumers plenty of trouble. That’s one way of looking at CL.Another factor to consider is that boring stocks to buy typically benefit from predictable businesses. And this predictability fosters resilience in its financials. For instance, Colgate-Palmolive’s three-year book growth rate stands at 52.2%, above almost 96% of the competition. Further, its net margin is just under 10%, boxing out 79.57% of its peers.Story continuesAs well, the consumer goods firm provides a forward yield of 2.66%. Notably, the company features 61 years of consecutive annual dividend increases, making it a dividend king. Finally, Wall Street analysts peg CL as a consensus moderate buy. Additionally, their average price target comes in at $79.70, implying over 10% upside potential.Duke Energy (DUK)A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.Source: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.comWhen it comes to boring stocks to buy, few sectors facilitate yawns quite like the utilities. Still, with fears rising regarding a banking contagion, investors should put Duke Energy (NYSE:DUK) on their radar. Topically, Duke like other utility firms benefits from natural monopolies. Because of the extremely high barriers to entry, the competition really shouldn’t be a problem.More importantly, households need Duke’s services. Irrespective of whatever’s happening in the economy, people require access to electricity and other critical resources. Therefore, utilities represent the last budget item to be axed. Cynically, this provides ongoing relevance for DUK and its ilk. Not dissimilar to other utility players, Duke’s financial profile pings as so-so. However, it does enjoy consistent profitability. In turn, the company provides a forward yield of 4.17%, above the utility sector’s average yield of 3.75%. Also, Duke benefits from 18 years of consecutive dividend increases,  a status it won’t give up on without a fight.Lastly, covering analysts peg DUK as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $108.44, implying almost 13% upside potential.McDonald’s (MCD)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar billsSource: shutterstock.com/CC7An iconic fast-food chain, McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) presents a mixture of varying fundamentals. On one hand, the company ties into the consumer discretionary space. Frankly, you don’t have to get food at McDonald’s – you choose to. On the other hand, the Golden Arches represents a major player among boring stocks to buy. MCD is a consistent player in the charts, making it an ideal name for troubled times.A key tailwind for McDonald’s is the trade-down effect. Offering coffee and a full breakfast menu, the fast-food specialist provides compelling competition against pricier coffee shops. Also, with many people returning to the office, McDonald’s offers a respite from the drudgery. Financially, the company brings solid metrics to the table. Its three-year revenue growth rate is 3.8%, above 74.39% of the field. Also, its net margin comes in at 26.65%, boxing out 96.55% of peers. Currently, McDonald’s carries a forward yield of 2.28%. In closing, covering analysts peg MCD as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target stands at $296, implying nearly 11% upside potential.Grocery Outlet (GO)tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comA discount closeout retailer, Grocery Outlet (NASDAQ:GO) specializes in deeply discounted, overstocked, and closeout products from name-brand and private-label suppliers. While arguably most grocery stores may be ideal candidates for boring stocks to buy, investors will particularly appreciate Grocery Outlet. Its focus on discounted products should be extremely appealing as economic conditions potentially worsen.To be fair, the company’s main strength lies in its fundamental narrative. Basically, Grocery Outlet sits at the bottom of the trade-down effect. In other words, you really can’t go much cheaper than discounted grocery products. Still, it does deliver some positive attributes. For example, its three-year book growth rate pings at 10.9%, outpacing 68.8% of its peers. Also, its operating margin comes in at 30.52%. This stat ranks above 72.67% of the underlying industry. Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg GO as a consensus moderate buy. Moreover, their average price target stands at $30.75, implying over 14% upside potential.Lowe’s (LOW)Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words ""buy"" and ""sell"" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image.Source: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.comAn American retailing giant, Lowe’s (NYSE:LOW) specializes in home improvement. Fundamentally, what makes LOW appealing as a candidate for boring stocks to buy centers on flexible relevance. Should the economy weaken, consumers may end up repairing issues on their own, thus boosting Lowe’s sales. On the other hand, if the economy improves, Lowe’s may see increased demand from contractors.In line with expectations for boring stocks to buy, the home-improvement retailer benefits from attractive financials. For instance, the company’s three-year revenue growth rate stands at 18.4%, above 81.35% of the field. Its free cash flow (FCF) growth rate during the same period pings at 43.7%, above nearly 82% of sector peers. Also, its net margin is 6.63%, which ranks above 74.25% of the industry. It also helps undergird Lowe’s forward yield of 2.13%. Notably, the company has 49 years of consecutive dividend increases, just on the cusp of dividend king status. Looking to the Street, covering analysts peg LOW as a consensus moderate buy. Further, their average price target stands at $229.73, implying over 16% upside potential.Unilever (UL)A businessman ripping his shirt off to reveal an upward green arrow with the word buy on it underneathSource: ImageFlow/Shutterstock.comA British multinational consumer goods company, Unilever (NYSE:UL) offers various products. These include food, condiments, bottled water, baby food, soft drink, ice cream, instant coffee, cleaning agents, energy drink, toothpaste, pet food, pharmaceutical, and consumer healthcare products, among many others. Generally speaking, UL responded well to various headwinds, gaining almost 9% in the trailing year.As with other essential goods businesses, Unilever doesn’t offer exceedingly remarkable financials. However, the company simply gets the job done, making it one of the boring stocks to buy. Notably, Unilever enjoys stability in the balance sheet, with an Altman Z-Score of 3.32 indicating low bankruptcy risk. Also, its three-year book growth rate pings at 15.2%, above nearly 78% of the industry. In the trailing year, Unilever carries a net margin of 12.74%. This stat helps undergird the company’s forward yield of 3.72%. Lastly, Argus Research pegs UL as a buy. It assigned a price target of $60, implying over 22% upside potential.Mercury General (MCY)a green button on a keyboard has an arrow pointing upward with the word ""Buy"". representing safe stocks to buySource: AdityaB. Photography/ShutterStock.comWhen it comes to boring stocks to buy, it doesn’t get much more boring than Mercury General (NYSE:MCY). Frankly, people don’t get up in the morning excited and refreshed because of their insurance policies. No, you typically don’t want to encounter incidents where insurance policies become necessary. Put another way, Mercury and its ilk offer more relief than any other emotion.Still, during these difficult times, relief is exactly what consumers want. Along with the Covid-19 pandemic, the banking sector fallout represents another reminder of why financial protection commands a premium. At any moment, the rug could be pulled underneath us. Thus, moving forward, households will likely pay more attention to this sector, perhaps even levering up their coverage.To be fair, Mercury doesn’t offer the greatest financial profile. That said, for risk-takers, MCY could be intriguing because of its undervalued status. For example, the market prices MCY at a trailing sales multiple of 0.47. As a discount to revenue, Mercury ranks better than 76.34% of the competition.Finally, Raymond James’ Charles Peters pegs MCY as a buy. As well, the analyst forecasts a price of $45, implying nearly 50% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

""Now he has been falsely portrayed as a perjurer, a criminal, and of being completely unfit to practice his profession.""""The Dropout"" made its debut last March.Neither Disney nor Hulu immediately responded to requests for comment. Disney owns 67% of Hulu, while Comcast Corp's NBCUniversal owns 33%.Richard Altman, a lawyer for Rosendorff, said neither he nor his client would have additional comment.Holmes, 39, was found guilty in January 2022 and later sentenced to 11-1/4 years in prison for defrauding investors in Theranos, which was once valued at $9 billion.Now a mother of two young children, Holmes is trying to delay her sentence while she appeals her conviction. Prosecutors have opposed a delay, calling Holmes a flight risk.The case is Rosendorff v Hulu LLC et al, New York State Supreme Court, New York County, No. 152734/2023.

RPM is benefiting from accretive acquisitions and cost-reduction initiatives. During the first two quarters of fiscal 2023, the company completed six small acquisitions. Also, its MAP 2025 (Margin Achievement Plan) is expected to drive growth.These strategies helped the company to report higher earnings and revenues. Bottom and top lines increased 39.2% and 9.3%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis in the fiscal second quarter. The uptrend was backed by strong pricing, volume growth in businesses that are benefiting from reshoring and infrastructure spending and material supply improvement through insourcing and qualifying new suppliers.Although this manufacturer and marketer of high-performance coatings, sealants and specialty chemicals has been benefiting from the abovementioned tailwinds, its growth is being restricted by inflationary pressure along with supply chain and foreign exchange risks. These risks partially offset the benefits, as evident from second-quarter fiscal 2023 net sales missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.9%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchShares of RPM have declined 1.9% over the past six months against the Zacks Paints and Related Products industry’s growth of 0.7%. Earnings estimates for fiscal 2023 and 2024 have declined in the past 60 days, depicting analysts’ concerns over the prospects of the company.Growth DriversRPM engages in acquisitions that assist it to grow in its segments. Six acquisitions completed during the first half of fiscal 2023 contributed 1% to the sales of the company during the period. During fiscal 2022, it completed eight acquisitions in three segments, acquiring a chemical manufacturing facility located in Corsicana, TX, within the CPG segment along with a Clearwater, FL-based indoor air quality solutions provider. The company remains focused on prudent strategic growth investments in fiscal 2023 as well. This is expected to improve resiliency, capacity and efficiency.In fiscal 2018, the company undertook a multi-year restructuring plan, the 2020 Margin Acceleration Plan (“2020 MAP to Growth”) to maintain a balance between its segments’ performance as well as to drive growth. This led to improvement in its earnings, adjusted EBIT margin and the net income. Due to the positive outcome, the company unveiled the MAP 2025 (Margin Achievement Plan) operational improvement initiative in August 2022. It expects to accelerate growth, maximize operational efficiencies and generate superior value for its customers, associates and shareholders via MAP 2025. By the end of May 2025, RPM expects to achieve $8.5 billion of annual revenues, 42% gross margin and 16% adjusted EBIT margin.The company is well on track to reduce costs by closing plants, merging IT system, centralizing more of its back-office functions and rationalizing its manufacturing footprint.Story continuesHeadwindsRPM’s business has been witnessing higher costs and expenses related to restructuring, acquisitions, labor, distribution and freight.Current economic conditions have become difficult as series of interest rate hikes have been negatively impacting construction activities. Temporarily, customers are moderating purchases due to market uncertainties and the company is normalizing inventories in response to a more stable supply chain. Due to these factors, certain RPM businesses are experiencing lower customer demand, which is anticipated to continue in third-quarter fiscal 2023. Along with this, additional headwinds like foreign currency translation and inflation will likely affect the company’s growth. As a result, the company expects year-over-year adjusted EBIT growth to slow or possibly modestly decline in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 for the first time in five quarters.Weak demand in Europe, where cost pressure was severe and volumes deteriorated due to macroeconomic factors, and new residential construction businesses hurt the bottom line.Zacks Rank &amp; Key PicksRPM currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

While the full scale of cuts couldn’t be determined, Cerner’s marketing and creative services divisions were hard hit, and some technical positions also were affected, said former employees who lost their jobs.Jason Withington worked at Cerner for nearly 16 years, most recently in data center operations, before his job was wiped out last week. He said multiple workers in his division with over a decade of tenure had been let go. Withington is also a recently elected commissioner for Clay County in Missouri, the county in the Kansas City metropolitan area where Cerner’s old headquarters was located.Oracle didn’t respond to requests for comment. Cerner, which became part of the company last June, has fueled cloud growth and contributed more than $1.5 billion in revenue in the most recent quarter. Chairman Larry Ellison has said Oracle anticipates even stronger future growth for the electronic records business.Still, the software giant is focused on cutting costs at Cerner. At an investor event in October, Chief Executive Officer Safra Catz said there are many ways that profitability could be improved at the acquired unit. “The situation in Cerner — that’s just not how we run a place,” Catz said, later adding they would “clean Cerner up.”Oracle announced last year that it would conduct a restructuring program “due to our acquisitions and certain other operational activities,” according to a recent regulatory filing. The company spent $585 million on the program through Feb. 28, primarily related to employee severance costs, and estimated it would spend some of the remaining $342 million allocated for restructuring through the end of the fiscal year in May.Story continuesOracle employed about 143,000 people in May 2022, before the Cerner deal closed, the company said. Cerner had about 25,000 employees when the acquisition was announced in December 2021, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Earlier this month, Catz said Cerner’s operating margin has increased over 5 percentage points since the acquisition. Last year, Oracle said it would close some offices in the Kansas City area and consolidate its workforce into a single location. The recent Cerner job reductions were reported earlier by the Kansas City Business Journal.Oracle is famous for its cost cuts and high profits. In an earnings call earlier this month, Salesforce Inc. CEO Marc Benioff said he learned the “Oracle Playbook” from Ellison as activist investors pushed Benioff to boost earnings. A few months prior, Salesforce announced it would cut 8,000 workers.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe Texas Preacher’s $24 Million Ponzi SchemeChina Lent Heavily to Developing Nations.

225,f313665f-bd97-3173-9232-75c4c056f826,PSA,2023-03-24,Why Is Public Storage (PSA) Down 2.5% Since Last Earnings Report?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-public-storage-psa-down-153003558.html,1679585403,STORY,['PSA'],"[A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Public Storage (PSA). Shares have lost about 2.5% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Public Storage due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Public Storage’s Q4 FFO &amp; Revenues Top EstimatesPublic Storage reported fourth-quarter 2022 core FFO per share of $4.16, increasing 17.5% year over year. The core FFO per share, excluding the contribution from the company’s equity investment in PS Business Parks, Inc., was $4.16. Both figures surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.99.Results reflected better-than-anticipated top-line growth, aided by an improvement in the realized annual rent per occupied square foot. The company also benefited from its expansion efforts through acquisitions, developments and extensions.Quarterly revenues of $1.09 billion exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.08 billion. Moreover, revenues increased 17.8% year over year.In 2022, Public Storage reported core FFO per share of $15.92, up 23.1% from $12.93 in the prior year, and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $15.75. Revenues of $4.18 billion surged 22.4% year over year and outpaced the consensus mark of $4.17 billion.Behind the HeadlinesPublic Storage’s same-store revenues increased 13.3% year over year to $818.9 million in the fourth quarter, highlighting the higher realized annual rent per occupied square foot, partially offset by a decline in occupancy. This storage REIT witnessed a 15.7% increase in the realized annual rental income per occupied square foot to $22.74. However, the weighted-average square foot occupancy of 93.4% was down 2.6% year over year.The same-store cost of operations increased 5.3% year over year, mainly reflecting a rise in property tax expense, marketing expense, other direct property costs and repairs and maintenance.Consequently, PSA’s same-store net operating income (NOI) increased 15.8% to $637.5 million. Also, this REIT’s NOI growth from non-same-store facilities was $50.5 million due to the facilities acquired in 2021 and the fill-up of recently developed and expanded facilities.Public Storage achieved an 81.2% same-store direct NOI margin in the quarter, reflecting an increase of 1.8% year over year.Story continuesPortfolio ActivityIn the fourth quarter, Public Storage acquired 30 self-storage facilities comprising 1.6 million net rentable square feet of area for $228.6 million. Following Dec 31, 2022, the company acquired or was under contract to buy eight self-storage facilities spanning 0.5 million net rentable square feet of space for $70.5 million.The company opened three newly developed facilities and completed several expansion projects with 0.5 million net rentable square feet costing $101.2 million.As of Dec 31, 2022, PSA had several facilities in development (2.1 million net rentable square feet) with an estimated cost of $492.3 million and several expansion projects (2.5 million net rentable square feet) worth $487.3 million. It expects to incur the remaining $606.6 million of development costs related to these projects, mainly over the next 18 to 24 months.Balance Sheet PositionPublic Storage exited fourth-quarter 2022 with $775.2 of cash and equivalents, down from $883.8 million as of Sep 30, 2022.2023 GuidancePublic Storage issued guidance for 2023.It projects 2023 core FFO per share in the range of $16.10-$16.80.The company’s full-year assumption is backed by 2.5-5% growth in same-store revenues, a 4.75% to 6.75% rise in same-store expenses and a 1.2% to 5.1% expansion in same-store NOI.Further, the company expects $750 million in acquisitions and $375 million in development openings.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates.VGM ScoresAt this time, Public Storage has a subpar Growth Score of D, however its Momentum Score is doing a bit better with a C. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of D on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of D. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. Notably, Public Storage has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Charles' trip would have included a lavish banquet at the Palace of Versailles.""You can see the situation linked to the protests,"" Macron told a news conference during a visit to Brussels.He added that ""it would not have been serious"" to host the state visit after unions announced a nationwide day of strikes and protests for Tuesday.""Common sense and friendship pushed us to propose to postpone (the visit).""A British government spokesperson said the decision was ""taken with the consent of all parties"" after Macron asked the British government to postpone the visit.The last-minute scrapping of the visit will pile further pressure on Macron to find a way out of a crisis over his plans to raise the retirement age by two years to 64, which has seen some of France's worst unrest since the ""Yellow Vest"" rebellion of 2018-2019.The Elysee said it hoped the visit would be rescheduled in the coming months.""There were calls on social networks to disrupt the king's visit, to take action, so we didn't want to take any risks,"" a French source close to the matter said.Story continuesA Buckingham Palace source said Charles' visit to Germany will go ahead as planned.The king and his wife, Queen Consort Camilla, looked forward to rescheduling the visit to France ""as soon as dates can be found"", a Buckingham Palace spokesperson said.STREET BATTLESBlack-clad anarchists fought street battles with police for several hours in the French capital on Thursday, ransacking a McDonald's restaurant, smashing up bus shelters and setting alight mounds of garbage that have piled up during strikes.In Bordeaux, at the heart of one of France's best-known wine growing areas and where Charles had also been expected to visit, protesters set alight the entrance to the city hall.""He's right not to come right now,"" said architecture student Mathias Sainte Agathe. ""There are protests and strikes everywhere.""Weeks of protests over Macron's pension plans escalated and became more violent after his government pushed the legislation through parliament last week without a vote. His government lacks a clear majority.The president has insisted the pensions changes are essential to keep the system funded.Hard-left leader Jean-Luc Melenchon, who earlier this week said now was ""not the right time"" for Charles to come, welcomed the cancellation of the visit.The left-wing opposition and some protesters often mockingly portray Macron - who began his second term in office last year - as a would-be monarch.""The meeting of the kings in Versailles is broken up by popular censure,"" Melenchon tweeted.But not all were happy that the visit was postponed.""Why is he not coming? I don't understand,"" jewellery worker Razmig Kertechin said in Paris.""We're not bad people. It's just the way it is, it's the freedom (to protest). I don't know, that's weird.""(Additional reporting by Dominique Vidalon, Michael Holden Writing by Richard Lough, Ingrid Melander Editing by Christina Fincher, Jon Boyle and Frances Kerry)]"

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their returns over the years, and go directly to read 5 Future Dividend Kings in the Next 6 Years or Less. Dividend Kings are companies that have dividend growth streaks of 50 years or more. Investors are inclined toward these securities as these companies are financially stable and are more likely to raise their payouts in the future. Moreover, these stocks also offer regular income to shareholders along with the potential for capital appreciation as the stock price grows over time. Some of the best dividend kings that investors are paying attention to include The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) as these companies have strong cash flow generation which enabled them to raise their payouts for decades.The current inflationary environment has enhanced the importance of dividend growers. Analysts also recommend loading up on companies with strong dividend growth track records instead of those with high yields. According to a report by Nuveen, global dividend-payers with modest yields of around 3% generally exhibit better earnings potential and higher profit margins when compared with high-yielding dividend stocks. The report also mentioned that dividend growth stocks outperformed their peers during monthly periods of rising volatility. From December 2002 to December 2022, dividend growers delivered an average excess return of 0.7% when the monthly volatility increase was over 20%.In addition to shareholder return, dividend stocks also contributed significantly to the overall market return. According to a report by T. Rowe Price, compounded dividends have represented over 70% of global market returns. The report also mentioned the performance of dividend growers over the years. The S&amp;P Dividend Aristocrat Index, which tracks the performance of companies that have raised their payouts for 25 years or more, has outperformed the wider market by over 75% since 1989.Story continuesPayout ratios also play a vital part when considering investments in dividend growers. In one of our previous articles titled 10 Companies Likely to be Dividend Kings in the Future, we mentioned a research which says dividend growers returned 11.1% on average in a 12-month period starting after the rate hikes in 1994 through the third quarter of 2022, compared with a 9.2% return of the wider market. We also mentioned that payout ratios below 50% are considered healthy as these companies have stable cash flow generation for shareholder return.Healthy payout ratios show the financial position of the company which directly affects the sustainability of future dividends. Andrew Crowell, financial adviser and vice chairman of wealth management at D.A. Davidson, spoke to Wall Street Journal about dividend payout ratios and their importance. Here are some comments from the analyst:“The dividend payout ratio is a good indicator of a company’s dividend track record. It is the ratio of the total amount of dividends paid out to shareholders relative to the net income of the company.”He added:“The annual dividend payout ratio for dividend aristocrats is 30% to 50%. This allows them to retain enough cash if business stalls, or the economy turns downward.” Future Dividend Kings in the Next 6 Years or LessOur Methodology:For this list, we selected companies that have raised their dividend payouts for 44 years or more and are on a steady path to becoming dividend kings (companies which increase their dividends for 50 or more straight years). These companies would be achieving their Dividend King status in six years or less. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their consecutive years of dividend growth.12.

236,6882ca61-2aec-3321-b531-9f0d58ee3e33,AXP,2023-03-24,AmEx (AXP) to Offer Digital Payment Benefits in Australia,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amex-axp-offer-digital-payment-181106457.html,1679595066,STORY,"['AXP', 'SCM']","[In a bid to benefit its consumer and small business Card Members, American Express Company AXP recently collaborated with Australia-based payment solutions provider Cuscal to introduce the card bill PayID service throughout the country. The new service will be launched on the New Payments Platform (NPP), which is handled by the domestic payments organization of Australia - Australian Payments Plus (“AP+”).The tie-up with Cuscal will provide an opportunity for American Express Card Members to create a unique PayID for availing the innovative service. And the PayID creation will be made possible and seamless by leveraging the APIs of Cuscal.  Subsequently, the PayID can be stored in the capacity of a payee in the digital banking channel of the bank in which an American Express Card Member holds an account.American Express Card Members can now directly make repayments for purchases (that they had made using an AXP card) through their bank accounts and immediately liberate themselves from the credit that they owed to AXP. The process requires a Card Member to send payment from their bank account to their individual PayID. Consequently, from the PayID, Cuscal will direct the funds in real time to the American Express Card account.Apart from ensuring an immediate and hassle-free payment experience for Card Members, there are other benefits that accompany the new PayID service. A greater sense of transparency and security is injected within the service. As a testament to the same, a confirmation step pops up before making payments to ensure that the funds are directed to American Express and receipt of payments from the Card Member’s bank account is accompanied by a payment alert.The recent tie-up reflects American Express’ sincere efforts to extend the widespread benefits of digital offerings to its Card Members. AXP frequently resorts to incorporating new options or enhancing existing ones within its card offerings. With the card-issuing business remaining an important source of revenues for American Express, initiatives to extend varied benefits to its Card Members are expected to keep contributing to AXP’s top-line growth.Story continuesAlso, the latest move in Australia is likely to enable American Express in capturing a significant share of the digital payments market of a country that continues to witness widespread adoption of digital means.Shares of American Express have gained 10.1% year to date compared with the industry’s 3% growth. AXP currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOther Stocks to ConsiderSome other top-ranked stocks from the Finance space are Trinity Capital Inc.

Strong dividend growth and buyback of shares will further increase its shareholders’ value.However, this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock is facing certain headwinds, such as delay in closure of PNM Resources’ deal, and constraints related to new projects and cyber-security risks.TailwindsAVANGRID is consistently expanding its clean energy generation capacity, and adding more wind and solar sources to its portfolio. The company has an investment plan of $21.5 billion through 2025. It invested a total of $2.7 billion in 2022, with nearly 71% in its Networks segment and the rest in its Renewables segment.  AGR is focused on regulated and contracted investments, which guarantee earnings and cash flows.In March 2023, the company announced that it is going to use $30 million worth of high-quality solar trackers from the New Mexico-based company, Array Technologies (ATI), to develop a 321 Megawatt (MW) solar farm in Texas. It currently produces more than 1,250 MWs of sustainable energy in Texas through six wind farms and has a pipeline of 1,300 MWs projects.AVANGRID has been paying dividends consistently since 2016. Its quarterly dividend stands at 44 cents per share, bringing the annual dividend to $1.76 per share. The company has a repurchase plan to maintain Iberdrola's relative ownership at 81.5%. As of Dec 31, 2022, a total of 997,983 shares were repurchased in the open market.HeadwindsDelay in receiving the necessary regulatory approvals for PNM Resources’ merger has adversely impacted AGR’s financial position. The merger deal might get canceled as the commission might again disapprove the revised proposal.Although the company keeps investing in development opportunities, budgetary control and timely completion of the same might not be always possible. This can have an adverse impact on the company’s financial position and its prospects.Story continuesStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the same industry are MGE Energy, Inc.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their returns over the years, and go directly to read 5 Future Dividend Kings in the Next 6 Years or Less. Dividend Kings are companies that have dividend growth streaks of 50 years or more. Investors are inclined toward these securities as these companies are financially stable and are more likely to raise their payouts in the future. Moreover, these stocks also offer regular income to shareholders along with the potential for capital appreciation as the stock price grows over time. Some of the best dividend kings that investors are paying attention to include The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) as these companies have strong cash flow generation which enabled them to raise their payouts for decades.The current inflationary environment has enhanced the importance of dividend growers. Analysts also recommend loading up on companies with strong dividend growth track records instead of those with high yields. According to a report by Nuveen, global dividend-payers with modest yields of around 3% generally exhibit better earnings potential and higher profit margins when compared with high-yielding dividend stocks. The report also mentioned that dividend growth stocks outperformed their peers during monthly periods of rising volatility. From December 2002 to December 2022, dividend growers delivered an average excess return of 0.7% when the monthly volatility increase was over 20%.In addition to shareholder return, dividend stocks also contributed significantly to the overall market return. According to a report by T. Rowe Price, compounded dividends have represented over 70% of global market returns. The report also mentioned the performance of dividend growers over the years. The S&amp;P Dividend Aristocrat Index, which tracks the performance of companies that have raised their payouts for 25 years or more, has outperformed the wider market by over 75% since 1989.Story continuesPayout ratios also play a vital part when considering investments in dividend growers. In one of our previous articles titled 10 Companies Likely to be Dividend Kings in the Future, we mentioned a research which says dividend growers returned 11.1% on average in a 12-month period starting after the rate hikes in 1994 through the third quarter of 2022, compared with a 9.2% return of the wider market. We also mentioned that payout ratios below 50% are considered healthy as these companies have stable cash flow generation for shareholder return.Healthy payout ratios show the financial position of the company which directly affects the sustainability of future dividends. Andrew Crowell, financial adviser and vice chairman of wealth management at D.A. Davidson, spoke to Wall Street Journal about dividend payout ratios and their importance. Here are some comments from the analyst:“The dividend payout ratio is a good indicator of a company’s dividend track record. It is the ratio of the total amount of dividends paid out to shareholders relative to the net income of the company.”He added:“The annual dividend payout ratio for dividend aristocrats is 30% to 50%. This allows them to retain enough cash if business stalls, or the economy turns downward.” Future Dividend Kings in the Next 6 Years or LessOur Methodology:For this list, we selected companies that have raised their dividend payouts for 44 years or more and are on a steady path to becoming dividend kings (companies which increase their dividends for 50 or more straight years). These companies would be achieving their Dividend King status in six years or less. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their consecutive years of dividend growth.12.

Despite its full price, we continue to hold RLI because of its high quality and our reluctance to trade in and out.

It's just a natural area many investors go towards because they can ""buy what they know.""

Over the last year, shares of Home Depot have fallen 7%.However, Home Depot has a forward P/E of 18.3, which isn't cheap, but isn't at nosebleed levels either. And investors get a dividend, currently yielding 2.9%.Story continuesIs this a buying opportunity in Home Depot?2.       Costco Wholesale Corp.

They love everything about the company and continue to own the stock, no matter the ups, and downs.Shares of Costco have fallen 11.6% over the last year and it's still expensive, with a forward P/E of 34.

But it's been a stellar performer for a long time. Over the last 5 years, shares of Tractor Supply are up 291% compared to the S&amp;P 500 up just 54%. And you get a dividend, paying 1.8%.Tractor Supply isn't cheap. It trades with a forward P/E of 22.5.Is it too late to get into Tractor Supply?4.       Ulta Beauty ULTAUlta Beauty is one of the few big retailers which has actually seen its business pick up steam on the reopening as consumers were buying more makeup and skincare products once they could ditch their masks. Earnings are expected to rise 5% in fiscal 2024 and another 7.9% in fiscal 2025.Shares of Ulta Beauty have jumped 34% in the last year and are near 5-year highs. However, it's no longer a secret. Ulta Beauty trades with a forward P/E of 20.5, which is not cheap.Can Ulta Beauty keep its momentum even if a recession hits?5.       Williams-Sonoma, Inc.

In that same time, the Oils-Energy sector lost 5.47%, while the S&amp;P 500 lost 1.21%.Investors will be hoping for strength from Occidental Petroleum as it approaches its next earnings release. On that day, Occidental Petroleum is projected to report earnings of $1.41 per share, which would represent a year-over-year decline of 33.49%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $7.71 billion, down 9.63% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $6.19 per share and revenue of $31.6 billion. These totals would mark changes of -33.8% and -14.81%, respectively, from last year.Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Occidental Petroleum. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988.

Integrated energy players’ midstream business is also sound since the companies generate stable fee-based revenues from pipeline and storage assets, thereby enhancing the outlook for the Zacks Oil &amp; Gas US Integrated industry.Among the frontrunners in the industry that will possibly make the most of the handsome business scenario are ConocoPhillips COP, Occidental Petroleum Corporation OXY, Hess Corporation HES and Cactus Inc. WHD.About the IndustryThe Zacks Oil &amp; Gas US Integrated industry comprises companies mostly involved in upstream and midstream energy businesses. The upstream operations entail oil and natural gas exploration and production in the prolific shale plays of the United States. The integrated energy companies are also engaged in midstream businesses through gathering and processing facilities along with transportation pipeline networks and storage sites. Overall, the upstream business is positively correlated to oil and gas prices. The produced commodity volumes are then transported through midstream assets, generating stable fee-based revenues. The integrated energy players in the United States also have access to downstream operations wherein the transported oil volumes are converted to finished products, comprising gasoline, natural gas liquids and diesel, through refining activities.3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Oil &amp; Gas US Integrated IndustryOil Price Still High: The price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude is trading higher than the $70-per-barrel mark, still favorable for exploration and production activities. Per the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the WTI spot average price will be $77.10 per barrel in 2023, suggesting the upstream business environment will favor the integrated players. Stable Fee-Based Revenues: The integrated companies’ midstream business is relatively less exposed to the volatility in commodity prices. This is because the pipeline and storage assets are usually booked by shippers for the long term, securing stable fee-based revenues.Story continuesClimate Change Position: Integrated players in the United States have recognized climate change as a serious risk that needs to be addressed. The companies are now focused on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and flaring rates.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bullish OutlookThe Zacks Oil &amp; Gas US Integrated industry is a 10-stock group within the broader Zacks Oil - Energy sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #98, which places it in the top 39% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bullish near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock market performance and valuation picture.Industry Outperforms Sector and S&amp;P 500The Zacks Oil &amp; Gas US Integrated industry has surpassed the broader Zacks Oil - Energy sector and the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite over the past year.The industry has fallen 1.7% over this period compared with the S&amp;P 500’s decline of 11.3% and the broader sector’s deterioration of 3.5%.One-Year Price PerformanceIndustry's Current ValuationSince oil and gas companies are debt-laden, it makes sense to value them based on the EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/ Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) ratio. This is because the valuation metric takes into account not just equity but also the level of debt.On the basis of the trailing 12-month enterprise value-to-EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) ratio, the industry is currently trading at 3.46X, lower than the S&amp;P 500’s 12.19X. It is, however, higher than the sector’s trailing-12-month EV/EBITDA of 2.84X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 13.41X, as low as 3.32X, with a median of 5.62X.Trailing 12-Month Enterprise Value-to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) Ratio4 US Integrated Oil Stocks Moving Ahead of the PackCactus: Cactus has been aiding its clients in fast-tracking their well drilling and completion activities. The company has also been enabling lower operator emissions per barrel of production. Thus, there has been a significantly lower carbon intensity per well. Cactus carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and is likely to see earnings growth of 27.2%.Price and Consensus: WHDConocoPhillips: Considering production and reserves, ConocoPhillips is among the leading upstream energy players in the world. COP is strongly focused on returning capital to shareholders. Last year, the upstream firm returned as high as $15 billion to shareholders.#3 Ranked COP employed a three-tier framework that comprised $5.7 billion in cash distributions through the ordinary dividend and variable return of cash route, while the remaining $9.3 billion was distributed through share repurchases.  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. Price and Consensus: COPHess: Headquartered in New York, Hess is a leading upstream firm with a footprint in Bakken, the Gulf of Mexico and offshore Guyana. The firm believes its position in Guyana is strong enough to generate growth in long-term cashflows.For 2023, Hess, carrying a Zacks Rank #3, has seen upward earnings estimate revisions in the past seven days.Price and Consensus: HESOccidental Petroleum: Headquartered in Houston, TX, Occidental Petroleum, with a Zacks Rank of 3, is an oil and natural gas explorer with a presence in the midstream energy business.

247,bdcb4e64-5fed-3747-a023-b5455ce71004,BSX,2023-03-24,Boston Scientific (NYSE:BSX) shareholders have earned a 12% CAGR over the last five years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/boston-scientific-nyse-bsx-shareholders-130027252.html,1679576427,STORY,['BSX'],"[When we invest, we're generally looking for stocks that outperform the market average. And in our experience, buying the right stocks can give your wealth a significant boost. For example, long term Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE:BSX) shareholders have enjoyed a 80% share price rise over the last half decade, well in excess of the market return of around 48% (not including dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 14% in the last year.Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. See our latest analysis for Boston Scientific While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Over half a decade, Boston Scientific managed to grow its earnings per share at 43% a year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 12% over the same period. So one could conclude that the broader market has become more cautious towards the stock. Having said that, the market is still optimistic, given the P/E ratio of 107.43.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthBefore buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here.A Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that Boston Scientific shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 14% over the last year. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 12%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Boston Scientific better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 4 warning signs  with Boston Scientific (at least 1 which is potentially serious)  , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.Story continuesIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

Billowing smoke above the village and reports from residents that they still suffer from illnesses, turned high-level attention to railroad safety and how dangerous materials are transported.Bipartisan legislation introduced in Congress following the derailment would require train crews to continue to have two people, although the train that derailed in East Palestine had a three-person crew.Railroad worker unions argue that operational changes and widespread job cuts across the industry in the past six years have made railroads riskier. They say employees are spread thin after nearly one-third of all rail jobs were eliminated and train crews, in particular, deal with fatigue because they are on call 24/7The Federal Railroad Administration also is considering a rule that would require two-person crews in most instances.Earlier this week, Norfolk Southern CEO Alan Shaw offered support for some parts of the railroad safety bill while testifying before the Senate Commerce Committee, but he declined when pressed to support a two-person requirement for crews.Instead, he said, “We are a data-driven organization and I’m not aware of any data that links crew size with safety.”The International Association of Sheet Metal, Air, Rail and Transportation Workers union has long opposed attempts by the nation's railroads to cut down crew sizes, citing safety concerns.]"

""These scheduling enhancements, which were part of last year's national agreements, have the potential to make an immediate positive impact for our conductors by giving them fixed days off and greater certainty about their weekly assignments. The willingness of NS to step back from plans to change to a ground-based conductor model is a welcome show of good faith in the negotiation process.""Under the terms of the national agreements, Norfolk Southern and SMART-TD have a mid-June deadline to negotiate the details of these scheduling enhancements. Given this limited window, Norfolk Southern has withdrawn its current Section 6 bargaining notice on conductor redeployment to fully focus on collaboratively implementing these enhancements and other quality-of-life priorities.""Norfolk Southern is committed to working with labor partners, including SMART-TD, to identify and negotiate benefits that will have a meaningful impact on our employees' quality of life,"" said Wai Wong, vice president, Labor Relations at Norfolk Southern. ""While redeployment of conductors to ground-based shift-work will provide more predictable jobs and minimize time away from home, there are a number of other priorities that our labor partners would like to address, and we are committed to working together to make immediate progress.""Story continuesThe withdrawal of the Section 6 notice on conductor redeployment removes the mandatory requirement for the parties to bargain over the issue, though voluntary discussions remain an option.

Hence, a dividend-paying one is obviously much coveted. However, headwinds like high fuel costs and supply-chain disruptions continue to hurt NSC. Currently, NSC carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Factors Favoring NSCDespite economic uncertainties, Norfolk Southern is committed to reward its shareholders. During 2022, Norfolk Southern paid dividends worth $1,167 million, up 13.5% year over year, and repurchased and retired common stock worth $3,110 million.Norfolk Southern's strong free cash flow generating ability supports its shareholder-friendly activities. In January, the company's board announced a 9% increase in its quarterly dividend payout. This was the fourth dividend hike announced by the company in a year’s time.Moreover, higher fuel surcharges and favorable pricing are driving the top line. Improvement in coal revenues represents a further tailwind. In fourth-quarter 2022, coal revenues increased 28% year over year to $448 million. Coal volumes increased 8% in the quarter.Key RisksNSC is being hurt by headwinds like supply-chain disruptions and slower network velocity, due to which overall volumes declined 1% year over year in fourth-quarter 2022. Volumes declined in each quarter of 2022, resulting in an annual decline of 3% from 2021 levels.Moreover, high fuel costs are denting the bottom-line growth. At NSC, expenses on fuel surged 82.6% year over year in 2022, leading to a 18.5% rise in operating costs. High capex is also likely to play as a spoilsport.Zacks Rank &amp; Key PicksCurrently, NSC carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Other well known tycoons have tried to go toe-to-toe with the drinks giants, and failed, most notably Richard Branson with his Virgin Cola.But Asia's richest person has famously disrupted India's telecoms market seven years ago with cut-throat pricing to make Reliance the leading player in that industry. And he's applying some of that same strategy in his soft drinks venture.""Coca-Cola and Pepsi are unused to a nationwide challenge, and Reliance has the financial muscle and reach to challenge them with a local brand with high nostalgic value,"" said Amulya Pandit, a consultant at Euromonitor International.A person with direct knowledge of Reliance's plan said it aims to open some factories of its own or as joint ventures to make Campa, and take the soda to hotels, restaurants and in-flight sales. Production of Campa is currently outsourced, after its $2.7 million acquisition of the brand last year.The company is heavily discounting in-store prices. A two-litre Campa Cola bottle is priced at 49 rupees (60 U.S. cents) in stores, a near 50% discount on its label price, and around a third lower than 2.25-litre Coke and Pepsi variants, a Reuters check showed. The smallest bottles of Campa Cola and Coke both cost 10 rupees, while Pepsi starts from 12 rupees.Story continues""The price will be disruptive across,"" said the person, who added Reliance is planning an advertising spree during the upcoming popular IPL cricket tournament and is in talks with at least three teams to make Campa their refreshment partner.The person did not want to be identified as the strategy is confidential. Reliance did not respond to a request for comment, while Pepsi said it doesn't comment on competition as a policy.Coca-Cola said it has broadly kept prices of its small bottles unchanged since last year and was focused on expanding distribution. ""Having new players in the market presents a great opportunity for investments to develop the market further,"" it said.Reliance, India's top retailer, will supply Campa to its 2,500 grocery outlets and thousands of smaller non-network stores as part of its new consumer goods push from which it has set an internal target of $6.5 billion in annual revenues within five years.The company also has a grocery shopping app and a wholesale vertical under which it supplies consumer goods to 500,000 mom-and-pop stores, which it will also tap for Campa sales.'GREAT INDIAN TASTE' VS FOREIGN BRANDSReliance's cola and consumer goods foray is being driven by T. Krishnakumar, an executive who worked for nearly 17 years at Coca-Cola in various leadership roles.Pepsi and Coca-Cola will also cautiously eye Reliance's marketing strategy after it targetted nationalist sentiment and nostalgia by promoting Campa as a homegrown brand with ""Great Indian Taste"" and a ""rich heritage"".A former Pepsi executive who did not want to be identified because of the sensitive nature of the subject said the U.S. firm has always been worried about local products marketed with an ""India First"" agenda, especially at a time when Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself backs self-reliance.The rivalry is already playing out in the market.In five Reliance outlets that Reuters visited in Mumbai in India's west, Chennai in the south and Lucknow in the north, Campa cola or lemon plastic bottles were displayed at the main entry gates or placed on shelves just next to the rivals.At one Chennai outlet, a Reliance store manager said this year they were placing Campa at the entrance for promoting it, with rivals tucked behind it and not visible at first glance. Another city store employee said 30 Campa bottles were being sold for every 100 of Pepsi and Coca-Cola.For now, the U.S. rivals have an upper hand. Pepsi and Coca-Cola drinks are available in at least 3 million Indian outlets and the companies have a widespread logistics network, dozens of factories and the advantage of a taste preferred by many, said Alok Shah, a consumer analyst at India's Ambit Capital.""We'll need to wait and watch to see if consumers switch to Campa,"" he said, adding that Pepsi and Coke remain aspirational foreign brands for many Indians, offered at largely similar small-pack prices.Srinivas Rao said he still loves Coca-Cola's Thums Up, a domestic brand it acquired in 1993 and is its best-selling one in India, unlike in the U.S. where Coke dominates.""We buy Thums Up every time we eat biryani or meat at home. We are not drawn to discounts from other brands including Campa,"" Rao said outside a Reliance store in Chennai.(Reporting by Praveen Paramasivam and Aditya Kalra; Additional reporting by Jessica DiNapoli, Francis Mascarenhas, Saurabh Sharma and Jatindra Dash; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman)]"

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their returns over the years, and go directly to read 5 Future Dividend Kings in the Next 6 Years or Less. Dividend Kings are companies that have dividend growth streaks of 50 years or more. Investors are inclined toward these securities as these companies are financially stable and are more likely to raise their payouts in the future. Moreover, these stocks also offer regular income to shareholders along with the potential for capital appreciation as the stock price grows over time. Some of the best dividend kings that investors are paying attention to include The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) as these companies have strong cash flow generation which enabled them to raise their payouts for decades.The current inflationary environment has enhanced the importance of dividend growers. Analysts also recommend loading up on companies with strong dividend growth track records instead of those with high yields. According to a report by Nuveen, global dividend-payers with modest yields of around 3% generally exhibit better earnings potential and higher profit margins when compared with high-yielding dividend stocks. The report also mentioned that dividend growth stocks outperformed their peers during monthly periods of rising volatility. From December 2002 to December 2022, dividend growers delivered an average excess return of 0.7% when the monthly volatility increase was over 20%.In addition to shareholder return, dividend stocks also contributed significantly to the overall market return. According to a report by T. Rowe Price, compounded dividends have represented over 70% of global market returns. The report also mentioned the performance of dividend growers over the years. The S&amp;P Dividend Aristocrat Index, which tracks the performance of companies that have raised their payouts for 25 years or more, has outperformed the wider market by over 75% since 1989.Story continuesPayout ratios also play a vital part when considering investments in dividend growers. In one of our previous articles titled 10 Companies Likely to be Dividend Kings in the Future, we mentioned a research which says dividend growers returned 11.1% on average in a 12-month period starting after the rate hikes in 1994 through the third quarter of 2022, compared with a 9.2% return of the wider market. We also mentioned that payout ratios below 50% are considered healthy as these companies have stable cash flow generation for shareholder return.Healthy payout ratios show the financial position of the company which directly affects the sustainability of future dividends. Andrew Crowell, financial adviser and vice chairman of wealth management at D.A. Davidson, spoke to Wall Street Journal about dividend payout ratios and their importance. Here are some comments from the analyst:“The dividend payout ratio is a good indicator of a company’s dividend track record. It is the ratio of the total amount of dividends paid out to shareholders relative to the net income of the company.”He added:“The annual dividend payout ratio for dividend aristocrats is 30% to 50%. This allows them to retain enough cash if business stalls, or the economy turns downward.” Future Dividend Kings in the Next 6 Years or LessOur Methodology:For this list, we selected companies that have raised their dividend payouts for 44 years or more and are on a steady path to becoming dividend kings (companies which increase their dividends for 50 or more straight years). These companies would be achieving their Dividend King status in six years or less. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their consecutive years of dividend growth.12. The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW)Consecutive Years of Dividend Growth: 44The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW) is an Ohio-based paint and coating manufacturing company. On February 15, the company declared a 0.8% growth in its quarterly dividend to $0.605 per share. Through this increase, the company took its dividend growth streak to 44 years. The stock has a dividend yield of 1.15%, as of March 23.SHW is also favored by investors alongside some of the best dividend kings like The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG).In the fourth quarter of 2022, The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW) posted an EPS of $1.89, which beat Street estimates by $0.04. The company's revenue for the quarter came in at $5.23 billion, up 9.9% from the same period last year. In FY22, it paid $619 million to shareholders in dividends.In January, RBC Capital maintained an Outperform rating on The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW) with a $267 price target, expecting the company to benefit from US housing fundamentals.As per Insider Monkey's Q4 2022 database, 64 hedge funds reported having stakes in The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW), up from 63 in the previous quarter. These stakes have a total value of over $2.44 billion. With over 1.3 million shares, Farallon Capital was the company's leading stakeholder in Q4.ClearBridge Investments mentioned The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“A third approach to return generation is purchasing idiosyncratic businesses that largely control their own destiny. We saw mixed results from this group in the fourth quarter, with paint and coatings maker The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW) benefiting from significant pricing power that will allow it to grow earnings handsomely with only modest revenue increases.”11.

Study data, submitted along with the NDA, showed that ruxolitinib met the bioequivalence objective of Incyte’s Jakafi (ruxolitinib) tablets based on the area under the curve parameters. However, the FDA identified other additional requirements that were not satisfied for the approval of ruxolitinib XR tablets. Following the issue, Incyte intends to work closely with the FDA to discuss steps going forward to address the FDA’s decision.Jakafi, Incyte’s lead drug, is a first-in-class JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor, approved in the United States for the treatment of patients with PV, who have had an inadequate response to or are intolerant to hydroxyurea. It is also approved for the treatment of patients with intermediate or high-risk MF, including primary MF, post-PV MF and post-essential thrombocythemia MF. The drug is also approved in the United States for the treatment of steroid-refractory acute GVHD in adult and pediatric patients aged 12 years or older.Jakafi sales came in at $2.4 billion in 2022, contributing 71% to total revenues. Incyte has a collaboration agreement with Swiss pharma giant Novartis NVS for Jakafi. Jakafi is marketed by Incyte in the United States and by Novartis as Jakavi outside the country.Story continuesHowever, Incyte faces competition from other players in the market like Bristol-Myers Squibb Company BMY and CTI BioPharma Corp. CTIC. Bristol-Myers’ Inrebic (fedratinib) is approved for the treatment of adult patients for three indications – intermediate-2 or high-risk primary MF, post-PV MF and post-essential thrombocythaemia MF. Bristol-Myers also received marketing authorization in the European Union from the European Medicine Agency in early 2021 for the same three indications as in the United States.CTI Biopharma got accelerated approval for pacritinib in February 2022 for the treatment of adults with intermediate or high-risk primary or secondary (post-PV or post-essential thrombocythemia) MF with a platelet count below 50 × 109 /L (1).

The FDA acknowledged that the study submitted in the New Drug Application (NDA) met its objective of bioequivalence based on area under the curve (AUC) parameters but identified additional requirements for approval. Incyte intends to meet with the FDA to determine appropriate next steps.""While we are disappointed that the FDA issued a complete response letter for ruxolitinib extended-release tablets, we remain committed to advancing care for people with myeloproliferative neoplasms and GVHD,"" said Hervé Hoppenot, Chief Executive Officer, Incyte. ""We will work closely with the FDA on the appropriate next steps to address their comments.""The NDA was based on two studies designed to show that ruxolitinib XR tablets are dosage strength proportional and bioequivalent to Jakafi® (ruxolitinib) tablets. The first study was designed to determine the relative bioavailability of ruxolitinib XR tablets to Jakafi tablets and to demonstrate that ruxolitinib XR tablets are dosage strength proportional to Jakafi tablets. The second study was an open-label, randomized, two-period, two-way crossover study in 63 healthy adults evaluating the bioequivalence of the highest strength of ruxolitinib XR tablets (50 mg) dosed once-daily (QD) to the highest strength of Jakafi tablets (25 mg) dosed twice-daily (BID), following a single dose and at steady-state. Study results demonstrated that ruxolitinib XR 50 mg tablets dosed QD is bioequivalent to Jakafi 25 mg tablets dosed BID, based on AUC parameters.Story continuesAbout Jakafi® (ruxolitinib)Jakafi® (ruxolitinib) is a JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor approved by the U.S. FDA for treatment of polycythemia vera (PV) in adults who have had an inadequate response to or are intolerant of hydroxyurea; intermediate or high-risk myelofibrosis (MF), including primary MF, post-polycythemia vera MF and post-essential thrombocythemia MF in adults; steroid-refractory acute GVHD in adult and pediatric patients 12 years and older; and chronic GVHD after failure of one or two lines of systemic therapy in adult and pediatric patients 12 years and older1.Jakafi is a registered trademark of Incyte.Important Safety InformationJakafi can cause serious side effects, including:Low blood counts: Jakafi® (ruxolitinib) may cause low platelet, red blood cell, and white blood cell counts.

Among these, Incyte’s INCY skin cancer drug obtained FDA approval.  Altimmune ALT declined on mixed obesity data.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories:Altimmune Down on Obesity Data:  Clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company Altimmune, announced top-line results from the interim analysis of 160 subjects in its 48-week phase II MOMENTUM obesity study of pemvidutide at week 24 along with the results of the 12-week phase Ib safety trial of pemvidutide in subjects with obesity or overweight and type 2 diabetes.Data showed subjects receiving pemvidutide achieved mean weight losses of 7.3%, 9.4% and 10.7% at the 1.2 mg, 1.8 mg, and 2.4 mg doses, respectively, with the placebo group experiencing a mean weight loss of 1.0% at week 24. Of the subject population comprising subjects with baseline body weight less than or equal to 115 kg, 75% witnessed a mean weight loss of 8.2%, 10.6%, 11.9% and 0.8% at the 1.2 mg, 1.8 mg, 2.4 mg and placebo groups, respectively. Approximately 50% of subjects achieved 10% or more weight loss and about 20% of subjects achieved 15% or more weight loss at week 24 at the 1.8 mg and 2.4 mg doses.However, investors were most likely disappointed with adverse events (AEs), which mainly comprised upper gastrointestinal (GI) events of nausea and vomiting. One subject (2.4%) experienced a serious adverse event of nausea and vomiting, requiring rehydration at the 2.4 mg dose. Treatment discontinuation rates were 28.2% in subjects receiving placebo and 24.0% in subjects receiving pemvidutide.Results from the 12-week phase Ib study to treat obesity or overweight and type II diabetes showed average weight losses of 4.4%, 6.1% and 7.7% at the 1.2 mg, 1.8 mg and 2.4 mg doses of pemvidutide, respectively, with the placebo group experiencing a mean weight gain of 0.8%Biogen’s Update on Tofersen NDA: Biogen BIIB announced the outcome of the FDA’s Peripheral and Central Nervous System Drugs Advisory Committee meeting on pipeline candidate. The candidate is being evaluated for the treatment of superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), an ultra-rare, progressive and fatal neurodegenerative disease that results in the loss of motor neurons in the brain and the spinal cord that are responsible for controlling voluntary muscle movement. Biogen licensed tofersen from Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. under a collaborative development and license agreement.Story continuesThe committee voted unanimously 9:0 that reductions of neurofilament, a marker of neurodegeneration, observed in tofersen-treated patients in the clinical studies, are reasonably likely to predict the clinical benefit of tofersen for treating SOD1-ALS.  However, the opinion was mostly negative on the question of data from the placebo-controlled study and available long-term extension study results, with additional supporting results from the effects on relevant biomarkers providing substantial evidence of the effectiveness of tofersen in the treatment of patients with SOD1-ALS.  The committee voted 3:5 and one person abstained from voting on consideration of a potential traditional approval. Additionally, the committee discussed both topics and reached a consensus that the benefit-risk profile was favorable based on the review of the totality of data for tofersen in people with SOD1-ALS.The NDA for tofersen for the treatment of SOD1-ALS was submitted to the FDA for consideration under accelerated approval. The agency is continuing its review of tofersen with a target action date of Apr 25, 2023.Gilead Exercises Option for Targeted Protein Degrader:  Gilead Sciences, Inc. GILD announced that it has exercised its option to exclusively license Nurix Therapeutics’ investigational targeted protein degrader molecule NX 0479. Both companies announced a global strategic collaboration in 2019 to discover, develop and commercialize a pipeline of innovative targeted protein degradation drugs for cancer patients and other challenging diseases.Bivalent degrader NX 0479, designated as GS-6791, is the first development candidate resulting from this collaboration. The GS-6791 is a potent, selective, oral IRAK4 degrader that targets both the scaffold and kinase functions of the IRAK4 protein kinase to block inflammatory responses downstream of toll-like receptors (TLR) and the pro-inflammatory IL1 cytokine family of receptors (IL1Rs). The IRAK4 degradation has potential applications in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory diseases.Per the terms for the NX-0479 option that Gilead is exercising, Nurix will receive an option exercise payment of $20 million and could receive up to an additional $425 million in milestone payments, as well as up to low double-digit tiered royalties on product net sales. Shares of Nurix were up as investors seemed pleased about the cash inflow from the option exercise.Karuna’s Schizophrenia Study Data: Karuna Therapeutics, Inc. KRTX announced that its late-stage EMERGENT-3 stuyd evaluating the efficacy, safety and tolerability of its lead investigational therapy, KarXT (xanomeline-trospium) in adults with schizophrenia met its primary endpoint. KarXT demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful 8.4-point reduction in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score compared to placebo. Treatment with KarXT demonstrated reductions in both positive symptoms (like hallucinations or delusions) and negative symptoms (like, difficulty enjoying life or withdrawal from others) of schizophrenia, the secondary endpoints of the study.  Although KarXT demonstrated a clinically meaningful and statistically significant 3.5-point reduction in PANSS positive subscale compared to placebo at week five (-7.1 KarXT vs. -3.6 placebo; p&lt;0.0001), it did not meet the threshold for statistical significance at week five.Incyte’s Drug Approval: Incyte INCY announced that the FDA has granted accelerated approval to a biologics license application (BLA) for intravenous PD-1 inhibitor retifanlimab-dlwr. under the brand name Zynyz. The BLA was seeking approval to treat adults with metastatic or recurrent locally advanced merkel cell carcinoma (MCC).The accelerated approval was granted based on the tumor response rate and duration of response (DOR). Continued approval of Zynyz for this indication may be contingent on verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials.MCC, a rare and aggressive type of skin cancer, most often appears as a single, painless, reddish-purple skin nodule on the head, neck and arms in skin exposed to sunlight.The FDA approval was based on data from the POD1UM-201 trial, an open-label, multiregional, single-arm study that evaluated Zynyz in adults with metastatic or recurrent locally advanced MCC who had not received prior systemic therapy for their advanced disease.PerformanceThe Nasdaq Biotechnology Index has lost 2.22% in the past five trading sessions.

The BLA was seeking approval for the treatment of adults with metastatic or recurrent locally advanced merkel cell carcinoma (MCC).The drug has been approved under the brand name Zynyz.The accelerated approval was granted based on the tumor’s response rate and duration of response. Continued approval of Zynyz for this indication may be contingent on verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials.MCC, a rare and aggressive type of skin cancer, most often appears as a single, painless, reddish-purple skin nodule on the head, neck and arms in skin exposed to sunlight.The FDA approval was based on data from the POD1UM-201 trial, an open-label, multiregional, single-arm study of Zynyz in adults with metastatic or recurrent locally advanced MCC who had not received prior systemic therapy for their advanced disease.Zynyz monotherapy resulted in an objective response rate of 52% among chemotherapy-naïve patients. A complete response was seen in 12 patients (18%) and 22 patients (34%) showed partial response.The POD1UM program for retifanlimab includes POD1UM-201 and several other studies for patients with solid tumors, including registration-directed POD1UM trials evaluating retifanlimab as a monotherapy for patients with microsatellite instability, high endometrial cancer and squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal (SCAC) and in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy for patients with non-small cell lung cancer and SCAC.In July 2021, the FDA issued a complete response letter for the BLA of retifanlimab for the treatment of SCAC. In October 2021, Incyte withdrew the MAA seeking approval of retifanlimab for SCAC.The phase III POD1UM-304 study is evaluating retifanlimab in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy as a first-line treatment for patients with non-small cell lung cancer.Story continuesIncyte licensed retifanlimab from MacroGenics, Inc. in 2017.Shares of Incyte have lost 6.3% in the past year compared with the industry’s decline of 15.6%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Approval of additional drugs will add an incremental stream of revenues to the top line and reduce the company’s dependence on Jakafi.

But in contrast you can make much more than 100% if the company does well. For instance the Ingersoll Rand Inc. (NYSE:IR) share price is 135% higher than it was three years ago. Most would be happy with that. We note the stock price is up 2.7% in the last seven days.Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. View our latest analysis for Ingersoll Rand In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Ingersoll Rand was able to grow its EPS at 45% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. This EPS growth is higher than the 33% average annual increase in the share price. So it seems investors have become more cautious about the company, over time.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Ingersoll Rand has improved its bottom line over the last three years, but what does the future have in store? It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on how its financial position has changed over time.A Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that Ingersoll Rand shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 11% over the last year. And that does include the dividend. However, the TSR over five years, coming in at 12% per year, is even more impressive. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.

Their Wildfire Next Generation System is exactly the kind of innovative program that Chartwell Awards were designed to highlight. We look forward to the opportunity for other utilities to learn from SDG&amp;E's experience at PowerUp this summer,"" said Russ Henderson, Chartwell Director of Research.WiNGS is a cloud-based tool that combines visual representations of SDG&amp;E's infrastructure with real-time weather data and information from wildfire mitigation initiatives, including but not limited to historical ignitions, tree strike analysis, wildfire modeling, Public Safety Power Shutoff (PSPS) probability and critical customer locations. The state-of-the-art system models climate scenarios and recommends grid hardening initiatives, like prioritizing and strategically undergrounding power lines in high-risk areas, to help prevent utility-related wildfires, reduce the likelihood and duration of PSPS, and mitigate the impacts of climate change.""We developed the Wildfire Next Generation System to provide decision makers with real-time information on scenarios and action plans to reduce the risk of wildfires during high winds and other extreme weather conditions,"" said Ben Gordon, SDG&amp;E Senior Vice President, Chief Information Officer and Chief Digital Officer. ""This system is also invaluable in making proactive decisions to prioritize wildfire prevention efforts.""About WiNGSIn November of 2021, SDG&amp;E's IT Digital Innovation team partnered with the Wildfire Mitigation team to create a proof of concept to explore two goals: 1) to use data and analytics to produce visualizations that support Public Safety Power Shutoff (PSPS) decision-making by allowing users to run hypothetical scenarios based on changing requirements and parameters, like weather conditions and 2) support the Company's Wildfire Mitigation Program investments by providing SDG&amp;E leaders and scientists with a geospatial view of recommended mitigation actions and associated risk reduction.Story continues""WiNGS has proven to be a vital tool to help us prioritize wildfire hardening projects based on robust fire science data and real-world situations,"" said Brian D'Agostino SDG&amp;E Vice President of Wildfire and Climate Science. ""The intel it provides allows us to strategically make infrastructure improvements that will continue to help reduce the risk of wildfire, as well as the impacts to our customers during Public Safety Power Shutoffs in the future.""WiNGS has become another important tool in SDG&amp;E's toolbox to reduce the chances of a utility-related wildfire and helps guide the development and implementation of its Wildfire Mitigation Plan (WMP) filed annually with the Office of Energy Infrastructure Safety.

As you’ve no doubt heard, the U.S. and the rest of the world presently reel from two major banks failing. Moreover, the main concern centers on the contagion spreading to other components of the global economy.What really adds weight to the drama here is of course the Federal Reserve. The central bank must decide how to navigate monetary policy in light of recent developments. If the Fed reacts with a more dovish stance, it would contradict its stated intentions of controlling inflation. However, if it continues with interest rate hikes, this hawkish framework could break more cogs in the flywheel.No matter what, the Fed faces a gargantuan task with serious consequences either way. Basically, it’s caught between a rock and a hard place. With investors deeply (and understandably) concerned, the most-established businesses probably make the most sense. In that spirit, below are the defensive stocks to buy during this chaotic spell.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsPGRProgressive$139.07SAPSAP$121.38MRKMerck$105.85APDAir Products &amp; Chemicals$279.21WENWendy’s$21.05TJXTJX Companies$75.40XOMExxon Mobil$102.45Progressive (PGR)Man holding stacks of money. Millionaire.Source: Epic Cure / ShutterstockAs an insurance stalwart, Progressive (NYSE:PGR) makes for an ideal candidate for defensive stocks to buy. Featuring an established and permanently relevant business, PGR features predictability in the financials and the technicals. Further, the chaos from the coronavirus pandemic – such as heightened traffic incidents and property crime – incentive financial protection programs.Most importantly, Progressive garners the most attention for its auto insurance. Required by the vast majority of states, drivers practically can’t go anywhere (legally) without coverage. Therefore, Progressive cynically benefits from a captive audience.Story continuesTo be fair, the company doesn’t deliver the most remarkably positive financials. However, it does enough to get the job done. For example, Progressive’s three-year revenue growth rate pings at 8.3%, above 59.45% of its peers. As well, the company enjoys a long history of consistent annual profitability. Finally, Wall Street analysts peg PGR as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target comes in at $147, implying nearly 8% upside potential.SAP (SAP)A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.Source: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.comA German multinational software company, SAP (NYSE:SAP) develops enterprise software to manage business operations and customer relations. Further, the company is the world’s leading enterprise resource planning software vendor. Given the size and influence of its business, SAP makes for an ideal choice for defensive stocks to buy. Even with various economic challenges, companies must continue to operate. More often than not, the large players use SAP.While the company features far-from-perfect financials, it offers plenty of substance to chew on. For example, SAP’s Altman Z-Score pings at 4.09, indicating low bankruptcy risk. Operationally, its three-year free cash flow (FCF) growth rate comes in at 21.9%, above 64.74% of the industry. As well, its net margin is 7.4%, ranked better than 70.91% of sector rivals. Also, investors may note that right now, the market prices SAP at a forward multiple of 20.41. As a discount to earnings, SAP ranks better than 60.98% of the field.Lastly, covering analysts peg SAP as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $137, implying 15% upside potential.Merck (MRK)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar billsSource: shutterstock.com/CC7A multinational pharmaceutical giant, Merck (NYSE:MRK) makes for an intriguing case for defensive stocks to buy. Basically, no matter what happens with the global markets, people will need access to therapeutics and vaccines. While MRK incurred a volatile ride in the year so far, in the past 365 days, it gained almost 32% of equity value. Better yet, there may still be extra room in the tank.Overall, Merck enjoys a solid fiscal profile. Notably, its Altman Z-Score comes in at 4.49, which indicates low bankruptcy risk. Operationally, the company posts a three-year revenue growth rate of 15.4%, above nearly 75% of the drug manufacturing industry. Also, its book growth rate during the same period is 21.1%, well above average. On the bottom line, Merck’s net margin pings at 24.49%. This stat helps undergird the company’s forward yield of 2.8%, noticeably above the healthcare sector’s average yield of 1.58%.In closing, analysts peg MRK as a consensus moderate buy. Further, their average price target stands at $119.95, implying over 15% upside potential.Air Products and Chemicals (APD)tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comAn industrial player, Air Products and Chemicals (NYSE:APD) specializes in selling gases and chemicals for industrial uses. Fundamentally, APD makes for a solid case for defensive stocks to buy because of its “backstage” utility. While Air Products may not be a Broadway star so to speak, its services undergird various applications. Without the company, infrastructural networks could fail.In fairness, APD went volatile this year, shedding over 10% since the January opener. However, in the trailing one-year period, APD gained almost 19% of its equity value. On the financial front, Air Products delivers the goods. Its three-year revenue growth rate pings at 12.3%, ranking better than 67.43% of the competition. Also, it’s a stable business, as its Altman Z-Score of 4.44 indicates. On the bottom line, Air Products features a net margin of 17.61%, above 86.52% of sector players. Also, these robust earnings support the company’s forward yield of 2.55%.Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg APD as a consensus moderate buy. Moreover, their average price target stands at $324.67, implying over 18% upside potential.Wendy’s (WEN)Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words ""buy"" and ""sell"" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image.Source: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.comA popular fast-food chain, Wendy’s (NASDAQ:WEN) makes a compelling case as one of the defensive stocks to buy. Though it’s tied to the consumer discretionary sector, Wendy’s benefits from the trade-down effect. Essentially, as economic conditions worsen, consumers will eschew fine-dining establishments for cheaper fare like Wendy’s. That’s one positive catalyst.The other tailwind centers on social normalization. As white-collar employees return to the office, Wendy’s coffee and breakfast menu could be appealing to worker bees. In addition, Wendy’s offerings would compete effectively on price with premium-label coffee shops.Generally speaking, WEN represents one of the defensive stocks to buy that features just enough positives. For instance, the underlying company’s three-year revenue growth rate stands at 10.1%, above 84.45% of the competition. On the bottom line, its net margin comes in at 8.46%, boxing out 83.33% of sector players. Plus, Gurufocus’ proprietary calculations for fair market value (FMV) indicate WEN is undervalued. Looking to the Street, covering analysts peg WEN as a consensus hold. However, their average price target stands at $24.78, implying over 20% upside potential.TJX Companies (TJX)picture of a man circling buy on a stock chartSource: ImageFlow/ShutterStock.comFor those that don’t mind adding a little risk to their defensive stocks to buy in exchange for greater reward potential, TJX Companies (NYSE:TJX) brings plenty to think about. A multinational off-price department store, TJX largely offers a relevant business profile. However, the disruption of the Covid-19 pandemic clouded the narrative. With workers operating remotely, a wardrobe upgrade wasn’t really necessary.However, TJX may enjoy two powerful upside catalysts. First, as stated above, the normalization of society should incentive an apparel upgrade. Second, should the economy weaken, off-price department stores will look much more attractive. Demand may rise, making TJX one of the top defensive stocks to buy.Also, the company features several compelling fiscal attributes. Its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 7.6%, above 64.25% of the (cyclical) retail industry. On the bottom line, its net margin pings at 7%, above 75.61% of sector players. Likely to catch people off guard, analysts peg TJX as a unanimous strong buy. What’s more, their average price target stands at $90.73, implying nearly 22% upside potential.Exxon Mobil (XOM)image of businessperson and bar graph with dollar signs to represent undervalued stocksSource: Wright Studio/Shutterstock.comDespite the political and ideological winds favoring renewable energy infrastructures, hydrocarbon specialists will likely remain relevant for years. That’s good news then for Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), one of the top defensive stocks to buy. While energy prices may suffer from rising interest rates, it’s also possible they could rise on geopolitical catalysts.Obviously, the big one centers on China. With its economic reopening, a gradual increase in commercial activity should accelerate resource consumption. Cynically, that’s a tailwind for XOM stock. Also, the aforementioned social normalization trend should see traffic volume on U.S. roadways rise. If so, this framework may spark inflation in the energy arena.After struggling during the early phase of the Covid-19 disaster, Exxon Mobil looks quite attractive financially. For example, its three-year revenue growth rate of 15.9% ranks above 70.88% of the oil and gas industry. Further, its net margin of nearly 14% beats out almost 66% of its rivals. Finally, Wall Street analysts peg XOM as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $128.17, implying over 28% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their returns over the years, and go directly to read 5 Future Dividend Kings in the Next 6 Years or Less. Dividend Kings are companies that have dividend growth streaks of 50 years or more. Investors are inclined toward these securities as these companies are financially stable and are more likely to raise their payouts in the future. Moreover, these stocks also offer regular income to shareholders along with the potential for capital appreciation as the stock price grows over time. Some of the best dividend kings that investors are paying attention to include The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) as these companies have strong cash flow generation which enabled them to raise their payouts for decades.The current inflationary environment has enhanced the importance of dividend growers. Analysts also recommend loading up on companies with strong dividend growth track records instead of those with high yields. According to a report by Nuveen, global dividend-payers with modest yields of around 3% generally exhibit better earnings potential and higher profit margins when compared with high-yielding dividend stocks. The report also mentioned that dividend growth stocks outperformed their peers during monthly periods of rising volatility. From December 2002 to December 2022, dividend growers delivered an average excess return of 0.7% when the monthly volatility increase was over 20%.In addition to shareholder return, dividend stocks also contributed significantly to the overall market return. According to a report by T. Rowe Price, compounded dividends have represented over 70% of global market returns. The report also mentioned the performance of dividend growers over the years. The S&amp;P Dividend Aristocrat Index, which tracks the performance of companies that have raised their payouts for 25 years or more, has outperformed the wider market by over 75% since 1989.Story continuesPayout ratios also play a vital part when considering investments in dividend growers. In one of our previous articles titled 10 Companies Likely to be Dividend Kings in the Future, we mentioned a research which says dividend growers returned 11.1% on average in a 12-month period starting after the rate hikes in 1994 through the third quarter of 2022, compared with a 9.2% return of the wider market. We also mentioned that payout ratios below 50% are considered healthy as these companies have stable cash flow generation for shareholder return.Healthy payout ratios show the financial position of the company which directly affects the sustainability of future dividends. Andrew Crowell, financial adviser and vice chairman of wealth management at D.A. Davidson, spoke to Wall Street Journal about dividend payout ratios and their importance. Here are some comments from the analyst:“The dividend payout ratio is a good indicator of a company’s dividend track record. It is the ratio of the total amount of dividends paid out to shareholders relative to the net income of the company.”He added:“The annual dividend payout ratio for dividend aristocrats is 30% to 50%. This allows them to retain enough cash if business stalls, or the economy turns downward.” Future Dividend Kings in the Next 6 Years or LessOur Methodology:For this list, we selected companies that have raised their dividend payouts for 44 years or more and are on a steady path to becoming dividend kings (companies which increase their dividends for 50 or more straight years).

278,4aee23f2-2fd7-35ee-ae4b-01411a97eb8e,AAL,2023-03-24,American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/american-airlines-group-inc-aal-130001756.html,1679576401,STORY,['AAL'],"[American Airlines (AAL) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this world's largest airline have returned -11.2% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -1.2% change. The Zacks Transportation - Airline industry, to which American Airlines belongs, has lost 8% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.American Airlines is expected to post earnings of $0.01 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +100.4%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +800%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.16 points to a change of +332% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.3%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.73 indicates a change of +26.4% from what American Airlines is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for American Airlines.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for AAL _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of American Airlines, the consensus sales estimate of $12.25 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +37.6%. The $53.57 billion and $55.53 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +9.4% and +3.7%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryAmerican Airlines reported revenues of $13.19 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +39.9%. EPS of $1.17 for the same period compares with -$1.42 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.22 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.22%. The EPS surprise was +2.63%.Over the last four quarters, American Airlines surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.American Airlines is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about American Airlines. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

280,f89e7bd0-3bf0-3e87-ad61-fe92ff33cae0,SHW,2023-03-24,12 Future Dividend Kings in the Next 6 Years or Less,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/12-future-dividend-kings-next-192646605.html,1679599606,STORY,['SHW'],"[In this article, we discuss 12 future dividend kings in the next 6 years or less. You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their returns over the years, and go directly to read 5 Future Dividend Kings in the Next 6 Years or Less. Dividend Kings are companies that have dividend growth streaks of 50 years or more. Investors are inclined toward these securities as these companies are financially stable and are more likely to raise their payouts in the future. Moreover, these stocks also offer regular income to shareholders along with the potential for capital appreciation as the stock price grows over time. Some of the best dividend kings that investors are paying attention to include The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) as these companies have strong cash flow generation which enabled them to raise their payouts for decades.The current inflationary environment has enhanced the importance of dividend growers. Analysts also recommend loading up on companies with strong dividend growth track records instead of those with high yields. According to a report by Nuveen, global dividend-payers with modest yields of around 3% generally exhibit better earnings potential and higher profit margins when compared with high-yielding dividend stocks. The report also mentioned that dividend growth stocks outperformed their peers during monthly periods of rising volatility. From December 2002 to December 2022, dividend growers delivered an average excess return of 0.7% when the monthly volatility increase was over 20%.In addition to shareholder return, dividend stocks also contributed significantly to the overall market return. According to a report by T. Rowe Price, compounded dividends have represented over 70% of global market returns. The report also mentioned the performance of dividend growers over the years. The S&amp;P Dividend Aristocrat Index, which tracks the performance of companies that have raised their payouts for 25 years or more, has outperformed the wider market by over 75% since 1989.Story continuesPayout ratios also play a vital part when considering investments in dividend growers. In one of our previous articles titled 10 Companies Likely to be Dividend Kings in the Future, we mentioned a research which says dividend growers returned 11.1% on average in a 12-month period starting after the rate hikes in 1994 through the third quarter of 2022, compared with a 9.2% return of the wider market. We also mentioned that payout ratios below 50% are considered healthy as these companies have stable cash flow generation for shareholder return.Healthy payout ratios show the financial position of the company which directly affects the sustainability of future dividends. Andrew Crowell, financial adviser and vice chairman of wealth management at D.A. Davidson, spoke to Wall Street Journal about dividend payout ratios and their importance. Here are some comments from the analyst:“The dividend payout ratio is a good indicator of a company’s dividend track record. It is the ratio of the total amount of dividends paid out to shareholders relative to the net income of the company.”He added:“The annual dividend payout ratio for dividend aristocrats is 30% to 50%. This allows them to retain enough cash if business stalls, or the economy turns downward.” Future Dividend Kings in the Next 6 Years or LessOur Methodology:For this list, we selected companies that have raised their dividend payouts for 44 years or more and are on a steady path to becoming dividend kings (companies which increase their dividends for 50 or more straight years). These companies would be achieving their Dividend King status in six years or less. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their consecutive years of dividend growth.12.

Other well known tycoons have tried to go toe-to-toe with the drinks giants, and failed, most notably Richard Branson with his Virgin Cola.But Asia's richest person has famously disrupted India's telecoms market seven years ago with cut-throat pricing to make Reliance the leading player in that industry. And he's applying some of that same strategy in his soft drinks venture.""Coca-Cola and Pepsi are unused to a nationwide challenge, and Reliance has the financial muscle and reach to challenge them with a local brand with high nostalgic value,"" said Amulya Pandit, a consultant at Euromonitor International.A person with direct knowledge of Reliance's plan said it aims to open some factories of its own or as joint ventures to make Campa, and take the soda to hotels, restaurants and in-flight sales. Production of Campa is currently outsourced, after its $2.7 million acquisition of the brand last year.The company is heavily discounting in-store prices. A two-litre Campa Cola bottle is priced at 49 rupees (60 U.S. cents) in stores, a near 50% discount on its label price, and around a third lower than 2.25-litre Coke and Pepsi variants, a Reuters check showed. The smallest bottles of Campa Cola and Coke both cost 10 rupees, while Pepsi starts from 12 rupees.Story continues""The price will be disruptive across,"" said the person, who added Reliance is planning an advertising spree during the upcoming popular IPL cricket tournament and is in talks with at least three teams to make Campa their refreshment partner.The person did not want to be identified as the strategy is confidential. Reliance did not respond to a request for comment, while Pepsi said it doesn't comment on competition as a policy.Coca-Cola said it has broadly kept prices of its small bottles unchanged since last year and was focused on expanding distribution. ""Having new players in the market presents a great opportunity for investments to develop the market further,"" it said.Reliance, India's top retailer, will supply Campa to its 2,500 grocery outlets and thousands of smaller non-network stores as part of its new consumer goods push from which it has set an internal target of $6.5 billion in annual revenues within five years.The company also has a grocery shopping app and a wholesale vertical under which it supplies consumer goods to 500,000 mom-and-pop stores, which it will also tap for Campa sales.'GREAT INDIAN TASTE' VS FOREIGN BRANDSReliance's cola and consumer goods foray is being driven by T. Krishnakumar, an executive who worked for nearly 17 years at Coca-Cola in various leadership roles.Pepsi and Coca-Cola will also cautiously eye Reliance's marketing strategy after it targetted nationalist sentiment and nostalgia by promoting Campa as a homegrown brand with ""Great Indian Taste"" and a ""rich heritage"".A former Pepsi executive who did not want to be identified because of the sensitive nature of the subject said the U.S. firm has always been worried about local products marketed with an ""India First"" agenda, especially at a time when Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself backs self-reliance.The rivalry is already playing out in the market.In five Reliance outlets that Reuters visited in Mumbai in India's west, Chennai in the south and Lucknow in the north, Campa cola or lemon plastic bottles were displayed at the main entry gates or placed on shelves just next to the rivals.At one Chennai outlet, a Reliance store manager said this year they were placing Campa at the entrance for promoting it, with rivals tucked behind it and not visible at first glance. Another city store employee said 30 Campa bottles were being sold for every 100 of Pepsi and Coca-Cola.For now, the U.S. rivals have an upper hand. Pepsi and Coca-Cola drinks are available in at least 3 million Indian outlets and the companies have a widespread logistics network, dozens of factories and the advantage of a taste preferred by many, said Alok Shah, a consumer analyst at India's Ambit Capital.""We'll need to wait and watch to see if consumers switch to Campa,"" he said, adding that Pepsi and Coke remain aspirational foreign brands for many Indians, offered at largely similar small-pack prices.Srinivas Rao said he still loves Coca-Cola's Thums Up, a domestic brand it acquired in 1993 and is its best-selling one in India, unlike in the U.S. where Coke dominates.""We buy Thums Up every time we eat biryani or meat at home. We are not drawn to discounts from other brands including Campa,"" Rao said outside a Reliance store in Chennai.(Reporting by Praveen Paramasivam and Aditya Kalra; Additional reporting by Jessica DiNapoli, Francis Mascarenhas, Saurabh Sharma and Jatindra Dash; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman)]"

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their returns over the years, and go directly to read 5 Future Dividend Kings in the Next 6 Years or Less. Dividend Kings are companies that have dividend growth streaks of 50 years or more. Investors are inclined toward these securities as these companies are financially stable and are more likely to raise their payouts in the future. Moreover, these stocks also offer regular income to shareholders along with the potential for capital appreciation as the stock price grows over time. Some of the best dividend kings that investors are paying attention to include The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) as these companies have strong cash flow generation which enabled them to raise their payouts for decades.The current inflationary environment has enhanced the importance of dividend growers. Analysts also recommend loading up on companies with strong dividend growth track records instead of those with high yields. According to a report by Nuveen, global dividend-payers with modest yields of around 3% generally exhibit better earnings potential and higher profit margins when compared with high-yielding dividend stocks. The report also mentioned that dividend growth stocks outperformed their peers during monthly periods of rising volatility. From December 2002 to December 2022, dividend growers delivered an average excess return of 0.7% when the monthly volatility increase was over 20%.In addition to shareholder return, dividend stocks also contributed significantly to the overall market return. According to a report by T. Rowe Price, compounded dividends have represented over 70% of global market returns. The report also mentioned the performance of dividend growers over the years. The S&amp;P Dividend Aristocrat Index, which tracks the performance of companies that have raised their payouts for 25 years or more, has outperformed the wider market by over 75% since 1989.Story continuesPayout ratios also play a vital part when considering investments in dividend growers. In one of our previous articles titled 10 Companies Likely to be Dividend Kings in the Future, we mentioned a research which says dividend growers returned 11.1% on average in a 12-month period starting after the rate hikes in 1994 through the third quarter of 2022, compared with a 9.2% return of the wider market. We also mentioned that payout ratios below 50% are considered healthy as these companies have stable cash flow generation for shareholder return.Healthy payout ratios show the financial position of the company which directly affects the sustainability of future dividends. Andrew Crowell, financial adviser and vice chairman of wealth management at D.A. Davidson, spoke to Wall Street Journal about dividend payout ratios and their importance. Here are some comments from the analyst:“The dividend payout ratio is a good indicator of a company’s dividend track record. It is the ratio of the total amount of dividends paid out to shareholders relative to the net income of the company.”He added:“The annual dividend payout ratio for dividend aristocrats is 30% to 50%. This allows them to retain enough cash if business stalls, or the economy turns downward.” Future Dividend Kings in the Next 6 Years or LessOur Methodology:For this list, we selected companies that have raised their dividend payouts for 44 years or more and are on a steady path to becoming dividend kings (companies which increase their dividends for 50 or more straight years). These companies would be achieving their Dividend King status in six years or less. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their consecutive years of dividend growth.12.

(PEP) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pepsico-inc-pep-trending-stock-130001899.html,1679576401,STORY,['PEP'],"[PepsiCo (PEP) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this food and beverage company have returned +0.2%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -1.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry, which PepsiCo falls in, has gained 1.4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, PepsiCo is expected to post earnings of $1.37 per share, indicating a change of +6.2% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.1% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.23 points to a change of +6.5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.1%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.81 indicates a change of +8% from what PepsiCo is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.1%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for PepsiCo.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for PEP _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For PepsiCo, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $17.18 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +6.1%. For the current and next fiscal years, $89.48 billion and $93.97 billion estimates indicate +3.6% and +5% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPepsiCo reported revenues of $28 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +10.9%. EPS of $1.67 for the same period compares with $1.53 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $26.85 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +4.27%. The EPS surprise was +1.83%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.PepsiCo is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about PepsiCo. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The drug is already approved for asthma and some skin conditions, such as eczema. But its role in treating COPD came to light for the first time in over a decade.New data from a phase three clinical trial shows Dupixent lowered bad bouts of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD, by 30% compared with a placebo over 52 weeks, per a CNBC article. The trial enrolled COPD patients with type 2 inflammation — an allergic response that can result in decreased lung function. About 300,000 people in the United States alone live with COPD with type 2 inflammation, according to Regeneron.The more than 900 participants in the trial showed improvements in lung function on receiving Dupixent. The companies said a second phase three trial of Dupixent in COPD is ongoing, with data likely to come in 2024.“This benefit suggests a clear clinically meaningful benefit for Dupixent and should support broad usage for the asset in this segment of the COPD market,” Schott wrote in a research note to clients Thursday, as quoted on the above-mentioned CNBC article.The article pointed out that J.P. Morgan expects to see new COPD patients infusing $1.5 billion to $2 billion in new sales for Dupixent. Dupixent amassed sales of $8.7 billion last year for Regeneron, up 40% year over year.Against this backdrop, investors can bet on the pharma ETFs that are heavy on Sanofi and Regeneron.ETFs in FocusInvesco Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (IBBQ) Regeneron: 7.96% of the fund’s weightSanofi: 1.43% of the fund’s weightThe underlying Nasdaq Biotechnology Index measures the performance of either biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies.

The jump came on an impressive volume with a higher-than-average number of shares changing hands in the session. This compares to the stock's 0.4% gain over the past four weeks.Share prices rose after the company announced positive data from a late-stage study evaluating its blockbuster drug Dupixent in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) indication. Data from this study showed that treatment with Dupixent achieved a 30% reduction in moderate or severe acute COPD exacerbations, the study’s primary endpoint. Treatment with the drug also led to improved lung function, quality of life and reduction in disease symptoms. Investors cheered on this news as a potential approval in COPD indication will drive Dupixent’s sales even higher.This biopharmaceutical company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $9.54 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -17%. Revenues are expected to be $2.94 billion, down 0.9% from the year-ago quarter.While earnings and revenue growth expectations are important in evaluating the potential strength in a stock, empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For Regeneron, the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. And a stock's price usually doesn't keep moving higher in the absence of any trend in earnings estimate revisions.

Data from the BOREAS study showed that Dupixent, when added to maximal standard-of-care inhaled therapy, achieved a 30% reduction in moderate or severe acute COPD exacerbations — the primary endpoint —  over a 52-week treatment period, against placebo. Treatment with the drug also led to improved lung function, quality of life and reduction in disease symptoms.Dupixent is currently approved in the United States and EU for five type II inflammatory diseases, namely severe chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis, severe asthma, moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis, eosinophilic esophagitis and prurigo nodularis.Shares of Sanofi have gained 0.7% in the year so far against the industry’s 7.6% fall.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchDupixent is being jointly marketed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. Sanofi records global net product sales of Dupixent, while Regeneron records its share of profits/losses in connection with the global sales of the drug.COPD is a life-threatening respiratory disease that damages the lungs and causes progressive lung function decline. Smoking is also a key risk factor for COPD. The disease is the third leading cause of death worldwide. Management estimates that around 300,000 people are living with uncontrolled COPD with type II inflammation in the United States. Currently, there are limited treatment options for COPD patients. In fact, no novel treatments have been approved targeting this indication in more than a decade.An approval for Dupixent in COPD indication will drive the drug’s sales higher.Apart from the BOREAS study, Sanofi and Regeneron are also evaluating the drug in COPD indication in an ongoing second replicate phase III study (NOTUS). Data from the same is expected next year.Story continuesDupixent has become the key driver of the top line for Sanofi. Dupixent generated global product sales of $8.3 billion in 2022, which were recorded by Sanofi, representing growth of 43.8% at a constant exchange rate. With outside U.S. revenues accelerating and multiple approvals for new indications and expansion in younger patient populations expected, its sales are likely to be higher.Dupixent is now annualizing at close to €9.0 billion in sales after around five years on the market. Sanofi expects Dupixent to achieve more than €13 billion in peak sales and €10 billion in 2023.Sanofi and Regeneron are also studying dupilumab in late-stage studies in a broad range of diseases driven by type II inflammation, like bullous pemphigoid and chronic spontaneous urticaria.Sanofi Price Sanofi PriceSanofi price | Sanofi Quote Zacks Rank &amp; Stocks to ConsiderSanofi currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A couple of better-ranked stocks in the overall healthcare sector are Adaptive Biotechnologies Corporation ADPT and Atara Biotherapeutics ATRA, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

It's only natural to consider a company's balance sheet when you examine how risky it is, since debt is often involved when a business collapses. Importantly, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN) does carry debt. But is this debt a concern to shareholders?When Is Debt Dangerous?Debt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. In the worst case scenario, a company can go bankrupt if it cannot pay its creditors. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together. Check out our latest analysis for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals What Is Regeneron Pharmaceuticals's Net Debt?As you can see below, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals had US$1.98b of debt, at December 2022, which is about the same as the year before. You can click the chart for greater detail. But on the other hand it also has US$7.74b in cash, leading to a US$5.76b net cash position.debt-equity-history-analysisA Look At Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' LiabilitiesWe can see from the most recent balance sheet that Regeneron Pharmaceuticals had liabilities of US$3.14b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$3.41b due beyond that. Offsetting this, it had US$7.74b in cash and US$5.33b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So it actually has US$6.52b more liquid assets than total liabilities.Story continuesThis surplus suggests that Regeneron Pharmaceuticals has a conservative balance sheet, and could probably eliminate its debt without much difficulty. Simply put, the fact that Regeneron Pharmaceuticals has more cash than debt is arguably a good indication that it can manage its debt safely.The modesty of its debt load may become crucial for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals if management cannot prevent a repeat of the 44% cut to EBIT over the last year. When it comes to paying off debt, falling earnings are no more useful than sugary sodas are for your health. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Regeneron Pharmaceuticals's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.But our final consideration is also important, because a company cannot pay debt with paper profits; it needs cold hard cash. While Regeneron Pharmaceuticals has net cash on its balance sheet, it's still worth taking a look at its ability to convert earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow, to help us understand how quickly it is building (or eroding) that cash balance. Over the most recent three years, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals recorded free cash flow worth 68% of its EBIT, which is around normal, given free cash flow excludes interest and tax. This free cash flow puts the company in a good position to pay down debt, when appropriate.Summing UpWhile we empathize with investors who find debt concerning, you should keep in mind that Regeneron Pharmaceuticals has net cash of US$5.76b, as well as more liquid assets than liabilities. And it impressed us with free cash flow of US$3.4b, being 68% of its EBIT. So we don't have any problem with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals's use of debt. Of course, we wouldn't say no to the extra confidence that we'd gain if we knew that Regeneron Pharmaceuticals insiders have been buying shares: if you're on the same wavelength,  you can find out if insiders are buying by clicking this link.If, after all that, you're more interested in a fast growing company with a rock-solid balance sheet, then check out our list of net cash growth stocks without delay.Have feedback on this article?

These will be useful in broadening access to laboratory tests for transplanting solid organ, human cells and tissue.Quest Advanced Specialized Transplant Services currently comprises one of the most comprehensive transplant testing portfolios available in the market. It features a broad menu of more than 170 specialized transplant and infectious disease tests.Additionally, it provides longitudinal trends analysis of test results in the physician's electronic medical record (EMR). Also, it has round-the-clock support services that include medical consultation to ensure appropriate test selection and results interpretation affecting care.More on the NewsThe services are available to recipients and living donors across the United States (excluding Alaska and Hawaii), broadening access for both donors and patients.During traditional organ transplantation procedures, living donors and recipients commonly face the issue of absence of any specialized pre- and post-testing and results reporting in their local community. With the latest development, Quest Diagnostics is putting efforts to address those limitations.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAccording to Quest Diagnostics, these specialized services, featuring Anywhere-Access in the United States, include personalized patient access to the company’s national network of 2,100 patient service centers and 5,000 mobile and at-home phlebotomists to support patient-compliant pre- and post-transplant testing and nationwide access, regardless of surgical center location.Market ProspectGoing by data provided by Quest Diagnostics, in 2021 alone, over 6,500 transplants were performed from living donors. This was an increase of 14.2% over 2020. According to the company, medical advances and less restrictive medical guidelines have now allowed more individuals, including those diagnosed with hepatitis C or HIV, to act as living donors (for transplant recipients already infected).Story continuesIn such a scenario, DGX’s latest development is well-timed.Quest Diagnostics' Focus on High Growth AvenueQuest Diagnostics continued to ramp investments in advanced diagnostics capabilities. During the last-reported fourth quarter of 2022, the company launched a solid tumor expanded panel as a laboratory-developed test. This test extends the company’s capabilities beyond tissue pathology to offer a faster turnaround time from cancer diagnosis to therapy selection. Throughout 2022, Quest Diagnostics continued to make investments to strengthen the bio-informatics capabilities that support some of the faster-growing opportunities of the portfolio, like genomic sequencing services, prenatal and hereditary genetic testing and pharma services. The company also invested in the women’s health sales force, which will position it well for continued strong growth in prenatal genetics.Further, in 2022, the company launched its new digital platform — QuestHealth.com. Following the launch of the new consumer site, the company began ramping up marketing spend through the fourth quarter.Share PriceIn the past year, Quest Diagnostics has outperformed its industry.

With this in mind, we are always looking at value, growth, and momentum trends to discover great companies.Considering these trends, value investing is clearly one of the most preferred ways to find strong stocks in any type of market. Value investors use tried-and-true metrics and fundamental analysis to find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the ""Value"" category. When paired with a high Zacks Rank, ""A"" grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today.One company to watch right now is Ameriprise Financial (AMP). AMP is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as a Value grade of A. The stock is trading with P/E ratio of 9.67 right now. For comparison, its industry sports an average P/E of 12.65. Over the past 52 weeks, AMP's Forward P/E has been as high as 12.71 and as low as 7.92, with a median of 10.47.Investors will also notice that AMP has a PEG ratio of 0.54. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. AMP's industry currently sports an average PEG of 0.66. Over the last 12 months, AMP's PEG has been as high as 0.77 and as low as 0.50, with a median of 0.64.Value investors also frequently use the P/S ratio. This metric is found by dividing a stock's price with the company's revenue. This is a prefered metric because revenue can't really be manipulated, so sales are often a truer performance indicator. AMP has a P/S ratio of 2.18. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 2.42.Story continuesFinally, investors should note that AMP has a P/CF ratio of 13.35. This figure highlights a company's operating cash flow and can be used to find firms that are undervalued when considering their impressive cash outlook. AMP's P/CF compares to its industry's average P/CF of 27.65. AMP's P/CF has been as high as 15.71 and as low as 7.92, with a median of 10.92, all within the past year.Value investors will likely look at more than just these metrics, but the above data helps show that Ameriprise Financial is likely undervalued currently. And when considering the strength of its earnings outlook, AMP sticks out at as one of the market's strongest value stocks.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The top environment persisted in the fourth quarter making the entire 2022 a challenging year. Specially ending the COVID zero policy resulted in a significant upgrade of COVID cases in late 2022, where led to a nationwide disruption in supply chain and logistics. Along with the worst ever consumption sentiment. We missed a general decline in sales across different categories, channels and cities, reflecting the lower consumer spending, our revenue declined approximately 20% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. However, we're glad that despite the weaker top line, we achieved the higher operating profit and the recorded positive cash flow for the fourth quarter.We were able to achieve this on the such a difficult and unpredictable environment by making sure operations were interrupted, relying on our battle tested technology and regional service centers. In addition, our reform of employee compensation and the incentive programs also generated higher productivity. As a result, we were able to improve the quality of our earnings. In this COVID, in the past three years had a dramatic impact our people daily life. Seems like long COVID it also has a long-term impact on consumer competence. Well, we observed a modest rise in China's retail industry this February, we believe a full recovery in consumer sentiment will take time. In spite of this difficult environments, it is encouraging to see that many of our brand partners have remained committed to invest in China for the long-term, especially with regards to technology, digitalization and local marketing to serve Chinese consumers in local relevant ways.Looking forward, we see a rapid merging of online and offline e-commerce, however which is represent a huge opportunity. We believe it is our expertise in technology for the service of brand options operations, that fundamentally defines whole Baozun business. As shown on the Slide number three, adhering to our vision of technology empowers the future success, our technology and operating platform service as a unified and solid foundation that powers our broaden the scope of service and the markets. Baozun now has three major business lines, while the e-commerce BEC, Baozun Brand Management BBM and Baozun International BZI. Baozun e-commerce or BEC remains our core business in recent years -- in addition to leading the way and helping brand partners accelerate their digital transformation, we continue to improve our value added services, upgrade BECs integrated operating platforms and the middle office systems for better accountability, efficiency and flexibility.We also diversed our category mix made complimentary business acquisitions and invested in our people. I would like to highlight one person in particular, Arthur Yu, who was instrumental in every aspect of this advancements to make our e-commerce business more resilient and balanced. Naturally as we expand our scope and markets I'm thankful to Arthur for accepting additional role of President of BEC in addition to his role as CFO. For additional BEC highlights and objectives I will let Arthur discuss later in the call. Baozun Brand Management or BBM is our focus for growth and profitability over the next three years and beyond. Consumers now prefer brands powered by China-for-China products and a communication. Offering China tailor made updates and iterations.Clearly, in addition to e-commerce and Digital Business Solutions, brands need a brand new management powered by technology and digitalization. As you may recall, on February the 1 of this year, we completed the acquisition of Gap Shanghai, Gap's operations in Mainland, Hong Kong and Macau, China are now a part of Baozun Brand Management, led by Sandrine Zerbib, our President of BBM and Wing Xiao, the newly appointed CEO of Gap Greater China. With a core team of functional experts who understand both China consumers and local market dynamics, we have confidence in our China-for-China strategy and the digitalization initiatives for Gap Greater China. For BBM highlights and objectives, I will let Sandrine discuss later in the call. Baozun International or BZI is a longer term opportunity that we will patiently invest in and explore.We have a natural affinity to replicate our China e-commerce success. We work with brand partners to co-develop glocalization. Glocalization is a term combining global and local and we refer to our philosophy is a while we pursue global opportunities, where we rely on local expertise and resources. Where necessary, we will form local strategic alliances. We're initiated in some trials in Southeast Asia and Europe. As a sneak peak in Southeast Asia we have already established the region's headquarters in Singapore and operations in six markets in the region. With our technology IT infrastructure and data advantage, brands that wish to expand into Southeast Asia are excited to engage with us. This February 2023, we made an important interest investment along with proceeds in Branded Lifestyle Asia limited.It is a leading premium fashion retailer with a strong brand portfolio that includes products and Roots and a proven track record in South Korea and Taiwan. Fung Group, a global leader in the consumer goods supply chain is a majority shareholder. We have also entered into strategic cooperation agreement to become the preferred strategic service provider for the e-commerce operations in Asia, outside of the PRC. Baozun and the Fung Group are setting up a strategic technology committee to jointly develop an enterprise wide technology strategy covering proposals for ERP technologies, systems and platforms suitable for digital transformation. We're excited about overseas opportunities. Although, we don't aim to immediately generate meaningful revenue from Baozun International in the next three years, I'm adopting an entrepreneurial mindset for international expansion.I will personally share the development of Baozun International in technology routine approach. As we expand our scope, we now have increased our addressable market and the revenue sources. Clearly, BEC represents our existing China e-commerce revenue stream while BBM and the BZI are incremental opportunities providing tangible growth path over the next five years. With greater business diversification and explendid leadership, we're confident in our roadmap. Let me now pass the call over to Arthur.Arthur Yu: Okay, thank you, Vincent and hello, everyone. It's a great pleasure to communicate with you for the first time as the Group CFO and the President of Baozun e-commerce. I will do a quick review of the financials of the fourth quarter and full year of 2022 following by a business updates on Baozun e-commerce. Now please turn to Slide number 4. Despite the weak consumption sentiments, our total GMV showed resilience and was nearly flat on a year-over-year basis. Benefiting from a diversified category mix. FMCG outperformed with high double-digit growth well applying contracts is the most. Our net revenues declined by 20% to RMB2.6 billion of which products sales declined by 37% and service revenue decreased by 8% compared with the same period of last year.Let's turn to Slide number 5 for a breakdown of revenue. We continue to prioritize the service model, especially focusing on value added service in digital marketing and IT services. Well reducing low quality product sales during the quarter. Our digital marketing and IT solutions decreased by 7% mainly due to brand partners reduced the marketing budget. Warehousing and the fulfillment service revenue declined by 13% of which 13% was due to the disposal of Baobida the delivery business representing a 3% reduction in an apple to apple comparison business. In addition, our service revenue from apparel and accessories despite a lower GMV in category continues to grow during the quarter, reflecting higher take rate for deeper service penetration.In total revenue from service declined by 8% year-over-year. Our total product sales declined by 37% during the quarter, reflecting the weak consumption sentiments towards appliance category and our continuous efforts in optimization of life profitable product sales from electronics. Please turn to Slide number 6. In this quarter, our cost of products decreased by 38% to RMB643 million, mainly due to lower product sales. One highlight is the gross margin for product sales improved by 155 bps to 16.7%. Our overall gross margin improved by 770 bps to 74.8% driven by a combination of higher service revenue mix and improving gross margin of product sales. Now turning to Slide number 7. Our non-GAAP income from operations was RMB183 million during the quarter, more than doubled than a year ago.Mobile phone, Industry, TehnologyPhoto by NordWood Themes on UnsplashNon-GAAP operating profit margin was 7.2%, compared with 2.2% a year ago. During the same quarter of last year, there was a one off G&amp;A of RMB44 million related to our move into the new headquarters and the loss of RMB30 million from Baobida. Excluding such impact, our non-GAAP operating profit still grow 43% year-over-year. Non-GAAP net income was RMB168 million this quarter, compared with RMB89 million in the same period of last year. Once again, we have prepared waterfall diagrams depicting our analysis of how our top-line and bottom-line evolved year-over-year. As a reminder, the latest analysis is unaudited and should solely be used as supporting numbers to aid discussion. First on Slide number 8, this waterfall diagram shows our net revenues walk from Q4 2021 to Q4 2022.In red, you can see that the biggest item impacting our revenue this quarter was product sales as we just talked about. Revenue from DM and IT services has shown resilience and the warehouse and logistics revenue, excluding the disposable of Baobida declined by 3%. Excluding the impact of such disposal, the apple to apple revenue declined by 17% of which service revenues declined by 4%. Now please turn to Slide number 9 for the indicative walk of non-GAAP operating profit. In light of the weaker consumption sentiment, we have implemented several cost optimization initiatives, including centralizing our operating capabilities, rationalizing incentives and consolidating office footprint since the beginning of 2022. More than 1,600 of our customer service staff are now located in regional service centers.By utilizing S-ANY modules across regional service centers with lower cost increase service flexibility and agility to pay to cope with COVID induced turbulence. For full year 2022, we generated over RMB30 million in savings from regional service center. Now that major cost saving initiative is to the introduction of Baozun Business Ownership BBO compensation framework, which provides higher performance incentives linking to improvement in productivity, quality and sustainability. We achieved another RMB50 million cost saving from BBO initiative in 2022. This quarter, we are seeing profitability leverage, especially with the strong seasonality of China e-commerce in the fourth quarter, and the leverage applies to almost all categories and all service models.I believe the chart is self-explanatory, and just one to highlight that this portal of Baobida which generated a profit saving of RMB30 million, and product sales bottom line deteriorated by RMB12 million. Due to weak top line as well as higher product costs related to default and imperfect products due to higher return rate. Now turn to Slide number 10 about our cash flow. As of December 31, 2022, our cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investment totaled RMB3.1 billion. In light of the micro uncertainties, we continue to improve the working capital efficiency and our initiatives to further advance our back-end processes to improve inventory management and billing and collection activities have proven to be effective. During the quarter our total operating cash flow grow by 17% to RMB622 million.Please turn to Slide number 11, for a quick full year summary. We ended 2022 on a solid note, with total GMV of RMB84 billion, an increase of 19% year-over-year. Our non-GAAP operating profit is RMB256 million an increase of 14% year-over-year. Annual operating cash flow reached RMB367 million, a new record since our inception, and our balance sheet also remained solid with RMB3.1 billion in total cash. In summary, this meant a challenging year, our business model delivered positive non-GAAP operating profits and cash flow. I want to quickly mention that came in our new group structure. We will begin reporting segments financials in quarter one 2023 to better reflect our business activities. Along this thought, we will stop reporting costly GMV metrics.I said metric has become like indicative of our actual group performance. I'd like to take this opportunity to share some progress we made in the Baozun e-commerce during last year. Right at the beginning of 2022, we stressed that our overall goal is high quality sustainable business apparel. To achieve this goal, we continuously made efforts for all the services to be more customer centric. Diversify our business models through innovation and continuously optimize our cost structure. Let me share some specific items on Slide number 12. Our omnichannel end to end value added services are highly recognized by customers. By the end of the year, we have 42% of our branded partners increase the weight of an omni-channel business. We further enhanced our service penetration with value added service accounting half of our revenue stream.By end of 2022, we have a total of over 400 brand partners and some of these brands engage with us firstly in value added service of technology and digital marketing. Our regional service center, RSC continues to expand, reducing costs and increasing efficiency, while improving the service quality. We launched BOCDOP to deepen the commercialization of technology and explore new market opportunities. Our logistics and warehouse division further enhanced strategic cooperation with Cainiao. We established Baozun carbon neutrality whitepaper, clarifying the dual carbon goal and releasing sustainable development responsibilities in multiple dimensions. On November 1, 2022, we officially become a deal primary latest company on the main board of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, and NASDAQ Global Select Market.And lastly, in 2022, we win the best employer brands award for the seventh consecutive year. It exemplifies our business development has always been in harmony with social responsibility. Our business philosophy is to put the customer first and create value for them. Throughout the year, we continue to help our brand partner with initiatives for innovative user engagement and to find on customer journeys. This innovation includes fund generation campaigns, AI based shots video creation tools, game based interactive social marketing, and business intelligence dashboards to improve decision-making effectiveness. For instance, in last year's Double 11, our efforts enabled one of our brand partners, a leading international sportswear brand, not only ranked number one brand in GMV generation, but also number one in traffic.Number one in live streaming, along with number one in membership acquisition. This is a demonstration of how we empower our brand partners and also our commitment to facilitate our brand partner's success. This commitment also applies to our new journeys in Baozun Brand Management. So let me now turn the call over to Sandrine to elaborate more on BBM.Sandrine Zerbib: Thank you, Vincent and Arthur and thank you all for joining us today. It is my great pleasure to speak with you. As we have previously stated Baozun Brand Management is a strategic addition that naturally flows from existing core e-commerce service business. BBM Baozun Brand Management is a holistic, all rounded partner for global brands to further unlock their business potential in China. Our technologies and insights enable us to forge a sustainable symbiotic relationship between physical retail and online commerce. We aim to deliver the best in class seamless omni-channel experience by integrating the digital and the physical at scale and succeed where few have done so in retail. Please turn to Slide number 13, Baozun Brand Management.Today's digital transformation, in fact every aspect of business in general and of brand business in particular, from integration of online and offline stores, increasing share of marketing budgets to digital marketing and the accelerating use of big data and AI in brands product creation cycle and customer relationship.

We are positioning in the mid-end and premium consumer lifestyle brands segments and we target brands with strong potential in China and Asia and strong digital presence.Now, let me provide you with a high level summary of our first 50-days post-acquisition of Gap, the first brand that has entered the BBM portfolio. Gap is an advantages starting point for us in this line of business. In our business arrangements with Gap with secured complete control of the supply chain, which would Gap scale will enable us to accelerate the establishment of a modern technology driven, flexible and responsive supply chain that will be leveraged for the entire brand management portfolio. Likewise, we have started already to work on our technologies to turn them into state-of-the-art systems to manage retail across all channels. And last but not least, Gap is a formidable chance for us to rapidly strengthen the talent pool for brand management, new line of business.Our first 50 days have confirmed the diagnosis we had made before the acquisition, and the focus on product and margin, gross margin we were planning for is fully confirmed by our first observations. Eventually, execution is everything. In addition to mobilizing the best experts at Baozun to fully leverage Baozun's resources, we have partnered to identify key resources to contribute to the execution of our plans and we are building the necessary echo system to rapidly increase our consistencies in the management of Gap Greater China. As you know apparel retailing is a seasonal and cyclical business. And therefore the changes we're making will take at least several quarters to bring measurable result. Product commitments and purchases for the first half of 2023 were made before our acquisition of Gap Greater China, and we're only able to meaningfully impact products from winter '23.Having said that, we've been very active. With weighing at the helm, we've been able to quickly identify and hire excellent top level experts, including local designer, supply chain specialists, and a proven financial officer for Gap. These are the experts along with HR and production specialists that will propel forward our focus on China for China products and communication and optimize Gap Greater China supply chain to be closer to market needs, improving cost expand gross profit and ultimately achieve net profit. We also quickly a limited higher priced product capital in collaboration with one of China's rising stars in peak session. In this release, we started at a significantly higher price point, which is four times Gap typical price point.And yet, we were able to sell half of the inventory in a couple of weeks at zero discount. On the first day of release, the highest priced item had sold out within one hour. And our team movements ranking climbed from rank lower than 30 to number 8. This test offered an excellent opportunity to practice our integrated marketing. And we're glad to have won the attention of a younger audience. This is something that we were able to ideate and execute at blazing speeds and that proves the validity of our strategy and plans. We have also been able to fully leverage China post zero COVID recovery and to enjoy 22% growth in retail traffic over 500 basis points retail gross margin improvement in the last 10 weeks. While we're still very early in the Gap transformation, we believe our ability to quickly establish a strong local team and successfully test new launches validate that our analysis for the Gap acquisition was right.We are confident that Gap is now on the right track. Things are closing of the Gap Shanghai acquisition many other brands have come to us to discuss about China-for-China strategy and our technology driven approach. These are the brands genuinely wish to explore possible cooperation with BBM which further strengthens our confidence that BBM will meaningfully expand our total addressable market.
