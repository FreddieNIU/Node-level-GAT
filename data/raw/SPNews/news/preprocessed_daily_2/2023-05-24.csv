4,b786f4fd-ce0d-3c39-9f32-14621fde0aab,TXN,2023-05-24,Texas Instruments' (NASDAQ:TXN) 12% CAGR outpaced the company's earnings growth over the same five-year period,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/texas-instruments-nasdaq-txn-12-110028566.html,1684926028,STORY,['TXN'],"[Passive investing in index funds can generate returns that roughly match the overall market. But the truth is, you can make significant gains if you buy good quality businesses at the right price. For example, the Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) share price is up 53% in the last five years, slightly above the market return. Over the last year the stock price is up, albeit only a modest 1.1%.After a strong gain in the past week, it's worth seeing if longer term returns have been driven by improving fundamentals. Check out our latest analysis for Texas Instruments To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Over half a decade, Texas Instruments managed to grow its earnings per share at 17% a year. This EPS growth is higher than the 9% average annual increase in the share price. Therefore, it seems the market has become relatively pessimistic about the company.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthIt might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Texas Instruments' earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for Texas Instruments the TSR over the last 5 years was 75%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveTexas Instruments shareholders gained a total return of 4.1% during the year. But that return falls short of the market. On the bright side, the longer term returns (running at about 12% a year, over half a decade) look better. It may well be that this is a business worth popping on the watching, given the continuing positive reception, over time, from the market. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. To that end, you should learn about the   2 warning signs  we've spotted with Texas Instruments (including 1 which doesn't sit too well with us) .Of course Texas Instruments may not be the best stock to buy.

Our POs for SWN, CHK, RRC and EQT imply on average 3x the upside of their generic U.S. oil-weighted E&amp;P peers.”BofA’s analysts said over the past six months, their studies have highlighted the ‘case for gas,’ or an argument that the dynamics of U.S. natural gas markets and liquefied natural gas, or LNG, have changed.“Versus our prior long-held view of the U.S. as a stranded gas market, we suggest the combination of capital discipline, full U.S. LNG utilization on an improved international arbitrage post-Ukraine and line of sight for rapid LNG expansion that suggests U.S. gas markets have evolved towards gas-on-gas competition with storage for the first time,” the analysts said.“This starts with understanding what was behind the volatility that characterized gas markets in 2021/22; anchored on our proprietary analysis that replicates gas prices for the past 10yrs we suggest we can help answer whether it’s reasonable to have confidence in a current forward curve that doubles by 2025.”U.S. natural gas storage rose by 99 billion cubic feet, or bcf, during the week ended May 12, the Energy Information Administration, or EIA, said last week, announcing a smaller-than-expected build that bolstered sentiment in a market that needs to see less stockpile increases and more demand.Story continuesNotwithstanding the smaller-than-expected build for last week, the latest inventory rise put total gas in underground caverns in the United States at 2.24 trillion cubic feet, or tcf. That was 30.3% higher from the year-ago level of 1.719 tcf and 17.9% above the five-year average of 1.9 tcf.BofA’s analysts, however, differed in opinion, citing higher LNG feedgas demand from the full-scale return of the idled Freeport facility in Texas and cutbacks in gas output by domestic drillers.“With Freeport LNG back&amp;drilling activity responding to weak spot prices we suggest absent LNG outages, U.S. gas markets are the tightest in a generation,” the analysts said.Related ArticlesOil gains 2% after Saudi warns short-sellers: 'watch out'Silver seen at $30/oz over next 6-12 months - Citi]"

(NYSE: ARE), the first, preeminent, longest-tenured and pioneering owner, operator and developer of collaborative life science, agtech and advanced technology campuses in AAA innovation cluster locations, today announced the completion of the sale of 11119 North Torrey Pines Road in its San Diego cluster to DivcoWest, a DivCore Capital company. The fully leased 72,506 RSF single-tenant property sold for $86 million at an impressive capitalization rate of 4.6% (based upon cash net operating income for 1Q23 annualized), resulting in significant realized value for Alexandria. Alexandria purchased the property in 2007 as a fully occupied stand-alone building in its Torrey Pines submarket and successfully redeveloped it into a Class A laboratory facility. The sale is the latest example of the company's exceptional execution of its strategic value harvesting and asset recycling program, through which Alexandria capitalizes on the strong private market valuations by sourcing significant equity-type capital for reinvestment into its value-creation development and redevelopment projects. As of March 31, 2023, Alexandria's highly leased pipeline of 6.7 million RSF of current and near-term projects is expected to generate more than $610 million of annual incremental net operating income, primarily commencing from 2Q23 through 1Q26.(PRNewsfoto/Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.)""11119 North Torrey Pines served us well for more than 15 years, but this stand-alone asset no longer fits with our focus on aggregating our highly sought-after mega campuses. The strategic disposition of this stabilized asset is a testament to our irreplaceable and dominant platform, which, coupled with the scarcity of high-quality life science real estate assets, continues to create strong demand for investment opportunities arising from our value harvesting and capital recycling strategies,"" said Peter M. Moglia, chief executive officer and co-chief investment officer at Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. ""This sale also underscores our ability to monetize our investments at significant profit margins, even in challenging times, and enables the funding of the next generation of Class A life science campus assets. It was a great outcome for us, and we are pleased to continue building a long-term relationship with DivcoWest.""Story continuesBuilding off its strong execution of strategic dispositions and sales of partial interests, Alexandria is making excellent progress on its 2023 plan. The company is targeting $1.5 billion (midpoint of guidance) in dispositions and sales of partial interests this year, with approximately $865 million in transactions that have been completed or are subject to signed letters of intent or purchase and sales agreements as of April 24, 2023. These proceeds will serve as an important source of capital that eliminates Alexandria's need to issue common equity in 2023.About Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.

But striking the right chord each time is not easy unless blessed with Midas touch. When it comes to the investment market, experts consider value style as one of the most effective approaches. Value investing is essentially about selecting stocks that have good things going on for them, even at a time when they have been beaten down by some external factors.There are different valuation metrics to determine a stock’s inherent strength but a random selection of ratios cannot serve your purpose if you want a realistic assessment of a company’s financial position. For this, we recommend Price to Cash Flow (or P/CF) as one of the key metrics. This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per-share basis — the lower the number, the better. Unum Group UNM, General Motors Company GM, American International Group, Inc. AIG and Park Hotels &amp; Resorts PK boast a low P/CF ratio.Price to Cash Flow Reveals Financial HealthQuestions may arise as to why we are considering the Price to Cash Flow valuation metric, when the most widely used metric is Price/Earnings (or P/E). Well, what makes P/CF stand out is that operating cash flow adds back non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income, truly reflecting the financial health of a company.Analysts caution that a company’s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. However, cash flow is reliable. It is net cash flow that reveals how much money a company is actually generating and how effectively management is putting the same to use.A positive cash flow indicates an increase in the company’s liquid assets. This gives the company the means to settle debt, shell out for its expenses, reinvest in its business, endure downturns and finally pay back its shareholders. Then again, a negative cash flow implies a decline in the company’s liquidity, which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves.Story continuesWhat’s the Best Strategy?An investment decision solely based on the P/CF metric may not fetch the desired results. To identify stocks that are trading at a discount, you should expand your search criteria and also consider the price-to-book ratio, price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-sales ratio. Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a Value Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to even better results as these eliminate the chance of falling into a value trap.Here are the parameters for selecting true value stocks:P/CF less than or equal to X-Industry Median.Price greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.P/E using (F1) less than or equal to X-Industry Median: This parameter shortlists stocks that are trading at a discount or are equal to their peers.P/B less than or equal to X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.P/S less than or equal to X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how a stock price compares to the company’s sales — the lower the ratio the more attractive the stock is.PEG less than 1: The ratio is used to determine a stock's value by taking the company's earnings growth into account. The PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and that investors need to pay less for a stock that has robust earnings growth prospects.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best upside potential.Here are four of the nine stocks that qualified the screening:Unum Group, which provides financial protection benefit solutions, sports a Zacks Rank #1 and has an expected EPS growth rate of 9.1% for three-five years.

One-month return of U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) was -1.21%, and its shares lost 39.17% of their value over the last 52 weeks. U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) has a market capitalization of $47.735 billion.Artisan Value Fund made the following comment about U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:""We are taking advantage of the current weakness in bank stocks. In Q1, we purchased PNC Financial Services and U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB). These are banks we have known for years. They are well-managed and have solid capital positions and liquidity. At the end of Q1, we had an ~7% weighting in banks consisting of PNC, US Bancorp and Bank of America. All 3 are among the 10 largest US banks. We believe the range of probabilities and long-term outcomes are tilted in our favor at current prices but are proceeding with caution for several reasons. First, while we believe deposit-runs have likely burned themselves out, there is a non-zero risk these runs spread wider than our base case. Second, we expect more regulation in coming years which will increase the cost of doing business, potentially in exchange for higher FDIC limits. Third, at the very least we expect banks to cease buybacks for the rest of the year to build up liquidity and capital ratios. There is an increasingly more likely outcome that banks issue equity capital and preferred stock once markets stabilize. Fourth, with the banking system in shock, it will likely retrench, which will constrict capital to the US economy. Coupled with the “long and variable lags” of Fed policy, this will slow US economic growth beyond what private credit markets can make up.""Story continuesfinance, investmenteverything possible/Shutterstock.comU.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) is not on our list of 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds.

The leaders discussed some of the barriers that have prevented Black Americans from building intergenerational wealth and the progress that has been made in recent decades to help decrease the racial wealth gap.The leaders began by discussing the U.S. Bank Building Black Wealth Insights Study, which revealed that 79% of Black Americans felt there were institutional roadblocks keeping them from accumulating wealth and that 69% of Black Americans felt a deep sense of responsibility to help their communities financially and are committed to leaving a financial legacy for the next generation. The study is part of Access Commitment, a series of initiatives across U.S. Bank to increase wealth-building opportunities, starting with the Black community.""The study revealed an eight-to-one wealth disparity between white households and Black households in terms of overall wealth,"" Cunningham said. ""Forty-five percent of Black households own their own home vs. 74% of white households. We all know how important homeownership is. It's the No. 1 way that wealth gets transferred in this country. These are big and important problems.""Ford agreed. ""In most cases, a home is the most valuable asset families have,"" he said. ""Lack of access to homeownership is one of the things that precipitated the wealth gap to begin with. But homeownership rates among Black Americans are about the same now as when redlining and housing discrimination were legal.""Story continuesThe leaders also discussed Black American small business owners and their historic lack of access to capital.""The vast majority of all job creation is in companies with less than 100 employees,"" Ford said. ""The median net worth for Black business owners is 12 times higher than for the rest of the general Black population. Small businesses are key contributors to the stability of our communities and the ability to create intergenerational wealth.""To help address the needs of small businesses, U.S. Bank recently introduced a Business Diversity Lending program.""Too many diverse and underinvested businesses have been starved of capital,"" Kaalund said. ""Our diversity lending program can provide access, consulting, advisory services, capital and lending to help these businesses scale. Because when they are scaling, they are hiring people. Job and business growth strengthens communities and contributes to wealth creation and a stronger economy.""Despite the challenges facing Black Americans, many are optimistic about the future and their finances. Both Ford and Kaalund offered advice to help them build wealth.""Start where you are,"" Ford said. ""Be more deliberate about saving and paying yourself first - that will help you pass more wealth on to the next generation. It's incumbent upon all of us to take it to the next level. My hope is, in the next 25 years we will absolutely see a significant increase as people educate themselves and become more aware of the tools and ways they can pass on wealth to their families and children.""Kaalund said he is optimistic about the progress that has been made.""Our starting point is different than previous generations,"" he said. ""If you're able to save sooner, invest sooner, purchase a home sooner or inherit a home, over time this will create opportunity and shorten the duration upon which people can build and grow wealth.""The event - like the study - supports U.S. Bank Access Commitment™, the bank's long-term framework to help build wealth while redefining how it serves diverse communities, starting with the Black community. Among its progress in 2022, the bank deployed $321 million in capital to Black-owned or -led businesses and organizations through U.S. Bancorp Impact Finance and spent $487 million with diverse suppliers in 2022, including $276 million spent with Black suppliers. U.S. Bank continues to partner with the Urban Institute to identify social impact measures and is committed to continuing this work to help close the wealth gap.Learn more about how the bank is working to close the racial wealth gap through its Access CommitmentView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from U.S. Bank on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: U.S. BankWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/us-bankEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: U.S. BankView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/756637/US-Bank-Leaders-Discuss-How-Black-Families-Can-Build-Intergenerational-Wealth]"

With 77% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Institutional investors would appreciate the 4.2% increase in share prices last week, given their one-year returns have been disappointing at 36%.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of U.S. Bancorp, beginning with the chart below. Check out our latest analysis for U.S. Bancorp ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About U.S. Bancorp?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.We can see that U.S. Bancorp does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see U.S. Bancorp's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in U.S. Bancorp. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 8.3%. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 6.8% of common stock, and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. holds about 3.8% of the company stock.Story continuesA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of U.S. BancorpThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of U.S. Bancorp. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$95m worth of shares. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipWith a 22% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over U.S. Bancorp. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.

Grainger Inc. GWW, Graphic Packaging Holding Co. GPK, PulteGroup Inc. PHM, Walmart Inc. WMT and Novartis NVS.Invest in These Dividend Growth Stocks Amid Default FearsWorries over debt default have been making investors jittery, raising the appeal for dividend investing. This is especially true as dividend stocks are major sources of consistent income for investors to create wealth when returns from the equity market are at risk, even though these do not offer dramatic price appreciation.In fact, stocks with a strong history of year-over-year dividend growth form a healthy portfolio with a greater scope of capital appreciation as opposed to simple dividend-paying stocks or those that have high yields.We have selected five dividend growth stocks — W.W. Grainger Inc., Graphic Packaging Holding Co., PulteGroup Inc., Walmart Inc. and Novartis — that could be solid choices for your portfolio.Why Dividend Growth Strategy?Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market, and thus act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility. At the same time, these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.Additionally, these stocks have superior fundamentals that make dividend growth a quality and promising investment for the long term. These include a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics. Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that a dividend increase is likely in the future.Although these stocks do not necessarily have the highest yields, they have outperformed for a longer period than the broader stock market or any other dividend-paying stock.Story continuesHere are five of the 11 stocks that fit the bill:Illinois-based W.W. Grainger is a broad-line, business-to-business distributor of maintenance, repair and operating products and services. The company has an estimated growth rate of 19.8% and delivered an average earnings surprise of 9.15% for the past four quarters.GWW has a Zacks Rank #1 and a Growth Score of A.

25,5d08946e-7d9e-38e0-be52-d7182379e32c,WMT,2023-05-24,"Walmart to pay California $500,000 in settlement over sale of brass knuckles",AP Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walmart-pay-california-500-000-224612870.html,1684881972,STORY,['WMT'],"[SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — Walmart will pay half a million dollars to settle allegations from California's Department of Justice that it was selling brass knuckles on its website, state Attorney General Rob Bonta said Tuesday.Brass knuckles are classified as deadly and illegal weapons in a number of states, including California, which punishes their sale with up to a year in prison.The investigation into the retail giant first started in 2018, when the Merced County district attorney found Walmart was selling and allowing third-party vendors to sell brass knuckles on its website, officials said at a news conference. The Department of Justice conducted the yearslong investigation and negotiation in partnership with the district attorney’s offices of Merced, Ventura, and Yolo Counties.Brass knuckles, typically made of metal or hard plastic, could be used to break bones, cut people or cause even fatal injuries, Bonta said, calling the settlement “a tremendous win” for consumers in California.“We’re making it clear that we won’t sit idly by while a company, no matter how large ... allows Californians to be armed with illegal weapons,"" Bonta said. “This is a critical push back on an e-commerce giant that stands to have an important impact on the industry.”Walmart said in a statement that it didn't violate any California laws and admits “no liability of wrongdoing,” but settled because “we believe this agreement is in the best interest of all parties.”As part of the settlement, Walmart will pay the Department of Justice and district attorneys' offices $125,000 each in civil penalties. The nation’s largest retailer will also be required to stop selling and allowing any sales of brass knuckles on its website.Investigators found roughly 250 products that could be classified as brass knuckles on Walmart's website, 60% of which were offered directly by the retailer and 40% of which were available from third-party sellers, authorities said.Story continuesThe settlement also requires Walmart to notify customers who have purchased brass knuckles that the weapon is illegal.Authorities said they are investigating others for illegal weapons sales but didn't name the alleged offenders.“While Walmart was particularly cooperative in this case and has done their best to remove the illegal weapons from their websites, there are others who have not done so, and they need to know we’re coming for them,” Ventura County Deputy District Attorney Karen Wold said Tuesday.Walmart is a major seller of weapons in the United States, but has taken steps to curb the sale of firearms and ammunition since 2015.The giant retailer stopped selling ammunition for semi-automatic rifles and handguns after 23 people were killed at one of its stores in El Paso, Texas, in 2019. The company stopped selling semi-automatic weapons such as the AR-15 style rifle in 2015 and raised the minimum age to buy firearms from 18 to 21 in 2018.]"

Eligible participants receive their funds on an electronic benefits transfer (EBT) card.Food Stamps: Do People on SNAP Need To Work Full Time?Learn: How To Build Your Savings From ScratchWalmart is one of many retailers that accepts EBT payments (in 48 states you can pay at checkout, in Alaska and Montana, you can pay at pickup) and a convenient and affordable place for many people to shop with their SNAP benefits. If you’ve just started up with SNAP and are wondering, “What can I buy with EBT at Walmart?” we’re here to answer that question for you with this list of USDA-approved eligible foods.First, though, a note about payment: You will need an online Walmart account to use EBT for pick-up or delivery. You also have the option to use multiple forms of payment, such as an EBT card and a debit card, in one shopping trip. While you can receive a delivery of goods that you paid for with your SNAP EBT card, you will have to pay delivery fees separately. Now, onto the items you can buy with EBT at Walmart.Fruits and VegetablesSNAP emphasizes nutritious food, and what could be more nutritious than fruits and vegetables? From fresh berries and melons to leafy greens and beans, Walmart’s produce section welcomes you. Consider buying bags of legumes, beans and rice for making bulk meals, and be sure to buy your veggies whole, rather than individually wrapped or cut, where you’re likely losing money.Meats, Poultry and FishThese warm summer months are a great time for grilling your meats, poultry or fish, and Walmart has a wide selection. From bulk bags of frozen chicken breasts, whole turkeys, ground beef and a wide variety of fish, you can buy the right protein for your family.Dairy ProductsDairy products are staples in all kinds of delicious recipes: a creamy breakfast yogurt; a bagel and cream cheese brunch; a tasty vanilla shake; a sumptuous grilled cheese sandwich or bubbling lasagna. However you like to work your dairy into your meal planning, you’ll be glad to know you can purchase all manner of products at Walmart with your EBT card.Story continuesTake Our Poll: Are You Concerned About the Safety of Your Money in Your Bank Accounts?Breads and CerealsWhat is life without carbs? Bread comes in as many varieties as there are tastes to enjoy them, from whole wheat to gluten-free, from multi-grain to brioche, most of us have a hankering for this most essential of carbohydrates. And what’s breakfast for schoolkids without a quick and easy bowl of cereal? All of these can be purchased at Walmart with EBT.Snack FoodsIn between meals, many of us need a little bite during the day to keep us going, be it at work, school or out on a good hike. From cookies to chips, trail mix to crackers, snacks are the foods that keep us going when we can’t have a full meal. Walmart is a leader on snacks that you can purchase with EBT. Try to aim for buying full bags or boxes, rather than individually packaged snacks, however, to stretch your funds.Non-Alcoholic BeveragesPick your non-alcoholic poison. What quenches your thirst best? A gently sweetened iced tea, a sparkling water, lemonade, soda or juice? Maybe you like an energy drink for extra pep, or a sparkling apple juice to celebrate an occasion without alcohol? From Gatorade to kombucha, Mountain Dew to Capri Sun, Walmart has you covered with your EBT purchase of tasty beverages.Seeds and PlantsIf you have a green thumb or are ready to take up gardening for the first time, you may be heartened to know that you can buy food-producing seeds and plants in Walmart’s garden section with your EBT benefits, according to FoodStampFacts.com. Growing food such as tomatoes, potatoes, onions, beans and other veggies and fruit can save you a ton on these costs. The only thing you can’t buy with your EBT are things like fertilizer, soil and other gardening adjacent tools.What You Can’t Buy With SNAP at WalmartAccording to the USDA, there are a few items you cannot use your SNAP benefits to buy anywhere, much less at Walmart:Alcoholic beverages and tobacco products of any kind.Vitamins, medicines, and supplements. The way to determine if an item qualifies as one of these is to look for a “supplement facts label.” This indicates it is a supplement and can’t be purchased with SNAP benefits.Live animals in general, however, exceptions are made for shellfish, fish that are removed from water for eating, and animals slaughtered before store pick-up.Hot foods.Nonfood items such as: pet foods, household supplies, hygiene items and cosmetics, to name a few.More From GOBankingRates5 Expensive Renovations Homeowners Always RegretFinancial Insight in Your Inbox: Sign Up for GBR's Daily Newsletter3 Ways to Recession Proof Your Retirement7 Things You Must Do To Create a Plan for Your MoneyThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: SNAP Benefits at Walmart: What Can I Buy?]"
27,bc61593c-33aa-3d6b-b191-00f5fb25acb0,WMT,2023-05-24,Dick's Sporting Goods stock jumps on earnings beat,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/dicks-sporting-goods-stock-jumps-152956623.html,1684855796,VIDEO,"['TGT', 'FL', 'WMT', 'DKS']","[Yahoo Finance Live anchor Diane King Hall discusses the rise of Dick's Sporting Goods stock on Q1 earnings, the company's growth outlook, and consumer spending trends.Video TranscriptRACHELLE AKUFFO: Well, we're on retail detail again this morning, as the last of the retailers report their results this week. Dick's Sporting Goods is out today posting strong results. Unlike what we saw last week with Foot Locker. ""Yahoo Finance's"" Diane King Hall is here to weigh in. Hi, Diane.DIANE KING HALL: Hey, Rachelle. Well, let's start with a check on shares of Dick's. They are a little bit higher in response to posting better than expected numbers on its top and bottom line. But they've trimmed the gains that we saw earlier in the session. So up just about a little over a half of a percent now.The sports retailer says, earnings totaled $305 million in the first quarter or $3.40 a share. That's up from the same time a year ago. Sales top $2.8 billion. CEO Lauren Hobart said, quote, ""Even as consumers face macroeconomic uncertainties, our athletes have continued to prioritize sport and rely on Dick's to meet their needs.""I just listened to the earnings call. And these are some of the items that stood out to me. They talked about-- they did acknowledge the macroeconomic realities. They said, it does remain uncertain. But they believe they'll continue to deliver on sales and growth. They got a lot of compliments from analysts on their numbers. Because if you compare and contrast them to Foot Locker, you mentioned Foot Locker earlier, they did much better.Dick's results stand in stark contrast to Foot Locker, which you may recall posted an 11% drop in sales. The question is, did Foot Locker lean too heavily on Nike and its lineup? Back in 2022, it bought 65% of its inventory from Nike. And it reiterated its partnership with the brand in March. Foot Locker also said it may have to discount more to incentivize shoppers. And so I want to pull out a couple more items from the Dick's earnings call, Rachelle, where they were asked about their relationship with Nike.Story continuesLauren says, she doesn't feel they have an over inventory of Nike. Again, Dick's share price was doing better going into the earnings call. But there wasn't really anything that stuck out. It seems to be more of a general downtrend in the market that is affecting Dick's and just worries about the retail sector, in general. They were asked if the consumer is weakened. They said, basically, their consumer has not. Their consumer, they said, from low income to high income shoppers has remained strong.They reiterated their presence with athletes purchasing from them. So they had strong numbers. Their comps were up 3.4% same store sales. So Dick's definitely stands in stark contrast to Foot Locker, though, it's not having a big run up in terms of its share price currently.Earlier in the session, it did. We'll see how things shake out throughout the day, Rachelle.RACHELLE AKUFFO: It's true. You just have to wait and see how investors digest all of this. And so to that point, Dick's didn't disappoint. But let's broaden it out to where some of the other trends that we're seeing have emerged this earnings season when it comes to the retail sector.DIANE KING HALL: Yeah. You had some varying trends. You had a tale of two retailers, basically. Now, shoppers did spend less at some retailers. And there was a focus on necessities and not discretionary. Walmart was certainly the beneficiary of the focus on necessities. And that was really due to grocery.Now, Target did beat when it reported its results. But it acknowledged and talked about the struggle with the impact of organized crime on its results. So really, what we've seen in terms of the retailers is those retailers that focus on necessities are doing well. And there were retailers that acknowledged there have been some trade down. Now, Dick's today said, they didn't notice much trade down in terms of people trading away from certain brand names for other brand names.So they said, their differentiation of their inventory stood out. So that's something that definitely benefited them. But, again, other retailers pointed out that their struggle was with consumers trading down, Rachelle.RACHELLE AKUFFO: Indeed. Still seeing that divergence. As you mentioned, the tale of two retailers. Great stuff. Thank you so much, Diane.]"
28,a73f80ad-24ba-3945-b08e-aa7ba98d4e54,WMT,2023-05-24,Brokers Suggest Investing in Walmart (WMT): Read This Before Placing a Bet,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/brokers-suggest-investing-walmart-wmt-133007539.html,1684848607,STORY,['WMT'],"[Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Walmart (WMT) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.Walmart currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.55, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 28 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.55 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 28 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 18 are Strong Buy and four are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 64.3% and 14.3% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for WMTBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for WMTCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Walmart here&gt;&gt;&gt;The ABR suggests buying Walmart, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.ABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.Is WMT Worth Investing In?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Walmart, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 2.5% over the past month to $6.20.Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Walmart. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Walmart may serve as a useful guide for investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE:XYL) stock is about to trade ex-dividend in two days. The ex-dividend date occurs one day before the record date which is the day on which shareholders need to be on the company's books in order to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important because any transaction on a stock needs to have been settled before the record date in order to be eligible for a dividend. Thus, you can purchase Xylem's shares before the 26th of May in order to receive the dividend, which the company will pay on the 28th of June.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.33 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$1.32 to shareholders. Calculating the last year's worth of payments shows that Xylem has a trailing yield of 1.3% on the current share price of $104.34. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! We need to see whether the dividend is covered by earnings and if it's growing. View our latest analysis for Xylem Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. Xylem paid out 60% of its earnings to investors last year, a normal payout level for most businesses. Yet cash flows are even more important than profits for assessing a dividend, so we need to see if the company generated enough cash to pay its distribution. Thankfully its dividend payments took up just 49% of the free cash flow it generated, which is a comfortable payout ratio.It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. This is why it's a relief to see Xylem earnings per share are up 2.3% per annum over the last five years. Earnings growth has been slim and the company is paying out more than half of its earnings. While there is some room to both increase the payout ratio and reinvest in the business, generally the higher a payout ratio goes, the lower a company's prospects for future growth.Story continuesThe main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. In the past 10 years, Xylem has increased its dividend at approximately 13% a year on average. We're glad to see dividends rising alongside earnings over a number of years, which may be a sign the company intends to share the growth with shareholders.The Bottom LineHas Xylem got what it takes to maintain its dividend payments? While earnings per share growth has been modest, Xylem's dividend payouts are around an average level; without a sharp change in earnings we feel that the dividend is likely somewhat sustainable. Pleasingly the company paid out a conservatively low percentage of its free cash flow. Overall, it's hard to get excited about Xylem from a dividend perspective.With that in mind, a critical part of thorough stock research is being aware of any risks that stock currently faces. For example, we've found 1 warning sign for Xylem that we recommend you consider before investing in the business.A common investing mistake is buying the first interesting stock you see.

Also, net interest income (NII) and margins are anticipated to rise in the near term. However, the company is witnessing higher expenses. Also, a lack of diversification in the loan portfolio and declining mortgage banking income due to higher mortgage rates are concerning.While other banks witnessed a decline in deposits in the first quarter due to regional bank failures, Huntington’s deposit balances increased during the same period, indicating strength in this funding source. Moreover, the company’s lending book has also witnessed robust growth in the past few years supported by resilient commercial and consumer loan portfolios.Going forward, a rise in deposits will help HBAN be active on the lending front and strengthen its balance sheet. In fact, for 2023, management expects average loans to grow 5-7%.Given the solid loan demand and expectations of interest rates remaining high in the near term, Huntington’s NII is expected to increase and propel top-line growth. The company projects 2023 NII (excluding Paycheck Protection Program and Purchase Accounting Accretion) growth of 6-9%.Organic growth aside, Huntington has been undertaking strategic acquisitions in a bid to expand its footprint and capabilities in a number of verticals. In June 2022, it completed the acquisition of Capstone Partners, an Investment Banking firm, enhancing the complementary capabilities of the capital markets business. In May 2022, the company acquired Torana to enhance its digital capabilities and enterprise payments strategy.With credit metrics gradually improving since the last quarter of 2009, we see HBAN as a proven astute manager of its credit quality historically. In first-quarter 2023, total non-performing assets were $578 million, down from $708 million in the prior-year quarter. With decent credit quality and reserves, the company is well-positioned to manage through any economic uncertainty.However, Huntington’s rising cost base limits bottom-line growth. Non-interest expenses have been increasing over the past few years due to continued investments in key growth initiatives. The rising trend is likely to continue in the near term with management projecting the metric to increase 1-3% in 2023.As mortgage rates are expected to remain high in the near future, origination volumes and refinancing activities are less likely to witness growth. This is expected to reduce Huntington’s mortgage banking income and fee income in the near term.As of Mar 31, 2023, HBAN’s long-term debt of $13.07 billion, exceeded its liquidity (consisting of cash and due from banks, as well as interest-bearing deposits) of $10.57 billion. A comparatively low cash balance makes the company’s debt level seem unmanageable. Also, such limited liquidity, coupled with volatile earnings, indicates that its capital deployment activities might not be sustainable in the long term.The majority of Huntington’s loan portfolio (57% as of Mar 31, 2023) comprises total commercial loans, depicting a lack of diversification. This can be risky for the company amid any unfavorable developments in the economy and competitive markets.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have lost 30.6% compared with a 32.9% decline recorded by the industry over the past six months.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchYou can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Bank Stocks Worth ConsideringA couple of better-ranked stocks from the banking space are Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Inc.

As we continue to grow the portfolio, Jamey Cua joins Pete Metzger and the rest of our development team as we build on this momentum throughout the year and beyond.""The Emphasis On Franchise Business Bodes WellChoice Hotels gains from economies of scale associated with the franchise business. Accordingly, higher fees from franchisees and transference of cost burden to franchises provide the company with operational advantages.

PENN is likely to benefit from Barstool Sports expansion, 3C’s initiatives and iCasino business. Also, the emphasis on new loyalty program bodes well. However, a rise in labor and non-gaming costs is a concern.Let us discuss the factors that highlight why investors should retain the stock for the time being.Growth CatalystsPENN Entertainment focuses on Barstool Sports expansion to drive growth. During the first quarter of 2023, the company reported solid revenue and engagement results, courtesy of a compelling content and an exceptional product experience. During the quarter, the company stated progress with respect to the integration of the Barstool Sportsbook (in the United States) to theScore player account management and trading platform. During the quarter, the initiative paved a path for improved metrics, including a rise in six-month retention rates. On the media front, the company’s cross-platform views were up 40% year over year.The company is optimistic about the inclusion of the remaining Barstool Sports to the Penn Entertainment family. PENN is of the opinion that the combination of Barstool’s audience with theScore’s fully-integrated media and betting platform will pave the path for new customer acquisition and organic cross-selling opportunities. The company anticipates completing the migration in July 2023.PENN Entertainment continues to progress toward the new generation of cordless, cashless and contactless technology, collectively known as 3C’s, to drive growth. The technological solution removes friction from transactions and reduces wait times and bolsters its marketing capabilities. During the first-quarter 2023 conference call, the company announced that 3Cs technology is active in 21 properties. Owing to the continuous roll-out, the company witnessed a rise in mywallet customers (195,000) and deposits (worth $104 million), marking growth on a sequential basis.The company emphasizes on new game additions, creative marketing and leveraging the casino database to boost the Barstool-branded iCasino business. During the first quarter of 2023, the company reported strong performance in Ontario, with iCasino GGR experiencing significant year-over-year growth. The upside was backed by the proprietary technology stack.Story continuesIncreased focus on loyalty program bodes well. During the first quarter of 2023, the company announced the launch of an enhanced and rebranded customer loyalty program, PENN Play. The program connects the Company’s brands under one loyalty program and allows members a wide range of incentives including priority access, discounts, gifts, trips to PENN destinations, partner experiences and PENN Cash. Given the rising adoption of digital wallet and its supporting role in increasing visitation and time on device, the company anticipates the program to drive growth in the upcoming periods.ConcernsZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSo far this year, shares of PENN Entertainment have declined 14.9% against the industry’s 24% growth. The company’s performance was impacted by a rise in labor and non-gaming costs. During the first quarter of 2023, the company’s gaming expenses came in at $729.5 million compared with $686.6 million reported in the prior-year quarter. The upside was primarily driven by a rise in third-party service provider fees, higher payroll expenses and an increase in gaming taxes. Food, beverage, hotel and other expenses during the quarter came in at $244.3 million compared with $171.9 million reported in the prior-year quarter. The company is cautious about the ongoing uncertain macroeconomic environment. For 2023, our model predicts gaming expenses and Food, beverage, hotel and other expenses to rise 2.2% and 16.1%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis.Zacks Rank &amp; Key PicksPENN Entertainment currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector are MGM Resorts International MGM, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.

Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.Overall trade between China and Russia rose by nearly 30 per cent in 2022 to US$190 billion, according to Chinese customs data, but the room for significant growth in energy trade could be limited going forward, according to analysts.""It is likely that Russia's energy exports to China have now reached a plateau after booming last year. Beijing is careful not to become overly dependent on a single energy supplier,"" said Agathe Demarais, global forecasting director at the Economist Intelligence Unit and author of Backfire, a book on US sanctions.""The picture is the same for gas: China is reluctant to build a new pipeline, Power of Siberia 2 - which would boost gas supplies from Russia, also for fear of becoming overly dependent on Russian hydrocarbons.""Energy, especially crude oil, has accounted for a significant proportion for bilateral trade, and natural resources consultancy firm Wood Mackenzie forecasts that China is likely to import around 2.3 million barrels a day of crude oil from Russia, up from 1.75 million barrels in 2022, from its total of 10.6 million barrels a day in 2023.Story continues""For natural gas, we do see a significant increase of pipeline gas imports by China from Russia in 2023 through Power of Siberia. China's [liquefied natural gas] imports from Russia will also be notably higher in 2023 versus 2022,"" said Kang Wu, head of macro, demand &amp; Asia analytics at S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights.Wu predicts China's crude oil imports from Russia will be well above 2 million barrels per day, up from 1.7 million in 2022, from its overall total of 11.1 million barrels per day in 2023.Beijing has yet to make a commitment to the Power of Siberia 2 project, which plans to deliver 50 billion cubic metres (1.77 trillion cubic feet) of natural gas per year from Russia's Yamal Peninsula in western Siberia to China via Mongolia.In March, Xi and Russian President Vladimir Putin pledged to ""significantly increase"" trade by 2030.Xi and Putin also promised ""smooth settlement"" between economic entities, as well as ""supporting the expansion of the use of local currency in bilateral trade, investment, credit and other economic and trade activities"".China's yuan is now a reserve currency for Russia, which has been under sweeping sanctions from the US and its allies since its invasion of Ukraine last year.Russia's central bank has been blocked from accessing its foreign reserves, and several Russian banks have been banned from the Swift international payments network.Herman Gref, chief executive of Russia's largest lender, Sberbank, told a Russia-China forum in Shanghai on Tuesday that the yuan is the ""undisputed leader"" for its clients.""In 2023, we expect a tenfold increase in the number of transactions in the yuan compared to last year [at Sherbank],"" said Gref, who has also since been added to the list of individuals sanctioned by the US Treasury.""Over the year, the share of the yuan increased from 2 per cent to 18 per cent in Russia's export operations, and from 5 per cent to 27 per cent in its imports, which is an impressive trend.""But Liu Huaqin, a researcher with China's Ministry of Commerce, said one of the key hurdles in China's trade with Russia has been the lack of diversification beyond energy.Energy accounted for 74.5 per cent of Russia's total exports to China in 2022, up from 68 per cent in 2021, according to Liu.""Over the years, the two sides have been promoting the diversification of the trade in commodity, striving to increase the trade share of high value-added commodities and expand trade in agricultural products etc, but the reality is farther away from this goal,"" Liu said in a journal published by Heilongjiang University last month.Russia's trade barriers and restrictions on certain farm goods have been on the rise since last year following its invasion of Ukraine, making products such as sunflower oil and soybean more costly for importers.""The Russian soybean export tariff is 20 per cent. This policy directly affects the implementation of the soybean supply plan between China and Russia,"" added Liu.""Changing tariff policies are making the trade environment between the two sides more complicated, which is not conducive to the stable development of trade between the two countries.""China's trade deficit with Russia reached a record US$38 billion last year, according to Liu.""From the perspective of trade balance, the quality of trade from China's side has declined, which is not conducive to the sustainable development of bilateral trade,"" Liu added.In September 2019, China and Russia agreed to increase trade to US$200 billion by 2024 from US$107 billion in 2018.Russia Minister of Economic Development, Maxim Reshetnikov, told Chinese state media CGTN in March that the two countries are ""ahead of schedule"" in meeting the target in 2023.China's exports to Russia soared by 153.1 per cent in April, year on year, to US$9.62 billion, and by 6 per cent month on month, according to Chinese customs dataBut China's imports from Russia grew by just 8 per cent in April, year on year, to US$9.61 billion, while dropping by 12 per cent from a month earlier.This article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

""No one was really expecting that.""Market pricing had favoured a half-point hike, and traders were also primed for an extension of the tightening streak.Japan's Nikkei sank 0.5%, extending its retreat from a post-bubble-era peak to a second day.Hong Kong's Hang Seng declined 1%, and mainland blue chips slid 0.6%.MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares fell 0.4%.U.S. equity futures, though, pointed to gains of 0.15% at the reopen for the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq, after sharp declines overnight.Representatives of President Joe Biden and congressional Republicans ended another round of debt ceiling talks on Tuesday with no signs of progress.Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has warned that the federal government could no longer have enough money to pay all its bills as soon as June 1, raising the risk of a damaging default.While the risk of a default that could precipitate a recession is bad for the United States, investors worried about the repercussions for the global economy have turned away from riskier assets.Story continuesReports that Treasury has asked federal agencies whether they can delay upcoming payments added to the sense of crisis.""Payment prioritisation is now real,"" Chris Weston, head of research at brokerage Pepperstone in Melbourne, wrote in a client note.""And while it seems highly prudent to have this conversation, the market's anxiety levels have heated up consequently,"" he said. ""The market is starting to de-risk.""The U.S. dollar index, which measures the currency against six major peers, eased 0.1% to 103.43, but remained close to a two-month high of 103.63 reached last week.Long-term Treasury yields ticked down to 3.68% in Tokyo, extending a retreat from a more than two-month high of 3.696% reached in New York.In commodities, gold edged 0.1% higher to around $1,977 as traders eyed debt ceiling talks.Crude oil price extended gains from Tuesday, when Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman warned speculators to ""watch out,"" saying ""they will be ouching.""Brent crude futures rose 68 cents to $77.52 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude (WTI) gained 75 cents to $73.66 a barrel.(Reporting by Kevin Buckland; Additional reporting by Tom Westbrook; Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore)]"

This could have denied taxpayers, pension savers and financial institutions the benefits of full competition for these products, including the minimisation of borrowing costs,"" said Michael Grenfell, Executive Director of Enforcement at the CMA.The CMA said it was yet to decide if there was sufficient evidence of an infringement of competition law for it to take enforcement action against any of the banks. Until then, no assumption should be made that any of them had broken the law, it said.Having alerted the CMA to its involvement via its leniency policy, Deutsche Bank will not be fined if the provisional findings are upheld. Citi also struck a settlement with the CMA and will also likely receive a discount if a fine is imposed.Story continuesA Deutsche Bank spokesperson said it had secured ""provisional immunity"" after proactively reporting the activities, which took place before 2014. Citi said it had co-operated fully with the CMA on the matter and was ""pleased to put it behind us.""A spokesperson for Morgan Stanley said it disagreed with the CMA's provisional findings and intended to contest them.""Morgan Stanley cooperated fully with the watchdog during the investigation and will continue to engage in the process,"" the spokesperson said.HSBC denies the allegations and will continue to make its case while awaiting the CMA's final decision, the bank told Reuters in an emailed statement.RBC told Reuters it disagreed with the CMA's findings, but had cooperated fully with the investigation and took any allegation of employee misconduct very seriously.In the wake of the financial crisis, the Bank of England shored up the UK economy and markets by buying UK government debt, also known as gilts, via regular buy-back auctions.Those auctions prompted some of the alleged exchanges of information among some of the banks involved, said the CMA, which launched the probe in November 2018.Financial sector workers use Bloomberg chatrooms to communicate with customers and colleagues.

53,6797cdd3-d1fb-3e07-b260-13ee811211a3,FE,2023-05-24,Calculating The Fair Value Of FirstEnergy Corp. (NYSE:FE),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/calculating-fair-value-firstenergy-corp-192045133.html,1684869645,STORY,['FE'],"[Key InsightsThe projected fair value for FirstEnergy is US$34.99 based on Dividend Discount ModelCurrent share price of US$37.89 suggests FirstEnergy is potentially trading close to its fair value Analyst price target for FE is US$43.46, which is 24% above our fair value estimateDoes the May share price for FirstEnergy Corp. (NYSE:FE) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for FirstEnergy The ModelAs FirstEnergy operates in the electric utilities sector, we need to calculate the intrinsic value slightly differently. Instead of using free cash flows, which are hard to estimate and often not reported by analysts in this industry, dividends per share (DPS) payments are used. Unless a company pays out the majority of its FCF as a dividend, this method will typically underestimate the value of the stock. We use the Gordon Growth Model, which assumes dividend will grow into perpetuity at a rate that can be sustained. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a company's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). In this case we used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%). The expected dividend per share is then discounted to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.9%. Relative to the current share price of US$37.9, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.Story continuesValue Per Share = Expected Dividend Per Share / (Discount Rate - Perpetual Growth Rate)= US$1.7 / (6.9% – 2.1%)= US$35.0dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at FirstEnergy as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for FirstEnergyStrengthNo major strengths identified for FE.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Interest payments on debt are not well covered.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Electric Utilities market.Expensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Dividends are not covered by earnings.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. For FirstEnergy, we've compiled three additional factors you should look at:Risks: Take risks, for example - FirstEnergy has   3 warning signs  (and 2 which are potentially serious)  we think you should know about.Future Earnings: How does FE's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Salesforce.com (CRM) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.Salesforce.com currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.86, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 35 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.86 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 35 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 20 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 57.1% and 5.7% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for CRMBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for CRMCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Salesforce.com here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying Salesforce.com, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.Story continuesZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.Zacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABRAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.Is CRM a Good Investment?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Salesforce.com, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $7.11.Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Salesforce.com. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for Salesforce.com.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(VFC) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.17 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.13 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.45 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 30.77%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this maker of brands such as Vans, North Face and Timberland would post earnings of $0.99 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.12, delivering a surprise of 13.13%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.V.F. , which belongs to the Zacks Textile - Apparel industry, posted revenues of $2.74 billion for the quarter ended March 2023, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.20%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $2.82 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.V.F. Shares have lost about 29.2% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 9.2%.What's Next for V.F.While V.F. Has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for V.F. Unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future.

The current consensus EPS estimate is -$0.01 on $2.19 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $2.15 on $12.01 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well.

Here's how much to save This is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home Earlier this week, I attended an A.I.-focused event hosted by Goldman Sachs and SV Angels, Ron Conway’s early-stage investment firm. (Yes, we’re sticking with the generative A.I. theme here at CEO Daily.) The opening speaker was none other than Bill Gates, Microsoft’s co-founder and former CEO. Gates was interviewed by another CEO, Stripe’s Patrick Collison, who seemed to relish the opportunity to ask Bill Gates pretty much everything he’s ever wanted to ask Bill Gates. While the conversation veered away from A.I. quite a few times—at one point, Collison asked Gates what most inspires him “aesthetically”—there were a few interesting insights sprinkled throughout the interview.For example, Gates said health and education are the two domains outside of tech that are most likely to be “revolutionized” by A.I. over the next few years. And he said there was room for multiple companies and multiple A.I. engines to dominate the generative A.I. market, but that one player will likely conquer at least one key area.“There will be one company that creates the personal agent that understands all of your activities…” Gates said, referring to the decades-old promise of a truly all-knowing A.I. assistant. “Whoever wins the personal agent, that will be a big thing because you’ll never go to a search site again. You’ll never go to a productivity tool again. You’ll never go to Amazon again. Everything will be mediated through your agent.”So is Gates foreseeing a future in which the current tech giants are replaced by new ones? Not necessarily. When Collison asked who will create the dominant personal agent, Gates had this to say: “I’d be disappointed if Microsoft didn’t come in there, but I’m very impressed with a couple of startups in the space...”Story continuesSpeaking of startups, here’s another nugget from the conversation: After Gates brought up Steve Jobs and Larry Ellison, the former CEOs of Apple and Oracle, respectively, Collison asked if Gates thought today's CEOs are as “tough” as those of the earlier tech era—Microsoft included. (Jobs, Ellison, and Gates were notoriously hard on their employees and on their competition.) Gates’ response? In today’s world in which tech CEOs have to meet with government officials on a regular basis, “they know not to show it.”More news below.Michal Lev-Ram@mlevrammichal.levram@fortune.comThis story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

You can skip our detailed analysis of blue chip companies and dividend stocks, and go directly to read 5 Best Blue Chip Dividend Stocks To Buy. After recording one of its worst performances in 2022, the stock market has rebounded this year. The S&amp;P 500 and the tech-heavy NASDAQ both are delivering positive returns to shareholders this year, gaining 9.39% and 22.2%, respectively, as of May 23. This market rally has boosted investors’ confidence. According to a survey conducted by Bankrate in March, analysts expect the S&amp;P 500 to rise by 8% over the next four quarters. The survey also highlighted that 46% of the respondents believe that the bull market may begin in the second half of the year.Despite these positive signs, many investors still prefer to steer clear of risks and prefer safe stocks that pay dividends. Blue chip companies are generally regarded as more stable and less volatile than smaller or riskier investments. According to a report by Wall Street Journal, exchange-traded funds that specialize in quality stocks have grown to over $60 billion over the past few years. The same report also quoted Denise Chisholm, director of the quantitative market strategy at Fidelity Investments. She said that quality stocks have outperformed about 80% of the time in the past three decades during periods of economic downturn.In addition to their strong performance, many blue chip companies have a history of paying consistent dividends. Investors seeking regular income through dividends may consider these quality stocks as they often have the financial strength to maintain and increase dividend payments over time. In our article titled 25 Things Every Dividend Investor Should Know, we mentioned data that shows the strong performance of companies with strong dividend growth track records. Dividend Aristocrats, companies that have raised their payouts for over 25 years, delivered a 12.13% return to shareholders from 1990 to 2018, compared with a 9.96% return for the broader market during this period.Story continuesBest Blue Chip Dividend Stocks To BuyPhoto by Joshua Hoehne on UnsplashMedtronic plc (NYSE:MDT), NextEra Energy, Inc.

The specific terms of the agreement were not disclosed in the filing made on Monday.Earlier this month, U.S. District Judge David Campbell in Phoenix ordered the case to proceed to trial as he determined that there were factual issues that only a jury could resolve.The trial would focus on whether Walgreens knowingly partnered with Theranos, despite having reasonable suspicions that the startup's technology was ineffective.Last year, Theranos' founder and former CEO, Elizabeth Holmes, was convicted of fraud and received an 11 1/4-year sentence. Additionally, the company's former president, Ramesh ""Sunny"" Balwani, was found guilty by a jury and is currently serving a 13-year sentence.Price Action: WBA shares are down 0.60% at $31.00 during the premarket session on the last check Tuesday.Photo via FlickrDon't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!

But hidden away is another problem it needs to handle: rights abuse in plantations.Around 13 million tea estate workers suffer “endemic human rights abuses” in India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Kenya, Uganda, and 43 other countries, according to the UK-based Business &amp; Human Rights Resource Centre (BHRRC).Read moreA look back at BTS as it became the world's top-selling actYour anxiety brings 4 distinct superpowersAmericans may have seen the last of big rent hikesThe abuse allegations at the supplier level include violations of freedom of association, health and safety infringements, wage payments, and living standards.datawrapper-chart-ljDbs“As estate managers look to cut costs in an increasingly unprofitable industry, there is a growing trend towards the use of temporary contracts, third-party labour providers and other precarious employment arrangements,” the BHRRC report (pdf) published earlier this month said.“These heighten workers’ vulnerability to abuses, including sexual exploitation and health and safety violations, and make it more difficult for workers to unionize to collectively defend their rights,” it said.The report detailed responses from 16 tea majors and retailers—Starbucks, Unilever, Marks &amp; Spencer, Tetley, Morrisons, Twinings, Ahmad Tea, Bettys &amp; Taylors, Ekaterra, Goodricke, James Finlay, Jenier, Plus, Ringtons, Tesco, and Typhoo—buying from estates where 47 of the 70 alleged human rights abuse occurred. Out of 16, only UK-based Plus did not respond to the allegations, the report said.The lowest rung in the tea-supply chain is the worst-hitWhile the cost of tea production has risen over the years, prices have largely remained unchanged. Climate change and the Ukraine war are only the most recent problems that have added to the burden, the BHRRC report has stated.And it is the tea estate workers that pay the highest price. Apart from already low wages, they face other persistent problems like “unpaid overtime, recurrent indebtedness and degrading and unsafe living and working conditions—including endemic sexual harassment and abuse,” the BHRRC report said.Story continuesAll this is despite most companies having policy commitments in place to protect labour rights. This makes the full disclosure of supply chains by companies pertinent, so as to ensure corporate accountability.How Unilever and Starbucks deflect responsibilitySome of the world’s largest tea buyers have disclosed where they source their tea from, but many have not published details of their supply chains, the BHRRC report said. “...the only thing stopping companies from being transparent is their own commitment and willingness,” it said.For instance, in Bangladesh’s eight tea estates, from where Netherlands-based Ekaterra purchased tea in 2022, nearly 150,000 tea workers put forth their demand for a wage increase.Similarly, in Sri Lanka, several plantation companies reportedly refused to pay the increased wages to tea estate workers, citing it would cause them to incur significant financial losses. Starbucks, Unilever, Marks &amp; Spencers, Tetley were some of the tea conglomerates that buy tea from Sri Lanka’s plantations.India’s story is not any different.The BHRRC report found that responses by five companies—Morrisons, ekaterra, Ringtons, Marks &amp; Spencer, Tetley—had “almost identical wording,” while deflecting the responsibility for uplifting wages to other entities such as the local government and their suppliers.The investigation found that companies don’t engage directly with tea estate workers to assess their working conditions and demands.“There appears to be little engagement with suppliers or engagement with other actors, such as state governments, trade unions and civil society organisations, to mitigate the effects of estate closure or sale or changes in business structure for workers and residents,” the report said.More from QuartzThe world’s biggest banknote printer said the demand for cash hit a two-decade lowEvery fifth car sold worldwide this year will be electricSign up for Quartz's Newsletter.

Plus, this pullback has positioned SBUX close to a historically bullish trendline, making now an opportune time to bet on a move higher. More specifically, Starbucks stock is now trading near its 160-day moving average. Per Schaeffer's Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White's latest study, the equity saw three comparable signals during the past three years, and was higher one month later 67% of the time, averaging a 7.8% gain. A similar move would place the shares back above $108. SBUX 160 Day Short-term options traders lean bearish, indicating a shift in sentiment could generate tailwinds. This is per the equity's Schaeffer's put/call open interest ratio (SOIR) of 0.91, which stands in the 85th percentile of annual readings.It’s also worth noting that premiums are attractively priced at the moment.

Looking at Sysco (NYSE:SYY), it does have a high ROCE right now, but lets see how returns are trending.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Sysco:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.20 = US$2.7b ÷ (US$23b - US$9.0b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to April 2023).Therefore, Sysco has an ROCE of 20%. In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Consumer Retailing industry average of 12%. Check out our latest analysis for Sysco roceIn the above chart we have measured Sysco's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Sysco here  for free.What Does the ROCE Trend For Sysco Tell Us?Things have been pretty stable at Sysco, with its capital employed and returns on that capital staying somewhat the same for the last five years. Businesses with these traits tend to be mature and steady operations because they're past the growth phase. So it may not be a multi-bagger in the making, but given the decent 20% return on capital, it'd be difficult to find fault with the business's current operations. With fewer investment opportunities, it makes sense that Sysco has been paying out a decent 53% of its earnings to shareholders. Unless businesses have highly compelling growth opportunities, they'll typically return some money to shareholders.Story continuesThe Bottom Line On Sysco's ROCEAlthough is allocating it's capital efficiently to generate impressive returns, it isn't compounding its base of capital, which is what we'd see from a multi-bagger. And with the stock having returned a mere 25% in the last five years to shareholders, you could argue that they're aware of these lackluster trends. As a result, if you're hunting for a multi-bagger, we think you'd have more luck elsewhere.Sysco does have some risks though, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for Sysco  that you might be interested in.If you'd like to see other companies earning high returns, check out our free list of companies earning high returns with solid balance sheets here.Have feedback on this article?

These new boutiques will build on an already successful collaboration between Simon and The Webster at The Galleria in Houston, Texas.Simon (PRNewsfoto/Simon)""The Webster is an iconic retail destination that exudes a distinctive energy with a commitment to good fashion and good fun.  Our shoppers are zealous for unique luxury retail experiences, and we are thrilled to be working with The Webster to deliver top-level customer service and a highly curated selection from the industry's leading designers to three booming markets. The Webster is a natural complement to the extensive roster of luxury offerings at The Domain, Lenox Square, and The Shops at Riverside,"" said Velda Turan, Senior Vice President, Leasing at Simon. ""The vibrant intimacy of their store design is an exceptional addition to our curated mix of market-exclusive brands, further establishing these properties as top fashion and lifestyle shopping destinations.""The Webster at The Shops of Riverside, the first to open in the Simon expansion, is being designed by French Interior Designer Stéphane Parmentier. This will be the fourth location in the retailer's portfolio designed by Parmentier, which includes their Montecito boutique in Rosewood Miramar Beach, Toronto, the first international boutique, and the most recent opening of their Palm Springs location. Parmentier has built upon The Webster's highly established DNA and evolved its notorious store design POV, taking luxury retail in a residential setting to the next level. While this distinct aesthetic connects these four properties, there are still key design elements that have carried over from The Webster's inception that created the South Beach flagship. Hints of Art Deco, vintage wallpapers, a discerning collection of art, and of course, the sunny spirit of Miami will always be pillars in every future The Webster location.Story continues""When I opened The Webster 15 years ago, I never imagined a day where I would be saying we have 12 stores. The response and support from our partners like Simon to our clients who have been with us since day one is truly incredible!

Originally the Webster Hotel, the 20,000 square-foot Art Deco building was built in 1939 by architect Henry Hohauser. Heriard Dubreuil, who grew up in Paris and worked as a top merchandiser for Balenciaga and Yves Saint Laurent before founding The Webster, kept the name but reimagined the three-story interior as a women's and men's multi-brand luxury retailer designed with vibrant intimacy to resemble a residential space.""The idea was a place where you can feel very comfortable,"" says Heriard Dubreuil of The Webster's concept. ""It's a place to spend time. You arrive, you take off your shoes, you're at someone's house, or you're in your gigantic closet, and you can try everything."" Rather than organize the store according to brand, Heriard Dubreuil merchandised it as if it were a personal wardrobe, mixing big brands with the emerging, arranging everything intuitively by mood, which was revolutionary at the time. Her instinctive, warm touch lured an impressive brand matrix, including Balenciaga, Bottega Veneta, Chanel, Celine, Saint Laurent as well as loyal customers.After more than a decade after the South Beach flagship opened, The Webster has expanded to eight additional flagship locations in Bal Harbour, Houston, Costa Mesa, New York City, Los Angeles, Montecito at the Rosewood Miramar Beach, Toronto, and, most recently, Palm Springs. Each store has its own distinctive energy, unified by Heriard Dubreuil's uncompromising vision of good energy, good fashion, good fun, and Miami's sunny spirit. The retailer has become a destination for exclusive collaborations with brands such as Pucci, Bottega Veneta, AMIRI, and permanent partnerships with David Mallett and Augustinus Bader, who operates a studio out of The Webster's SoHo location.About Simon® Simon® is a real estate investment trust engaged in the ownership of premier shopping, dining, entertainment and mixed-use destinations and an S&amp;P 100 company (Simon Property Group, NYSE: SPG).

(NASDAQ:PYPL), and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.

The index has posted monthly gains during April over 16 of the past 20 years, while the index has risen during 14 of the past 20 Mays.It’s a similar story when it comes to the stocks that make up the S&amp;P 500, which have posted gains during 14 of the past 20 Marchs, 15 of the past 20 Mays, and 16 of the past 20 Aprils, the latter being the strongest performing month for the index. Spring has also been a good season for tech stocks, with the Nasdaq posting gains over 13 of the past 20 years in each of March, April, and May, ranking them in a tie as the third-best performing months for the index.Energy and Finance Stocks Do a Lot of Spring Cleaning (Up)When it comes to the performance of specific industries, energy and finance stocks have often been the runaway spring winners. According to CNBC, between 2001 and 2010, nearly half of all stocks that posted at least 20% gains during any given spring were either finance or energy stocks, with finance stocks leading the way.There’s a surprisingly strong historical correlation between the energy and financial sectors which makes their equally strong springs somewhat less surprising. Naturally, the energy sector is highly correlated with the price of West Texas crude, at 71%. What many investors may not know is that it’s also highly correlated with the finance sector, with the correlation between the S&amp;P 500 energy and finance indexes standing at 70% according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Story continuesIn terms of where the two sectors stand today, they’re somewhat at odds despite their strong stock market correlation. The banking sector is experiencing somewhat of a crisis, with many U.S. banks borrowing heavily but tightening their lending policies, which has some experts concerned about a forthcoming credit crunch.On the other hand, the energy sector looks like it has the potential to outperform the broader market for a third straight year in 2023 thanks to oil prices that are expected to steady but also rise this year, impressive free cash flow yields, and the lowest P/E ratio among all S&amp;P 500 sectors.With that in mind, let’s take a look at 12 spring stocks to buy now.12 Best Spring Stocks To Buy NowSource:unsplashOur MethodologyThe companies in the following list of the best spring stocks to buy now are gathered from the finance and energy sectors, traditionally the strongest performing sectors during the spring, and then ranked based on hedge fund sentiment. We follow a select group of hedge funds because Insider Monkey’s research has uncovered that their consensus stock picks can deliver outstanding returns.All hedge fund data is based on the exclusive group of 900+ funds tracked by Insider Monkey that filed 13Fs for the Q1 2023 reporting period.12 Best Spring Stocks To Buy Now12. Schlumberger Limited (NYSE:SLB)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 68 JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), and PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) are a few of the stocks that appear poised for strong springs. Another is oilfield services giant Schlumberger Limited (NYSE:SLB), which is coming off an exceptional 2022, growing revenue by 23% to $28.1 billion, including a 25% rise in services revenue. Earnings per share jumped by 70% to $2.18, while the company generated an impressive $3.7 billion in free cash flow.Schlumberger Limited (NYSE:SLB) believes the macro backdrop suggests a strong multi-year upcycle for the sector is ongoing, which should only increase the demand for Schlumberger’s services as investment in the space continues to pick up and new projects are launched.With things looking up over the longer term, Schlumberger has begun returning more cash to shareholders through buybacks and dividend hikes, though on the latter front, its dividend yield of 2.18% is still rather light compared to the industry average.VGI Partners made the following comment about Schlumberger Limited (NYSE:SLB) in its 2022 annual investor letter:“In addition to defence, we have focused our efforts on other new sectors where we see structural growth, including energy and medical technology. The long-term outlook for energy looks highly attractive given many years of under-investment and more recently amplified by ESG constraints and corporate discipline. Although we reviewed commodity owners (where we leveraged the expertise of the Regal resources team), we focused our efforts on the second derivative – the oil service companies. These are the picks-and-shovels of the industry and arguably the highest-quality way to gain exposure. As a result, we invested in Schlumberger Limited (NYSE:SLB) earlier this year and grew this to a circa 8% weight during the year (now circa 3%)”11. The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 70 The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) ranks as the 11th best spring stock to buy now and should be of particular interest to value investors. The company ranked third on our list of the Most Profitable Value Stocks Now after pulling in $8.79 in GAAP EPS during the first quarter, beating estimates by $0.69. Revenue did fall year-over-year however and analysts were mixed on the quarterly results.The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) is undertaking several initiatives to deal with the challenging macro environment, including the partial sale of its Marcus unsecured loan portfolio. With the pace of fundraising expected to slow throughout the rest of the year, the company is also scaling back its share repurchase program.Manole Capital Management discussed The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS)’s partnership with Apple in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Back in 2019, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) made a splash in the card industry by working with Apple and MasterCard on a credit card. The actual card is fairly sleek (as you can see below), as customers names are etched into an Apple titanium card. The no-fee card generated a lot of hype, as many early users were quick to post their latest card on various social media sites.The initial goal of Marcus (back in 2016) was to leverage Goldman’s wonderful name brand and build a full-service digital bank. This card was a large piece of GS’s ambitions to grow its retail banking franchise called Marcus. After 5 years, Marcus now has 14 million customers and $16 billion in loan balances. Surprisingly, Marcus now represents nearly 20% of the firm’s total revenue.We thought it would be interesting to look how the Apple Card is doing in terms of loans and exposures. With over $100 billion in assets, this has been a successful source of cheap deposits for GS. Despite having an institutional / “white shoe” brand in the investment banking and trading world, GS’s Apple Card has been a disappointment.” (Click here to read the full text)10. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 74 Hedge fund ownership of Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) has dipped by 14% over the past year after hitting a 10-year high in the first quarter of 2022. The company’s shareholders have been pressuring it to consider abandoning its fossil fuel investments, or at the very least to look into the potential costs of abandoning them versus the financial risks those investments could incur if the world achieves net-zero emissions by 2050. Exxon plans to invest as much as $25 billion annually over the next few years on various energy projects.While Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) believes the net-zero initiative is unlikely to succeed, it’s nonetheless looking into other ways to diversify into renewables, including the recent purchase of a 120,000-acre tract of land in Arkansas that’s believed to be rich in lithium. The company has also been expanding its EV charging network.First Eagle Investments Global Fund likes some of the other things Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) has been doing with its cash, as relayed in the fund’s Q2 2022 investor letter:“Integrated oil and gas giant Exxon Mobil performed well in the second quarter as continued high prices for energy products supported the stock. As the largest refiner in the US, the company has benefitted from wide “crack spreads,” or the margin between the cost of crude oil and the petroleum products extracted from it. Exxon continues to invest in refining capacity in the US, which industrywide has been in steady decline since 2019. We are pleased that Exxon has been using its strong cash flows to reduce debt and to return cash to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases.”9. ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 75 Hedge funds have been swarming into ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) in recent quarters, with ownership of the stock jumping by 50% since Q3 of 2021, which helped push the stock up to ninth on the list of top spring stocks to buy now. Steve Cohen’s Point72 Asset Management opened a new COP stake in Q1, while Louis Bacon’s Moore Global Investments did so in the fourth quarter of last year.ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) achieved record production of 1,792 MBOED in the first quarter beat earnings estimates by over 10% at $2.38. That could be just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to company’s earnings potential, as it recently unveiled a 10-year plan in which it projects to generate $225 billion in free cash flow at a modest West Texas price point of $60 per barrel. After accounting for capital expense during that timeframe, that could leave it with $100 billion or more in excess cash, the bulk of which will likely be returned to shareholders.Oakmark Global Fund revealed why it believes ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) shares to be undervalued in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) is one of the largest and lowest cost U.S. exploration and production companies in the country, led by CEO Ryan Lance—in our view one of the best value creators in the industry. ConocoPhillips’s share prices fell in the first quarter as oil prices receded, which is not atypical. We were buying the company at prices where it could generate its entire market cap in free cash flow over the next decade while growing the production such that at the end of that time, the base of production would be one-third higher. This sort of reinvestment opportunity is unique to ConocoPhillips and clearly not reflected in the current share price.”8. American Express Company (NYSE:AXP)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 79 The number of hedge funds long American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) hit a 10-year high in the first quarter and has risen in each of the past three quarters. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway maintained its gargantuan AXP holding during Q1, owning nearly 152 million AXP shares worth over $25 billion as of March 31.American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) was one of ten companies with “Great” Earnings Reports Jim Cramer is Talking About after the company grew revenue by 21.7% year-over-year to $14.3 billion, though its EPS of $2.40 missed estimates. Cramer characterized it as “a gigantic quarter with tremendous growth”.Some analysts weren’t quite as bullish on the results however. BMO Capital lowered its price target on American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) to $185 from $194, noting that the company’s growth is moderating while its credit losses are on the rise. Piper Sandler also lowered its price target on the stock, dropping it to $172 from $179, given expectations that comps will become more challenging later this year and into 2024 as consumer leverage rises.7. Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 81 Hedge funds continued to sell off Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) during Q1, with the number of funds long Citigroup falling for the 16th time in the last 21 quarters. Ownership of the stock has fallen by 37% during that time. Citigroup is another finance stock that Warren Buffett loves, while Lee Ainslie’s Maverick Capital was at the other end of the spectrum, selling off its Citi stake during Q1.Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) appears to be rather attractive from several standpoints, including its industry-low price-to-book ratio of 0.43x and its moderate price-to-earnings ratio of 6.39x. While Citi hasn’t raised its dividend payout in four years and still has a relatively high payout ratio compared to the industry average despite that, the company is expected to begin repurchasing shares again later this year.Diamond Hill Long-Short Fund noted that some of Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C)’s initiatives may be dilutive to the company’s earnings in the near-term as of the fund’s Q1 2022 investor letter:“Shares of Citigroup declined in the quarter as investors became increasingly negative on capital markets activity. The company is also continuing to divest certain consumer banking geographies which may be dilutive to earnings in the near term.”6. Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 85 Closing out the first part of our list of the best spring stocks to buy now is Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC). Several hedge funds bailed on Wells Fargo in the first quarter, including Warren Buffett, who otherwise maintains high conviction in several other finance stocks. The company nonetheless ranks as one of hedge funds’ top five picks among investment banks.Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC) bought back $4 billion worth of shares in Q1 and appears poised to continue buying back shares in the coming quarters. CEO Charlie Scharf recently stated that the company feels good about the size of its buffer zone above the regulatory minimums required to be held by banks to balance out their risk-weighted assets, which would allow them to continue buying back shares while otherwise remaining fiscally prudent.Davis New York Venture Fund is impressed by the resiliency of Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC)’s customers, as expressed in the fund’s 2022 annual investor letter:“Our investment thesis for our next largest bank investment, Wells Fargo, is totally different. As is well known, Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC) is the country’s third-largest bank, serving one in three U.S. households. Years of regulatory missteps under prior managements resulted in reputational damage, higher-than-average expenses, numerous consent orders, caps on asset growth, all added to the negative impact of low rates on their interest income. However, where others see bad news, we see resiliency and gradual improvement. Wells Fargo’s resiliency is reflected in the fact that despite years of terrible headlines and congressional hearings, Wells Fargo’s core customers stayed put and customer attrition remains extraordinarily low.As to gradual improvement, new management has made steady headway in closing consent orders, settling regulatory matters and upgrading systems. Thus, rather than increasing profits from growth, Wells Fargo’s earnings growth for the next three-to-five years should come from the combined tailwinds of rising interest income, partially offset by normalizing credit costs, reduced expenses as systems improve and the scandals of the last decade are gradually put behind them, and the return of excess capital through share repurchases and rising dividends. The hypothetical earnings bridge displayed in Figure 6 gives some sense of the earnings power we see unfolding in the years ahead for this durable financial franchise.While our grounded optimism carries the day, we are mindful of the risk that Wells Fargo’s historically excellent credit culture may have deteriorated, or that exasperated regulators may choose to extract even more major penalties for past infractions.” PayPal Holdings, Inc.

Click to skip ahead and see the 5 Best Spring Stocks To Buy Now.If historical trends are anything to go by (and they usually are), then financial stocks like Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), as well as a wide range of energy stocks will be some of the best stocks to buy this spring.The Running of the Spring BullsThe stock market has traditionally performed very well during the spring, which is then followed by a summer swoon as institutional investors like hedge funds pare back their holdings in anticipation of lower summer trading volumes (and the resultant spike in volatility) and more time off for staff.That’s particularly true of the NYSE, with April and May being the index’s strongest and third-strongest months over the past 20 years. The index has posted monthly gains during April over 16 of the past 20 years, while the index has risen during 14 of the past 20 Mays.It’s a similar story when it comes to the stocks that make up the S&amp;P 500, which have posted gains during 14 of the past 20 Marchs, 15 of the past 20 Mays, and 16 of the past 20 Aprils, the latter being the strongest performing month for the index.

However, Talbot Underwriting and Western World, which were also bought as part of the Validus Holdings acquisition and presently account for around $1.6 billion of total gross premiums written of AIG, are not part of the recently disclosed divestiture deal.The consideration price for the latest transaction stands at $2.985 billion, which will be paid by RNR partly in cash amounting to $2.735 billion and the leftover balance will be paid through its common shares. To this effect, concurrent with the latest transaction announcement, RenaissanceRe announced an underwritten public offering of 6,300,000 common shares and the proceeds derived from the offering will be leveraged to finance a part of the cash consideration of the divestiture deal.Additionally, any capital worth more than $2.1 billion of Validus Re’s shareholders’ equity can be retained by AIG. Further, the balance sheet transfer of Validus Re to RenaissanceRe is expected to create future capital synergies of roughly $400 million to AIG.Conclusively, the total value of the divestiture deal is forecast to cross $4.5 billion. Consequent to the transaction closure, AIG estimates to incur substantial investments in the DaVinci Reinsurance and Fontana Re managed funds businesses of RNR as an effort to strengthen ties between the two companies.The latest move seems to be a win-win situation for both parties involved in the transaction. For AIG, the divestiture deal is likely to intensify focus on the General Insurance unit, minimize volatility in its portfolio, boost cash liquidity and enable it to accelerate capital deployment. Also, investments in RNR’s businesses are expected to help AIG in tapping the growth prospects of a low-risk reinsurance market.Story continuesAs an example of benefits to RenaissancRe, the recent move is anticipated to enhance the scale of its global property and casualty reinsurance business as well as boost profitability. AIG had also resorted to divestitures in the past with an endeavor to increase focus on the General Insurance business. It has a deal in place with American Financial Group, Inc. AFG to sell another unit that was part of the Validus Holdings acquisition - Crop Risk Services. The agreement valued at $240 million is likely to be completed in the third quarter of 2023.To complement the same endeavor, AIG also sold a 9.9% equity stake in its Life &amp; Retirement Business to one of the world’s leading investment firms Blackstone BX in November 2021. The General Insurance business resorts to prudent underwriting and expense management efforts along with devising an extensive reinsurance strategy that aids in portfolio repositioning. The unit is usually the most significant contributor to AIG’s overall top line.Shares of American International have declined 4.5% over a year, compared with the industry’s decline of 11.1%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAIG currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

94,57373b06-0779-33e3-a4a2-db7ea25a2344,AIG,2023-05-24,4 Low Price-to-Cash Flow Stocks to Refine Your Portfolio,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-low-price-cash-flow-125900900.html,1684846740,STORY,"['UNM', 'GM', 'AIG', 'PK']","[We always try to hit the jackpot while picking stocks. But striking the right chord each time is not easy unless blessed with Midas touch. When it comes to the investment market, experts consider value style as one of the most effective approaches. Value investing is essentially about selecting stocks that have good things going on for them, even at a time when they have been beaten down by some external factors.There are different valuation metrics to determine a stock’s inherent strength but a random selection of ratios cannot serve your purpose if you want a realistic assessment of a company’s financial position. For this, we recommend Price to Cash Flow (or P/CF) as one of the key metrics. This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per-share basis — the lower the number, the better. Unum Group UNM, General Motors Company GM, American International Group, Inc. AIG and Park Hotels &amp; Resorts PK boast a low P/CF ratio.Price to Cash Flow Reveals Financial HealthQuestions may arise as to why we are considering the Price to Cash Flow valuation metric, when the most widely used metric is Price/Earnings (or P/E). Well, what makes P/CF stand out is that operating cash flow adds back non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income, truly reflecting the financial health of a company.Analysts caution that a company’s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. However, cash flow is reliable. It is net cash flow that reveals how much money a company is actually generating and how effectively management is putting the same to use.A positive cash flow indicates an increase in the company’s liquid assets. This gives the company the means to settle debt, shell out for its expenses, reinvest in its business, endure downturns and finally pay back its shareholders. Then again, a negative cash flow implies a decline in the company’s liquidity, which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves.Story continuesWhat’s the Best Strategy?An investment decision solely based on the P/CF metric may not fetch the desired results. To identify stocks that are trading at a discount, you should expand your search criteria and also consider the price-to-book ratio, price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-sales ratio. Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a Value Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to even better results as these eliminate the chance of falling into a value trap.Here are the parameters for selecting true value stocks:P/CF less than or equal to X-Industry Median.Price greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.P/E using (F1) less than or equal to X-Industry Median: This parameter shortlists stocks that are trading at a discount or are equal to their peers.P/B less than or equal to X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.P/S less than or equal to X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how a stock price compares to the company’s sales — the lower the ratio the more attractive the stock is.PEG less than 1: The ratio is used to determine a stock's value by taking the company's earnings growth into account. The PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and that investors need to pay less for a stock that has robust earnings growth prospects.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best upside potential.Here are four of the nine stocks that qualified the screening:Unum Group, which provides financial protection benefit solutions, sports a Zacks Rank #1 and has an expected EPS growth rate of 9.1% for three-five years.

AVTR recently announced its entry into an agreement with Labguru. The collaboration aims to integrate Avantor's Inventory Manager (IM) and e-commerce channel into Labguru's Lab Information Management Software and Electronic Lab Notebook (ELN).Avantor and Labguru's combined solution will offer a single source for scientists to access a wide range of high-quality products when needed at the lab bench. It is worth mentioning that Labguru is a research-to-production platform for leading global pharma, national research institutes and innovative startups.The latest partnership is expected to significantly boost Avantor’s Clinical Services business on a global scale.Rationale Behind the CollaborationAvantor's IM is a proprietary, vendor-agnostic cloud-based software designed to serve as the central transactional and intelligence hub for lab inventory management. IM provides real-time reporting and customized, on-demand replenishment of lab consumables.Following the tie-up, IM will now likely be able to integrate with ELNs from multiple providers. By integrating IM with Labguru, scientists who use their ELN will likely be able to easily view, check available stock and order products via Avantor's e-commerce channel. This is expected to aid customers while streamlining their lab workflows and driving efficiencies.Per management, the company is focused on providing researchers and scientists with a more streamlined and efficient way to manage their inventory and purchase research materials from Avantor via Labguru's ELN platform. The integration will likely enable Avantor to further enhance the user experience for researchers and provide them with a single source for their lab research needs.Labguru's management feels the partnership with Avantor will likely empower scientists and eliminate friction by providing efficiencies and data-based insights.Industry ProspectsPer a report by Precision Business Insights, the healthcare inventory management software market was valued at $22.1 billion and is expected to witness a CAGR of 5.4% between 2022 and 2028. Factors like the increasing demand for cloud-based medical inventory software and the growing need for healthcare organizations to manage their inventories effectively are likely to drive the market.Story continuesGiven the market potential, the latest partnership is expected to significantly strengthen Avantor's business worldwide.Notable DevelopmentsIn April, Avantor announced its first-quarter 2023 results, wherein it registered a year-over-year uptick in its Europe and AMEA core organic sales. Strength in Avantor’s end markets was also recorded.In January, Avantor entered into a multi-year supply and services agreement with Catalent.

MMSI has been gaining from its strong product portfolio. The optimism led by solid first-quarter 2023 performance and potential in its Cardiovascular unit are expected to contribute further. However, headwinds related to higher consolidation in the healthcare industry and stiff competition persist.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has gained 43.1% compared with an 8.1% rise of the industry and a 7.1% growth of the S&amp;P 500.The renowned medical device provider has a market capitalization of $4.86 billion. The company projects 11% growth for the next five years and expects to maintain its strong performance. It has delivered an earnings surprise of 20.2% for the past four quarters, on average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Strong Q1 Results: Merit Medical’s robust first-quarter 2023 results buoy optimism. The company witnessed a year-over-year uptick in the top and bottom lines. Solid revenue growth in both its segments and across all the product categories within its Cardiovascular unit was also recorded. Robust performances in the United States and outside were also seen. The company stands to benefit from the execution of its global growth and profitability plan.Strong Product Portfolio: Merit Medical has continued to gain significant momentum on the back of new products. The company is upbeat about the product pipeline, including radio and electrophysiology products, raising investors’ optimism. It has several electrophysiology products that are either on track for release or in several other stages of development.In March, Merit Medical announced the expansion of its SwiftNINJA Steerable Microcatheter product line, which belongs to its delivery systems portfolio.Potential in Cardiovascular Unit: We are optimistic about the unit’s robust potential. During the first quarter of 2023, Merit Medical witnessed a solid uptick in its Cardiovascular unit’s year-over-year revenues on a reported and at constant exchange rate, organic basis. Revenues in the unit’s product categories, Peripheral Intervention, Cardiac Intervention, Custom Procedural Solutions and Original Equipment Manufacturer, were also robust during the first quarter.Story continuesDownsidesHigher Consolidation in Healthcare Industry: Healthcare costs have risen significantly over the past decade. Thus, to provide healthcare solutions at a cheaper rate and eradicate competition, large-cap MedTech behemoths have started consolidating with mid-cap and small-cap companies. This enables the availability of healthcare products at low prices in the market. Per management, such trends compel Merit Medical’s customers to ask for price concessions on its products, which acts against its ongoing business strategies. This may also exert a solid downward pressure on the prices of Merit Medical’s products and reduce the customer base.Stiff Competition: Merit Medical operates in highly competitive markets, where it faces competition from many companies with greater resources. The company competes globally in several market areas, including radiology and interventional cardiology. Such resources and market presence may enable the competitors to market competing products more efficiently or at reduced prices to gain market share.Estimate TrendMerit Medical is witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for 2023. In the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings has moved 2.5% north to $2.89.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s second-quarter 2023 revenues is pegged at $309.9 million, suggesting a 5.1% rise from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.Other Key PicksA few other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

97,af5a1b99-1327-3482-94b6-cf4848fa0e65,HOLX,2023-05-24,Here's Why You Should Retain Insulet (PODD) Stock for Now,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-retain-insulet-podd-122500999.html,1684844700,STORY,"['PODD', 'HOLX', 'ZBH']","[Insulet Corporation PODD is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, backed by strength in Omnipod 5 and global manufacturing capabilities. The company’s recently released 2023 first-quarter results also generate investors’ optimism. However, escalating expenses and a substantial fall in drug delivery sales are discouraging.In the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has increased 40.8% compared to the 29.4% fall of the industry and a 7% rise of the S&amp;P 500 composite.The developer, manufacturer and distributor of insulin delivery systems has a market capitalization of $20.98 billion. Insulet projects a long-term estimated earnings growth rate of 35.1% compared with 13.6% of the industry. PODD’s earnings surpassed estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed the same in one, delivering an average surprise of 80.2%.Let’s delve deeper.UpsidesImpressive Q1 Results: Insulet delivered better-than-expected earnings and revenues in the first quarter of 2023. The company exceeded the high end of revenue guidance in the first quarter, led by solid 35% growth across the Omnipod portfolio of products. Internationally, high Omnipod revenues were supported by ongoing Omnipod DASH adoption.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchRobust new customer starts in both the United States and worldwide buoy optimism. Omnipod 5 continued to be a driving force of Insulet’s strong U.S. growth, representing almost 95% of the company’s U.S. new customer starts.On the first-quarter earnings call, Insulet updated its full-year 2023 revenue guidance range of 18-22% (from the earlier band of 14-19%). Across the Omnipod portfolio of products, Insulet anticipates 2023 revenues in the range of 21-25% (from the previous 17-22%).Omnipod 5 – a Key Growth Driver: In the first quarter, Omnipod achieved 49% revenue growth in the United States, driven by the company’s annuity-based model with cumulative record new customer starts and growing U.S. pharmacy volumes. These include increasing contributions from Omnipod 5 and a premium for the Omnipod 5 and Omnipod DASH pods in the U.S. pharmacy, where PODD provides a personal diabetes manager without any charge.Story continuesInsulet is set to begin its international rollout of Omnipod 5 — in the United Kingdom in the middle of 2023 and Germany during the fall. The company also plans to launch Omnipod 5 more broadly across international markets during 2024.Solid Manufacturing Capabilities: Insulet considers its global manufacturing capabilities critical to the long-term growth plan. The company is building a new manufacturing facility in Malaysia, expected to start functioning in 2024.Despite challenging macro-related headwinds, Insulet is securing components and producing pods ahead of forecasted demand levels. This ensures global supply for the company’s expanding customer base.DownsidesMounting Expenses: Insulet reported a 383-basis points contraction in the gross margin in the first quarter of 2023. A volume increase in the U.S. pharmacy channel, including the associated premium positively contributed to gross margin. However, it was more than offset by an expected higher mix of costs due to the ramping of Omnipod 5 and domestic manufacturing operations as well as an unfavorable mix from lower drug delivery revenues.The quarter’s adjusted operating margin was affected by a 26.4% year-over-year increase in SG&amp;A expenses and a 16.2% increase in Research and Development expenses compared to the prior year’s quarter.Lumpy Drug Delivery Business: In the first quarter, Insulet’s Drug Delivery Business was down 98.1% year over year. The company expects full-year revenues to decline 55%-45% from this segment, similar to the 2022 reported figures.With several investment opportunities to grow the diabetes side of the business, Insulet is currently not focusing on the drug delivery side.Estimate TrendInsulet has been witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for 2023. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 earnings per share (EPS) has moved up 2.4% to $1.27 in the past 30 days and 5.5% to $1.34 in the past seven days.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 revenues is pegged at $1.57 billion. This suggests a 20.5% rise from the year-ago reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Zimmer Biomet ZBH, Penumbra PEN and Hologic, Inc.

The email details how you can transfer a profile to a new account, as well as the option of paying to add an extra member outside your household.Read moreA look back at BTS as it became the world's top-selling actYour anxiety brings 4 distinct superpowersAmericans may have seen the last of big rent hikes“A Netflix account is for use by one household,” the company said in its press release, adding that “everyone living in that household can use Netflix…at home, on the go, on holiday.”The perks of transferring a profile to a new one, instead of building one from scratch, is that the freeloader-turned-customer can retain their history and recommendations.Meanwhile, the extra member option comes with more out-of-pocket expenses for the original member, and added restrictions: The additional member has to be activated in the same country, they can only use one device to view or download content at a time, and they can’t create extra profiles or log in as a Kids profile.A brief explanation of a Netflix householdNetflix describes a household as “a collection of the devices connected to the internet at the main place you watch Netflix.” Once the household is set using a TV device, all other devices that use the Netflix account on the same internet connection as the TV will automatically be part of it. The company uses IP addresses, device IDs, and account activity to determine whether a device is part of the same Netflix Household or not.Quotable: Netflix didn’t mind password sharing before“We love people sharing Netflix whether they’re two people on a couch or 10 people on a couch.

Netflix’s competitors are bulking up, with HBO Max becoming Max, Paramount+ adding Showtime to its service, and Disney combining Disney+ and Hulu into one app.April 2022 represented a wake up call of sorts for Netflix as it lost subscribers for the first time ever. Now the Los Gatos, California-based streaming giant wants all households to get separate accounts to boost subscriber numbers, and therefore revenue.But it could do more harm than good. College students, who often use their parents’ accounts, have been irked by the impending change. A larger concern for streaming freeloaders is that other platforms will follow Netflix’s example, compelling people to expand their streaming budgets.Password sharing crackdown, by the digits103: Countries and territories, including the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Australia, Singapore, Mexico, and Brazil, where Netflix is expanding its password sharing crackdown$7.99: Additional fee a subscriber in the US can pay per month to add an extra member to its standard or premier plans. It’s more than the cost of the $6.99 per month Netflix’s ad-supported tier, which launched six months ago and has so far amassed 5 million subscribers£4.99 ($6.21): The cost of the basic with ads plan in the UK is the same as the cost of adding an extra memberMore than 100 million: Households that had supplied their log-in credentials to friends and family outside their homes, according to Netflix’s estimates. That’s a big chunk of its 233 million user base globallyMore than 1 million: Number of subscribers Netflix lost in Spain, when it started charging €5.99 (£5.27) for an additional account, according to Kantar. However, Netflix execs argue the dwindling numbers are just a product of knee-jerk reactions—similar to when price increases happen—but users will eventually return to the platform90%: TV series and movies in Netflix’s catalog that are available on the ad-supported tier. A limited number aren’t initially available due to licensing restrictions but co-CEO Sarandos said there will be negotiations to include the restPerson of interest: Arnold SchwarzeneggerOn May 22, Netflix appointed Arnold Schwarzenegger as chief action officer. The 75-year-old’s job role wasn’t accompanied by any sort of description, but it was posted along with a list of action movies and series releasing on Netflix soon. Featured in the lineup was Fubar—a series starring Schwarzenegger slated to premiere on Netflix on May 25—suggesting it’s a marketing gimmick more than a real role. But besides appealing to Arnie’s fans, there are other concrete steps the streaming behemoth is taking to woo customers, from pumping in billions of dollars into Korean content and making a push into gaming.Related stories📝 Netflix accidentally revealed its blueprint to stop password sharing📺 Netflix revealed how many subscribers are paying for its ad-supported plan💿 Netflix is hitting the stop button on the DVD rental business that started it allMore from QuartzThe world’s biggest banknote printer said the demand for cash hit a two-decade lowEvery fifth car sold worldwide this year will be electricSign up for Quartz's Newsletter.

TPR, one of the widely recognized names in the Retail - Apparel and Shoes industry, has been making tactical changes to its business operations to adapt and stay relevant in the competitive retail landscape. Its consumer-centric approach, omnichannel capabilities, brand awareness and emphasis on high-growth areas position it well among peers.Growth InitiativesTapestry has been witnessing growth in the omnichannel. This can be attributed to a mid-single-digit jump in store revenues as consumers continue to embrace the return of in-person shopping during the fiscal third quarter. Also, in the aforementioned period, digital sales rose mid-single digits and remained three times of fiscal 2019 level. The company has been expanding its digital distribution channels. It is aiming to enhance curbside or store pickup service as well as contactless payment options and the opportunities to make virtual appointments.Tapestry’s long-term growth drivers include deepening engagement with consumers, creating innovative and compelling products, venturing into under-penetrated markets and enhancement of digital capacities. The company’s compelling pricing strategy, smaller format locations and cost-effective global sourcing model have been enhancing store productivity.From growth perspective, China remains one of the prominent markets for Tapestry. The company has been accelerating growth in the region through tailored and innovative product assortments, enhanced marketing and expanded reach across direct channels and third-party online distribution.Owing to a robust performance in the fiscal third quarter, the company raised its guidance for fiscal 2023. It now envisions revenues to be approximately $6.7 billion for fiscal 2023, which is in line with the prior-year figures. On a constant-currency basis, revenues are estimated to grow 3% year over year. Earlier, the company projected revenues of approximately $6.6 billion for fiscal 2023.TPR now guided earnings in the band of $3.85-$3.90, representing low-double-digit growth from the prior year on an adjusted basis.

The award has been offered by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, DC.Details of the DealValued at $1.08 billion, the contract is expected to be completed by September 2033. Per the terms of the deal, General Dynamics will provide long lead time material associated with the Virginia class submarines SSN 812 and SSN 813.A major portion of the work related to this contract will be carried out in Sunnyvale, CA.What’s Favoring General Dynamics?The changing dynamics of the military landscape and the rising geopolitical tension make it mandatory for a country to continuously evolve and strengthen its defense structure. The increased defense spending is mainly due to upgrading and improvising defense systems with technologically advanced features. Military submarines with enhanced undersea warfare capabilities form an integral part of any nation’s defense system.The increased focus on military submarines is likely to benefit General Dynamics as its Electric Boat business unit is a prime contractor of submarines.Looking ahead, General Dynamics, along with an industry partner, is currently working on Blocks IV and V in the Virginia Class program. The company has 17 Virginia-class submarines in its backlog, scheduled for delivery through 2032.Notably nine of the boats in Block V include the Virginia Payload Module, an 84-foot Electric Boat-designed-and-built hull section that adds four additional payload tubes, more than tripling the strike capacity of these submarines and providing unique capabilities to support special missions.Electric Boat is responsible for all aspects of design and engineering, leading the construction of Virginia-class attack submarines. The aforementioned developments should usher in more contracts for General Dynamics, like the latest one. These contracts, in turn, are expected to boost the company’s growth.Story continuesPeer MovesNations are strengthening their defense capabilities. Per a report from Mordor Intelligence, the submarine market is projected to witness a CAGR of 4% during 2023-2028. Such abounding growth trends indicate ample growth opportunities for General Dynamics as it enjoys a lucrative position in the military submarine space.A few defense primes that can reap the benefits of the expanding submarine market are BAE Systems BAESY, Northrop Grumman NOC and Huntington Ingalls Industries HII .BAE Systems’ Astute class submarines, the U.K.’s largest and most powerful attack submarines, can strike targets up to 621 miles from the coast with pinpoint accuracy.BAESY’s long-term earnings growth rate is pegged at 13.7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 earnings indicates year-over-year growth of 25.4%.Northrop Grumman designs, develops and produces communication systems, sensors, signal processing and electronic warfare systems to counter increasingly sophisticated sea-based threats. It also provides launch systems for submarines. NOC’s eject launch technology has powered more than 7,000 successful launches.The company has a long-term earnings growth rate of 3.8%. NOC delivered an average earnings surprise of 4.6% in the last four quarters.Huntington Ingalls has a teaming agreement with Electric Boat to build Virginia-class fast-attack nuclear submarines. Its Newport News division is participating in the design and construction of the Columbia-class (SSBN 826) submarine as a replacement for the current aging Ohio-class nuclear ballistic missile submarines.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for HII’s 2023 earnings indicates year-over-year growth of 2.5%. Huntington Ingalls delivered an average earnings surprise of 8.09% in the last four quarters.Zacks Rank &amp; Price PerformanceCurrently, General Dynamics carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

You can skip our detailed analysis of blue chip companies and dividend stocks, and go directly to read 5 Best Blue Chip Dividend Stocks To Buy. After recording one of its worst performances in 2022, the stock market has rebounded this year. The S&amp;P 500 and the tech-heavy NASDAQ both are delivering positive returns to shareholders this year, gaining 9.39% and 22.2%, respectively, as of May 23. This market rally has boosted investors’ confidence. According to a survey conducted by Bankrate in March, analysts expect the S&amp;P 500 to rise by 8% over the next four quarters. The survey also highlighted that 46% of the respondents believe that the bull market may begin in the second half of the year.Despite these positive signs, many investors still prefer to steer clear of risks and prefer safe stocks that pay dividends. Blue chip companies are generally regarded as more stable and less volatile than smaller or riskier investments. According to a report by Wall Street Journal, exchange-traded funds that specialize in quality stocks have grown to over $60 billion over the past few years. The same report also quoted Denise Chisholm, director of the quantitative market strategy at Fidelity Investments. She said that quality stocks have outperformed about 80% of the time in the past three decades during periods of economic downturn.In addition to their strong performance, many blue chip companies have a history of paying consistent dividends. Investors seeking regular income through dividends may consider these quality stocks as they often have the financial strength to maintain and increase dividend payments over time. In our article titled 25 Things Every Dividend Investor Should Know, we mentioned data that shows the strong performance of companies with strong dividend growth track records. Dividend Aristocrats, companies that have raised their payouts for over 25 years, delivered a 12.13% return to shareholders from 1990 to 2018, compared with a 9.96% return for the broader market during this period.Story continuesBest Blue Chip Dividend Stocks To BuyPhoto by Joshua Hoehne on UnsplashMedtronic plc (NYSE:MDT), NextEra Energy, Inc.

The two new reports conclude that U.S. bank earnings will fall markedly this year as liquidity pressures weigh on net interest margins, while credit costs rise.Published by S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence's financial institutions research group, the reports find that U.S. banks will respond to the liquidity crunch by building reserves for loan losses, slowing loan growth and building cash on their balance sheets. Those actions in conjunction with higher funding costs will put pressure on margins and earnings. As margins come under pressure, banks will continue to build reserves for loan losses in the face of an increasingly uncertain economic environment.""Significant tightening from the Federal Reserve since March 2022 and customers moving cash out of banks into higher-yielding alternatives have put pressure on liquidity across the banking industry,"" said Nathan Stovall, director of financial institutions research at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence. ""More recently, liquidity pressures grew in the wake of the second, third and fourth-largest bank failures in U.S. history, sparking concerns about funding. The increased funding costs will serve as a headwind to banks' net interest margins, but the challenge appears to be an earnings issue rather than a threat to safety and soundness of the banking system.""Key findings from the US Bank Market Report:U.S. bank earnings are expected to fall 18.3% in 2023 as deposit outflows and notably higher deposit costs weigh on net interest margins.Higher interest rates have boosted loan yields but have also led to growing pressures on bank liquidity. Funding costs will rise at a quicker pace than earning-asset yields in 2023, causing net interest margins to contract by 10 basis points in 2023 and another 7 basis points in 2024.Deposit betas, or the percentage of rate changes banks pass on to customers, will more than double in 2023 from year-ago levels.Story continuesLiquidity crunch will pressure deposits in the short term (%)Key findings from the US Community Bank Market Report:U.S. community bank earnings are expected to fall 22.6% in 2023 as deposit outflows and notably higher deposit costs weigh on net interest margins, while credit trends begin to normalize.Higher interest rates have boosted loan yields but have also led to growing pressures on bank liquidity. Funding costs will rise at a quicker pace than earning-asset yields in 2023, causing net interest margins to contract by 33 basis points in 2023.Deposit betas, or the percentage of rate changes banks pass on to customers, will more than triple the level witnessed in 2022 due to liquidity pressures in the market.Community banks will tighten lending standards to preserve liquidity and adjust to stress in the markets. S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence expects community banks to maintain tighter lender standards — which surfaced yet again in the Federal Reserve's latest senior loan officer survey in April 2023 — in the near term and the pull back in lending will contribute to credit costs moving higher for the group.Deposit outflows cause community banks' loan-to-deposit ratios to rebound sharply (%)To request a copy of the 2023 U.S. Community Bank Market Report and/or the 2023 U.S. Bank Market Report, please contact press.mi@spglobal.com.S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence's opinions, quotes, and credit-related and other analyses are statements of opinion as of the date they are expressed and not statements of fact or recommendation to purchase, hold, or sell any securities or to make any investment decisions, and do not address the suitability of any security.About S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence At S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, we understand the importance of accurate, deep and insightful information.

This volume would translate to an estimated sales pace of 14.5 million units (seasonally adjusted annual rate: SAAR), a step down from the month-prior result, but reminiscent of ongoing monthly patterns in this metric.On the supply side of the equation, supply chain issues have continued the easing that began in the second half of 2022, resulting in consistent increases in retail advertised inventory levels. As we approach the summer months, vehicle listings have plateaued at approximately 2 million units, 67% higher than a year ago, according to S&amp;P Global Mobility's proprietary analysis of advertised dealer inventory.""With increased supply comes increased negotiating power for consumers in the market for a new vehicle – as 40% of vehicle listings now reflect a price below MSRP, compared to less than 25% a year ago,"" said Matt Trommer, associate director of Market Reporting at S&amp;P Global Mobility. ""While certain models continue to be difficult to find, savvy consumers are better positioned to find a deal now than they have been since the pandemic.""""Auto sales in May are expected to reflect the ongoing market conditions running in opposition of each other; improving inventory, but uncertain consumers,"" said Chris Hopson, principal analyst at S&amp;P Global Mobility. ""Potential upside to immediate term sales remains as inventory levels progress. However, gathering economic headwinds point to some volatility come the second half of the year.""Story continuesSales volumes over the next several months are not expected to dynamically change from the current trend, according to the analysis.

Even if the two sides agree on a deal, it could still have implications for economic growth, he said.""If they come to an agreement on the debt ceiling, there will be some concessions on the fiscal spending.

Healthcare expenditures are projected to reach $6.2 trillion by 2028, giving rise to more complexities and inefficiencies. This partnership aims to reduce complications and is expected to protect consumers' data and save costs.This move bodes well for Mastercard, which is focused on protecting customer data and creating better security. Through this partnership, HealthLock’s analytics-based services can be used by millions of Mastercard users for no extra fee. In addition, the customers will also receive better rates for subscriptions and a free 90-day trial of HealthLock’s premium service.Through HealthLocks’ unique value proposition, Mastercard will be able to retain issuer clients by enhancing its existing offerings. Mastercard issuers will benefit by gaining consumers’ trust as they ensure the privacy and security of medical data. As consumers save money on healthcare costs, as a byproduct of this move, issuers can drive incremental revenues and increase deposits.Medical overbilling, abuse and fraud cost Americans $325 billion annually. Medical data fraud is on the rise and will continue to soar higher; hence consumers need to protect their data. As Mastercard collaborates with HealthLock, consumers are assisted in assessing every medical insurance claim and keeping them organized. More than half of the medical bills contain errors, and this move will help combat the same.Mastercard has unmatchable experience in combating frauds and stands on its ground for innovation in data security. Mastercard’s partnership with HealthLock to enhance its technological footprint is likely to boost the top line in the future by adding value to the company’s existing offerings.Price PerformanceShares of Mastercard have gained 12.9% in the past year compared with the industry’s growth of 5.2%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank &amp; Key PicksMastercard currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks from the Financial Transaction Services industry are PagSeguro Digital Ltd.

Click to skip ahead and see the 5 Best Spring Stocks To Buy Now.If historical trends are anything to go by (and they usually are), then financial stocks like Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), as well as a wide range of energy stocks will be some of the best stocks to buy this spring.The Running of the Spring BullsThe stock market has traditionally performed very well during the spring, which is then followed by a summer swoon as institutional investors like hedge funds pare back their holdings in anticipation of lower summer trading volumes (and the resultant spike in volatility) and more time off for staff.That’s particularly true of the NYSE, with April and May being the index’s strongest and third-strongest months over the past 20 years. The index has posted monthly gains during April over 16 of the past 20 years, while the index has risen during 14 of the past 20 Mays.It’s a similar story when it comes to the stocks that make up the S&amp;P 500, which have posted gains during 14 of the past 20 Marchs, 15 of the past 20 Mays, and 16 of the past 20 Aprils, the latter being the strongest performing month for the index. Spring has also been a good season for tech stocks, with the Nasdaq posting gains over 13 of the past 20 years in each of March, April, and May, ranking them in a tie as the third-best performing months for the index.Energy and Finance Stocks Do a Lot of Spring Cleaning (Up)When it comes to the performance of specific industries, energy and finance stocks have often been the runaway spring winners. According to CNBC, between 2001 and 2010, nearly half of all stocks that posted at least 20% gains during any given spring were either finance or energy stocks, with finance stocks leading the way.There’s a surprisingly strong historical correlation between the energy and financial sectors which makes their equally strong springs somewhat less surprising. Naturally, the energy sector is highly correlated with the price of West Texas crude, at 71%. What many investors may not know is that it’s also highly correlated with the finance sector, with the correlation between the S&amp;P 500 energy and finance indexes standing at 70% according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Story continuesIn terms of where the two sectors stand today, they’re somewhat at odds despite their strong stock market correlation. The banking sector is experiencing somewhat of a crisis, with many U.S. banks borrowing heavily but tightening their lending policies, which has some experts concerned about a forthcoming credit crunch.On the other hand, the energy sector looks like it has the potential to outperform the broader market for a third straight year in 2023 thanks to oil prices that are expected to steady but also rise this year, impressive free cash flow yields, and the lowest P/E ratio among all S&amp;P 500 sectors.With that in mind, let’s take a look at 12 spring stocks to buy now.12 Best Spring Stocks To Buy NowSource:unsplashOur MethodologyThe companies in the following list of the best spring stocks to buy now are gathered from the finance and energy sectors, traditionally the strongest performing sectors during the spring, and then ranked based on hedge fund sentiment. We follow a select group of hedge funds because Insider Monkey’s research has uncovered that their consensus stock picks can deliver outstanding returns.All hedge fund data is based on the exclusive group of 900+ funds tracked by Insider Monkey that filed 13Fs for the Q1 2023 reporting period.12 Best Spring Stocks To Buy Now12. Schlumberger Limited (NYSE:SLB)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 68 JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), and PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) are a few of the stocks that appear poised for strong springs. Another is oilfield services giant Schlumberger Limited (NYSE:SLB), which is coming off an exceptional 2022, growing revenue by 23% to $28.1 billion, including a 25% rise in services revenue. Earnings per share jumped by 70% to $2.18, while the company generated an impressive $3.7 billion in free cash flow.Schlumberger Limited (NYSE:SLB) believes the macro backdrop suggests a strong multi-year upcycle for the sector is ongoing, which should only increase the demand for Schlumberger’s services as investment in the space continues to pick up and new projects are launched.With things looking up over the longer term, Schlumberger has begun returning more cash to shareholders through buybacks and dividend hikes, though on the latter front, its dividend yield of 2.18% is still rather light compared to the industry average.VGI Partners made the following comment about Schlumberger Limited (NYSE:SLB) in its 2022 annual investor letter:“In addition to defence, we have focused our efforts on other new sectors where we see structural growth, including energy and medical technology. The long-term outlook for energy looks highly attractive given many years of under-investment and more recently amplified by ESG constraints and corporate discipline. Although we reviewed commodity owners (where we leveraged the expertise of the Regal resources team), we focused our efforts on the second derivative – the oil service companies. These are the picks-and-shovels of the industry and arguably the highest-quality way to gain exposure. As a result, we invested in Schlumberger Limited (NYSE:SLB) earlier this year and grew this to a circa 8% weight during the year (now circa 3%)”11. The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 70 The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) ranks as the 11th best spring stock to buy now and should be of particular interest to value investors. The company ranked third on our list of the Most Profitable Value Stocks Now after pulling in $8.79 in GAAP EPS during the first quarter, beating estimates by $0.69. Revenue did fall year-over-year however and analysts were mixed on the quarterly results.The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) is undertaking several initiatives to deal with the challenging macro environment, including the partial sale of its Marcus unsecured loan portfolio. With the pace of fundraising expected to slow throughout the rest of the year, the company is also scaling back its share repurchase program.Manole Capital Management discussed The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS)’s partnership with Apple in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Back in 2019, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) made a splash in the card industry by working with Apple and MasterCard on a credit card. The actual card is fairly sleek (as you can see below), as customers names are etched into an Apple titanium card. The no-fee card generated a lot of hype, as many early users were quick to post their latest card on various social media sites.The initial goal of Marcus (back in 2016) was to leverage Goldman’s wonderful name brand and build a full-service digital bank. This card was a large piece of GS’s ambitions to grow its retail banking franchise called Marcus. After 5 years, Marcus now has 14 million customers and $16 billion in loan balances. Surprisingly, Marcus now represents nearly 20% of the firm’s total revenue.We thought it would be interesting to look how the Apple Card is doing in terms of loans and exposures. With over $100 billion in assets, this has been a successful source of cheap deposits for GS. Despite having an institutional / “white shoe” brand in the investment banking and trading world, GS’s Apple Card has been a disappointment.” (Click here to read the full text)10. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 74 Hedge fund ownership of Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) has dipped by 14% over the past year after hitting a 10-year high in the first quarter of 2022. The company’s shareholders have been pressuring it to consider abandoning its fossil fuel investments, or at the very least to look into the potential costs of abandoning them versus the financial risks those investments could incur if the world achieves net-zero emissions by 2050. Exxon plans to invest as much as $25 billion annually over the next few years on various energy projects.While Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) believes the net-zero initiative is unlikely to succeed, it’s nonetheless looking into other ways to diversify into renewables, including the recent purchase of a 120,000-acre tract of land in Arkansas that’s believed to be rich in lithium. The company has also been expanding its EV charging network.First Eagle Investments Global Fund likes some of the other things Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) has been doing with its cash, as relayed in the fund’s Q2 2022 investor letter:“Integrated oil and gas giant Exxon Mobil performed well in the second quarter as continued high prices for energy products supported the stock. As the largest refiner in the US, the company has benefitted from wide “crack spreads,” or the margin between the cost of crude oil and the petroleum products extracted from it. Exxon continues to invest in refining capacity in the US, which industrywide has been in steady decline since 2019. We are pleased that Exxon has been using its strong cash flows to reduce debt and to return cash to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases.”9. ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 75 Hedge funds have been swarming into ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) in recent quarters, with ownership of the stock jumping by 50% since Q3 of 2021, which helped push the stock up to ninth on the list of top spring stocks to buy now. Steve Cohen’s Point72 Asset Management opened a new COP stake in Q1, while Louis Bacon’s Moore Global Investments did so in the fourth quarter of last year.ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) achieved record production of 1,792 MBOED in the first quarter beat earnings estimates by over 10% at $2.38. That could be just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to company’s earnings potential, as it recently unveiled a 10-year plan in which it projects to generate $225 billion in free cash flow at a modest West Texas price point of $60 per barrel. After accounting for capital expense during that timeframe, that could leave it with $100 billion or more in excess cash, the bulk of which will likely be returned to shareholders.Oakmark Global Fund revealed why it believes ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) shares to be undervalued in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) is one of the largest and lowest cost U.S. exploration and production companies in the country, led by CEO Ryan Lance—in our view one of the best value creators in the industry. ConocoPhillips’s share prices fell in the first quarter as oil prices receded, which is not atypical. We were buying the company at prices where it could generate its entire market cap in free cash flow over the next decade while growing the production such that at the end of that time, the base of production would be one-third higher. This sort of reinvestment opportunity is unique to ConocoPhillips and clearly not reflected in the current share price.”8. American Express Company (NYSE:AXP)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 79 The number of hedge funds long American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) hit a 10-year high in the first quarter and has risen in each of the past three quarters. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway maintained its gargantuan AXP holding during Q1, owning nearly 152 million AXP shares worth over $25 billion as of March 31.American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) was one of ten companies with “Great” Earnings Reports Jim Cramer is Talking About after the company grew revenue by 21.7% year-over-year to $14.3 billion, though its EPS of $2.40 missed estimates. Cramer characterized it as “a gigantic quarter with tremendous growth”.Some analysts weren’t quite as bullish on the results however. BMO Capital lowered its price target on American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) to $185 from $194, noting that the company’s growth is moderating while its credit losses are on the rise. Piper Sandler also lowered its price target on the stock, dropping it to $172 from $179, given expectations that comps will become more challenging later this year and into 2024 as consumer leverage rises.7. Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 81 Hedge funds continued to sell off Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) during Q1, with the number of funds long Citigroup falling for the 16th time in the last 21 quarters. Ownership of the stock has fallen by 37% during that time. Citigroup is another finance stock that Warren Buffett loves, while Lee Ainslie’s Maverick Capital was at the other end of the spectrum, selling off its Citi stake during Q1.Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) appears to be rather attractive from several standpoints, including its industry-low price-to-book ratio of 0.43x and its moderate price-to-earnings ratio of 6.39x. While Citi hasn’t raised its dividend payout in four years and still has a relatively high payout ratio compared to the industry average despite that, the company is expected to begin repurchasing shares again later this year.Diamond Hill Long-Short Fund noted that some of Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C)’s initiatives may be dilutive to the company’s earnings in the near-term as of the fund’s Q1 2022 investor letter:“Shares of Citigroup declined in the quarter as investors became increasingly negative on capital markets activity. The company is also continuing to divest certain consumer banking geographies which may be dilutive to earnings in the near term.”6. Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 85 Closing out the first part of our list of the best spring stocks to buy now is Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC). Several hedge funds bailed on Wells Fargo in the first quarter, including Warren Buffett, who otherwise maintains high conviction in several other finance stocks. The company nonetheless ranks as one of hedge funds’ top five picks among investment banks.Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC) bought back $4 billion worth of shares in Q1 and appears poised to continue buying back shares in the coming quarters. CEO Charlie Scharf recently stated that the company feels good about the size of its buffer zone above the regulatory minimums required to be held by banks to balance out their risk-weighted assets, which would allow them to continue buying back shares while otherwise remaining fiscally prudent.Davis New York Venture Fund is impressed by the resiliency of Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC)’s customers, as expressed in the fund’s 2022 annual investor letter:“Our investment thesis for our next largest bank investment, Wells Fargo, is totally different. As is well known, Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC) is the country’s third-largest bank, serving one in three U.S. households. Years of regulatory missteps under prior managements resulted in reputational damage, higher-than-average expenses, numerous consent orders, caps on asset growth, all added to the negative impact of low rates on their interest income. However, where others see bad news, we see resiliency and gradual improvement. Wells Fargo’s resiliency is reflected in the fact that despite years of terrible headlines and congressional hearings, Wells Fargo’s core customers stayed put and customer attrition remains extraordinarily low.As to gradual improvement, new management has made steady headway in closing consent orders, settling regulatory matters and upgrading systems. Thus, rather than increasing profits from growth, Wells Fargo’s earnings growth for the next three-to-five years should come from the combined tailwinds of rising interest income, partially offset by normalizing credit costs, reduced expenses as systems improve and the scandals of the last decade are gradually put behind them, and the return of excess capital through share repurchases and rising dividends. The hypothetical earnings bridge displayed in Figure 6 gives some sense of the earnings power we see unfolding in the years ahead for this durable financial franchise.While our grounded optimism carries the day, we are mindful of the risk that Wells Fargo’s historically excellent credit culture may have deteriorated, or that exasperated regulators may choose to extract even more major penalties for past infractions.” PayPal Holdings, Inc.

That announcement at Microsoft's Build Developers Conference means further integration of Qualcomm's Snapdragon in Windows devices. Qualcomm saying in a statement, quote, ""On-device generative AI solutions allow developers and cloud service providers to make generative AI more affordable, reliable, and private by moving queries and inferences to edge devices, including PCs and phones.""Joining us to discuss is Ziad Asghar, Qualcomm's senior vice president of product management. We've also got our very own Ali Garfinkel joining in on the conversation. Ziad good to talk to you. The announcement today really does build on an existing partnership you've already had with Microsoft. Talk to me about the scale of the opportunity you see in this partnership centered around AI with Microsoft.ZIAD ASGHAR: I think this generative AI opportunity is just amazing for Qualcomm. You have to understand that this is how we're able to bring all of these experiences onto the devices that are in people's hands. Right now, many of these generative experiences are sitting in the cloud, so people, at large, are not able to access these experiences.But now whether you think about productivity applications on PC-like devices or other entertainment-like applications on smartphones, with this change that's coming right now, with the technology that we have been building, we can actually bring all these experiences to the edge devices. To your PCs, to XR products, to smartphones, to IoT products, and that's really the amazing opportunity for Qualcomm. And we believe we have some unique differentiated technology that sets us apart from everybody else in this space.Story continuesALEXANDRA GARFINKLE: Ziad, Ali here. Investors aren't necessarily thinking of Qualcomm as an AI stock, but should they? How big of an opportunity is Qualcomm looking at in AI?ZIAD ASGHAR: Oh, absolutely, right. So think about it. If you think from the perspective of privacy, if you think from the perspective of the contextual data that's available on a device, to be able to run these generative AI use cases, large language models on the device, it completely changes the story. It allows people to be able to run these devices while keeping those queries private.To be able to generate that experience even when you are not connected. To be able to use the contextual information in a way that, basically, you can give a far better experience to the user than is possible today. So let's take an example, right. So if you are talking about, you're creating a virtual world around you. If you already know the kind of textures, the colors, the themes that you like, we can actually optimize that experience for you.So the experience is better, the privacy is basically preserved, you have the experience, whether you're connected or not, and essentially, the experience is far better. So we really think this brings the generative AI opportunity to the edge and really move the center of gravity towards edge devices. So it's a massive opportunity for us at Qualcomm.- Yeah, I've heard you say over and over about the experience here. It feels like we're just really at the tip of experiencing generative AI. What does that future look like? When you talk about user experience on your smartphone, what are we talking about?ZIAD ASGHAR: Let's take an example, right. So on the smartphone right now, you take a picture, already, we are using AI to be able to enhance the quality of that image. But what we can do now is, you can literally talk into your smartphone and you can say, well, put me in front of the Eiffel Tower at sunset with the beautiful clouds in the distance. And we can go and run a text two image model that actually generates that background and puts you right in front of it, right. That sort of an experience. That sort of an interactive experience on devices is really truly only possible if you can do this on the device.And what makes this possible is our special hardware. Our pedigree is about doing more processing at the lowest power possible, and that's precisely what we're able to do with AI too. And we can essentially do that on a device that's not plugged, whereas some of our other competitors run it on graphics engines that takes hundreds of Watts of power, we literally do the experiences with milliwatts of power.And that's what takes it to the masses. That's what takes it to every user that uses a smartphone at this point in time.ALEXANDRA GARFINKLE: Ziad, we've heard a lot about AI risks in the context, for instance, of ChatGPT, which kicked all this off. But I'd love to hear a little bit about how AI risks look from your vantage point.ZIAD ASGHAR: Yeah, so I think one of the main concerns that people have with some of the generative AI examples is privacy. You have seen some of the news come out recently about certain information getting out and staying and residing on these cloud servers.Well, with AI-- generative AI running on the device, that query, that question that you ask from a text or text-like example, stays precisely on the device. It never leaves it. So actually, we are able to address some of the concerns that people have. Of course, additionally, the models have continued to get better. That will actually help with doing a lot more, in terms of improving the experience and taking away some of the concerns that people have with these generative AI use cases.And of course, what is also going to happen is that people will actually get to use these experiences. I think this is a seminal moment in our industry because it really changes the way we interact with our products, with our devices, and this is not one of those things that kind of follow the hype curve. This is actually an example where we have customers coming up to us today and saying, I want to run these use cases on the device. So this is very true, and this is where we believe that we'll be able to actually address a lot of the concerns that people have.Another big, very quick, concern that people have is the cost, right. If you can imagine that these models are getting larger, the applications are growing, at the same time, a lot more people are using them, you will get to a point where you will not have enough resources in the cloud. So you actually need the edge to be able to do generative AI. And that's the unique opportunity for us.ALEXANDRA GARFINKLE: So I'd love to take this a step further then and say, is it possible that the technology you're talking about developing at Qualcomm will make ChatGPT and apps like it more accessible and less costly?ZIAD ASGHAR: Absolutely. Right, so what we can do today, what we showed at some of our recent conferences, was a $1 billion parameter model, what we call stable diffusion running entirely on the device. We showed it today at BuildWare, that same model is now running on a PC.Now what we have a roadmap for is to be able to do up to $10 billion parameters models on the device. And you can envision some of the models that are out there today, text to text-like models. And we see on a daily basis, new modalities coming into it.Text to music, text to audio, image to video. All of those-- many of those, actually, fit very well in this range that I'm talking about, which we believe can run comfortably on the device in a sustained fashion. And that's why it comes to everybody. It comes to anybody and everybody that has a smartphone, or a PC, or an XR device not just connected to the cloud at this point in time.- Qualcomm's Ziad Asghar, good to talk to you today. Fascinating to think about all the applications for AI. Our thanks to Ali Garfinkel as well for joining in on the conversation.]"

These include a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics.

(PHM) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pultegroup-inc-phm-attracting-investor-130012970.html,1684846812,STORY,['PHM'],"[PulteGroup (PHM) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this homebuilder have returned +5.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +1.6% change. The Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry, to which PulteGroup belongs, has gained 1.8% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, PulteGroup is expected to post earnings of $2.41 per share, indicating a change of -11.7% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +34% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.05 points to a change of -16.2% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +21.7%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9 indicates a change of -0.6% from what PulteGroup is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +24.3%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for PulteGroup.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for PHM _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of PulteGroup, the consensus sales estimate of $3.9 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -0.6%. The $15.03 billion and $15.2 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -7.4% and +1.1%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPulteGroup reported revenues of $3.58 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +12.2%. EPS of $2.35 for the same period compares with $1.83 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.27 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +9.42%. The EPS surprise was +32.02%.Over the last four quarters, PulteGroup surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.PulteGroup is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about PulteGroup. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Improving earnings should help companies sustain dividend payments.Price/Cash Flow less than M-Industry: A ratio less than M-industry indicates that the stock is undervalued in that industry and that an investor needs to pay less for better cash flow generated by the company.52-Week Price Change greater than S&amp;P 500 (Market Weight): This ensures that the stock appreciated more than the S&amp;P 500 over the past year.Top Zacks Rank: Stocks having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and 2 (Buy) generally outperform their peers in all types of market environments.Growth Score of B or better: Our research shows that stocks with a Growth Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.Just these few criteria narrowed down the universe from over 7,700 stocks to just 11.Here are five of the 11 stocks that fit the bill:Illinois-based W.W.

You can skip our detailed analysis of blue chip companies and dividend stocks, and go directly to read 5 Best Blue Chip Dividend Stocks To Buy. After recording one of its worst performances in 2022, the stock market has rebounded this year. The S&amp;P 500 and the tech-heavy NASDAQ both are delivering positive returns to shareholders this year, gaining 9.39% and 22.2%, respectively, as of May 23. This market rally has boosted investors’ confidence. According to a survey conducted by Bankrate in March, analysts expect the S&amp;P 500 to rise by 8% over the next four quarters. The survey also highlighted that 46% of the respondents believe that the bull market may begin in the second half of the year.Despite these positive signs, many investors still prefer to steer clear of risks and prefer safe stocks that pay dividends. Blue chip companies are generally regarded as more stable and less volatile than smaller or riskier investments. According to a report by Wall Street Journal, exchange-traded funds that specialize in quality stocks have grown to over $60 billion over the past few years. The same report also quoted Denise Chisholm, director of the quantitative market strategy at Fidelity Investments. She said that quality stocks have outperformed about 80% of the time in the past three decades during periods of economic downturn.In addition to their strong performance, many blue chip companies have a history of paying consistent dividends. Investors seeking regular income through dividends may consider these quality stocks as they often have the financial strength to maintain and increase dividend payments over time. In our article titled 25 Things Every Dividend Investor Should Know, we mentioned data that shows the strong performance of companies with strong dividend growth track records. Dividend Aristocrats, companies that have raised their payouts for over 25 years, delivered a 12.13% return to shareholders from 1990 to 2018, compared with a 9.96% return for the broader market during this period.Story continuesBest Blue Chip Dividend Stocks To BuyPhoto by Joshua Hoehne on UnsplashMedtronic plc (NYSE:MDT), NextEra Energy, Inc.

Pictured is a Goodyear factory worker in Turkey. (Photo: Goodyear)The Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) on Monday asked the Mexican government to investigate claims that labor rights are being denied at a Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. plant in the country.The USTR petition alleges that Goodyear is obstructing workers’ freedom of association and right to collective bargaining at its plant in the north central Mexican city of San Luis Potosi.On May 7, more than 82% of workers at the Goodyear plant in San Luis Potosi voted to terminate their contract with the Miguel Trujillo Lopez union and seek new representation at the facility.It was the second workers’ union vote since April. Mexico’s Labor Department said voter fraud occurred during the April vote, whose results were thrown out.“In rejecting the collective bargaining agreement, the workers at the Goodyear rubber tire facility in San Luis Potosi have expressed their will,” Thea Lee, deputy undersecretary for international affairs at the U.S. Department of Labor, said in a statement.The plant, which manufactures tires for the domestic and international markets, directly employs around 1,149 workers.“With this result, it is proven that the vast majority of Goodyear workers decided personally, freely, directly and secretly to terminate the collective bargaining agreement held by the Miguel Trujillo Lopez union,” according to a statement from Mexico’s Labor Department.The Miguel Trujillo Lopez union is affiliated with the Confederation of Mexican Workers (CTM), one of the country’s largest labor organizations.CTM has been accused by labor critics of keeping worker wages low for decades across Mexico, according to the Associated Press. The union reportedly signed a collective bargaining agreement with Goodyear for worker salaries of $22 a day in San Luis Potosi.The USTR petition was filed under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) trade pact’s rapid response mechanism, focusing on the denial of specific labor rights. Enforcement efforts can result in additional tariffs or other import restrictions.Story continuesThe petition was reviewed by the U.S. Office of Trade and Labor Affairs, which said the Mexican government has 10 days to decide whether to conduct a review and 45 days to investigate the claims and to present its findings.The USMCA petition is based on a complaint by the independent Mexican trade union Liga Sindical Obrera Mexicana (LSOM) to the USTR, which accuses Goodyear of not respecting the provisions of the plant’s collective bargaining agreement with its workers, while also offering workers fewer benefits than available to other workers in the rubber industry in Mexico.“By rejecting the collective bargaining agreement, the workers at the Goodyear plant in San Luis Potosi have expressed their will,” Lee said. “We now expect Goodyear to treat its workers fairly and enforce the contract law.”Based in Akron, Ohio, Goodyear employs about 74,000 people globally and manufactures its products in 57 facilities in 23 countries.Watch: Werner Transportation loses appeal on $100 million judgment.Click for more FreightWaves articles by Noi Mahoney.More articles by Noi MahoneyMexican government urges Texas to halt truck inspections at borderTruckers threaten to boycott Florida over migrant crackdownCanadian town wins another court battle against illegal trucking operationThe post US wants labor rights investigation of Goodyear plant in Mexico appeared first on FreightWaves.]"

The same holds true for various sectors. After an extended bull market, there tends to be a price and time correction phase in various sectors.One secret to successful investing is to identify sectors that have been depressed for an extended period. Stocks in this sector tend to be undervalued, and once sentiments reverse, the rally can be massive. My focus in this column is on undervalued pharma stocks to buy.To put things into perspective, the S&amp;P Pharmaceuticals Select Industry Index has delivered total annualized returns of 3.83% in the last 10 years. For the same period, the S&amp;P 500 index has delivered total annualized returns of 11.68%. Clearly, the pharmaceutical sector has been a big underperformer.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsGiven the business developments, these pharma stocks can trend higher in the next few years. Overall returns are likely to beat index returns. Thus, it makes sense to consider some of the undervalued pharma stocks to buy for the portfolio.Pfizer (PFE)Pfizer logo on Pfizer building. Pfizer is an American pharmaceutical corporation.Source: Manuel Esteban / Shutterstock.comPfizer (NYSE:PFE) stock has been in a downtrend, but the correction seems to be overdone. At a forward price-earnings ratio of 10.9, PFE stock is massively undervalued. Additionally, the stock offers investors an attractive dividend yield of 4.4%.Through 2030, Pfizer has planned its growth strategy focusing on two areas. First, the company will continue to invest in research and development to deepen the product pipeline. Pfizer already has 101 potential drug candidates, with 12 drugs in the registration phase and 23 in phase three trials.As new products are launched, revenue growth is likely to be steady. Pfizer is targeting $20 billion in incremental revenue from new molecular entities by 2030. Furthermore, Pfizer has been active on the acquisition front in the last year. The company targets $25 billion in incremental revenue from new business developments through 2030.Story continuesWith these developments, PFE stock is poised for a reversal rally. I would hold with patience for the next 24 to 36 months for high total returns.AstraZeneca (AZN)Exterior of the AstraZeneca's manufacturing facility at SnackvikenSource: Roland Magnusson / Shutterstock.comAstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) is another undervalued pharma stock to buy for high total returns. In the last 12 months, the stock has been marginally higher by 13%. However, I believe that the best part of the rally is still to come. AZN stock also offers an attractive dividend yield of 2.6%.It’s worth noting that the company has guided for healthy revenue growth. Through 2025, AstraZeneca expects to deliver a low double-digit CAGR. Beyond this period, the company believes it’s poised for an industry-leading growth rate. If this holds, AZN stock is attractive at a forward price-earnings ratio of 20.2.I believe that the growth expectations are realistic. For 2023, AstraZeneca has a phase three pipeline of 30 drugs. Of this, the company believes that 10 drugs have blockbuster potential. The over pipeline currently stands at 178 projects. With a strong global presence and visibility for the continued launch of drugs, AstraZeneca has a bright outlook.Merck (MRK)Markel website homepage MRK stockSource: madamF / Shutterstock.comMerck (NYSE:MRK) is an undervalued quality pharma stock even after a 23% rally in the last 12 months. MRK stock trades at a forward price-earnings ratio of 16.5 and offers a dividend yield of 2.54%.In terms of growth, there are two catalysts. First, Merck has 30 programs in phase three and 80 in phase two. The late-stage clinical development program looks attractive and catalyzes revenue growth. It’s worth noting that Merck has invested $11.4 billion in research and development in the last 12 months. Significant R&amp;D investments will continue to boost the company’s late-stage pipeline.Further, Merck announced the acquisition of Prometheus Biosciences (NASDAQ:RXDX) for a consideration of $10.8 billion. The acquisition will boost the company’s presence in the immunology segment. With strong financial flexibility, inorganic growth will continue to support the company’s growth outlook.On the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

150,f3bb17c8-7a9f-3d38-af21-d5799238dce7,MOS,2023-05-24,Mosaic (NYSE:MOS) Is Investing Its Capital With Increasing Efficiency,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mosaic-nyse-mos-investing-capital-160243140.html,1684857763,STORY,['MOS'],"[If you're not sure where to start when looking for the next multi-bagger, there are a few key trends you should keep an eye out for. One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. And in light of that, the trends we're seeing at Mosaic's (NYSE:MOS) look very promising so lets take a look.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for Mosaic, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.24 = US$4.2b ÷ (US$23b - US$5.2b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).Therefore, Mosaic has an ROCE of 24%. In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Chemicals industry average of 11%. View our latest analysis for Mosaic roceIn the above chart we have measured Mosaic's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.How Are Returns Trending?Mosaic's ROCE growth is quite impressive. Looking at the data, we can see that even though capital employed in the business has remained relatively flat, the ROCE generated has risen by 671% over the last five years. Basically the business is generating higher returns from the same amount of capital and that is proof that there are improvements in the company's efficiencies. It's worth looking deeper into this though because while it's great that the business is more efficient, it might also mean that going forward the areas to invest internally for the organic growth are lacking.Story continuesFor the record though, there was a noticeable increase in the company's current liabilities over the period, so we would attribute some of the ROCE growth to that. Effectively this means that suppliers or short-term creditors are now funding 23% of the business, which is more than it was five years ago. It's worth keeping an eye on this because as the percentage of current liabilities to total assets increases, some aspects of risk also increase.The Bottom LineTo sum it up, Mosaic is collecting higher returns from the same amount of capital, and that's impressive. Considering the stock has delivered 35% to its stockholders over the last five years, it may be fair to think that investors aren't fully aware of the promising trends yet. So exploring more about this stock could uncover a good opportunity, if the valuation and other metrics stack up.If you want to know some of the risks facing Mosaic we've found 2 warning signs (1 is a bit concerning!) that you should be aware of before investing here.Mosaic is not the only stock earning high returns.

You can skip our detailed analysis of blue chip companies and dividend stocks, and go directly to read 5 Best Blue Chip Dividend Stocks To Buy. After recording one of its worst performances in 2022, the stock market has rebounded this year. The S&amp;P 500 and the tech-heavy NASDAQ both are delivering positive returns to shareholders this year, gaining 9.39% and 22.2%, respectively, as of May 23. This market rally has boosted investors’ confidence. According to a survey conducted by Bankrate in March, analysts expect the S&amp;P 500 to rise by 8% over the next four quarters. The survey also highlighted that 46% of the respondents believe that the bull market may begin in the second half of the year.Despite these positive signs, many investors still prefer to steer clear of risks and prefer safe stocks that pay dividends. Blue chip companies are generally regarded as more stable and less volatile than smaller or riskier investments. According to a report by Wall Street Journal, exchange-traded funds that specialize in quality stocks have grown to over $60 billion over the past few years. The same report also quoted Denise Chisholm, director of the quantitative market strategy at Fidelity Investments. She said that quality stocks have outperformed about 80% of the time in the past three decades during periods of economic downturn.In addition to their strong performance, many blue chip companies have a history of paying consistent dividends. Investors seeking regular income through dividends may consider these quality stocks as they often have the financial strength to maintain and increase dividend payments over time. In our article titled 25 Things Every Dividend Investor Should Know, we mentioned data that shows the strong performance of companies with strong dividend growth track records. Dividend Aristocrats, companies that have raised their payouts for over 25 years, delivered a 12.13% return to shareholders from 1990 to 2018, compared with a 9.96% return for the broader market during this period.Story continuesBest Blue Chip Dividend Stocks To BuyPhoto by Joshua Hoehne on UnsplashMedtronic plc (NYSE:MDT), NextEra Energy, Inc.

Per the terms of the deal, General Dynamics will provide long lead time material associated with the Virginia class submarines SSN 812 and SSN 813.A major portion of the work related to this contract will be carried out in Sunnyvale, CA.What’s Favoring General Dynamics?The changing dynamics of the military landscape and the rising geopolitical tension make it mandatory for a country to continuously evolve and strengthen its defense structure. The increased defense spending is mainly due to upgrading and improvising defense systems with technologically advanced features. Military submarines with enhanced undersea warfare capabilities form an integral part of any nation’s defense system.The increased focus on military submarines is likely to benefit General Dynamics as its Electric Boat business unit is a prime contractor of submarines.Looking ahead, General Dynamics, along with an industry partner, is currently working on Blocks IV and V in the Virginia Class program. The company has 17 Virginia-class submarines in its backlog, scheduled for delivery through 2032.Notably nine of the boats in Block V include the Virginia Payload Module, an 84-foot Electric Boat-designed-and-built hull section that adds four additional payload tubes, more than tripling the strike capacity of these submarines and providing unique capabilities to support special missions.Electric Boat is responsible for all aspects of design and engineering, leading the construction of Virginia-class attack submarines.

These contracts, in turn, are expected to boost the company’s growth.Story continuesPeer MovesNations are strengthening their defense capabilities.

The market rotation theme that helped last year’s losers become Q1’s winners also applied to last year’s winners becoming Q1’s losers. Both Cigna and NOC performed well during 2022’s market downturn as investors sought safety—each gaining more than 40% during the calendar year. The war in Ukraine was an additional tailwind for NOC’s shares. We were trimming our position into that relative strength. NOC remains well positioned, in our view, for the future of military spending due to its concentration in aerospace and limited exposure to the US Army. Further, the business has high exposure to classified bookings, which we believe means NOC is addressing the next generation of threats as opposed to “fighting the last war.” NOC’s financial condition is healthy, with an investment grade balance sheet and a strong fixed charge coverage ratio.

The stock is currently priced at US$306 on the market compared to my intrinsic value of $229.02. Not the best news for investors looking to buy! But, is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since ANSYS’s share price is quite volatile, this could mean it can sink lower (or rise even further) in the future, giving us another chance to invest. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.What does the future of ANSYS look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by 34% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for ANSYS. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has well and truly priced in ANSS’s positive outlook, with shares trading above its fair value. At this current price, shareholders may be asking a different question – should I sell? If you believe ANSS should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards its real value can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on ANSS for some time, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its true value, which means there’s no upside from mispricing. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for ANSS, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.With this in mind, we wouldn't consider investing in a stock unless we had a thorough understanding of the risks.

Following our prepared remarks, we'll open the call for questions. I'll now hand over to Benno.Story continuesBenno O. DorerHello, everyone. It's been nearly 6 months into my interim role as CEO of VF. I'm proud to be part of this beautiful company of the products that we create for our consumers, the difference we make to so many people's lives, to witness so many highly skilled and committed people create engaging styles and shopping experiences for our consumers and how people know, wear and love our brands on streets, trails and mountains around the world. Having an even deeper appreciation of VF's possibilities now, I'm incredibly optimistic about the company's future. I'm pleased to report that VF is stable, delivering against our commitments with strong discipline and making solid progress against our executional priorities. Today, I will build on themes introduced in February and highlight progress to sharpen our focus on the biggest consumer opportunities within our brand portfolio and on enhanced operational performance. I will cover 3 areas: First, an overview of VF's performance in Q4 fiscal year '23 and an update on work underway in pursuit of our near-term priorities; second, an outline of the primary objectives for fiscal year '24, which will be a year of transition and progress; and third, why I believe even more today in VF's unique value proposition and our plan to return to strong growth and long-term shareholder value creation. First, we delivered revenue and profits in line with guidance for Q4 to close out fiscal year '23, and we've made solid progress towards our priority areas of focus. Against the backdrop of continued challenging macroeconomic conditions, we grew full year revenue by 3% in constant dollars, with 10 out of our 12 global brands flat or growing revenue, 5 of them double digits, and delivered earnings per share of $2.10 at the midpoint of our guidance. Revenue in Q4 was flat in constant dollars. Some highlights from our quarter performance to close out the fiscal year. Outdoor saw ongoing strength, led by continued stellar performance at The North Face. Vans was down in Q4 as expected, but we saw encouraging green shoots from new product launches and our increased focus on maximizing existing product platforms. We delivered sequential improvement in both Dickies and Supreme, which stabilized in Q4 behind very strong growth in our key markets, Japan. EMEA continue to execute well with its eighth consecutive quarter of strong growth, and Greater China's emerging momentum coming out of Q3 accelerated with Q4 revenue returning to positive growth. The North Face continues to execute strongly with engaging marketing and a steady stream of innovative styles. Our core snow sports category was a standout in Q4, while the iconic Nuptse jacket continued its strong momentum. We saw further growth in trail running footwear, particularly behind our proprietary active technology, underlying the brand's significant opportunity in footwear. The North Face continues to resonate with a growing consumer base with the XPLR PASS adding over 1 million new members to surpass 18.5 million global members at the end of Q4. Shifting to the near-term priorities outlined in February. Importantly, our company's supply chain performance improved significantly and our work to turn around Vans is on track. We are on or ahead of plan on our work to restore excellence in the area of supply chain. In Q4, we reached our target to reduce inventory by about $300 million. And while it remains elevated, trends are good. We talked about our unsatisfactory customer service in Q3. I am pleased that our on-term performance has generally returned to target levels of full 2 quarters ahead of plan. And finally, while our costs remain elevated in Q4, our cost focus and planning discipline are starting to bear fruit, and we are on track to see lower costs in fiscal year '24. On Vans, there are some positive developments. Our 2 emerging product lines of focus, UltraRange and MTE were up 51% and 34%, respectively. We are just scratching the surface on these. We also demonstrated that we can energize Vans fan-based when we have meaningful product news. In Q4, we had a highly successful start of our retro inspired Knu Skool platform. This [Knu] shoe shows the potential to grow into a meaningful growth driver for Vans over time. Our global Vans Family membership grew to 28 million members by end of Q4, nearly twice the number from 2 years ago. Clearly, there is much work ahead of us, but they are encouraging signs for us to build on. My second message is that fiscal year '24 will be a year of transition and progress, positioning us to accelerate profitable growth in fiscal year '25 and beyond. We have an appropriately balanced plan in place for this fiscal year, considering our organizational transition. We will show progress in several areas with sensible revenue projections, increased marketing investment and a sharp focus on margin, leading to solid operating profit growth and cash flow generation. Here are some highlights from our 2 biggest brands. On Vans, we continue to expect the brand to return to growth during the course of the second half of the fiscal year. Importantly, Vans will return to profit growth for the full fiscal year and even ahead of its return to revenue growth, aided by cost savings and SKU simplification. The Vans team is operating with a great sense of urgency and projects are on track. We continue to strengthen our team. Our new brand campaign launched in April. We are sharpening our go-to-market process with a focus on digital. We will increase our product development investment in fiscal year '24, (inaudible) our new Pinnacle premium line at the Paris Fashion Show next month and aggressively drive UltraRange, MTE and new school, while seeding the style 93 Women's Sandal launch now for a full launch this fall. More innovation will follow. Our consumer understanding work is in progress, sharpening our focus later this calendar year, and we are improving our shopping experience with a significantly reduced SKU count throughout 2023. Moving on to The North Face. We are increasing product and marketing investments to support consumer acquisition, innovation and marketplace sell-through and the expansion of the brand into new adjacent categories based on the clear permission from consumers to do so. Regionally, our focus is to improve execution in the Americas. The first quarter will be difficult here as we work to regain the confidence of an already cautious set of U.S. wholesale customers [inability] to deliver full customer service after a difficult 2022 in that respect, but we should see significant improvements starting this fall. The recent appointment of Jen McLaren to a newly created role to lead our U.S. key account management will bring stronger focus as we work with customers to capitalize on the many available partnership opportunities that exist. We expect EMEA to be resilient and generate profitable revenue growth in fiscal year '24 behind its hallmark execution strength. And APAC is anticipated to grow double digits this fiscal year, which we will fuel with increased brand investments. What is important to us is that VF grows the right way, meaning profitably and sustainably, expanding margins and generating significant cash flow in fiscal year '24. To do so, while supporting strong investments in the business, we are leaning into the more profitable parts of the portfolio and implementing a strong cost savings plan with a more systematic and ongoing cross-functional approach to eliminate costs that have lower value to consumers. VF's fiscal year '24 will be about progress and focus on what we can control in a difficult macroeconomic environment. Steadily, methodically and with discipline, we will set the stage for an acceleration of value creation in fiscal year '25 and beyond. Finally, I'm more confident than I was even 6 months ago in VF's value proposition and our plan to return to strong growth and long-term shareholder value creation. VF's distinctive business model unites a portfolio of iconic and deeply loved brands in profitable, large and growing spaces with strong enterprise capabilities for speed, consistency and scale efficiencies. We have significant growth opportunities in APAC and particularly in Greater China, where we have strong category tailwinds and tremendous brand penetration upside. VF's enterprise capabilities in supply chain, digital and technology and international go-to-market platforms give us a competitive advantage, which we will fuel with strong investments in our brands and consumer capabilities. We are disciplined and dynamic capital allocators with a history of long-term value creation. Near term, we will invest in organic growth to maximize the potential of our unique portfolio, while returning to disciplined M&amp;A midterm to further strengthen our roster of brands. And we will continue to generate strong cash flow to reduce debt to target levels midterm and to return cash to shareholders through a competitive dividend. We believe that this is a solid long-term investment thesis, especially when combined with our clear plan to accelerate a return to profitable growth with strong operational discipline, an increase in product and marketing investments and an expansion in margins through cost savings and more differential portfolio management. Lastly, we remain strongly committed to our company's purpose, not just because it is the right thing to do, but also because it drives value for shareholders. In summary, I'm confident VF is well positioned to return to strong long-term shareholder value creation. Thank you. I'll now hand it over to Matt to talk through the financials.Matthew H. PuckettThank you, Benno, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to have delivered Q4 results in line with our guidance, but acknowledge we still have much to do to fulfill the full potential of the portfolio. The end of the fiscal year was characterized by an ongoing challenged macro environment, particularly in the U.S. The business continued to excel in certain areas. And importantly, we are seeing progress against our near-term priorities, although aspects of the business are still underperforming. During the fiscal year, revenue was up 3% in constant dollars, with growth in both wholesale and direct-to-consumer. Despite softer results in the Americas, we saw strong growth in The North Face. In Outdoor emerging brands, which saw growth of 12%, both in the quarter and the year and in the international business, highlighted by exceptional results in Europe and steady sequential recovery in the APAC region. Adjusted gross margin was down 220 basis points, and adjusted operating margin declined by 330 basis points, which led to adjusted earnings per share of $2.10 compared to $3.18 in fiscal year '22. As anticipated, liquidity was slightly above $3 billion at the end of Q4, benefiting from our Eurobond offering, but impacted during the year by lower earnings and a significant inventory build. I also want to mention the Supreme impairment of $313 million recorded in the quarter. The business performance was clearly uneven in fiscal '23. We are now planning more modest growth in fiscal '24 before accelerating in fiscal '25, benefiting from geographic expansion, the pace of which will begin to quicken starting this fall. We remain confident in the brand's long-term growth potential, which will benefit from increasing access to the brand through both geographic expansion and further penetration in current markets, along with product category extension opportunities with current consumers. Now diving into the fourth quarter results. Revenue performed in line with our expectations, flat in constant dollars, led by the international business up 8% and outstanding performance in The North Face. I'd be remiss not to mention that the brand grew by double digits across all channels and all regions on a global basis in fiscal year '23. Our Outdoor emerging brands continued to deliver strong performance and Dickies and Supreme had improving results relative to the third quarter. As anticipated, Vans was down 12% and Timberland declined by 6%. Adjusted gross margin was down 260 basis points and adjusted operating margins declined by 230 basis points, with adjusted EPS of $0.17 compared to Q4 fiscal '22 of $0.45. Taking a closer look at the regions in the fourth quarter, our results reflected a mixed performance across geographies. As expected, the Americas region was soft with revenue down 7% during the quarter. Americas results were particularly impacted at wholesale, where regular price distribution was down 17%. North America remained challenging advance, which declined 18% in Q4 in the region. Timberland was also muted in the quarter at down 6%, while Dickies showed improvement to down 4%. EMEA continued to deliver strong results, up 8% in Q4, reflecting growth from most brands in the quarter and from all brands on a full year basis. While we are starting to see some impact from macro pressures on consumer spending, most countries saw continued revenue growth in the fourth quarter and all grew for the fiscal year. EMEA's revenue was up 12% for the year while delivering strong profitability. Last but not least, we were encouraged to see our business in APAC further strengthen and show sequential progress in Q4 with revenue up 10%, driven by a return to positive growth in Greater China in the quarter, which was also up 10%. In particular, The North Face delivered a standout performance in Greater China, up nearly 40% as the brand continues to fuel demand with the local consumer and achieve high sales productivity amidst the recovering marketplace environment. Across the rest of the region, we saw broad-based growth in major markets during the quarter. Further unpacking operating performance, Q4 gross margin was down 260 basis points. As expected, business mix remained a positive contributor to margin in the quarter of 60 basis points, driven primarily by the growth of our international business. This was more than offset by rate, down 310 basis points, due to the impact of a more promotional environment, transactional FX and higher product costs, partially offset by strategic pricing actions. Moving on to adjusted operating margin, which was down 230 basis points in the fourth quarter, reflecting the impact of the lower gross margin, partially offset by 50 basis points of SG&amp;A leverage. SG&amp;A declined slightly in the quarter as higher distribution costs and investments in advertising were more than offset by lower general and administrative costs, along with realized gains on sales of assets. Also negatively impacting the comparison was 30 basis points of FX. Now to share an update on the supply chain environment. We've seen some stabilization in the operating environment since Q3. And as Benno mentioned earlier in the call, some initial signs of improvement are visible since taking aggressive action to return to our hallmark standard of excellence in this area. As we outlined in February, we are returning to a more rigorous approach to planning and coordination between brand operations, sales and finance leaders, which is benefiting our inventory management and forecast accuracy as we progress through future seasons. While we're still continuing with the impact on the business today from higher lead times affecting our planning and buying calendar last year, manufacturing and freight times are now consistently trending down and contributing to better on-time performance and improved customer service with the arrival of Spring product. Further on logistics, we've seen reliability rates continue to improve, although they still remain below historical levels. And collectively, these trends are expected to continue as we move toward the important back-to-school and fall holiday seasons. We are well on track to achieving our goal outlined last quarter of returning to our targeted on-time performance rates and service levels by the first half of the fiscal year. The Houston cost of air freight is now more normalized. At the same time, ocean rates are coming down, and we'll see additional benefits moving into fiscal year '24. FOB inflation remains a factor, but it has moderated to a lower rate for both raw materials and labor costs. We have strategic pricing actions planned in fiscal '24 that will continue to be an offset to these increases. Now a few words on inventory. We achieved the forecasted reduction signaled in February of $299 million during Q4. At the end of the quarter, net inventory was up 62% versus last year, which reflects the continued higher amount of core carryover replenishment inventory, particularly at The North Face and Dickies. Excluding the increase relating to the change in eco terms to support the supply chain financing program implemented in Q1 of fiscal '23, inventory was up $620 million or 46%, a moderation from the year-over increase of 75% at the end of Q3. Moving on to the outlook for this fiscal year, which we expect to be a year of progress as we both continue to advance towards achieving our long-term goals and navigate a set of near-term macro and micro challenges. Revenue of flat to up slightly reflects the following: a growing direct-to-consumer business globally and in the U.S.; a modest decline in the Americas for the year behind a weaker U.S. wholesale business in an increasingly challenging environment; a cautious posture by most retail partners and the effects of our supply chain missteps from last fall. We expect growth in Europe for the year, although we do anticipate some deceleration considering our evolved view of macro pressures, and continued progressive improvement in China, which we've seen gain momentum in recent quarters and expect that to continue. We anticipate gross margin to be up at least 100 basis points, reflecting lower promotions, which we expect to trend toward more historical levels beginning in the fall season with benefits from mix, lower freight costs and strategic pricing actions, all partially offset by higher FOB costs and FX transaction headwinds. Operating margin will expand, reflecting the higher gross margin supporting targeted investments in our largest value-creating opportunities, namely The North Face and advance turnaround. We have continued to invest in key capabilities and support momentum within the portfolio, particularly in the areas of innovation and demand creation, while exercising careful cost management in light of the ongoing challenged macro environment. Earnings per share is expected to be in the $2.05 to $2.25 range, which includes more than $0.30 of negative impact from higher interest, unfavorable foreign currency affecting operating results, normalized incentive compensation and a modestly higher tax rate. To further help shape fiscal '24, I want to provide some operational guardrails related to our Q1 expectations. Largely in line with the revenue curve we anticipated in February, we expect Q1 to be down high single digits in constant dollars. Notably, VF reported its strongest quarter of last year in Q1 at plus 7%, it's wholesale was plus 18%. This is exacerbated by wholesale shipment timing that benefited Q1 of fiscal '23 due to supply chain unpredictability at that time. With Q1 being our smallest quarter, results are also subject to greater volatility. In addition, we have an unfavorable brand mix in the quarter with a bigger (inaudible), which will have a disproportionate impact from U.S. wholesale as we expect the brand's revenue to be particularly affected by a continuation of lower wholesale sales in the spring season as we work to right size inventories. As anticipated, we expect wholesale across the (inaudible) pressure through the first half of the fiscal year, particularly in the U.S., which will impact all of our brands with a meaningful U.S. wholesale penetration. While gross margin is expected to be similar year-over-year in the quarter, SG&amp;A will deleverage from the revenue decline, which will pressure operating margins. This performance in Q1 has been anticipated and is contemplated within our expectations for fiscal year '24. Now moving back to the full year. Our free cash flow is expected to be about $900 million, driven by growth in EBITDA and a reduction in working capital, primarily from activities to further right size inventory levels as we migrate through fiscal year '24. We continue to expect inventory to be near to normalized levels by the end of the calendar year and fully recovered by fiscal year-end, down more than 10% year-over-year at the end of fiscal year '24. These 2 benefits will be offset by higher tax payments and interest. Noteworthy and as continuously contemplated, the $900 million of free cash flow includes the impact of anticipated tax payments of approximately $290 million relating to intercompany IP transfers completed in a prior period. VF's strong anticipated cash generation supported by decisive actions we've already taken and will continue to take will ensure a path towards deleverage over the next 24 months. And specific to the balance sheet and expected cash evolution for fiscal '24, we ended this year with about $3 billion in liquidity. And throughout the year, we anticipate using our free cash flow to pay off debt and continue to return cash to shareholders through the dividend, which we project will result in liquidity of at least $2.5 billion at fiscal year-end. Now a brief update on the Timberland tax appeal of the tax court decision regarding the tax treatment of the acquisition of Timberland in 2011. The U.S. government filed a brief on May 4, and we'll be filing our response to this brief in early June. We and the government have requested an oral hearing of the case, which we expect will be granted for this fall. In summary, our focus is clearer than ever on the road ahead. Fiscal year '24 will be a year of progress, where we'll advance our key strategic priorities as we continue to focus on the consistent execution of our plans. We will deliver improved operating performance and financial results, fueled by an expansion in gross margins, EBITDA growth and strong cash generation, all of which supports our path to delever and strengthen our balance sheet. Fiscal year '23 was certainly a challenging year in our business and for our teams. But I'm consistently impressed by the resilience and strength of our more than 30,000 associates, which further increases my confidence in the actions we have implemented to enable VF to generate long-term, sustainable and profitable growth beginning in fiscal year '24. With that, we'll now open the line to your questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from the line of Abbie Zvejnieks with Piper Sandler.Abigail Virginia ZvejnieksSo I guess, just can you talk a little bit about the wholesale behavior in the U.S.? I mean it sounds like next quarter will be challenging from both the footwear and apparel perspective. Can you just really talk about the differences, I guess, between what you're seeing in footwear with both Vans and Timberland and the difference between that and North Face? And then I guess, complement to that, how willing are retailers then to take on like new product advance since that will be driving kind of the second half growth?Matthew H. PuckettAbbie, I'll start that one and certainly, Benno can add if he wants to on the new product in particular. I would say, overall, the environment generally is challenging, right? I think that's well understood. In the near term, I would say, I'd highlight kind of 2 main issues for us. Certainly, the macro wholesale partners generally taking a more cautious approach to order book. That's certainly prevalent in the U.S. But beyond in Europe, we're seeing some of that as well. And as they think about the fall order book positions, they're being very cautious and very careful. And certainly coming off of a year last year where inventories got distorted way too high and created a really heavy promotional environment, certainly reacting to that, I think, is one thing. And then I think just a general kind of cautious tone around consumer. But for us, at VF, we're also dealing with, quite honestly, the effects certainly in our first half of our own missteps from fall last year. Our supply chain in fall of '22 didn't perform to the level that we expect and kind of our own expectations and our own bar. And -- but we'll largely be past that now moving over the next couple of quarters. And. certainly, as we move toward the holiday sales season, we'll be in a much better place. As it relates to footwear versus apparel, I don't think we're seeing a discernible difference in terms of how retailers are responding. And I would say, generally speaking, to answer your question, certainly, a new compelling, interesting product, they're always eager to understand what we have to offer there and willing to take those things because that certainly helps from a traffic driving perspective.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Brooke Roach with Goldman Sachs.Brooke Siler RoachCan you talk to the confidence that you have in the drivers of margin inflection forecasted in your outlook today against a choppy macro? What levers do you still have to pull if the consumer environment gets weaker? And Matt, can you quantify your expectation for each of the moving pieces in gross margin, particularly the lower promotional effect that you're anticipating in the back half?Matthew H. PuckettYes, certainly, Brooke. I would say gross margin up at least 100 basis points is certainly the biggest driver of margin expansion as we look at fiscal '24. As I unpack that, a moderating promotional environment is assumed to some degree, beginning from fall, I would say, beginning from fall, not back to, I would say, normal levels, but certainly moderating and improving from there. And we have a lot of confidence in that, especially kind of in terms of our view and visibility to where we think inventories will be positioned, certainly our own inventories, but the market itself. So that's a good guide for us. I think we're being fairly cautious in our projection of that, but that's -- that's a big part of the gross margin increase. That's certainly not getting recovering everything we lost this year. We talked about significant reductions in margin over the last couple of quarters being heavily driven by promotions. So while some improvement, not all of it, business mix will continue to be a benefit. Think about that kind of in the 0.5 a point range. I think it's fair on a full year basis. And then we've got the benefit of lower freight costs coming into the margins and strategic price increases, which will largely offset continued higher FOBs, although moderating, and some foreign currency headwinds inside of product cost. But gross margin clearly is the big driver for us. SG&amp;A will be fairly cautious in terms of how we think about spending as we move through the year, given the environment. But we're continuing to drive. It's becoming kind of a routine discipline here as part of our revised and I would say revamped planning process in some way to really get after cost savings on an ongoing basis. So we're never stopping there, and we're looking for ways to reduce cost to funnel investments back towards the consumer and quite honestly, back towards the things that are working.Brooke Siler RoachAnd if I could just follow up, can you provide a little bit more color on your leverage targets and actions that you're taking to strengthen the balance sheet throughout the year?Matthew H. PuckettYes. So accelerating our path towards our target leverage, which is 2.5x gross over time, that work is one of our top priorities and certainly a focus of our capital allocation. So the next couple of years, it's a heavy emphasis. We're going to generate strong free cash flow this year, and we'll use that to pay -- we'll pay a dividend as we announced a continuation of the dividend, but more commensurate and in line with our policy of kind of a 50% payout target. And then beyond that, we'll pay down debt. The drivers of free cash flow going to be consistent EBITDA growth. Certainly, good progress in '24. I expect to see that further accelerating beyond their big working capital benefits this year, both from an inventory unwind standpoint, but also we've got a benefit in accounts payable as we get the full anniversary of the terms change that we put into place over the last few months and a continued sharpened focus on capital investments. We expect to spend about $200 million this year on CapEx, which is a little lower than our kind of long-term average spend and really all geared towards the consumer. So those are the things we're thinking about. I would expect at the end of this year, our gross leverage would be under 4x and our net would be in the mid-3s and then kind of sequentially similar kind of progress as you move into fiscal '25.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Paul Lejuez with Citigroup.Paul Lawrence LejuezCurious if you can talk about what you're seeing in your DTC channel for each brand? And how that compares to the sell-through that you're seeing at the wholesale channel? And then one other, just bigger picture. You guys have purchased businesses, you've spun off businesses, you've done both of those things. I'm curious where your heads are at in terms of whether or not you're in the mindset of still acquiring more at some point or maybe likely to sell or spend something off?Matthew H. PuckettYes, I'll take the first part and let Benno talk about the second part of your question. DTC is a growth driver for us and will continue to be. It's approaching 50% of the business, certainly, and over time, we expect will be half of the business and beyond as we think about our long-term plan. Q4 was another strong result overall and consistent with the last couple of quarters, up low single digits. And despite the challenges at Vans and to some degree, the choppiness that we've seen over the last few quarters in China. So we're really seeing good results across most of the portfolio. That will continue. And we're benefiting from the investments that we've made in DTC. And I think about digital and data analytics, brand loyalty programs, consumer insights, a sharper focus on ROI, the omni capabilities, so we feel good about the progress that we're making and the opportunity here that will be further fueled as Vans begins to turn around its business later this year. As it relates to wholesale and sell-through, I mean, we're continually seeing consistently good results in the businesses that are consistently performing. Vans has been challenged. And I think we -- continues to be that way in its classic products in many cases. But (inaudible) and strengthened, obviously, by newness and some of the things that we've put into place. And Benno talked about some of those things in his prepared comments. But I think the underlying sell-through in the businesses that are performing is pretty consistent across DTC and wholesale.Benno O. DorerThen Paul, regarding M&amp;A. So near term, clearly, we're focused on organic growth to pay down debt. Also, that's based on the belief that M&amp;A should come on top of a strong operating performance, and we're in the process of making significant progress on that. And then we'll turn M&amp;A back on once we're close to target debt, we certainly want to get bigger, not smaller. We feel like we're in an attractive space with a lot of interesting targets. And our promise to our investors is that we're going to continue to do M&amp;A with a lot of discipline. We're looking for a sustained growth, margin accretive growth and ongoing consumer tailwinds. So near term, it's all about organic growth investments and then M&amp;A, we'll turn back on mid-term.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Laurent Vasilescu with BNP Paribas.Laurent Andre VasilescuIn your press release, you talked about how 10 of the 12 brands were flat or actually grew for fiscal year '23. A lot of us model for -- at least for the big 4 brands. Can you maybe just give us some context of just how we should think about at least the 4 big brands so we can get confidence around the full year guide? And then maybe just, Matt, if you can give a little bit of shape of the curve of the year, how should it unfold by quarter? And then I have a follow-up question.Matthew H. PuckettOkay. Thanks, Laurent. Great to talk to you. First off, let me just click up in terms of your question about brands and the outlook. We've got a realistic plan. It's not an easy external environment certainly in the near term, but we've got a lot of confidence in the things that we're doing. The initiatives and the actions we've been driving are working and many parts of our portfolio are performing. The North Face consistently is delivering outstanding results. Our EMEA business has grown strongly for the last several years, including 12% in fiscal '23. Our direct-to-consumer business, we continue to make investments is consistently growing. Our operational execution continues to improve with better planning now firmly in place and impacting the go forward. Our supply chain performance improved a lot in Q4 with better on-time performance and customer service. We met our guidance now for the last couple of quarters, including a large inventory reduction here recently. We took decisive actions to strengthen our financial position and have a clear plan to reduce our leverage levels, as I talked about. The right work against our strategy at Vans is progressing and will lead to that business starting to turn around later this year. We've got a powerful portfolio of brands positioned to benefit from strong and growing tailwind marketplaces. And our 30,000 associates around the world are consistently delivering the things that are necessary to win in the marketplace today and set us up for growth into the future. So our plan is working, we're on track. We feel really good about where we are and the direction that we're heading and the opportunity ahead. And from an outlook standpoint, that kind of summarizes how we think about it. Your question is a little more specifically. It certainly was in -- I laid out some of the assumptions, which are probably more channel-based and macro and the like. But The North Face momentum [will] continue. We'll continue to have really good results there. It's not immune to some of the wholesale challenges that we mentioned in the short term in the U.S. to a lesser degree, but to some degree, in Europe. We said we expect Vans to return to growth during the course of the second half. We're going to see improving results in both Supreme and Dickies. And in both of those brands, we expect to grow, and we'll continue to see good performance in the Outdoor emerging brands and as we begin to even evolve our operating model there to accelerate value creation in those brands. As it relates to the curve, Q1 will clearly be the toughest compare versus last year and also probably most severely and acutely impacted by kind of the rightsizing of inventories in the wholesale channel and the actions that wholesale partners are taking. So that will begin to ease and sequentially improve. And then it will be, I think, a more consistent performance as we move kind of in the latter part of the year. But clearly, Q1 will be a bit more challenged.Laurent Andre VasilescuVery helpful, Matt. And just a quick follow-up. I'm Just curious to know how the permanent CEO search is progressing. Should we anticipate some news at some point this summer? Or should we anticipate it for later this fall?Benno O. DorerI'm not going to give better forecast, but we said 6 to 12 months, and now we're still short of 6 months. It's a rigorous process. We're casting on -- we have cast through (inaudible), internal candidates, external candidates. The process consists of interviews and leadership assessments. What I can say is that we make strong -- we are making strong progress. What I also can say is that my confidence in the ability to hire great new CEO has never been higher. We'll update you when the news is ready. And in the meantime, as you hopefully can see from today's report, this team is stable, very committed and engaged. And the business progress is very solid as is our progress on engaging the organization. So the goal here is to find the right CEO, not a fast CEO, and we're very much on track to deliver that in the time that -- in the time range that we talked about at the beginning of this process.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Janine Stichter with BTIG.Janine Marie Hoffman StichterOn Vans returning to growth in the back half of the year, I want to know how we should think about the pacing in terms of DTC versus wholesale? And then I know you tested some changes to the storage business for Vans in terms of reduced SKUs and some of the in-store merchandising. I want to get an update on what you were seeing there in terms of early reads?Benno O. DorerYes, Janine, thanks for that. So as you think about the fiscal year, what we've commented on is that we'll return to sales growth sometime during the course of the back half, but that will be growing profit in the full year, even ahead of sales growth. That's what we predicted in February. That's what we're predicting today. So the plan is really unchanged. And the work is on track and executed with great sense of urgency. As you think about DTC versus wholesale, we certainly expect DTC to grow quite a bit ahead of wholesale, given the issues that Matt reported on, which affect Vans, but frankly affect our whole industry. But in DTC, you should see the movement earliest, and you should see growth in the channel for the fiscal year. Everything else, all the work, including SKU simplification, is on track. We are rolling out a new store layout with improved merchandising, and we will be done with that by the end of 2023. And we expect the SKU count by the end of fiscal year '24 to be about 30% lower than what it was at the end of fiscal year '23, all very consistent with what we talked about, all very consistent. All focused on product and consumer engagement, on productivity, on organization, on cost efficiencies, all on track and proceeding with a great sense of urgency.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Bob Drbul with Guggenheim.Robert Scott DrbulI was just hoping that you could elaborate a little bit more on China, either by brand sort of Q4 into Q1, just what you're seeing there? I know you said, I think, double digit for the year for '24. But if you could maybe just address some of the recent performance and really how you're feeling within what you're seeing, that would be great? And then just a second quick question is just on Supreme. I know you wrote some -- you took a write-down $300-some million. Just how you feel about that business and sort of what you're really seeing real time with the strength of the brand at this point?Matthew H. PuckettYes, feeling bullish about China. As we turn to growth in Q4 at plus 10%, let's recall, in Q3, it was minus 10%, so a positive inflection. The North Face might not surprise you, is also leading a growth year, was up nearly 40% in Q4. And we certainly expect continued momentum in fiscal year '24. First, we have a lot of under-penetrated brands with a tremendous amount of upside. Second, there's a lot of category tailwinds with government support. And three, we're certainly also reaping the benefits of our own focus. As you probably know, we've moved our headquarter to Shanghai for the region with a local leader in that city. We have more localized innovation and marketing plans, and we're certainly investing to fuel into that long-term growth opportunities. So very bullish about [Greater] China and feel very good about where we stand and what it will do for the business in fiscal year '24. Supreme, the best way that I would describe it is, it remains a great brand and acquisition. There's no doubt about it. We saw sequential improvement in Q4, which is good. And we're expecting growth from the business margin accretive growth for the company in fiscal year '24. And we're very confident in our grow-wide strategy. We call that our goal is to increase global access to the brand from today, 20% of global consumers to 40% in 3 years. And there are 3 strategic pillars behind it: First, grow brand awareness; second, expand the new categories, including footwear; and last but not least, geographic expansion with keen (inaudible) and focus on Asia. The key to that is store openings, which, of course, is the key -- the big reason why our performance, as Matt said earlier, was perhaps a little more uneven in the last couple of years. We've done very little of that, given COVID, but we'll reaccelerate that work. Stores are performing really well. Our best market is Japan these days, which is growing strongly, and it's no surprise that that's also the market where we have the most stores, even more stores than in the United States. We recently entered the Beijing market and that store is performing well. The latest store openings in the U.S. in Los Angeles, where we've moved the previous location and in Chicago performing well. And we're now focused on opening more markets in Asia. So long-term growth tailwinds on a great brand with a lot of opportunities ahead.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Adrienne Yih with Barclays.Adrienne Eugenia Yih-TennantBenno, my question is on sort of the wholesale business in general. Clearly, last year, the retailers were kind of building up safety stock, and I think that's what that you were referring to kind of destocking. Is this -- should we think about it as sort of the normalization of kind of the timing shift that happened last year? And it would seem that after we go through this next 4 quarters, that by this time next year, right, the retail channel has to grow sales, and they would be back on potentially buying flat to up. So if you can just kind of help contextualize that. And then, Matt, with regards to the promo comment, 2 things. When did you strategically raise prices? I think it was maybe fall of last year. And are you already seeing sort of reduced pricing concessions or any of that type of thing for the back-to-school or fall order book that gives you comfort?Benno O. DorerYes. Thank you. I'll take the one on U.S. wholesale. I think we've commented on this. Customers clearly a little cautious. Everybody is sitting on higher inventories so that will depress the business short term for everybody in our categories. And I think a particular challenge that we have at VF is that we're dealing with the hangover from our 2022 customer service issues. We have to regain the customer's confidence back in our ability to fully meet their needs and that's sort of a wait and see. We think that, that's going to certainly have a negative impact during the first half of the fiscal year, where we'll see a very [market] difference between DTC and a more cautious outlook on wholesale. And then as we get to the back half of the fiscal year, we expect the 2 to move more in line, and we expect a significant recovery in U.S. wholesale and certainly continued strength in the DTC channel.Matthew H. PuckettYes. If I understood your pricing question, I'll answer what I think I heard if I'm not capturing it, you can let me know. But we took quite a bit of pricing action this past year. I think we talked about mid-single-digit price increases kind of broadly speaking, broad based. I would tell you, at the end of the day, probably 95% of what we planned occurred. So those price increases went into the market and have stuck and products generally have performed, notwithstanding kind of the overall macro. But in terms of the evaluation of the individual products themselves, we feel really good with what we got done there. We're a little bit more modest this year in terms of price increases, not as broad based I would suggest and probably more in the low single digit, a couple of percent range is what we've got baked in. So kind of more normalized. That's about what we see on a normal year. So price increases this year are certainly a little bit lower. But yes, we feel good about what we've gotten done there. And we have a rigorous process, as we've talked about a lot in terms of how we do this work and how we make those decisions. So we feel good about how that will play out.Adrienne Eugenia Yih-TennantOkay. And then the second part of that was just the confidence in promos. Is that coming from the DTC business and evidence there? Or are you actually giving fewer kind of pricing concessions on the fall/back-to-school kind of orders?Matthew H. PuckettYes, yes. Well, I think it's both, right? We are giving fewer concessions at this stage. I mean, we're seeing the order books stick. And our expectation moving into the fall season is that we won't have the issues. Remember, our issues were exaggerated last year. We were late. We were -- honestly, we were late on delivering product and particularly in the Outdoor segment. Our Outdoor brands, in particular, suffered there, and we had to offer a lot of additional pricing concessions to get product in and on the floor. We won't have to do that this year. We're well positioned. Our supply chain is in a good place, and we fully expect it will be on time or even maybe above our targets from a kind of service level perspective. So we've got our normal expectation of discounts and maybe a little bit of excess to give us some room. But overall, we feel good. And certainly, to your point, DTC, which is nearly half the business, fully in our control, and we feel good about how we've got that positioned, both from an inventory and a merchandise plan standpoint.Benno O. DorerYes we're building on Matt's point. So clearly, as inventories ease up in the category, it is very consistent with past behavior that the promotions are lower, that's what we're assuming. That said, we assume that promotions are still elevated from '22. We think that's prudent. We're also not assuming that we're recapturing the full margin benefit from the higher '22 promotions. So this is another example of being financially prudent and disciplined and having a balanced plan that gives us room to react should things get worse, but also room to do a lot better if things perhaps saw a little friendlier than we currently assume. So we think our plan is straight down the middle with perhaps a slight eye on being conservative.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Gabby Carbone with Deutsche Bank.Gabriella Olivia CarboneI just want to follow up on Vans. You mentioned some big growth numbers for [Altra] and MTE. How do you view the opportunity to build those franchises? And what do you think is making them so successful?Benno O. DorerCould you repeat the very last question, please -- the very last part of your question. I did not get that.Gabriella Olivia CarboneYes, just how do you view the opportunity to build those franchises? What do you think is making them so successful?Benno O. DorerYes. So as we analyze where we stand with the consumer, which is what we've done a lot of over the last 6 months, we realized that there's a big opportunity taking franchises that are out there but have a very low awareness to the next level. And that's why there's a bullish on MTE and on Ultra Vans. Awareness generally on both platforms, even though they've been around for several years, hovers at around 10% and even loyalist advance show awareness of below 30% on those 2. So what we're focused on, in general, in Vans is to tell fewer bigger stories and dedicate ourselves more to platforms, an MTE and UltraRange are 2. So we're building awareness, and we're backing it up with new products and news, and we're reintroducing these platforms to consumers, and that's what's working. UltraRange plus 51%, MTE plus 34%. And they're both part of what we call Progression, and Progression is about 30% of Vans. So these absolutely have the potential to be very meaningful for the brand in the future. And that's perhaps the model, this platform approach and building awareness over a longer period of time that we're also applying with new schools, which we've seeded in Q4 very successful, sold out within 2 weeks. We are leaning into inventory and think that could be meaningful. And just this last week, we began [seeding] a new women's sandal. We call it Style 93 that is going to see a full launch this fall. And we're also very bullish about this and the ability to turn into a meaningful platform. So this is a change in how we treat new products. Fewer stories, bigger stories backed with more money over a longer period of time in order to make them more sticky. This is a good approach that's showing some really strong green shoots as a proof point that we're effectively able to engage consumers when we have relevant product news, and we tell stories in an engaging way.OperatorAnd our last question will be from Jim Duffy with Stifel.James Vincent DuffyI'm hoping you can speak more on the inventory posture. What's the carryover seasonal inventory composition? Can you give some directional commentary on how inventories mix between brands and regions? And then maybe if you could give us a sense for purchase orders for new receipts? I presume that down meaningfully versus a year ago. Can you perhaps give us an order of magnitude on that?Matthew H. PuckettJim, inventory, we said we're going to reduce inventory in Q4, and we did that. So we feel good about kind of having our arms around what we're going to get done here. We continue to carry higher levels of core and carryover in excess, much of which is in The North Face and Dickies, to a much lesser degree, honestly, in Timberland and Vans. And I've said -- we've said a few times, we're comfortable carrying this into '24 because we've got plans to consume this inventory within kind of normal planned assortments across channels through the balance of spring and then really into fall holiday. So that's -- yes, that doesn't give us a lot of concern. I mean, certainly, I'd rather not have that inventory and rather have that cash and manage it differently, but we'll be able to work our way through that. I mentioned, I think, in my prepared comments up about $600 million or $620 million x in transit at the end of the year, which equated to 46%. To give you a little bit of color there, about 15% of that increase of that $620 million is what I call prior season discontinued product, all right? So that's a number, right, not nothing, but it's not unmanageable at all and will be sold primarily through our own outlets and at normal intervals in the excess channel as we normally would. So we've got plans to move through this inventory. We're on track, as we'd laid out a few months ago, to reduce inventory levels, to reduce days of supply while protecting brand equity. And we'll continue to do that over the next few quarters. We expect to make strong product -- strong progress by the middle of our fiscal year with inventories actually inflecting and declining at that point, near to normalized levels by the end of the calendar year and really kind of fully recovered by the end of the fiscal year. And I would suggest down more than 10% year-over-year at that point in time. So that kind of gives you a little bit of the glide path of how we're thinking about it. Hopefully, that's helpful.James Vincent DuffyIt is. Can you comment on the purchase orders for new receipt?Matthew H. PuckettRight. No, you're right. Purchase orders are down. I'm not going to quantify that, but they're down. If you think about a reduction of inventory of a little over 10%, what that means from a COGS consumption standpoint, you can kind of do the math there and tie that into -- tie that into what we've laid out in terms of -- from a revenue standpoint, flat to up low single with some improving margins. All that adds up to a fairly meaningful reduction in purchases for sure.OperatorAnd we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the call back over to Benno Dorer for closing remarks.Benno O. DorerThank you all for joining us today. We appreciate you. I look forward to speaking with you again in early August when we'll report fiscal year '24 Q1 earnings. And until then, please be well and be safe. Take good care.OperatorAnd this concludes today's conference, and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.]"

Seana.SEANA SMITH: Akiko, a number of names for you here. We have Urban Outfitters, Toll Brothers, Palo Alto Networks, and VF Corp. Kicking off with Urban Outfitters, we're looking at a gain of nearly 8% here in extended trading. The company beating on both the top and bottom line. The strength really from Anthropology and Free People.Getting into some of those comp sales numbers. Free People was up 17% from a year ago. Anthropology up 13%. Also, Urban Outfitters making some progress when it comes to inventory. The inventory levels were off just about 6% on a year over year basis. This retailer has been an outperformer since the start of the year, up nearly 12% over the last year, up about 36%.Flipping over to Toll Brothers. Giving us another picture of the homebuilders. Now that stock up just about 3% here. Pretty strong numbers from the company. They boosted their full year delivery guidance for the second quarter. They also beat expectations. Revenue was up 10% from a year ago.Their CEO Doug Yearley was saying in this release that it is a healthier demand environment, very similar to what we have been talking about when it comes to the homebuilders. And they're seeing that demand from the second quarter, from their fiscal second quarter continuing into their fiscal third quarter here. So certainly welcome news here for shareholders. Year to date, the stock is up nearly 28%.Cybersecurity play Palo Alto Networks. That stock up about 4% in extended trading. The company beating the Street's expectations. Billing growth of 26%. They also reiterated their full-year guidance, adding to those gains that we've seen of just about 36% since January 1. And VF Corp, the retailer.Now, this is a name that has north face's in some of their brands. Vans as well, that's up about 4% here. One of the standouts in this report was Vans. The company is starting to see some progress in their turnaround efforts with that brand. They do expect Vans to return to growth in the second half of the year.When it comes to their most recent quarter results, the adjusted earnings did beat revenue coming in line with expectations. Again, you're looking at a pop of about 4% which is very welcomed because that stock off over 30% so far this year.]"

This release also refers to ""constant dollar"" amounts, which exclude the impact of translating foreign currencies into U.S. dollars. Reconciliations of GAAP measures to constant currency amounts are presented in the supplemental financial information included with this release, which identifies and quantifies all excluded items, and provides management’s view of why this information is useful to investors.Discontinued Operations - Occupational Workwear BusinessOn June 28, 2021, VF completed the sale of its Occupational Workwear business. The Occupational Workwear business was comprised primarily of the following brands and businesses: Red Kap®, VF Solutions®, Bulwark®, Workrite®, Walls®, Terra®, Kodiak®, Work Authority® and Horace Small®. The business also included a license for certain Dickies® occupational workwear products that were historically sold through the business-to-business channel. Accordingly, the company has reported the operating results and cash flows of the business in discontinued operations for all periods through the date of sale.Adjusted Amounts - Excluding Transaction and Deal Related Activities, Costs Related to Specified Strategic Business Decisions, Noncash Impairment Charges, Pension Settlement Charge and a Tax ItemThe adjusted amounts in this release exclude transaction and deal related activities associated with the acquisition of the Supreme® brand. Total transaction and deal related activities include integration costs of approximately $0.3 million in fiscal 2023.The adjusted amounts in this release exclude costs related to VF's business model transformation primarily driven by Corporate actions and resulting restructuring costs, and a transformation initiative for our Asia-Pacific regional operations. Total costs were approximately $72 million in fiscal 2023.The adjusted amounts in this release exclude noncash impairment charges related to the Supreme® reporting unit goodwill and indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset of approximately $313 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 and $735 million in fiscal 2023.

The impairment charges in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 related to lower financial projections and increased risk of achieving management's forecasts.The adjusted amounts in this release exclude a noncash pension settlement charge. The pension settlement charge resulted from the purchase of a group annuity contract, which was an action taken to streamline administration, manage financial risk associated with pension plans, and to transfer a portion of the liability associated with VF's U.S. pension plan to an insurance company. Total expense was approximately $92 million in fiscal 2023.The adjusted amounts in this release exclude a discrete tax benefit of approximately $95 million in fiscal 2023 related to a favorable adjustment to VF's transition tax liability pursuant to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act based on examinations by the IRS.Combined, the above items negatively impacted earnings per share by $0.72 during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 and $1.79 during fiscal 2023. All adjusted amounts referenced herein exclude the effects of these amounts.Reconciliations of measures calculated in accordance with GAAP to adjusted amounts are presented in the supplemental financial information included with this release, which identifies and quantifies all excluded items, and provides management’s view of why this information is useful to investors.

Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations affect the amounts reported by VF from translating its foreign revenues and expenses into U.S. dollars. These rate fluctuations can have a significant effect on reported operating results. As a supplement to our reported operating results, we present constant currency financial information, which is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes the impact of translating foreign currencies into U.S. dollars.

The second quarter impairment charges were driven by non-operating factors including higher interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations. The fourth quarter impairment charges were related to lower financial projections and increased risk of achieving management's forecasts.A noncash pension settlement charge of $91.8 million was recorded in the Other income (expense), net line item during the twelve months ended March 2023. The pension settlement charge resulted from the purchase of a group annuity contract, which was an action taken to streamline administration, manage financial risk associated with pension plans, and to transfer a portion of the liability associated with VF's U.S. pension plan to an insurance company.The impairment and pension settlement charges resulted in a net tax benefit of $32.0 million and $92.2 million in the three and twelve months ended March 2023, respectively.(d) Tax item includes a $94.9 million discrete tax benefit recognized during the twelve months ended March 2023 related to the Internal Revenue Service examinations for tax year 2017 and short-tax year 2018 resulting in a favorable adjustment to VF's transition tax liability under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.(e) Amounts shown in the table have been calculated using unrounded numbers.

Click to skip ahead and see the 5 Best Spring Stocks To Buy Now.If historical trends are anything to go by (and they usually are), then financial stocks like Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), as well as a wide range of energy stocks will be some of the best stocks to buy this spring.The Running of the Spring BullsThe stock market has traditionally performed very well during the spring, which is then followed by a summer swoon as institutional investors like hedge funds pare back their holdings in anticipation of lower summer trading volumes (and the resultant spike in volatility) and more time off for staff.That’s particularly true of the NYSE, with April and May being the index’s strongest and third-strongest months over the past 20 years. The index has posted monthly gains during April over 16 of the past 20 years, while the index has risen during 14 of the past 20 Mays.It’s a similar story when it comes to the stocks that make up the S&amp;P 500, which have posted gains during 14 of the past 20 Marchs, 15 of the past 20 Mays, and 16 of the past 20 Aprils, the latter being the strongest performing month for the index. Spring has also been a good season for tech stocks, with the Nasdaq posting gains over 13 of the past 20 years in each of March, April, and May, ranking them in a tie as the third-best performing months for the index.Energy and Finance Stocks Do a Lot of Spring Cleaning (Up)When it comes to the performance of specific industries, energy and finance stocks have often been the runaway spring winners. According to CNBC, between 2001 and 2010, nearly half of all stocks that posted at least 20% gains during any given spring were either finance or energy stocks, with finance stocks leading the way.There’s a surprisingly strong historical correlation between the energy and financial sectors which makes their equally strong springs somewhat less surprising. Naturally, the energy sector is highly correlated with the price of West Texas crude, at 71%. What many investors may not know is that it’s also highly correlated with the finance sector, with the correlation between the S&amp;P 500 energy and finance indexes standing at 70% according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Story continuesIn terms of where the two sectors stand today, they’re somewhat at odds despite their strong stock market correlation. The banking sector is experiencing somewhat of a crisis, with many U.S. banks borrowing heavily but tightening their lending policies, which has some experts concerned about a forthcoming credit crunch.On the other hand, the energy sector looks like it has the potential to outperform the broader market for a third straight year in 2023 thanks to oil prices that are expected to steady but also rise this year, impressive free cash flow yields, and the lowest P/E ratio among all S&amp;P 500 sectors.With that in mind, let’s take a look at 12 spring stocks to buy now.12 Best Spring Stocks To Buy NowSource:unsplashOur MethodologyThe companies in the following list of the best spring stocks to buy now are gathered from the finance and energy sectors, traditionally the strongest performing sectors during the spring, and then ranked based on hedge fund sentiment. We follow a select group of hedge funds because Insider Monkey’s research has uncovered that their consensus stock picks can deliver outstanding returns.All hedge fund data is based on the exclusive group of 900+ funds tracked by Insider Monkey that filed 13Fs for the Q1 2023 reporting period.12 Best Spring Stocks To Buy Now12. Schlumberger Limited (NYSE:SLB)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 68 JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), and PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) are a few of the stocks that appear poised for strong springs. Another is oilfield services giant Schlumberger Limited (NYSE:SLB), which is coming off an exceptional 2022, growing revenue by 23% to $28.1 billion, including a 25% rise in services revenue. Earnings per share jumped by 70% to $2.18, while the company generated an impressive $3.7 billion in free cash flow.Schlumberger Limited (NYSE:SLB) believes the macro backdrop suggests a strong multi-year upcycle for the sector is ongoing, which should only increase the demand for Schlumberger’s services as investment in the space continues to pick up and new projects are launched.With things looking up over the longer term, Schlumberger has begun returning more cash to shareholders through buybacks and dividend hikes, though on the latter front, its dividend yield of 2.18% is still rather light compared to the industry average.VGI Partners made the following comment about Schlumberger Limited (NYSE:SLB) in its 2022 annual investor letter:“In addition to defence, we have focused our efforts on other new sectors where we see structural growth, including energy and medical technology. The long-term outlook for energy looks highly attractive given many years of under-investment and more recently amplified by ESG constraints and corporate discipline. Although we reviewed commodity owners (where we leveraged the expertise of the Regal resources team), we focused our efforts on the second derivative – the oil service companies. These are the picks-and-shovels of the industry and arguably the highest-quality way to gain exposure. As a result, we invested in Schlumberger Limited (NYSE:SLB) earlier this year and grew this to a circa 8% weight during the year (now circa 3%)”11. The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 70 The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) ranks as the 11th best spring stock to buy now and should be of particular interest to value investors. The company ranked third on our list of the Most Profitable Value Stocks Now after pulling in $8.79 in GAAP EPS during the first quarter, beating estimates by $0.69. Revenue did fall year-over-year however and analysts were mixed on the quarterly results.The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) is undertaking several initiatives to deal with the challenging macro environment, including the partial sale of its Marcus unsecured loan portfolio. With the pace of fundraising expected to slow throughout the rest of the year, the company is also scaling back its share repurchase program.Manole Capital Management discussed The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS)’s partnership with Apple in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Back in 2019, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) made a splash in the card industry by working with Apple and MasterCard on a credit card. The actual card is fairly sleek (as you can see below), as customers names are etched into an Apple titanium card. The no-fee card generated a lot of hype, as many early users were quick to post their latest card on various social media sites.The initial goal of Marcus (back in 2016) was to leverage Goldman’s wonderful name brand and build a full-service digital bank. This card was a large piece of GS’s ambitions to grow its retail banking franchise called Marcus. After 5 years, Marcus now has 14 million customers and $16 billion in loan balances. Surprisingly, Marcus now represents nearly 20% of the firm’s total revenue.We thought it would be interesting to look how the Apple Card is doing in terms of loans and exposures. With over $100 billion in assets, this has been a successful source of cheap deposits for GS. Despite having an institutional / “white shoe” brand in the investment banking and trading world, GS’s Apple Card has been a disappointment.” (Click here to read the full text)10. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 74 Hedge fund ownership of Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) has dipped by 14% over the past year after hitting a 10-year high in the first quarter of 2022. The company’s shareholders have been pressuring it to consider abandoning its fossil fuel investments, or at the very least to look into the potential costs of abandoning them versus the financial risks those investments could incur if the world achieves net-zero emissions by 2050. Exxon plans to invest as much as $25 billion annually over the next few years on various energy projects.While Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) believes the net-zero initiative is unlikely to succeed, it’s nonetheless looking into other ways to diversify into renewables, including the recent purchase of a 120,000-acre tract of land in Arkansas that’s believed to be rich in lithium. The company has also been expanding its EV charging network.First Eagle Investments Global Fund likes some of the other things Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) has been doing with its cash, as relayed in the fund’s Q2 2022 investor letter:“Integrated oil and gas giant Exxon Mobil performed well in the second quarter as continued high prices for energy products supported the stock. As the largest refiner in the US, the company has benefitted from wide “crack spreads,” or the margin between the cost of crude oil and the petroleum products extracted from it. Exxon continues to invest in refining capacity in the US, which industrywide has been in steady decline since 2019. We are pleased that Exxon has been using its strong cash flows to reduce debt and to return cash to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases.”9. ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 75 Hedge funds have been swarming into ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) in recent quarters, with ownership of the stock jumping by 50% since Q3 of 2021, which helped push the stock up to ninth on the list of top spring stocks to buy now. Steve Cohen’s Point72 Asset Management opened a new COP stake in Q1, while Louis Bacon’s Moore Global Investments did so in the fourth quarter of last year.ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) achieved record production of 1,792 MBOED in the first quarter beat earnings estimates by over 10% at $2.38. That could be just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to company’s earnings potential, as it recently unveiled a 10-year plan in which it projects to generate $225 billion in free cash flow at a modest West Texas price point of $60 per barrel. After accounting for capital expense during that timeframe, that could leave it with $100 billion or more in excess cash, the bulk of which will likely be returned to shareholders.Oakmark Global Fund revealed why it believes ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) shares to be undervalued in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) is one of the largest and lowest cost U.S. exploration and production companies in the country, led by CEO Ryan Lance—in our view one of the best value creators in the industry. ConocoPhillips’s share prices fell in the first quarter as oil prices receded, which is not atypical. We were buying the company at prices where it could generate its entire market cap in free cash flow over the next decade while growing the production such that at the end of that time, the base of production would be one-third higher. This sort of reinvestment opportunity is unique to ConocoPhillips and clearly not reflected in the current share price.”8. American Express Company (NYSE:AXP)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 79 The number of hedge funds long American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) hit a 10-year high in the first quarter and has risen in each of the past three quarters. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway maintained its gargantuan AXP holding during Q1, owning nearly 152 million AXP shares worth over $25 billion as of March 31.American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) was one of ten companies with “Great” Earnings Reports Jim Cramer is Talking About after the company grew revenue by 21.7% year-over-year to $14.3 billion, though its EPS of $2.40 missed estimates. Cramer characterized it as “a gigantic quarter with tremendous growth”.Some analysts weren’t quite as bullish on the results however. BMO Capital lowered its price target on American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) to $185 from $194, noting that the company’s growth is moderating while its credit losses are on the rise. Piper Sandler also lowered its price target on the stock, dropping it to $172 from $179, given expectations that comps will become more challenging later this year and into 2024 as consumer leverage rises.7. Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 81 Hedge funds continued to sell off Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) during Q1, with the number of funds long Citigroup falling for the 16th time in the last 21 quarters. Ownership of the stock has fallen by 37% during that time. Citigroup is another finance stock that Warren Buffett loves, while Lee Ainslie’s Maverick Capital was at the other end of the spectrum, selling off its Citi stake during Q1.Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) appears to be rather attractive from several standpoints, including its industry-low price-to-book ratio of 0.43x and its moderate price-to-earnings ratio of 6.39x. While Citi hasn’t raised its dividend payout in four years and still has a relatively high payout ratio compared to the industry average despite that, the company is expected to begin repurchasing shares again later this year.Diamond Hill Long-Short Fund noted that some of Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C)’s initiatives may be dilutive to the company’s earnings in the near-term as of the fund’s Q1 2022 investor letter:“Shares of Citigroup declined in the quarter as investors became increasingly negative on capital markets activity. The company is also continuing to divest certain consumer banking geographies which may be dilutive to earnings in the near term.”6. Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 85 Closing out the first part of our list of the best spring stocks to buy now is Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC). Several hedge funds bailed on Wells Fargo in the first quarter, including Warren Buffett, who otherwise maintains high conviction in several other finance stocks. The company nonetheless ranks as one of hedge funds’ top five picks among investment banks.Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC) bought back $4 billion worth of shares in Q1 and appears poised to continue buying back shares in the coming quarters. CEO Charlie Scharf recently stated that the company feels good about the size of its buffer zone above the regulatory minimums required to be held by banks to balance out their risk-weighted assets, which would allow them to continue buying back shares while otherwise remaining fiscally prudent.Davis New York Venture Fund is impressed by the resiliency of Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC)’s customers, as expressed in the fund’s 2022 annual investor letter:“Our investment thesis for our next largest bank investment, Wells Fargo, is totally different. As is well known, Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC) is the country’s third-largest bank, serving one in three U.S. households. Years of regulatory missteps under prior managements resulted in reputational damage, higher-than-average expenses, numerous consent orders, caps on asset growth, all added to the negative impact of low rates on their interest income. However, where others see bad news, we see resiliency and gradual improvement. Wells Fargo’s resiliency is reflected in the fact that despite years of terrible headlines and congressional hearings, Wells Fargo’s core customers stayed put and customer attrition remains extraordinarily low.As to gradual improvement, new management has made steady headway in closing consent orders, settling regulatory matters and upgrading systems. Thus, rather than increasing profits from growth, Wells Fargo’s earnings growth for the next three-to-five years should come from the combined tailwinds of rising interest income, partially offset by normalizing credit costs, reduced expenses as systems improve and the scandals of the last decade are gradually put behind them, and the return of excess capital through share repurchases and rising dividends. The hypothetical earnings bridge displayed in Figure 6 gives some sense of the earnings power we see unfolding in the years ahead for this durable financial franchise.While our grounded optimism carries the day, we are mindful of the risk that Wells Fargo’s historically excellent credit culture may have deteriorated, or that exasperated regulators may choose to extract even more major penalties for past infractions.” PayPal Holdings, Inc.

At the same time, signs of gradual economic deterioration can be seen. These were the key messages delivered by its top management on Investor Day.The primary update was the rise in net interest income (NII) guidance by $3 billion to reach approximately $84 billion for 2023. The reason for this jump in target is the acquisition of First Republic Bank, which was seized by the regulators after massive deposit outflows.This $84 billion NII represents almost a 26% year-over-year surge. This is in contrast to many other lenders like Bank of America BAC and Wells Fargo WFC, which are projecting modest NII growth this year, given the rise in deposit cost and gradually waning loan demand due to higher interest rates.Bank of America projects NII (FTE) to grow in the range of 7-8% this year, while Wells Fargo is anticipating a 10% increase. Hence, the huge rise in NII for JPMorgan stands out and will be a major catalyst.Management reiterated that the FRC deal will generate almost $500 million of “incremental net income” annually. This doesn’t include nearly $2 billion of post-tax restructuring charges anticipated this year and in 2024.Further, the transaction will help fast-track its strategy to serve affluent clients and hugely complement JPM’s wealth management business. Though the company plans to close some of the FRC branches where it already has a presence, it intends to expand the retail branches. It targets having 70% of the U.S. population (up from the current 60%) within a 10-minute drive to the branch.Jennifer Roberts, CEO of consumer banking, said, “You will see us build more branches then [than] we close resulting in a modestly larger branch network over time.”The company plans to spend almost $15.7 billion in investment growth opportunities this year, with major focus on technology (nearly 50% of this expenses), hiring, marketing and digital data &amp; AI. This is up almost 15% from last year’s spend on similar expansion efforts.JPMorgan anticipates a $3.5 billion (including integration-related charges) rise in non-interest expenses due to the FRC transaction. So, this brings total expenses to $84.5 billion for 2023, up roughly 11% year over year.The company expects to pay the Federal Deposit Insurance Fund a special assessment of approximately $3 billion to help absorb the losses from the seizures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in March. Several other large and mid-sized banks, including BAC and WFC, will also be helping to cover those costs.Additionally, the company provided guidance for investment banking (IB) and markets revenues, which are expected to be down 15% in the first half of 2023. Management expects a slight improvement in the same in the back half of the year. JPMorgan's chief operating officer Daniel Pinto, noted, “We have a period now of low volatility, but I don't think that that situation will stay for the rest of the year.”JPMorgan has been witnessing muted IB performance amid an industry-wide slump, while markets revenues have been offering some support.Story continuesConclusionDespite the near-term headwinds, JPM is expected to keep benefiting from higher rates, modest loan demand, strategic acquisitions, business diversification efforts, strong liquidity position and initiatives to expand the branch network.The current Investor Day provided more details as to how the company plans to expand and grow bigger.  Going forward, JPMorgan will be able to leverage its size to improve its market share across the businesses.Shares of JPMorgan have gained 2.9% so far this year against the industry’s decline of 9.3%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCurrently, JPM carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

This program consists of four trials evaluating the same in adults who are obese or overweight and have one or more comorbidities.Among these trials, OASIS 1 is a 68-week efficacy and safety trial comparing once-daily oral semaglutide 50 mg for weight management versus placebo in 667 adults with obesity or overweight with one or more comorbidities.The study achieved its primary endpoint, with people showing statistically significant and superior weight loss at week 68 with oral semaglutide 50 mg compared with placebo.People treated with oral semaglutide 50 mg achieved a statistically significant weight loss of 17.4% after 68 weeks compared with a 1.8% reduction with placebo when evaluating the effects of treatment, provided all people adhered to treatment. Additionally, 89.2% of those who received oral semaglutide 50 mg were able to attain a weight loss of 5% or more after 68 weeks compared with only 24.5% with a placebo.Oral semaglutide 50 mg was found to have a safe and well-tolerated profile in the study and most common adverse events were gastrointestinal, which were most prominent during dose escalation. Majority of the adversities were mild to moderate, weaned off over time and were consistent with the GLP-1 receptor agonist class.

NVO also has another approved drug, Saxenda (liraglutide), for obesity care.Novo Nordisk's first-quarter 2023 earnings matched estimates while revenues miss the same. Ozempic (semaglutide injection for type 2 diabetes) and Rybelsus have experienced great traction in the market since launch.Shares of Pfizer PFE surged on May 22, 2023, following the publication of encouraging data on the investigational drug danuglipron for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and obesity in the JAMA Network medical journal. In a phase II randomized clinical study in 411 adults with type 2 diabetes, danuglipron reduced glycated hemoglobin and fasting plasma glucose (at all doses) and body weight (at the highest doses) at week 16 compared with placebo.Investors were impressed as the weight loss observed with Pfizer’s danuglipron is of a similar magnitude to that observed in the phase II data for oral semaglutide.Novo Nordisk currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Other top-ranked stocks in the healthcare sector include Novartis NVS and Ligand Pharmaceuticals LGND.

The data showed that danuglipron reduced glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) at all dose levels studied and reduced body weight at doses of 80 mg or more twice daily compared with placebo. The data showed that patients treated with danuglipron lost about 10 pounds over the course of 16 weeks. Novo Nordisk’s Ozempic, a once-daily pre-filled insulin pen, showed a similar weight loss of about 9.9 pounds but over 30 weeks in a similar study.Novo Nordisk’s Ozempic is currently approved in the United States at 0.5 mg, 1.0 mg and 2.0 mg for the treatment of type II diabetes in adults. Novo Nordisk’s weight loss injection, Wegovy, which was approved by the FDA in June 2021, is the injectable formulation of semaglutide, the same ingredient that is approved as Ozempic for treating type II diabetes.Danuglipron is an orally administered, small molecule glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonist. Currently available GLP-1R agonists require subcutaneous administration or strict fasting requirements. In the study, danuglipron’s efficacy and safety profile was consistent with currently available GLP-1R agonists. However, it did not require any subcutaneous administration nor were there any fasting restrictions, the press release mentioned.This year so far, Pfizer’s stock has declined 24.4% against an increase of 2.6% for the industry.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOzempic is seeing strong demand trends and has witnessed a solid uptake so far. Sales of the drug were up 59% at a constant exchange rate (CER) in the first quarter of 2023. Wegovy sales were up 211% at CER in the first quarter. Novo Nordisk expects sales of Ozempic and Wegovy to pick up in 2023.Story continuesOn Monday, Novo Nordisk also released data from a phase III study, OASIS 1, which evaluated a once-daily oral formulation of semaglutide in obesity. In the study, oral semaglutide 50 mg achieved 17.4% weight loss at week 68 compared to a reduction of 1.8% with placebo. The weight loss is comparable to that achieved by Wegovy, which is a weekly injection for treating obesity. Novo Nordisk expects to file for regulatory approval of oral semaglutide for obesity in the United States and the EU in 2023If danuglipron is successful in further studies and eventually approved, it can enjoy strong demand trends as the demand for weight loss drugs is huge and rising. Also, danuglipron is an oral pill versus weekly injections with Ozempic/Wegovy, which is an easier-to-use formulation.In this context, it is important to mention Eli Lilly’s LLY Mounjaro/tirzepatide, a dual GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist (GIP/GLP-1 RA), which was launched last year for type II diabetes. Mounjaro is also approved in Europe and Japan. Mounjaro also showed superior weight-loss reduction in clinical studies for the obesity indication. Lilly has initiated a rolling submission in the United States for tirzepatide in obesity that is expected to be completed soon while a regulatory application has already been filed in the EU.The product is generating impressive sales and already benefiting from strong demand trends for type II diabetes. It is expected to be a key long-term top-line driver for Lilly as it has the potential to be approved for obesity and other diabetes-related diseases.Zacks RankPfizer currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Fox The ModelWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$1.53bUS$1.75bUS$2.14bUS$1.89bUS$1.22bUS$1.14bUS$1.09bUS$1.07bUS$1.06bUS$1.06bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x12Analyst x13Analyst x11Analyst x3Analyst x2Est @ -6.73%Est @ -4.08%Est @ -2.22%Est @ -0.92%Est @ -0.01% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.3% US$1.4kUS$1.5kUS$1.7kUS$1.4kUS$818US$704US$623US$563US$515US$475(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$9.7bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.3%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.1b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (8.3%– 2.1%) = US$17bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$17b÷ ( 1 + 8.3%)10= US$7.8bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$17b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$31.3, the company appears about fair value at a 9.5% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Fox as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.047. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for FoxStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is not viewed as a risk.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Media market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result.

Tucker Carlson parted ways with the network shortly after his commentary regarding former President Donald Trump came to light during Fox’s trial with Dominion.Once Carlson departed Fox, loyal viewers left the show in droves, resulting in a tanking stock price. In fact, Fox Corporation (NASDAQ:FOX) stock lost 5% of its value, or $962 million, in just one day.However, there are a few conservative stocks to buy that have the potential to be great long-term plays. Check out these conservative stocks below and why you should consider adding them to your portfolio.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsSinclair Broadcast Group (SBGI)n this photo illustration the Sinclair Broadcast Group (SGBI) logo seen displayed on a smartphoneSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.comSinclair Broadcast Group (NASDAQ:SBGI) is the second-largest television station operator in the U.S., with 185 stations in 86 markets. It owns approximately 600 channels, with 150 of those being associated with major news networks like ABC, FOX, NBC and CBS.While it has exposure to Fox News, it’s also diversified among other channels that cater to more liberal audiences like NBC. It provides exposure to various channels, which minimizes risk if one channel’s stock should see a steep decline.At the time of writing, SBGI stock is currently trading at roughly $17, which is moderately above its 52-week low of $12.64. It has an impressive 6% forward dividend yield and has been increasing its dividend since 2017. This stock is profitable and growing since it has a healthy return on equity of 30.21% and a net profit margin of 7.32%. While this is one of the better Tucker Carlson stocks, investors should also be mindful of its relatively high debt-to-equity ratio of 4.91.Rumble (RUM)Illustrative Editorial of RUMBLE.COM website homepage. RUMBLE (RUM) logo visible on display screen.Source: II.studio / Shutterstock.comRumble (NASDAQ:RUM) is a free video-sharing program that allows users to watch, share, like and comment on each others’ content. They can also upload their own videos and subscribe to creator content similar to on YouTube. Unlike YouTube, however, this Tucker Carlson stock caters to a more conservative audience and prides itself on creating technology that is “immune to cancel culture.”Story continuesWhile Tucker Carlson’s departure caused this stock to lose $235 million of its value, it still has room to run. Its current price is about $10, which is between its 52-week low of $5.81 and 52-week high of $17.23. Rumble is trying to attract a more conservative audience that would likely be looking for alternative news sources. This conservative stock is seeing significant growth. Its three-year revenue growth is 127.15. It also has minimal debt, with a debt-to-equity ratio of roughly 0.01. Despite this conservative stock’s potential, it still hasn’t turned a profit yet. New York Times (NYT)A photo of a person reading the Feb. 16, 2020 issue of the New York Times.Source: pio3 / Shutterstock.comThe New York Times (NYSE:NYT) is known for its trademark newspaper, The New York Times. Aside from the domestic version, it also offers an international version as well as digital properties, including several smartphone apps. Unlike Fox, this is a stock that caters to a more liberal audience. However, disillusioned former Fox viewers could even turn to this outlet for their daily news given its strong reputation.At nearly $37 at the time of writing, it’s smack dab in the middle of its 52-week low of $27.59 and high of $42.40. This stock has room to run since its revenue grew from $1,783.64 to $2,331.64 (millions) from 2019-2023. Besides having room for growth, this stock is relatively stable since it has no debt, a respectable return on equity of 12.48 and a 8.21% net profit margin. Investors can also take advantage of its 1.2% forward dividend yield.On the date of publication, Dalton Brewster did not have (either directly or indirectly) and positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Click to skip ahead and see the 5 Best Spring Stocks To Buy Now.If historical trends are anything to go by (and they usually are), then financial stocks like Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), as well as a wide range of energy stocks will be some of the best stocks to buy this spring.The Running of the Spring BullsThe stock market has traditionally performed very well during the spring, which is then followed by a summer swoon as institutional investors like hedge funds pare back their holdings in anticipation of lower summer trading volumes (and the resultant spike in volatility) and more time off for staff.That’s particularly true of the NYSE, with April and May being the index’s strongest and third-strongest months over the past 20 years. The index has posted monthly gains during April over 16 of the past 20 years, while the index has risen during 14 of the past 20 Mays.It’s a similar story when it comes to the stocks that make up the S&amp;P 500, which have posted gains during 14 of the past 20 Marchs, 15 of the past 20 Mays, and 16 of the past 20 Aprils, the latter being the strongest performing month for the index. Spring has also been a good season for tech stocks, with the Nasdaq posting gains over 13 of the past 20 years in each of March, April, and May, ranking them in a tie as the third-best performing months for the index.Energy and Finance Stocks Do a Lot of Spring Cleaning (Up)When it comes to the performance of specific industries, energy and finance stocks have often been the runaway spring winners. According to CNBC, between 2001 and 2010, nearly half of all stocks that posted at least 20% gains during any given spring were either finance or energy stocks, with finance stocks leading the way.There’s a surprisingly strong historical correlation between the energy and financial sectors which makes their equally strong springs somewhat less surprising. Naturally, the energy sector is highly correlated with the price of West Texas crude, at 71%. What many investors may not know is that it’s also highly correlated with the finance sector, with the correlation between the S&amp;P 500 energy and finance indexes standing at 70% according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Story continuesIn terms of where the two sectors stand today, they’re somewhat at odds despite their strong stock market correlation. The banking sector is experiencing somewhat of a crisis, with many U.S. banks borrowing heavily but tightening their lending policies, which has some experts concerned about a forthcoming credit crunch.On the other hand, the energy sector looks like it has the potential to outperform the broader market for a third straight year in 2023 thanks to oil prices that are expected to steady but also rise this year, impressive free cash flow yields, and the lowest P/E ratio among all S&amp;P 500 sectors.With that in mind, let’s take a look at 12 spring stocks to buy now.12 Best Spring Stocks To Buy NowSource:unsplashOur MethodologyThe companies in the following list of the best spring stocks to buy now are gathered from the finance and energy sectors, traditionally the strongest performing sectors during the spring, and then ranked based on hedge fund sentiment. We follow a select group of hedge funds because Insider Monkey’s research has uncovered that their consensus stock picks can deliver outstanding returns.All hedge fund data is based on the exclusive group of 900+ funds tracked by Insider Monkey that filed 13Fs for the Q1 2023 reporting period.12 Best Spring Stocks To Buy Now12. Schlumberger Limited (NYSE:SLB)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 68 JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), and PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) are a few of the stocks that appear poised for strong springs. Another is oilfield services giant Schlumberger Limited (NYSE:SLB), which is coming off an exceptional 2022, growing revenue by 23% to $28.1 billion, including a 25% rise in services revenue. Earnings per share jumped by 70% to $2.18, while the company generated an impressive $3.7 billion in free cash flow.Schlumberger Limited (NYSE:SLB) believes the macro backdrop suggests a strong multi-year upcycle for the sector is ongoing, which should only increase the demand for Schlumberger’s services as investment in the space continues to pick up and new projects are launched.With things looking up over the longer term, Schlumberger has begun returning more cash to shareholders through buybacks and dividend hikes, though on the latter front, its dividend yield of 2.18% is still rather light compared to the industry average.VGI Partners made the following comment about Schlumberger Limited (NYSE:SLB) in its 2022 annual investor letter:“In addition to defence, we have focused our efforts on other new sectors where we see structural growth, including energy and medical technology. The long-term outlook for energy looks highly attractive given many years of under-investment and more recently amplified by ESG constraints and corporate discipline. Although we reviewed commodity owners (where we leveraged the expertise of the Regal resources team), we focused our efforts on the second derivative – the oil service companies. These are the picks-and-shovels of the industry and arguably the highest-quality way to gain exposure. As a result, we invested in Schlumberger Limited (NYSE:SLB) earlier this year and grew this to a circa 8% weight during the year (now circa 3%)”11. The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 70 The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) ranks as the 11th best spring stock to buy now and should be of particular interest to value investors. The company ranked third on our list of the Most Profitable Value Stocks Now after pulling in $8.79 in GAAP EPS during the first quarter, beating estimates by $0.69. Revenue did fall year-over-year however and analysts were mixed on the quarterly results.The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) is undertaking several initiatives to deal with the challenging macro environment, including the partial sale of its Marcus unsecured loan portfolio. With the pace of fundraising expected to slow throughout the rest of the year, the company is also scaling back its share repurchase program.Manole Capital Management discussed The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS)’s partnership with Apple in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Back in 2019, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) made a splash in the card industry by working with Apple and MasterCard on a credit card. The actual card is fairly sleek (as you can see below), as customers names are etched into an Apple titanium card. The no-fee card generated a lot of hype, as many early users were quick to post their latest card on various social media sites.The initial goal of Marcus (back in 2016) was to leverage Goldman’s wonderful name brand and build a full-service digital bank. This card was a large piece of GS’s ambitions to grow its retail banking franchise called Marcus. After 5 years, Marcus now has 14 million customers and $16 billion in loan balances. Surprisingly, Marcus now represents nearly 20% of the firm’s total revenue.We thought it would be interesting to look how the Apple Card is doing in terms of loans and exposures. With over $100 billion in assets, this has been a successful source of cheap deposits for GS. Despite having an institutional / “white shoe” brand in the investment banking and trading world, GS’s Apple Card has been a disappointment.” (Click here to read the full text)10. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 74 Hedge fund ownership of Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) has dipped by 14% over the past year after hitting a 10-year high in the first quarter of 2022. The company’s shareholders have been pressuring it to consider abandoning its fossil fuel investments, or at the very least to look into the potential costs of abandoning them versus the financial risks those investments could incur if the world achieves net-zero emissions by 2050. Exxon plans to invest as much as $25 billion annually over the next few years on various energy projects.While Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) believes the net-zero initiative is unlikely to succeed, it’s nonetheless looking into other ways to diversify into renewables, including the recent purchase of a 120,000-acre tract of land in Arkansas that’s believed to be rich in lithium. The company has also been expanding its EV charging network.First Eagle Investments Global Fund likes some of the other things Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) has been doing with its cash, as relayed in the fund’s Q2 2022 investor letter:“Integrated oil and gas giant Exxon Mobil performed well in the second quarter as continued high prices for energy products supported the stock. As the largest refiner in the US, the company has benefitted from wide “crack spreads,” or the margin between the cost of crude oil and the petroleum products extracted from it. Exxon continues to invest in refining capacity in the US, which industrywide has been in steady decline since 2019. We are pleased that Exxon has been using its strong cash flows to reduce debt and to return cash to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases.”9. ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 75 Hedge funds have been swarming into ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) in recent quarters, with ownership of the stock jumping by 50% since Q3 of 2021, which helped push the stock up to ninth on the list of top spring stocks to buy now. Steve Cohen’s Point72 Asset Management opened a new COP stake in Q1, while Louis Bacon’s Moore Global Investments did so in the fourth quarter of last year.ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) achieved record production of 1,792 MBOED in the first quarter beat earnings estimates by over 10% at $2.38. That could be just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to company’s earnings potential, as it recently unveiled a 10-year plan in which it projects to generate $225 billion in free cash flow at a modest West Texas price point of $60 per barrel. After accounting for capital expense during that timeframe, that could leave it with $100 billion or more in excess cash, the bulk of which will likely be returned to shareholders.Oakmark Global Fund revealed why it believes ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) shares to be undervalued in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) is one of the largest and lowest cost U.S. exploration and production companies in the country, led by CEO Ryan Lance—in our view one of the best value creators in the industry. ConocoPhillips’s share prices fell in the first quarter as oil prices receded, which is not atypical. We were buying the company at prices where it could generate its entire market cap in free cash flow over the next decade while growing the production such that at the end of that time, the base of production would be one-third higher. This sort of reinvestment opportunity is unique to ConocoPhillips and clearly not reflected in the current share price.”8. American Express Company (NYSE:AXP)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 79 The number of hedge funds long American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) hit a 10-year high in the first quarter and has risen in each of the past three quarters. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway maintained its gargantuan AXP holding during Q1, owning nearly 152 million AXP shares worth over $25 billion as of March 31.American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) was one of ten companies with “Great” Earnings Reports Jim Cramer is Talking About after the company grew revenue by 21.7% year-over-year to $14.3 billion, though its EPS of $2.40 missed estimates. Cramer characterized it as “a gigantic quarter with tremendous growth”.Some analysts weren’t quite as bullish on the results however. BMO Capital lowered its price target on American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) to $185 from $194, noting that the company’s growth is moderating while its credit losses are on the rise. Piper Sandler also lowered its price target on the stock, dropping it to $172 from $179, given expectations that comps will become more challenging later this year and into 2024 as consumer leverage rises.7. Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 81 Hedge funds continued to sell off Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) during Q1, with the number of funds long Citigroup falling for the 16th time in the last 21 quarters. Ownership of the stock has fallen by 37% during that time. Citigroup is another finance stock that Warren Buffett loves, while Lee Ainslie’s Maverick Capital was at the other end of the spectrum, selling off its Citi stake during Q1.Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) appears to be rather attractive from several standpoints, including its industry-low price-to-book ratio of 0.43x and its moderate price-to-earnings ratio of 6.39x. While Citi hasn’t raised its dividend payout in four years and still has a relatively high payout ratio compared to the industry average despite that, the company is expected to begin repurchasing shares again later this year.Diamond Hill Long-Short Fund noted that some of Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C)’s initiatives may be dilutive to the company’s earnings in the near-term as of the fund’s Q1 2022 investor letter:“Shares of Citigroup declined in the quarter as investors became increasingly negative on capital markets activity. The company is also continuing to divest certain consumer banking geographies which may be dilutive to earnings in the near term.”6. Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 85 Closing out the first part of our list of the best spring stocks to buy now is Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC). Several hedge funds bailed on Wells Fargo in the first quarter, including Warren Buffett, who otherwise maintains high conviction in several other finance stocks. The company nonetheless ranks as one of hedge funds’ top five picks among investment banks.Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC) bought back $4 billion worth of shares in Q1 and appears poised to continue buying back shares in the coming quarters. CEO Charlie Scharf recently stated that the company feels good about the size of its buffer zone above the regulatory minimums required to be held by banks to balance out their risk-weighted assets, which would allow them to continue buying back shares while otherwise remaining fiscally prudent.Davis New York Venture Fund is impressed by the resiliency of Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC)’s customers, as expressed in the fund’s 2022 annual investor letter:“Our investment thesis for our next largest bank investment, Wells Fargo, is totally different. As is well known, Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC) is the country’s third-largest bank, serving one in three U.S. households. Years of regulatory missteps under prior managements resulted in reputational damage, higher-than-average expenses, numerous consent orders, caps on asset growth, all added to the negative impact of low rates on their interest income. However, where others see bad news, we see resiliency and gradual improvement. Wells Fargo’s resiliency is reflected in the fact that despite years of terrible headlines and congressional hearings, Wells Fargo’s core customers stayed put and customer attrition remains extraordinarily low.As to gradual improvement, new management has made steady headway in closing consent orders, settling regulatory matters and upgrading systems. Thus, rather than increasing profits from growth, Wells Fargo’s earnings growth for the next three-to-five years should come from the combined tailwinds of rising interest income, partially offset by normalizing credit costs, reduced expenses as systems improve and the scandals of the last decade are gradually put behind them, and the return of excess capital through share repurchases and rising dividends. The hypothetical earnings bridge displayed in Figure 6 gives some sense of the earnings power we see unfolding in the years ahead for this durable financial franchise.While our grounded optimism carries the day, we are mindful of the risk that Wells Fargo’s historically excellent credit culture may have deteriorated, or that exasperated regulators may choose to extract even more major penalties for past infractions.” PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) are three of the top spring stocks to buy now.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Li Auto Inc. LI, Stellantis N.V. STLA, General Motors Company GM, Lightning eMotors, Inc. ZEV and Canoo Inc. GOEV.Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:3 Auto Market Trends You Should Be Buying Right NowThe auto industry has been up against some pretty hard times in the last couple of years. In addition to the supply chain issues, particularly the shortage in semiconductor chips that increased pressure on the supply side, record high inflation squeezed consumer budgets and made it harder to buy a new car, thus increasing pressure on the demand side.According to ABI Research, overall vehicle sales will “inch closer to a rebound in 2023.” Despite macroeconomic concerns, the research firm is projecting a 5.1% increase in volume this year to 85.5 million units. North America is expected to grow 6%, Europe 6.2% and Asia/Pacific 4.3%. Sales are expected to increase 3.3% in 2024 and reach the previous high of more than 90 million units in 2025.The longer-term outlook for the industry is also extremely bright, as the industry is undergoing a major transformation, driven by factors such as the rise of electric vehicles, the growth of autonomous driving and the increasing popularity of ride-hailing services.The rise of electric vehicles is one of the most significant trends in the auto industry. Electric vehicles offer a number of advantages over gasoline-powered cars, including lower emissions, lower operating costs and improved performance. As a result, electric vehicles are becoming increasingly popular, and the global market for electric vehicles is expected to grow significantly in the coming years.According to the International Energy Agency’s (IEA) annual Global Electric Vehicle Outlook, more than 10 million electric cars were sold worldwide in 2022. Sales are expected to grow by another 35% this year to reach 14 million. This explosive growth means that electric cars' share of the overall car market has risen from around 4% in 2020 to 14% in 2022 and is set to increase further to 18% this year. This growth is being driven by emerging markets like China, India and Thailand, mainly because of government incentives, falling battery prices and increasing consumer awareness of the environmental benefits.Story continuesThe main stumbling blocks for adoption are range, affordability (including of the batteries) and the charging infrastructure and all these elements are a matter of focus for world leaders and car makers alike. The current momentum and strong competition is pushing automakers to increase investment in the category, further helping the market. The IEA estimates that electric cars could account for up to 30% of global car sales by 2030, which would reduce global oil demand by 2 million barrels per day.The growth of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving (AD) is another major trend that is expected to have a significant impact on the auto industry. According to McKinsey &amp; Company, the global market for ADAS and AD is expected to grow from $22.4 billion in 2020 to $120.7 billion by 2027. North America is expected to be the largest market for ADAS and AD, followed by Europe and Asia Pacific.China is expected to be the fastest-growing market for ADAS and AD, due to its large population and growing economy. This growth is being driven by a number of factors, including the increasing demand for safety features in cars and the development of new technologies that make AD possible.Autonomous vehicles have the potential to make driving safer, more efficient and more convenient. Some of the challenges that need to be overcome before autonomous driving can become mainstream however, are the need for better sensors and software, as well as the need for regulatory approval.The increasing popularity of ride-hailing services is another trend that is having a significant impact on the auto industry. Ride-hailing services, such as Uber and Lyft, offer a convenient and affordable alternative to owning a car.As a result, the popularity of ride-hailing services is growing. The global market for ride-hailing services is expected to grow from $56.4 billion in 2020 to $132.8 billion by 2027. AD and ADAS in passenger cars are expected to generate 300-400 billion in revenue by 2035.The popularity of the model is leading suppliers to think about new business models, such as subscription-based car ownership and car sharing. While this could be having a negative impact on new car sales, demand in the longer term will be supported by an expansion of the ride hailing market, increased car sharing and government mandates to upgrade ride-hailing fleets to EVs and other environment-friendly options.The auto industry is constantly evolving, and it will be interesting to see how these trends play out in the coming years. The industry is facing a number of challenges, but it also has a number of opportunities. Automakers that are able to adapt to the changing landscape will be well-positioned to succeed in the future.

205,57373b06-0779-33e3-a4a2-db7ea25a2344,GM,2023-05-24,4 Low Price-to-Cash Flow Stocks to Refine Your Portfolio,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-low-price-cash-flow-125900900.html,1684846740,STORY,"['UNM', 'GM', 'AIG', 'PK']","[We always try to hit the jackpot while picking stocks. But striking the right chord each time is not easy unless blessed with Midas touch. When it comes to the investment market, experts consider value style as one of the most effective approaches. Value investing is essentially about selecting stocks that have good things going on for them, even at a time when they have been beaten down by some external factors.There are different valuation metrics to determine a stock’s inherent strength but a random selection of ratios cannot serve your purpose if you want a realistic assessment of a company’s financial position. For this, we recommend Price to Cash Flow (or P/CF) as one of the key metrics. This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per-share basis — the lower the number, the better. Unum Group UNM, General Motors Company GM, American International Group, Inc. AIG and Park Hotels &amp; Resorts PK boast a low P/CF ratio.Price to Cash Flow Reveals Financial HealthQuestions may arise as to why we are considering the Price to Cash Flow valuation metric, when the most widely used metric is Price/Earnings (or P/E). Well, what makes P/CF stand out is that operating cash flow adds back non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income, truly reflecting the financial health of a company.Analysts caution that a company’s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. However, cash flow is reliable. It is net cash flow that reveals how much money a company is actually generating and how effectively management is putting the same to use.A positive cash flow indicates an increase in the company’s liquid assets. This gives the company the means to settle debt, shell out for its expenses, reinvest in its business, endure downturns and finally pay back its shareholders. Then again, a negative cash flow implies a decline in the company’s liquidity, which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves.Story continuesWhat’s the Best Strategy?An investment decision solely based on the P/CF metric may not fetch the desired results. To identify stocks that are trading at a discount, you should expand your search criteria and also consider the price-to-book ratio, price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-sales ratio. Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a Value Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to even better results as these eliminate the chance of falling into a value trap.Here are the parameters for selecting true value stocks:P/CF less than or equal to X-Industry Median.Price greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.P/E using (F1) less than or equal to X-Industry Median: This parameter shortlists stocks that are trading at a discount or are equal to their peers.P/B less than or equal to X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.P/S less than or equal to X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how a stock price compares to the company’s sales — the lower the ratio the more attractive the stock is.PEG less than 1: The ratio is used to determine a stock's value by taking the company's earnings growth into account. The PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and that investors need to pay less for a stock that has robust earnings growth prospects.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best upside potential.Here are four of the nine stocks that qualified the screening:Unum Group, which provides financial protection benefit solutions, sports a Zacks Rank #1 and has an expected EPS growth rate of 9.1% for three-five years. The company has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 18.6%, on average.

Shares of UNM have gained 33.6% in the past year.General Motors, which designs, builds, and sells cars, trucks, crossovers, and automobile parts globally, flaunts a Zacks Rank #1.

That dire outcome would potentially lead to a US recession that harms returns on these key investments by United Airlines.""The economy is balanced on a knife's edge,"" Kirby said on Yahoo Finance Live (video above). ""When the Silicon Valley banking scare started, we saw a 15% overnight drop in business bookings, and that tells you the economy is very fragile.""""That's what I am worried about with the debt ceiling,"" he added.

But maintaining that momentum will be tough if the US is thrust into a self-created debt ceiling recession.""If the debt ceiling crisis turns into a bigger crisis is where we are really impacted,"" Kirby added. ""We just shouldn't take the risk — it's a silly, silly risk to think about letting that first domino fall.""Kirby is hopeful politicians will come to a resolution in a timely manner.However, the contentious situation in D.C. isn't stopping United Airlines from making the major investments it views as necessary to beat the competition such as Jetblue (JBLU), Delta (DAL), and American Airlines (AAL).A woman walks to her car at an empty passenger drop off area at Denver International Airport as the coronavirus pandemic slows air travel on April 22, 2020 in Denver, Colorado.

This should be great news for the airline industry, but only if the major players can keep up with that demand. Stranded travelers, angry lawmakers, and staffing shortages have created travel disruptions for nearly every major airline in the past two years.And this summer, they can't afford any more meltdowns. One of the airlines gearing up for a big Memorial Day weekend is United Airlines. The airline is unveiling a major investment in Denver International Airport today. Let's bring in the United Airlines CEO, Scott Kirby. Scott, always great to get some time with you here on ""Yahoo Finance.""So big investment in Denver-- let's start there. A part of a $1 billion plan by your organization. Why Denver?SCOTT KIRBY: So Denver has been a phenomenal airport for us at United Airlines. And the city worked with us and built more gates. We're opening 12 more gates. We've got a couple more clubs opening soon. We're the largest private employer here in Denver. We've added 35 new flights. It is basically tied with Chicago as our largest airport in the country now. But we have more gates here than anywhere. And so growth to come in the near term, but also in the years ahead.It's just a great growing city. Great geography for connecting customers across the country. We're really excited about everything that's going on for us here in Denver.BRIAN SOZZI: Scott, you made a very interesting point in the press release on this this morning that this might be a hybrid work play by United. Explain that to us.SCOTT KIRBY: Yeah. I've been saying hybrid work makes every weekend a holiday. And so when people are going to the office three or four days a week, it used to be if they were tethered to their desk from 9 to 5, Monday to Friday, they couldn't get away for the weekend because it just wasn't enough time. But now, they can leave Wednesday night or Thursday morning and go somewhere. Go to Florida, or go to Cancun, or go up to the Poconos, or whatever it is.Story continuesAnd they work remotely for one or two days. And so they're still online. And they're still working. But they work remotely. And so it means there's just a structurally higher level of travel than there was before because people weren't constrained by money. They're constrained by time. And taking that time constraint off gives them more ability to travel. And we see that happening. And I've seen it happening for the past year and a half.BRIAN SOZZI: Scott, for investors not too familiar, where else you're putting capital to work? So $1 billion in Denver, that's a very large number. Where else are you investing in the United States at the same level or even more?SCOTT KIRBY: Well, by far, our biggest investment is in aircraft. We've got the largest aircraft orders in history coming this year and in the years to come. So we're going to spend a little over $8 billion in CapEx this year, mostly on aircraft. We're making big investments at almost all of our airports. But the big CapEx number for us is aircraft.BRIAN SOZZI: And I see the 737 Max by Boeing will be part of your planning in Denver. Is there still customer hasn't seen on getting on that airplane?SCOTT KIRBY: No. It's a great airplane, a very safe airplane. And there's no impact at all.BRIAN SOZZI: Talk to us about Memorial Day weekend demand. It's expected to be very strong. Compared to what we just heard from you a couple of weeks on earnings, how is the demand environment looking?SCOTT KIRBY: Look, the demand environment remains very good. We've had six of our 10 highest in history revenue booking days here in the month of May. The other four were all in March before Silicon Valley banking scare. So the demand environment remains very good. We're expecting all time records this weekend. But consistent all time records as we go through the summer. And expect to continue to break the booked revenue records as we move forward.BRIAN SOZZI: What is growing faster, US or international travel?SCOTT KIRBY: So international is growing faster. Well, international is growing faster really across the board. And a lot of what happened last year is international borders were still tough, either completely closed or there are all kinds of requirements to get in and around COVID. So that caused a surge in demand for domestic travel. This year, borders are open. A lot of people are able to go for the first time. And so long haul international particularly is the strongest part of the network.BRIAN SOZZI: We were looking at the latest CPI data, Scott. And we noticed that prices for airfares have start to come down a little bit. Is that because of more capacity in the airline industry or consumers balking at some of the higher prices?SCOTT KIRBY: No. I think this is really just a function of COVID. Airfares went up a lot last year, as there was coming out of Omicron and with the pent up demand. And so they're now coming back to the trend line of where they were before relative to GDP. So we all expected this. I don't think there's anything to read into it other than this time last year was this really surge, especially for domestic demand. And that CPI data is heavily weighted to domestic because people couldn't travel internationally.And so last year was the anomaly. And this year is back to normal trend line.BRIAN SOZZI: As an airline, Scott, that is investing billions of dollars each year, airplanes, infrastructure like in Denver, how concerned are you about what's going on in Washington right now with the debt ceiling debate? And how destabilizing? Could that be to your business and the overall airline industry, if there is a default?SCOTT KIRBY: Well, first, I've already talked about demand is really good for us. And so it feels to me like the economy is, we're going to make it through this fighting back against inflation with either a soft landing or at worst, a mild recession. But the economy is balanced on a knife's edge. When Silicon Valley banking scare started, we saw a 15% overnight drop in business bookings. And that tells you that the economy is very fragile. And that's what I'm worried about with the debt ceiling.We don't need an unforced error in the economy. And this would just be an unforced error. And I really hope that our politicians can find a way to compromise. And I'm bipartisan in that. Both sides compromise and get a deal done. Because we're going to make it through a tough period, I think, without a lot of damage. Unless, we do harm to ourselves. So let's not do harm to ourselves, not have an unforced error around the debt ceiling.BRIAN SOZZI: A lot of leaders I talked to, Scott, share your sentiment. Absolutely. But as a leader, as a CEO of a very large company, do you put plans in place if it doesn't go according to plan?SCOTT KIRBY: Well, there's not much for us that we're going to do different in the short term. If you're in banking or part of the financial plumbing, what I think of this is the debt ceiling would be the first domino. And there's a bunch of dominoes lined up in the financial system. And that's really where we have really bad outcomes, if some of those dominoes start to fall. And so I think they're really focused on what to do on day one.For us, on day one, it doesn't change. Our dominoes are more at the end of that chain. That if the debt ceiling crisis turns into a bigger crisis, is where we're really impacted. But we just shouldn't take the risk. It's a silly, silly, silly risk to even think about letting that first domino fall.BRIAN SOZZI: On a happier note, Scott, I booked a trip for next month. ""Yahoo Finance"" is headed to Cairns, which I'm very excited about. But it felt like to me, I'm using United. It felt like--SCOTT KIRBY: That's good. Thank you.BRIAN SOZZI: Yeah. Well, happy to help. But it felt like more premium seats on board. Are you adding more luxury seats, more first class seats on these planes? And why may that be the case?SCOTT KIRBY: Yeah. United, we've become the flag carrier of the United States. We fly to more destinations across the Atlantic than all the other US airlines combined, more across the Pacific than all the other US airlines combined. And a lot of our business is premium travel, so both business class and premium economy seats. And so we've had growth across the Atlantic, but even larger growth in the premium cabins for customers.BRIAN SOZZI: Do you have to take planes out of service to reconfigure them? It seems like a pretty big undertaking to put in just larger seating and more plush environments.SCOTT KIRBY: We do. And. In fact, it depends on what kind of reconfiguration you're doing. But think of it as an $8 to $10 million per airplane project. So there's significant investments when we run them through to upgrade the interiors with all the new seats, new paint, everything on the interiors.BRIAN SOZZI: Well, I hate to be the bearer of bad news. I'm flying economy class, Scott.[LAUGHING]But maybe next time. I want to keep saving. You got to watch it. You got to watch it.SCOTT KIRBY: Watch all those comfortable people and buy business next time.BRIAN SOZZI: Oh, I know I have the corporate card. But you've got to do the right thing. You got to do the right thing. All right. Scott Kirby, congratulations on that Denver investment. United Airlines, CEO, always great to get some time with you. Appreciate it.SCOTT KIRBY: Thanks, Brian.]"

Its Investor Class fund ARTLX returned 7.88%, Advisor Class fund APDLX posted a return of 7.93%, and Institutional Class fund APHLX returned 8.02% in the quarter, compared to a 1.01% return for the Russell 1000 Value Index.

(NYSE:PNC) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:""We are taking advantage of the current weakness in bank stocks. In Q1, we purchased The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (NYSE:PNC) and US Bancorp. These are banks we have known for years. They are well-managed and have solid capital positions and liquidity. At the end of Q1, we had an ~7% weighting in banks consisting of PNC, US Bancorp and Bank of America. All 3 are among the 10 largest US banks. We believe the range of probabilities and long-term outcomes are tilted in our favor at current prices but are proceeding with caution for several reasons. First, while we believe deposit-runs have likely burned themselves out, there is a non-zero risk these runs spread wider than our base case. Second, we expect more regulation in coming years which will increase the cost of doing business, potentially in exchange for higher FDIC limits. Third, at the very least we expect banks to cease buybacks for the rest of the year to build up liquidity and capital ratios. There is an increasingly more likely outcome that banks issue equity capital and preferred stock once markets stabilize. Fourth, with the banking system in shock, it will likely retrench, which will constrict capital to the US economy. Coupled with the “long and variable lags” of Fed policy, this will slow US economic growth beyond what private credit markets can make up.""Story continuesCard, Wallet, BankPhoto by Clay Banks on UnsplashThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.

The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 86% to be precise, is institutions. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Institutional investors endured the highest losses after the company's market cap fell by US$279m last week. Still, the 8.3% one-year gains may have helped mitigate their overall losses. But they would probably be wary of future losses.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Pinnacle West Capital. View our latest analysis for Pinnacle West Capital ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Pinnacle West Capital?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Pinnacle West Capital. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Pinnacle West Capital's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Pinnacle West Capital. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 13% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 9.1% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 6.2% by the third-largest shareholder.We also observed that the top 10 shareholders account for more than half of the share register, with a few smaller shareholders to balance the interests of the larger ones to a certain extent.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Pinnacle West CapitalWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our information suggests that Pinnacle West Capital Corporation insiders own under 1% of the company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$24m of stock. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 13% stake in Pinnacle West Capital. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Pinnacle West Capital better, we need to consider many other factors.

The items include ""gender fluid"" mugs, ""queer all year"" calendars and books for children aged 2-8 titled ""Bye Bye, Binary,"" ""Pride 1,2,3"" and ""I'm not a girl.""""Since introducing this year's collection, we've experienced threats impacting our team members' sense of safety and wellbeing while at work,"" Target said in a statement.""Given these volatile circumstances, we are making adjustments to our plans, including removing items that have been at the center of the most significant confrontational behavior,"" the Minneapolis-based retailer said.Target has been celebrating Pride Month for more than a decade. But this year's collection has led to an increase in confrontations between customers and employees and incidents of Pride merchandise being thrown on the floor, Target spokesperson Kayla Castaneda said.Target's action comes on the heels of aconservative backlash against Bud Light, after brewer Anheuser-Busch promoted the beer on social media last month with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney.The products Target is withdrawing are being removed from all its U.S. stores and from its website, Castaneda said.While various Pride Collection products are under review, the only ones now being removed are the LGBTQ brand Abprallen, which has come under scrutiny for its association with British designer Erik Carnell.Carnell has faced social media backlash for designing merchandise with images of pentagrams, horned skulls and other Satanic products.Story continuesA search for Abprallen merchandise on Target.com on Tuesday showed ""0"" results.Screenshots and postson social media show that Target previously sold a $25 slogan sweater with the words ""cure transphobia not trans people"" and an $18 ""too queer for here"" tote bag.Target is also reviewing certain transgender swimsuits and children's merchandise, Castaneda said, but no decision on those products has yet been made.For example, a swimsuit sold in the women's section has come under scrutiny for the way its fit was described, as ""tuck friendly,"" highlighted its ability to supposedly tuck male genitalia.A Fox Newsreportearlier on Tuesday said that some Target stores in Southern states were shifting Pride-related merchandise away from the front of stores.

Pride month is held in June.Target confirmed that it has moved its Pride merchandise from the front of the stores to the back in some Southern stores after confrontations and backlash from shoppers in those areas.Target’s Pride month collection has also been the subject of several misleading videos in recent weeks, with social media users falsely claiming the retailer is selling “tuck-friendly” bathing suits designed for kids or in kids’ sizes.The moves come as beer brand Bud Light is still grappling with a backlash from customers angered by its attempt to broaden its customer base by partnering with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney. Bud Light's parent company said it will triple its marketing spending in the U.S. this summer as it tries to restore sales it lost after the brand partnered with the transgender influencer.Target and other retailers including Walmart and H&amp;M have been expanding their LGBTQ+ displays to celebrate Pride month for roughly a decade.

Dick's Sporting Goods is out today posting strong results. Unlike what we saw last week with Foot Locker. ""Yahoo Finance's"" Diane King Hall is here to weigh in. Hi, Diane.DIANE KING HALL: Hey, Rachelle. Well, let's start with a check on shares of Dick's. They are a little bit higher in response to posting better than expected numbers on its top and bottom line. But they've trimmed the gains that we saw earlier in the session. So up just about a little over a half of a percent now.The sports retailer says, earnings totaled $305 million in the first quarter or $3.40 a share. That's up from the same time a year ago. Sales top $2.8 billion. CEO Lauren Hobart said, quote, ""Even as consumers face macroeconomic uncertainties, our athletes have continued to prioritize sport and rely on Dick's to meet their needs.""I just listened to the earnings call. And these are some of the items that stood out to me. They talked about-- they did acknowledge the macroeconomic realities. They said, it does remain uncertain. But they believe they'll continue to deliver on sales and growth. They got a lot of compliments from analysts on their numbers. Because if you compare and contrast them to Foot Locker, you mentioned Foot Locker earlier, they did much better.Dick's results stand in stark contrast to Foot Locker, which you may recall posted an 11% drop in sales. The question is, did Foot Locker lean too heavily on Nike and its lineup? Back in 2022, it bought 65% of its inventory from Nike. And it reiterated its partnership with the brand in March. Foot Locker also said it may have to discount more to incentivize shoppers. And so I want to pull out a couple more items from the Dick's earnings call, Rachelle, where they were asked about their relationship with Nike.Story continuesLauren says, she doesn't feel they have an over inventory of Nike. Again, Dick's share price was doing better going into the earnings call. But there wasn't really anything that stuck out. It seems to be more of a general downtrend in the market that is affecting Dick's and just worries about the retail sector, in general. They were asked if the consumer is weakened. They said, basically, their consumer has not. Their consumer, they said, from low income to high income shoppers has remained strong.They reiterated their presence with athletes purchasing from them. So they had strong numbers. Their comps were up 3.4% same store sales. So Dick's definitely stands in stark contrast to Foot Locker, though, it's not having a big run up in terms of its share price currently.Earlier in the session, it did. We'll see how things shake out throughout the day, Rachelle.RACHELLE AKUFFO: It's true. You just have to wait and see how investors digest all of this. And so to that point, Dick's didn't disappoint. But let's broaden it out to where some of the other trends that we're seeing have emerged this earnings season when it comes to the retail sector.DIANE KING HALL: Yeah. You had some varying trends. You had a tale of two retailers, basically. Now, shoppers did spend less at some retailers. And there was a focus on necessities and not discretionary. Walmart was certainly the beneficiary of the focus on necessities. And that was really due to grocery.Now, Target did beat when it reported its results. But it acknowledged and talked about the struggle with the impact of organized crime on its results. So really, what we've seen in terms of the retailers is those retailers that focus on necessities are doing well. And there were retailers that acknowledged there have been some trade down. Now, Dick's today said, they didn't notice much trade down in terms of people trading away from certain brand names for other brand names.So they said, their differentiation of their inventory stood out. So that's something that definitely benefited them. But, again, other retailers pointed out that their struggle was with consumers trading down, Rachelle.RACHELLE AKUFFO: Indeed. Still seeing that divergence. As you mentioned, the tale of two retailers. Great stuff. Thank you so much, Diane.]"

The system is powered by robotic technology that has exposed the company to medical mechatronics, robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) for the healthcare space.ISRG has also launched da Vinci X, an upgrade to its flagship Vinci Xi technology.Progress on the AI Front: We are upbeat about the growing adoption of minimally-invasive robot-assisted surgeries, self-automated home-based care, the use of information technology for quick and improved patient care, and the shift of the payment system to a value-based model. These indicate the high prevalence of AI in the MedTech space.Per Intuitive Surgical’s management, the rise of medical mechatronics, powerful computing, improved sensing, microfabrication and molecular imaging has enabled new approaches to old problems.Story continuesAI has been enhancing ISRG’s product portfolio with clinical applications, diagnostic support, operational efficiency, electronic health record systems, practice workflows and supply chain management.Strong Q1 Results: Intuitive Surgical’s solid first-quarter 2023 results buoy optimism. The company’s displayed strong segmental performance during the quarter. It also witnessed growth in da Vinci procedure volume.DownsidesRisk of Procedure Adoption: Intuitive Surgical faces the risk of adoption of its procedures. This is because adoption growth takes time, as each procedure needs to gain credibility.Furthermore, the wide use of the company’s products requires the training of surgical teams. Market acceptance could be delayed by the time required to complete such training.Stiff Competition: Since the launch of its flagship device, the da Vinci System, in 2000, ISRG enjoyed a monopoly in the market for robotic abdominal surgery. However, after the regulatory approval of Transenterix's surgical robot for abdominal surgery in 2017, competition intensified.Intuitive Surgical, Inc. PriceIntuitive Surgical, Inc.

For more stocks, head on over to Billionaire Andreas Halvorsen's Viking Global Portfolio: Top 5 Stock Picks. The world of investing is full of uncertainty. After all, there's no such thing as a free lunch, and trying to gauge the mood of the countless investors that make up the stock market carries with it its own set of risks. However, these moods are also often influenced by broader macroeconomic sentiments, and this factor has been true for the past couple of years as well. The stock market was dealt a major shock as investors fearful of the economic impact of the coronavirus exited the market in droves. Then, they rushed back as technology stocks boomed due to a favorable environment created by the lockdowns. However, yet again, this victory would be short lived since the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the after effects of the coronavirus led to fiscal expansion harbored in inflation and cut down the markets for growth companies.All these ups and downs appeared to be over as 2023 set in and major stock markets were eager to rise. But, as if the stock market gods weren't happy, the latest debate about the future of the market surrounds one of the most catastrophic events to hit the American economy - if it occurs. This phenomenon, often limited to struggling developing countries, is also knocking on the doors of the U.S. - the world's largest economy and a global financial sector. This threat is that of default, and in simple terms, it implies that the Treasury Department might not be able to meet its obligations if it is prevented from raising more debt. Or, in other words, the Treasury has to borrow to spend - and there's no way around it.The Treasury's ability to borrow is mandated by Congress - the sole governing body with authority to manage America's spending. However, Treasury itself is part of the Executive branch of America, headed by the Secretary appointed by the President. So, right now, it's back and forth between Congress and President Biden - or to be more specific, the Republican Party and the President - since the Democrats represent Mr. Biden's own party. Both sides have their own view on the debt ceiling, and the President's side released a rather ominous white paper in May 2023 where it predicted that should the U.S. default on its debt, the stock market might fall a stunning 45%.Story continuesTo quote the White House:The costs would be even greater under a protracted default. A CEA simulation of the effect of a protracted default shows an immediate, sharp recession on the order of the Great Recession. In 2023 Q3, the first full quarter of the simulated debt ceiling breach, the stock market plummets 45 percent, leading to a hit to retirement accounts; meanwhile, consumer and business confidence take substantial hits, leading to a pullback in consumption and investment. Unemployment increases 5 percentage points as consumers cut consumption, and businesses lay off workers. Unlike the Great Recession and the COVID recession, the government is unable to help consumers and businesses. As the breach continues, the economy heals slowly, and unemployment is still 3 percentage points higher at the end of 2023.On the flip side, the House Republicans maintain that they are earnestly striving to find a solution to avoid a default - and it's the Democrats who are refusing to negotiate. House Speaker McCarthy, speaking in April 2023, continued to express willingness to negotiate as he stated:Even members of his [BIDEN] own party think this approach is extreme. Democrat Senator Joe Mansion recently said, “Recent actions make clear to me that the Biden Administration is determined to pursue ideological agenda.” Senator Mansion is right. Make no mistake: the longer President Biden waits to be sensible, defined an agreement, the more likely it becomes that this administration will bumble into the first default in our nation’s history. Addressing the debt requires us to come together, find common ground, and reduce spending. Let me be clear. Defaulting on our debt is not an option, but neither is a future of higher taxes, higher interest rates, more dependency on China, an economy that doesn’t work for working Americans.So, amidst this back and forth between politicians, what does the regular investor do? Well, one approach is to follow the professionals. And one such professional is Ole Andreas Halvorsen of Viking Global. Mr. Halvorsen is worth $5.9 billion, and he set up his hedge fund in 1999.

As we continue to grow the portfolio, Jamey Cua joins Pete Metzger and the rest of our development team as we build on this momentum throughout the year and beyond.""The Emphasis On Franchise Business Bodes WellChoice Hotels gains from economies of scale associated with the franchise business.

PENN is likely to benefit from Barstool Sports expansion, 3C’s initiatives and iCasino business. Also, the emphasis on new loyalty program bodes well. However, a rise in labor and non-gaming costs is a concern.Let us discuss the factors that highlight why investors should retain the stock for the time being.Growth CatalystsPENN Entertainment focuses on Barstool Sports expansion to drive growth. During the first quarter of 2023, the company reported solid revenue and engagement results, courtesy of a compelling content and an exceptional product experience. During the quarter, the company stated progress with respect to the integration of the Barstool Sportsbook (in the United States) to theScore player account management and trading platform. During the quarter, the initiative paved a path for improved metrics, including a rise in six-month retention rates. On the media front, the company’s cross-platform views were up 40% year over year.The company is optimistic about the inclusion of the remaining Barstool Sports to the Penn Entertainment family. PENN is of the opinion that the combination of Barstool’s audience with theScore’s fully-integrated media and betting platform will pave the path for new customer acquisition and organic cross-selling opportunities. The company anticipates completing the migration in July 2023.PENN Entertainment continues to progress toward the new generation of cordless, cashless and contactless technology, collectively known as 3C’s, to drive growth. The technological solution removes friction from transactions and reduces wait times and bolsters its marketing capabilities. During the first-quarter 2023 conference call, the company announced that 3Cs technology is active in 21 properties. Owing to the continuous roll-out, the company witnessed a rise in mywallet customers (195,000) and deposits (worth $104 million), marking growth on a sequential basis.The company emphasizes on new game additions, creative marketing and leveraging the casino database to boost the Barstool-branded iCasino business. During the first quarter of 2023, the company reported strong performance in Ontario, with iCasino GGR experiencing significant year-over-year growth. The upside was backed by the proprietary technology stack.Story continuesIncreased focus on loyalty program bodes well. During the first quarter of 2023, the company announced the launch of an enhanced and rebranded customer loyalty program, PENN Play. The program connects the Company’s brands under one loyalty program and allows members a wide range of incentives including priority access, discounts, gifts, trips to PENN destinations, partner experiences and PENN Cash. Given the rising adoption of digital wallet and its supporting role in increasing visitation and time on device, the company anticipates the program to drive growth in the upcoming periods.ConcernsZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSo far this year, shares of PENN Entertainment have declined 14.9% against the industry’s 24% growth. The company’s performance was impacted by a rise in labor and non-gaming costs. During the first quarter of 2023, the company’s gaming expenses came in at $729.5 million compared with $686.6 million reported in the prior-year quarter. The upside was primarily driven by a rise in third-party service provider fees, higher payroll expenses and an increase in gaming taxes. Food, beverage, hotel and other expenses during the quarter came in at $244.3 million compared with $171.9 million reported in the prior-year quarter. The company is cautious about the ongoing uncertain macroeconomic environment. For 2023, our model predicts gaming expenses and Food, beverage, hotel and other expenses to rise 2.2% and 16.1%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis.Zacks Rank &amp; Key PicksPENN Entertainment currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector are MGM Resorts International MGM, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.

Investors may join via webcast, accessible at investor.analog.com.Non-GAAP Financial InformationThis release includes non-GAAP financial measures that are not in accordance with, nor an alternative to, generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and may be different from non-GAAP measures presented by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. These non-GAAP measures have material limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with the Company’s results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, the Company’s financial results presented in accordance with GAAP. The Company’s use of non GAAP measures, and the underlying methodology when including or excluding certain items, is not necessarily an indication of the results of operations that may be expected in the future, or that the Company will not, in fact, record such items in future periods. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP are provided in the financial tables included in this release.Management uses non-GAAP measures internally to evaluate the Company’s operating performance from continuing operations against past periods and to budget and allocate resources in future periods. These non-GAAP measures also assist management in evaluating the Company’s core business and trends across different reporting periods on a consistent basis. Management also uses these non-GAAP measures as the primary performance measurement when communicating with analysts and investors regarding the Company’s earnings results and outlook and believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP measures is useful to investors because it provides investors with the operating results that management uses to manage the Company and enables investors and analysts to evaluate the Company’s core business. Management also believes that the non-GAAP liquidity measure free cash flow is useful both internally and to investors because it provides information about the amount of cash generated after capital expenditures that is then available to repay debt obligations, make investments and fund acquisitions, and for certain other activities.The non-GAAP financial measures referenced by ADI in this release include: adjusted gross margin, adjusted gross margin percentage, adjusted operating expenses, adjusted operating expenses percentage, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted nonoperating expense (income), adjusted income before income taxes, adjusted provision for income taxes, adjusted tax rate, adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS), free cash flow, and free cash flow revenue percentage.Adjusted gross margin is defined as gross margin, determined in accordance with GAAP, excluding certain acquisition related expenses1, which are described further below. Adjusted gross margin percentage represents adjusted gross margin divided by revenue.Adjusted operating expenses is defined as operating expenses, determined in accordance with GAAP, excluding: certain acquisition related expenses1, acquisition related transaction costs2, and special charges, net3, which are described further below. Adjusted operating expenses percentage represents adjusted operating expenses divided by revenue.Adjusted operating income is defined as operating income, determined in accordance with GAAP, excluding: acquisition related expenses1, acquisition related transaction costs2, and special charges, net3, which are described further below. Adjusted operating margin represents adjusted operating income divided by revenue.Adjusted nonoperating expense (income) is defined as nonoperating expense (income), determined in accordance with GAAP, excluding: certain acquisition related expenses1, which is described further below.Adjusted income before income taxes is defined as income before income taxes, determined in accordance with GAAP, excluding: acquisition related expenses1, acquisition related transaction costs2, and special charges, net3, which are described further below.Adjusted provision for income taxes is defined as provision for income taxes, determined in accordance with GAAP, excluding tax related items4, which are described further below. Adjusted tax rate represents adjusted provision for income taxes divided by adjusted income before income taxes.Adjusted diluted EPS is defined as diluted EPS, determined in accordance with GAAP, excluding: acquisition related expenses1, acquisition related transaction costs2, special charges, net3, and tax related items4, which are described further below.Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities, determined in accordance with GAAP, less additions to property, plant and equipment, net. Free cash flow revenue percentage represents free cash flow divided by revenue.1Acquisition Related Expenses: Expenses incurred as a result of current and prior period acquisitions and primarily include expenses associated with the fair value adjustments to debt, inventory, property, plant and equipment and amortization of acquisition related intangibles, which include acquired intangibles such as purchased technology and customer relationships. Expenses also include fair value adjustments associated with the replacement of share-based awards related to the Maxim Integrated Products, Inc. (Maxim) acquisition. We excluded these costs from our non-GAAP measures because they relate to specific transactions and are not reflective of our ongoing financial performance.2Acquisition Related Transaction Costs: Costs directly related to the Maxim Integrated Products, Inc. acquisition, including legal, accounting and other professional fees as well as integration-related costs. We excluded these costs from our non-GAAP measures because they relate to a specific transaction and are not reflective of our ongoing financial performance.3Special Charges, net: Expenses, net, incurred as part of the integration of the Acquisition, in connection with facility closures, consolidation of manufacturing facilities, severance, other accelerated stock-based compensation expense and other cost reduction efforts or reorganizational initiatives. We excluded these expenses from our non-GAAP measures because apart from ongoing expense savings as a result of such items, these expenses have no direct correlation to the operation of our business in the future.4Tax Related Items: Income tax effect of the non-GAAP items discussed above, certain other income tax benefits associated with prior periods and an income tax benefit from a discrete tax item related to the consolidation of certain subsidiaries. We excluded the income tax effect of these tax related items from our non-GAAP measures because they are not associated with the tax expense on our current operating results.About Analog DevicesAnalog Devices, Inc.

For more stocks, head on over to Billionaire Andreas Halvorsen's Viking Global Portfolio: Top 5 Stock Picks. The world of investing is full of uncertainty. After all, there's no such thing as a free lunch, and trying to gauge the mood of the countless investors that make up the stock market carries with it its own set of risks. However, these moods are also often influenced by broader macroeconomic sentiments, and this factor has been true for the past couple of years as well. The stock market was dealt a major shock as investors fearful of the economic impact of the coronavirus exited the market in droves. Then, they rushed back as technology stocks boomed due to a favorable environment created by the lockdowns. However, yet again, this victory would be short lived since the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the after effects of the coronavirus led to fiscal expansion harbored in inflation and cut down the markets for growth companies.All these ups and downs appeared to be over as 2023 set in and major stock markets were eager to rise. But, as if the stock market gods weren't happy, the latest debate about the future of the market surrounds one of the most catastrophic events to hit the American economy - if it occurs. This phenomenon, often limited to struggling developing countries, is also knocking on the doors of the U.S. - the world's largest economy and a global financial sector. This threat is that of default, and in simple terms, it implies that the Treasury Department might not be able to meet its obligations if it is prevented from raising more debt. Or, in other words, the Treasury has to borrow to spend - and there's no way around it.The Treasury's ability to borrow is mandated by Congress - the sole governing body with authority to manage America's spending. However, Treasury itself is part of the Executive branch of America, headed by the Secretary appointed by the President. So, right now, it's back and forth between Congress and President Biden - or to be more specific, the Republican Party and the President - since the Democrats represent Mr. Biden's own party. Both sides have their own view on the debt ceiling, and the President's side released a rather ominous white paper in May 2023 where it predicted that should the U.S. default on its debt, the stock market might fall a stunning 45%.Story continuesTo quote the White House:The costs would be even greater under a protracted default. A CEA simulation of the effect of a protracted default shows an immediate, sharp recession on the order of the Great Recession. In 2023 Q3, the first full quarter of the simulated debt ceiling breach, the stock market plummets 45 percent, leading to a hit to retirement accounts; meanwhile, consumer and business confidence take substantial hits, leading to a pullback in consumption and investment. Unemployment increases 5 percentage points as consumers cut consumption, and businesses lay off workers. Unlike the Great Recession and the COVID recession, the government is unable to help consumers and businesses. As the breach continues, the economy heals slowly, and unemployment is still 3 percentage points higher at the end of 2023.On the flip side, the House Republicans maintain that they are earnestly striving to find a solution to avoid a default - and it's the Democrats who are refusing to negotiate. House Speaker McCarthy, speaking in April 2023, continued to express willingness to negotiate as he stated:Even members of his [BIDEN] own party think this approach is extreme. Democrat Senator Joe Mansion recently said, “Recent actions make clear to me that the Biden Administration is determined to pursue ideological agenda.” Senator Mansion is right. Make no mistake: the longer President Biden waits to be sensible, defined an agreement, the more likely it becomes that this administration will bumble into the first default in our nation’s history. Addressing the debt requires us to come together, find common ground, and reduce spending. Let me be clear. Defaulting on our debt is not an option, but neither is a future of higher taxes, higher interest rates, more dependency on China, an economy that doesn’t work for working Americans.So, amidst this back and forth between politicians, what does the regular investor do? Well, one approach is to follow the professionals. And one such professional is Ole Andreas Halvorsen of Viking Global. Mr. Halvorsen is worth $5.9 billion, and he set up his hedge fund in 1999. The billionaire hedge fund manager is a graduate of the Stanford Graduate School of Business, and his firm has a global presence while being headquartered in Greenwich, Connecticut.

These upgrades are part of a multi-year redesign of its network architecture to stay ahead of exponential data usage increases, upgrade the technology in the network, and to pave the way for personalized customer experiences. Network upgrades in McAllen include deploying new cell sites to extend coverage and capacity in local communities. They also include adding more capacity on fiber optic cables to move more data through the network and adding bandwidth to the cellular network to accommodate new services like wireless internet service for homes and businesses. Specifics on the upgrades include:Engineers have been aggressively deploying 5G Ultra Wideband service throughout McAllen which now offers 5G Ultra Wideband to 99% of the population. Most notably that service has recently expanded in McAllen, Mission, Edinburg, Harlingen and other communities in the area.McAllen’s exceptional 5G coverage uses Verizon’s recently acquired C-band spectrum.  Verizon engineers have been limited to using 60 MHz of C-band spectrum to deliver 5G service to customers. By the end of the year, customers in McAllen will be able to take advantage of significantly more spectrum as it becomes available for 5G Ultra Wideband, almost tripling the bandwidth available to customers.  That additional bandwidth will turbo charge the service, offering significantly higher speeds, much greater capacity to accommodate more customers and more robust services.Even as engineers provide wireless service in more places, they are also enhancing the service by deploying leading edge, modernized technology in the area. Engineers have upgraded the hardware in many of the cell sites providing service throughout McAllen adding capacity for more data to be used by customers, providing power efficiency, and providing virtualization. This technology milestone allows Verizon to rapidly respond to customers’ varied latency and computing needs, and provides greater flexibility and agility in the introduction of new products and services. The move to a cloud-based, virtualized architecture with standardized interfaces in every part of the network leads to greater flexibility, faster delivery of services, greater scalability, and improved cost efficiency in networks.Lastly, the addition of 5G service and the many additional wireless solutions allow far more data to travel on the wireless network in McAllen. That exponential increase in data carried into and out of the cell sites serving the community requires upgraded fiber optic cable links.  Fiber optic cables are used to move data between cell sites and connect those sites to the rest of the network.  Verizon has increased the capacity on the fiber connections in many cell sites in the McAllen area so they can carry 10 times the amount of data.Story continues“Whether our customers are enjoying connecting with friends and family while on the move, connecting their smart homes through one of our home internet products or using our service in McAllen for small business or enterprise applications, we know customers count on us,” Phillip French, Vice President of Engineering and Operations for Verizon. “Our team has been working hard in McAllen to deliver these results, and we are not slowing down.”With these and other technology advancements on Verizon’s network, customers are able to use more data in more ways.

Its consumer-centric approach, omnichannel capabilities, brand awareness and emphasis on high-growth areas position it well among peers.Growth InitiativesTapestry has been witnessing growth in the omnichannel. This can be attributed to a mid-single-digit jump in store revenues as consumers continue to embrace the return of in-person shopping during the fiscal third quarter. Also, in the aforementioned period, digital sales rose mid-single digits and remained three times of fiscal 2019 level. The company has been expanding its digital distribution channels. It is aiming to enhance curbside or store pickup service as well as contactless payment options and the opportunities to make virtual appointments.Tapestry’s long-term growth drivers include deepening engagement with consumers, creating innovative and compelling products, venturing into under-penetrated markets and enhancement of digital capacities. The company’s compelling pricing strategy, smaller format locations and cost-effective global sourcing model have been enhancing store productivity.From growth perspective, China remains one of the prominent markets for Tapestry. The company has been accelerating growth in the region through tailored and innovative product assortments, enhanced marketing and expanded reach across direct channels and third-party online distribution.Owing to a robust performance in the fiscal third quarter, the company raised its guidance for fiscal 2023.

You can skip our detailed analysis of blue chip companies and dividend stocks, and go directly to read 5 Best Blue Chip Dividend Stocks To Buy. After recording one of its worst performances in 2022, the stock market has rebounded this year. The S&amp;P 500 and the tech-heavy NASDAQ both are delivering positive returns to shareholders this year, gaining 9.39% and 22.2%, respectively, as of May 23. This market rally has boosted investors’ confidence. According to a survey conducted by Bankrate in March, analysts expect the S&amp;P 500 to rise by 8% over the next four quarters. The survey also highlighted that 46% of the respondents believe that the bull market may begin in the second half of the year.Despite these positive signs, many investors still prefer to steer clear of risks and prefer safe stocks that pay dividends. Blue chip companies are generally regarded as more stable and less volatile than smaller or riskier investments. According to a report by Wall Street Journal, exchange-traded funds that specialize in quality stocks have grown to over $60 billion over the past few years. The same report also quoted Denise Chisholm, director of the quantitative market strategy at Fidelity Investments. She said that quality stocks have outperformed about 80% of the time in the past three decades during periods of economic downturn.In addition to their strong performance, many blue chip companies have a history of paying consistent dividends. Investors seeking regular income through dividends may consider these quality stocks as they often have the financial strength to maintain and increase dividend payments over time. In our article titled 25 Things Every Dividend Investor Should Know, we mentioned data that shows the strong performance of companies with strong dividend growth track records.

For more stocks, head on over to Billionaire Andreas Halvorsen's Viking Global Portfolio: Top 5 Stock Picks. The world of investing is full of uncertainty. After all, there's no such thing as a free lunch, and trying to gauge the mood of the countless investors that make up the stock market carries with it its own set of risks. However, these moods are also often influenced by broader macroeconomic sentiments, and this factor has been true for the past couple of years as well. The stock market was dealt a major shock as investors fearful of the economic impact of the coronavirus exited the market in droves. Then, they rushed back as technology stocks boomed due to a favorable environment created by the lockdowns. However, yet again, this victory would be short lived since the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the after effects of the coronavirus led to fiscal expansion harbored in inflation and cut down the markets for growth companies.All these ups and downs appeared to be over as 2023 set in and major stock markets were eager to rise. But, as if the stock market gods weren't happy, the latest debate about the future of the market surrounds one of the most catastrophic events to hit the American economy - if it occurs. This phenomenon, often limited to struggling developing countries, is also knocking on the doors of the U.S. - the world's largest economy and a global financial sector. This threat is that of default, and in simple terms, it implies that the Treasury Department might not be able to meet its obligations if it is prevented from raising more debt. Or, in other words, the Treasury has to borrow to spend - and there's no way around it.The Treasury's ability to borrow is mandated by Congress - the sole governing body with authority to manage America's spending. However, Treasury itself is part of the Executive branch of America, headed by the Secretary appointed by the President. So, right now, it's back and forth between Congress and President Biden - or to be more specific, the Republican Party and the President - since the Democrats represent Mr. Biden's own party. Both sides have their own view on the debt ceiling, and the President's side released a rather ominous white paper in May 2023 where it predicted that should the U.S. default on its debt, the stock market might fall a stunning 45%.Story continuesTo quote the White House:The costs would be even greater under a protracted default. A CEA simulation of the effect of a protracted default shows an immediate, sharp recession on the order of the Great Recession. In 2023 Q3, the first full quarter of the simulated debt ceiling breach, the stock market plummets 45 percent, leading to a hit to retirement accounts; meanwhile, consumer and business confidence take substantial hits, leading to a pullback in consumption and investment. Unemployment increases 5 percentage points as consumers cut consumption, and businesses lay off workers. Unlike the Great Recession and the COVID recession, the government is unable to help consumers and businesses. As the breach continues, the economy heals slowly, and unemployment is still 3 percentage points higher at the end of 2023.On the flip side, the House Republicans maintain that they are earnestly striving to find a solution to avoid a default - and it's the Democrats who are refusing to negotiate. House Speaker McCarthy, speaking in April 2023, continued to express willingness to negotiate as he stated:Even members of his [BIDEN] own party think this approach is extreme. Democrat Senator Joe Mansion recently said, “Recent actions make clear to me that the Biden Administration is determined to pursue ideological agenda.” Senator Mansion is right. Make no mistake: the longer President Biden waits to be sensible, defined an agreement, the more likely it becomes that this administration will bumble into the first default in our nation’s history. Addressing the debt requires us to come together, find common ground, and reduce spending. Let me be clear. Defaulting on our debt is not an option, but neither is a future of higher taxes, higher interest rates, more dependency on China, an economy that doesn’t work for working Americans.So, amidst this back and forth between politicians, what does the regular investor do? Well, one approach is to follow the professionals. And one such professional is Ole Andreas Halvorsen of Viking Global. Mr. Halvorsen is worth $5.9 billion, and he set up his hedge fund in 1999.

254,c774d874-8ec3-3155-b41c-306b1a419b54,FOX,2023-05-24,Calculating The Intrinsic Value Of Fox Corporation (NASDAQ:FOXA),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/calculating-intrinsic-value-fox-corporation-191826795.html,1684869506,STORY,['FOXA'],"[Key InsightsThe projected fair value for Fox is US$34.58 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to EquityWith US$31.31 share price, Fox appears to be trading close to its estimated fair value The US$36.19 analyst price target for FOXA is 4.6% more than our estimate of fair valueIn this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of Fox Corporation (NASDAQ:FOXA) by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Fox The ModelWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$1.53bUS$1.75bUS$2.14bUS$1.89bUS$1.22bUS$1.14bUS$1.09bUS$1.07bUS$1.06bUS$1.06bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x12Analyst x13Analyst x11Analyst x3Analyst x2Est @ -6.73%Est @ -4.08%Est @ -2.22%Est @ -0.92%Est @ -0.01% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.3% US$1.4kUS$1.5kUS$1.7kUS$1.4kUS$818US$704US$623US$563US$515US$475(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$9.7bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.3%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.1b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (8.3%– 2.1%) = US$17bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$17b÷ ( 1 + 8.3%)10= US$7.8bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$17b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$31.3, the company appears about fair value at a 9.5% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Fox as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.047. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for FoxStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is not viewed as a risk.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Media market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result.

For instance after a resolution at Fox calling for more lobbying disclosure received support from 43% of votes cast in 2021, the company published a ""political activities report"" detailing much of its spending.(Reporting by Ross Kerber and Helen Coster; Editing by David Gregorio)]"

Tucker Carlson parted ways with the network shortly after his commentary regarding former President Donald Trump came to light during Fox’s trial with Dominion.Once Carlson departed Fox, loyal viewers left the show in droves, resulting in a tanking stock price. In fact, Fox Corporation (NASDAQ:FOX) stock lost 5% of its value, or $962 million, in just one day.However, there are a few conservative stocks to buy that have the potential to be great long-term plays. Check out these conservative stocks below and why you should consider adding them to your portfolio.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsSinclair Broadcast Group (SBGI)n this photo illustration the Sinclair Broadcast Group (SGBI) logo seen displayed on a smartphoneSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.comSinclair Broadcast Group (NASDAQ:SBGI) is the second-largest television station operator in the U.S., with 185 stations in 86 markets. It owns approximately 600 channels, with 150 of those being associated with major news networks like ABC, FOX, NBC and CBS.While it has exposure to Fox News, it’s also diversified among other channels that cater to more liberal audiences like NBC. It provides exposure to various channels, which minimizes risk if one channel’s stock should see a steep decline.At the time of writing, SBGI stock is currently trading at roughly $17, which is moderately above its 52-week low of $12.64. It has an impressive 6% forward dividend yield and has been increasing its dividend since 2017. This stock is profitable and growing since it has a healthy return on equity of 30.21% and a net profit margin of 7.32%. While this is one of the better Tucker Carlson stocks, investors should also be mindful of its relatively high debt-to-equity ratio of 4.91.Rumble (RUM)Illustrative Editorial of RUMBLE.COM website homepage.

They can also upload their own videos and subscribe to creator content similar to on YouTube. Unlike YouTube, however, this Tucker Carlson stock caters to a more conservative audience and prides itself on creating technology that is “immune to cancel culture.”Story continuesWhile Tucker Carlson’s departure caused this stock to lose $235 million of its value, it still has room to run. Its current price is about $10, which is between its 52-week low of $5.81 and 52-week high of $17.23. Rumble is trying to attract a more conservative audience that would likely be looking for alternative news sources. This conservative stock is seeing significant growth. Its three-year revenue growth is 127.15. It also has minimal debt, with a debt-to-equity ratio of roughly 0.01. Despite this conservative stock’s potential, it still hasn’t turned a profit yet. New York Times (NYT)A photo of a person reading the Feb. 16, 2020 issue of the New York Times.Source: pio3 / Shutterstock.comThe New York Times (NYSE:NYT) is known for its trademark newspaper, The New York Times. Aside from the domestic version, it also offers an international version as well as digital properties, including several smartphone apps. Unlike Fox, this is a stock that caters to a more liberal audience. However, disillusioned former Fox viewers could even turn to this outlet for their daily news given its strong reputation.At nearly $37 at the time of writing, it’s smack dab in the middle of its 52-week low of $27.59 and high of $42.40. This stock has room to run since its revenue grew from $1,783.64 to $2,331.64 (millions) from 2019-2023. Besides having room for growth, this stock is relatively stable since it has no debt, a respectable return on equity of 12.48 and a 8.21% net profit margin.

Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. With that in mind, the ROCE of Cummins (NYSE:CMI) looks decent, right now, so lets see what the trend of returns can tell us.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Cummins is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.17 = US$3.2b ÷ (US$31b - US$12b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).So, Cummins has an ROCE of 17%.  In absolute terms, that's a satisfactory return, but compared to the Machinery industry average of 11% it's much better. See our latest analysis for Cummins roceIn the above chart we have measured Cummins' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Cummins here  for free.What Does the ROCE Trend For Cummins Tell Us?The trend of ROCE doesn't stand out much, but returns on a whole are decent. Over the past five years, ROCE has remained relatively flat at around 17% and the business has deployed 55% more capital into its operations. 17% is a pretty standard return, and it provides some comfort knowing that Cummins has consistently earned this amount. Over long periods of time, returns like these might not be too exciting, but with consistency they can pay off in terms of share price returns.In Conclusion...The main thing to remember is that Cummins has proven its ability to continually reinvest at respectable rates of return. And since the stock has risen strongly over the last five years, it appears the market might expect this trend to continue. So while the positive underlying trends may be accounted for by investors, we still think this stock is worth looking into further.Story continuesCummins does have some risks though, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for Cummins  that you might be interested in.For those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free list of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

That opens the company up to more criticism and a potential row with one of its biggest advertisers, Walt Disney Co., which is engaged in an escalating dispute with DeSantis, Florida’s Republican governor, over his policies in the state.It’s also a break from the typical decorum held by social media leaders, who for years have faced scrutiny from users and policy makers about the potential bias of their ubiquitous platforms. While Musk has been open about his political opinions — before the US midterm elections in 2022, he advised users to vote Republican – this pushes Twitter further into being a partisan platform, and risks alienating other constituencies as well as advertisers averse to aligning with a particular political party.Read More: Managing Musk Will Be New Twitter CEO’s Biggest Challenge“I’m not at this time going to endorse any particular candidate but I am interested in X/Twitter being somewhat of a public town square,” Musk said Tuesday at the Wall Street Journal’s CEO Council Summit. Last November, Musk said in a tweet that he would support DeSantis if he ran for president in 2024.Story continuesDeSantis will join Musk at 6 p.m. ET in a Twitter Spaces audio livestream on Wednesday, according to people familiar with the plans, and the campaign will release a launch video. DeSantis in Florida has pushed positions that aren’t nationally popular, such as a ban on abortions after 6 weeks, an expansion of capital punishment, permitless concealed carry of guns and strict limits on how race and gender can be discussed in schools.Twitter, along with Meta Platforms Inc.’s Facebook and Instagram, have power over what their users see, to the extent that during the 2016 elections Russia tried to manipulate the content on those platforms in order to affect US public opinion. The social networks have stuck to the refrain that they are non-partisan platforms that have worked to improve the accuracy of the information people see, and say they have enforced their guidelines equitably across both sides of the political aisle.Read more: Meta’s Instagram Readies Twitter Competitor for Summer DebutSan Francisco-based Twitter has been a key platform for real-time information while people are voting and deciding how to vote. Under its past leadership, the company devoted extensive resources during elections to labeling or removing content that could affect the voting process. Approximately 300,000 posts were labeled as disputed or misleading, and in some cases, tweets were put behind warnings that users had to click past to view. Notably, Twitter banned former President Donald Trump in the wake of the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol out of concern his posts were inciting violence, after hiding several of his tweets.It’s not clear what advertising and content policies Musk, who bought Twitter last year for $44 billion, will carry through to the next election.“This checks off a lot of boxes for DeSantis,” said Katie Harbath, who previously ran election policy at Facebook. It indicates an alignment with Twitter’s conservative audience and “needles Trump on the platform that he used to dominate.”For years, social media platforms, including Twitter and Facebook, were accused by Republican lawmakers and conservative pundits of squelching right-leaning voices and discourse. Both have taken pains to make their platforms more welcoming to a broad range of views, and more recently, some of Facebook’s most popular pages have come to be dominated by far-right groups. Under Musk, Twitter has also proven hospitable to conservative — and in some cases, fringe-right — viewpoints.The effort to appear non-partisan has been essential to keeping the platforms in the good graces of lawmakers and, perhaps more importantly, to their advertisers. For marketers, optics matter. Many businesses don’t want to pay money for their ads to sit alongside posts advocating violence, amplifying threats or spreading harmful misinformation.Advertisers were already fleeing Twitter because of the company’s failure to moderate content or prevent their ads from appearing next to problematic tweets. Since Musk took over, advertising revenue has declined by 50%, Musk said in March.Disney, one of Twitter’s largest advertisers according to Musk, has continued buying ads on the platform, but that could potentially change as the platform begins amplifying DeSantis, who has been publicly feuding with Disney.Disney is in a major fight with DeSantis over state legislation on sexual identity, oversight of municipal services at the company’s parks and other issues. Disney has a large presence in Florida, where it operates its flagship theme park and employs about 70,000 people. The company has been using its economic heft to push back against DeSantis. Earlier this month Disney scrapped scrapped plans to build a nearly $1 billion corporate campus in the state.Disney didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekAssault Allegations Plague a $1.4 Billion Home Eldercare StartupSergey Brin Has a Secret Plan to Put Airships Back in the SkiesAdidas After YeezyYou’re the CEO and Your Company Got Hacked—What Now?There’s Still Scary Stuff in Sunscreen©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

We also note that EDPFY has a PEG ratio of 1.27. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. EXC currently has a PEG ratio of 2.55.Another notable valuation metric for EDPFY is its P/B ratio of 1.21. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, EXC has a P/B of 1.59.These metrics, and several others, help EDPFY earn a Value grade of B, while EXC has been given a Value grade of C.Story continuesEDPFY is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook, which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model.

Prudential does not undertake to update any particular forward-looking statement included in this document.Non-GAAP MeasuresThis release includes a reference to adjusted operating income. Adjusted operating income is a non-GAAP measure used by the Company to evaluate segment performance and to allocate resources. Adjusted operating income excludes ""Realized investment gains (losses), net, and related charges and adjustments"". A significant element of realized investment gains and losses are impairments and credit-related and interest rate-related gains and losses. Impairments and losses from sales of credit-impaired securities, the timing of which depends largely on market credit cycles, can vary considerably across periods. The timing of other sales that would result in gains or losses, such as interest rate-related gains or losses, is largely subject to our discretion and influenced by market opportunities as well as our tax and capital profile.Realized investment gains (losses) within certain businesses for which such gains (losses) are a principal source of earnings, and those associated with terminating hedges of foreign currency earnings and current period yield adjustments, are included in adjusted operating income. Adjusted operating income generally excludes realized investment gains and losses from products that contain embedded derivatives, and from associated derivative portfolios that are part of an asset-liability management program related to the risk of those products. Adjusted operating income also excludes gains and losses from changes in value of certain assets and liabilities relating to foreign currency exchange movements that have been economically hedged or considered part of our capital funding strategies for our international subsidiaries, as well as gains and losses on certain investments that are designated as trading. Adjusted operating income also excludes investment gains and losses on assets supporting experience-rated contractholder liabilities and changes in experience-rated contractholder liabilities due to asset value changes, because these recorded changes in asset and liability values are expected to ultimately accrue to contractholders. Additionally, adjusted operating income excludes the changes in fair value of equity securities that are recorded in net income.Adjusted operating income excludes ""Change in value of market risk benefits, net of related hedging gains (losses)"", which reflects the impact from changes in current market conditions, and market experience updates, reflecting the immediate impacts in current period results from changes in current market conditions on estimates of profitability, which we believe enhances the understanding of underlying performance trends. Adjusted operating income also excludes the results of Divested and Run-off Businesses, which are not relevant to our ongoing operations, and discontinued operations and earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests, each of which is presented as a separate component of net income under GAAP. Additionally, adjusted operating income excludes other items, such as certain components of the consideration for acquisitions, which are recognized as compensation expense over the requisite service periods, and goodwill impairments. Earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests is presented as a separate component of net income under GAAP and excluded from adjusted operating income. The tax effect associated with pre-tax adjusted operating income is based on applicable IRS and foreign tax regulations inclusive of pertinent adjustments.Adjusted operating income does not equate to ""Net income"" as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Adjusted operating income is not a substitute for income determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and our definition of adjusted operating income may differ from that used by other companies. The items above are important to an understanding of our overall results of operations. However, we believe that the presentation of adjusted operating income as we measure it for management purposes enhances the understanding of our results of operations by highlighting the results from ongoing operations and the underlying profitability of our businesses. Trends in the underlying profitability of our businesses can be more clearly identified without the fluctuating effects of the items described above.We believe that our use of this non-GAAP measure helps investors understand and evaluate the Company’s performance and financial position. The presentation of adjusted operating income as we measure it for management purposes enhances the understanding of the results of operations by highlighting the results from ongoing operations and the underlying profitability of our businesses. Trends in the underlying profitability of our businesses can be more clearly identified without the fluctuating effects of the items described below. However, this non-GAAP measure is not a substitute for net income determined in accordance with GAAP, and the adjustments made to derive this measure is important to an understanding of our overall results of operations and financial position.Due to the inherent difficulty in reliably quantifying future realized investment gains/losses and changes in asset and liability values given their unknown timing and potential significance, we cannot, without unreasonable effort, provide an estimate of expected lost net income, which is the GAAP measure most comparable to adjusted operating income.DisclaimersAnnuities are issued by Pruco Life Insurance Company, Newark, NJ (main office) and distributed by Prudential Annuities Distributors, Inc., Shelton, CT.

It banned them from computers that handle sensitive information.That came after Washington, Japan and the Netherlands blocked Chinese access to technology to make advanced processor chips on security grounds at a time when the ruling Communist Party is threatening to attack Taiwan and is more assertive toward its other Asian neighbors.“China’s cybersecurity review does not target specific countries or regions,” Mao said. “We do not exclude technologies and products from any country.”Companies on both sides have been buffeted by supply disruptions and lost sales revenue.Restrictions by Washington and its allies on access to chips and tools to make them hamper China’s efforts to develop its own chip industry. U.S. vendors have lost billions of dollars of potential sales to Chinese smartphone makers, chip foundries and other customers.Mao complained the United States has imposed restrictions on more than 1,200 Chinese companies on security grounds “without any factual basis.” She accused Washington of misusing national security as an excuse to “unreasonably suppress Chinese companies.”“This is economic coercion and is unacceptable,” Mao said.The U.S. government is “engaging directly” with Beijing to “make our view clear” about the Micron ban, State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Monday.“We have very serious concerns,” said Miller. Referring to the People’s Republic of China, he said, “This action appears inconsistent with the PRC’s assertions that it is open for business and committed to a transparent regulatory framework.”Story continuesMicron will cooperate with the Chinese regulator and is evaluating the ban’s impact, according to its chief financial officer, Mark Murphy.“We remain unclear as to what security concerns exist,” Murphy said on a JP Morgan technology industry conference call. “We’ve had no complaints from customers on the security of our products.”Micron estimates it might lose sales equivalent to a single digit percentage of total revenue, but the final figure depends on what customers and products are affected, Murphy said.On Tuesday, Foreign Minister Qin Gang pressed his Dutch counterpart for access to chipmaking technology that has been blocked on security grounds.China needs a machine available only from a single Dutch company, ASML Holding NV, that uses ultraviolet light to etch microscopic circuits on next-generation chips. Without that, the ruling party's efforts to develop chips for smartphones, artificial intelligence and other advanced applications are stalled.“China has serious concerns about this,” Qin said. “We should work together to jointly protect the normal trade order between us” and ""keep the global industrial and supply chains stable.”The Dutch minister, Wopke Hoekstra, said he “shared our national security concerns” and gave no indication his government's position changed.___Micron Technology Inc.: www.micron.com]"

Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.Meanwhile, the ruling by regulators that Micron products are a threat to national security and China's key information infrastructure operators - from banks to telecom operators - has been met with relative silence from industry operators.Few Chinese companies have stepped up to publicly pledge compliance with the ruling or to denounce Micron products, while Chinese vendors of Micron products said they have seen little impact from the decision so far.A customer service person at Crucial, Micron's consumer product brand founded in 1996, said via a consumer inquiry on e-commerce site JD.com that they have not received any notice to remove products from the store as of Tuesday, and that they can be ""purchased and delivered as normal"".The online store currently has dozens of Micron solid state drives (SSD) and dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) products on sale, ranging from 8GB DRAM priced at 129 yuan (US$18.30) to 4TB SSD priced at 1,999 yuan. The best selling product is a 1TB SSD, embedded with 176-layer NAND, priced at 318 yuan.Story continuesMicron has said it is communicating with Chinese authorities about the decision. Meanwhile, chief financial officer Mark Murphy said it estimates the impact is ""in the low single digits percentage of the company's total revenue at the low end, and high single digits percentage of total revenue at the high end"".However, the US Commerce Department described the ruling, along with recent raids on US consultancy firms in China, as a violation of Beijing's commitment to an open market economy and a transparent regulatory framework. Beijing has denied that this is the case.An editorial by the Chinese Communist Party-controlled tabloid Global Times said the Micron ruling was fact-based and the result of ""a seven-week investigation by the General Administration of Customs"" and a cybersecurity review by China's cybersecurity watchdog the Cybersecurity Administration of China.""Many foreign media outlets have included this matter in the scope of the US-China tech war, suggesting that it could lead to an escalation of the 'tech war' ... however, it needs to be said that the reality is not so,"" said the editorial. ""The so-called 'national security' of the US is a unilateral and anti-market suppression of China's technology, while China's security review of Micron is to effectively safeguard its own security interests.""It continued that ""any company must operate in compliance with the laws and those involved in illegal undertakings are subject to investigations"".ICWise, a Shanghai-based consultancy, published a research note on Tuesday, saying China's punishment of Micron is ""relatively restrained"" and that the country can afford to sanction Micron because its products can easily be substituted in the Chinese market.Zhang Chao, a merchant who runs a memory product store on Alibaba Group Holding's Taobao.com, said that even if China's ban reaches the consumer end, it will likely have a small impact as these Micron products account for ""a very low proportion"" of market share.""I don't think the ban will have a significant impact on my business,"" said Zhang.

279,31cd2f46-93e9-3895-aaf3-65b9bcbd14e3,MU,2023-05-24,China was reducing Micron chip purchases years before ban,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysis-china-reducing-micron-chip-084408763.html,1684917848,STORY,['MU'],"[By Eduardo BaptistaBEIJING (Reuters) - In the years before China declared U.S. firm Micron Technology's products a national security risk, authorities were already scaling back purchases of its chips, opting instead for domestic or South Korean options, documents showed.A Reuters review of over a hundred public government tenders found that while previously Chinese government authorities regularly put out purchase requests for Micron's chips for use in projects such as tax systems to surveillance networks, such requests dried up dramatically from 2020.Instead, the bulk of memory chip purchases from such entities have gone to domestic firms including Huawei Technologies, server maker Inspur as well as surveillance giants Uniview and Hikvision.While China's sudden move this week to block key industries from using Micron products appeared to be the result of heightened Sino-U.S. tensions, the tender documents suggest Beijing had laid the groundwork for years, in effect limiting the disruptions caused by such a ban.At the same time, analysts say the biggest U.S. memory chip maker had become an easier target if Beijing wanted to retaliate against Washington's curbs on tech exports, given China's own advances in memory chip production.""Most of its chips are replaceable with Chinese-made alternatives, and for those that are not, there are other foreign firms whose chips China can procure,"" said Alfredo Montufar-Helu, Beijing-based head of think tank The Conference Board's China Center.""So banning Micron’s products does not hurt China.""China's cyberspace regulator, which conducted the review of Micron's products, did not specify what security risks they found.In response to Reuters' request for comment, a Micron spokesperson said the company was ""assessing next steps"" in response to the ban but did not comment on questions about tenders.China's State Council did not respond to a request for comment.Story continuesDOMESTIC DRIVEIt was not clear from the tenders why requests from government-affiliated entities for Micron products dried up so dramatically from 2020, including what effect the pandemic may have had over that period.There were only four tenders that mentioned Micron products over the past three years. They include a tender by a weather bureau from Changzhou city, in the eastern province of Jiangsu, for two dozen storage devices, and a hospital in Zouping city, in the eastern province of Shandong, for an image sensor.By contrast, prior to 2020, Micron's products were sought by a range of local government bodies for projects that include sensitive work such as upgrades of surveillance camera and facial recognition networks in large cities.Micron chips, for example, were one of the many products purchased in two big tenders offered in 2019 -- one worth 187 million yuan ($27.05 million) and the other 29 million yuan -- from police authorities in the southern factory hub of Dongguan.An August 2015 tender also showed that China's National Tax Administration spent over 5.6 million yuan on purchasing almost 8,000 Micron chips for servers in its invoice system.China has for over a decade had a long-running campaign to reduce reliance on foreign technologies, asking state affiliated firms such as banks to switch to local software and promoting domestic chip manufacturing.Beijing ratcheted up the campaign in 2020, when its leaders proposed a so-called ""dual circulation"" growth model to reduce reliance on overseas markets and technology.Several tenders from the past year had ""domestic made"" product requirement requests.For example, a January tender for a ""smart public security"" project in the southern city of Taishan explicitly requested flash memory chips be domestically produced, assigning it almost 200,000 yuan.The project is made up of several hundred different pieces of hardware and software, with Hikvision supplying 41 of these, Huawei products accounting for 16, and an unspecified ""domestic made"" request tagged on 288 other products.To be sure, government procurement databases often redact or eschew sensitive details, and more information on Micron orders is likely available on paid-for private tender document databases.Chips made by South Korea's SK Hynix and Samsung Electronics also continued to be included in large government contracts, but often to supplement domestic products.Meanwhile, U.S. firms are still big players with Intel processors, Nvidia GPUs, and Dell servers purchased by hundreds of government bodies since 2020.However, for Micron, the dramatic drop in government tenders for its chips adds to the U.S. firm's troubles in China.In 2018, Micron became embroiled in a patent dispute with Chinese state-backed chip maker Fujian Jinhua, accusing it of conspiring to steal trade secrets.The dispute led to a temporary sales ban of Micron's main products in China that year, and was followed by a shutdown of its DRAM operations in Shanghai last year amid escalating trade tension with Washington.China was once Micron's biggest market, generating half of its $20 billion revenue in fiscal 2017 - that share shrank to just 16% last year.""Micron has been in the ‘eye of the hurricane’ for quite some time already, with its operations in China facing increasing challenges over the past years,"" said analyst Montufar-Helu.On Monday, Micron forecast a percentage hit to revenue from China's action in the single digits.(This story has been refiled to correct description to eastern Shandong province, not northeastern)($1 = 6.9121 Chinese yuan)(Reporting by Eduardo Baptista in Beijing; Editing by Brenda Goh, Miyoung Kim and Sam Holmes)]"

TECHNOLOGYThe United States has targeted Chinese companies across the technology sector, from export controls on semiconductor and artificial intelligence firms to a possible ban on short video app TikTok, owned by China's ByteDance, from the U.S. market.The U.S. says it wants to stop key technologies from reaching China's military and has accused TikTok of being a security risk due to the user data it handles. The Chinese government and companies have denied the accusations.Memory chip maker Micron became the first U.S. technology firm to be targeted by China, which barred key infrastructure makers from buying Micron products, citing national security.The chair of a U.S. House of Representatives' committee on China said the U.S. should put trade curbs on Chinese memory chip maker Changxin Memory Technologies in response.CONSULTANCIESA Chinese crackdown on its consultancy and due diligence sector brought a raid on the Beijing office of U.S. due diligence firm Mintz, and the detention of five Chinese staff members. China said Mintz was suspected of engaging in unlawful business. Police later visited the Shanghai office of U.S. management consultancy Bain &amp; Co.Washington called such incidents ""inconsistent"" with China's assertions it is opening its markets and is committed to a transparent regulatory framework. China's state media said it was ""intensifying"" protection of national security.Authorities also targeted Shanghai-headquartered Capvision, which runs China's largest ""expert network"" group, accusing it of aiding overseas institutions to steal secrets in areas such as the military and technology. Capvision said it would abide by security rules and take the lead in ensuring the consulting industry was compliant.Story continuesTAIWANChina has stepped up military and diplomatic pressure to force democratically governed Taiwan to accept Chinese sovereignty. Taiwan rejects China's claims.While the United States has long followed a policy of ""strategic ambiguity"" on whether it would intervene militarily to protect Taiwan in the event of a Chinese attack, U.S. President Joe Biden has said he would be willing to use force to defend it.SPYING, FOREIGN INFLUENCEChina is facing a backlash from the United States and other Western governments over its efforts to exert influence beyond its borders, including the use of secret 'police stations' that target dissidents and financial crime suspects.China has disputed the existence of such facilities but has said there are volunteer-run centres abroad that help citizens renew documents and other services.Washington and Beijing clashed in February after the U.S. shot down what it suspected was a Chinese spy balloon over U.S. airspace. China has said it was a civilian airship.In May, China convicted a 78-year-old U.S. citizen and Hong Kong resident of espionage and jailed him for life. It did not give specifics of his offence.RUSSIA/UKRAINEThe United States has said it is concerned by greater alignment between China and Russia and has accused China of considering providing weapons for Russia's war in Ukraine.While China has stood by Russia, resisting Western pressure to isolate it, it denies any direct involvement in Ukraine and says it wants to promote a peaceful resolution.This week, China and Russia responded furiously to a G7 summit that singled out both on a range of issues. Russia called the summit an ""incubator"" for anti-Russian and anti-Chinese hysteria.(Reporting by Brenda Goh; Editing by Robert Birsel)]"

That’s in response to Beijing this week blocking Micron from supplying Chinese critical infrastructure on national security grounds, an unusual move that’s already ignited accusations of over-reach.Gallagher wants Changxin on a list that already encompasses many of China’s largest technology companies, including networking leader Huawei Technologies Co. and its largest storage firm Yangtze Memory Technologies Co. The Entities List blocks the shipment of everything from American software to circuitry without licenses, effectively preventing access to the building blocks of much of modern technology.The tensions over technology have been brewing since the US imposed sweeping export restrictions on semiconductor equipment and knowhow to China, aimed at stifling its chip sector development, and set off dueling accusations of “economic coercion.”John Kirby, spokesman for the US National Security Council, said Wednesday that China’s ban on Boise, Idaho-based Micron was intended to undermine the Group of Seven consensus on countering perceived hostile policies by Beijing, but won’t derail White House efforts to restore high-level talks, including between leaders Joe Biden and Xi Jinping.Story continuesGallagher’s Republican colleague Michael McCaul, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, also criticized Beijing’s move on Micron and called for a response.“The Biden administration and our allies and partners must make every act of coercion more costly to the CCP,” he said, referring to the Chinese Communist Party. “I urge the administration to use the many authorities Congress has given it to hold the CCP accountable.”Read more: Xi’s Micron Ban Shows His Limited Options to Hit Back at USWashington should lean on allies such as South Korea to try and prevent Micron’s peers from stepping in to fill the void in China after the Micron action, argued Gallagher, who chairs the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party. Samsung Electronics Co. and SK Hynix Inc. dominate the world’s supply of memory chips, which power most electronics as well as servers and smartphones.“This is the latest example of PRC economic coercion, designed to intimidate the U.S. government from implementing export controls and harass the U.S. companies that abide by them,” Gallagher, who’s known for his hawkish stance on China, wrote in a statement.“The Commerce Department should also ensure no U.S.-export licenses granted to foreign semiconductor memory firms operating in the PRC are used to backfill Micron, and our South Korean allies, who have experienced exactly this kind of CCP economic coercion firsthand in recent years, should likewise act to prevent backfilling.”Read more: Chinese Chip Rival to Samsung Seeks IPO at $14.5 Billion ValueChina’s foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning on Wednesday defended the government’s Micron decision.“The cybersecurity review on Micron’s products sold in China is carried out according to China’s laws and the decision was made based on facts,” she told reporters at a regular press briefing in Beijing.The US “without any evidence” has listed scores of Chinese companies and individuals “into all kinds of lists and imposed all kinds of restrictions,” she added. “That is what economic coercion is.”Changxin Memory is one of a handful of major Chinese firms that embody Beijing’s ambitions to match the US technologically, particularly in the semiconductors that drive most advances from AI to self-driving cars. It plans to file for a domestic initial public offering this year that could value the Chinese chipmaker at more than $14.5 billion, a milestone debut that could help galvanize the country’s technology aspirations.Changxin is already one of the largest Chinese makers of DRAM storage chips, an industry that could serve as a launchpad for more advanced semiconductor development down the road.--With assistance from Lucille Liu, Ramsey Al-Rikabi and Jennifer Jacobs.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekAssault Allegations Plague a $1.4 Billion Home Eldercare StartupRepublicans Hail Big Spending Cuts That Economists Say Will Have Little Impact on the EconomyOpioid Crisis Spurred by Animal Sedative’s Stealth EmergenceSergey Brin Has a Secret Plan to Put Airships Back in the SkiesAdidas After Yeezy©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

FIS currently has a ratio of 9.2X, much lower than the industry average of 21.2X.The company expects promising growth from account-to-account payments in the coming days. This method is expected to decrease the cost of payment acceptance for merchants. It is crucial as the global e-commerce market is expected to hit around $8.5 trillion by 2026 despite the current volatility witnessed in economy.Story continuesRising travel volumes are expected to benefit Fidelity National’s Merchant Solutions segment revenues. With consumer spending expected to witness a rapid recovery and cross-border transactions likely to improve over the coming quarters, the Merchant Solutions business will gain heavily.FIS’ well-performing Banking and Capital Markets businesses are major positives. It focuses on top-tier strategic partnerships and future-proof underlying technologies to grow its operations. The company’s growing footprint in the crypto market is praiseworthy. It has partnered with cryptocurrency platforms like Crypto.com and OKCoin to support their respective global expansions. Further, its partnership with bitcoin-focused financial services and technology provider NYDIG is likely to increase traffic to its Digital One Mobile application.Inorganic growth strategies like the Payrix acquisition help the company to scale its business, capture more market share and boost capabilities. Also, FIS does not shy away from shedding non-core assets to boost efficiency and profitability. Currently, it has plans to opt for a tax-free spin-off of its Merchant Solutions business.Key ConcernsThere are a few factors that are impeding the stock’s growth lately.Increasing costs are eating into its profits. Selling, general and administrative expenses saw a CAGR of 26% over the last five years ending 2022. The growing costs due to a multi-year modernization of platforms and applications are anticipated to keep its margins under pressure.Also, its high long-term debt, excluding the current portion, of $13,905 million at the first-quarter end was significantly higher than the cash and cash equivalents of $1,871 million. Nevertheless, we believe that a systematic and strategic plan of action bodes well for the long run.Better-Ranked PlayersSome better-ranked stocks in the broader business services space are Remitly Global, Inc. RELY, Paysafe Limited PSFE and Repay Holdings Corporation RPAY, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Remitly Global’s 2023 earnings indicates a 7.4% increase from the prior-year reported number.

PSFE’s earnings beat estimates in three of the last four quarters and met the mark once, the average surprise being 190.5%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Repay Holdings’ 2023 bottom line has increased 1.3% in the past 60 days.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: McDonald's MCD, W.W. Grainger GWW and Cardinal Health CAH.Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:3 Top S&amp;P 500 Stocks to Buy as Index Takes On 4200 MarkThe S&amp;P 500 Index, despite making more than a few attempts, failed to finish above the coveted 4,200 mark since August 2022. Antagonistic debt ceiling negotiations and banks’ credit crunch issues prevented the index from exceeding the desired level. Needless to mention, consumer sentiment has also taken a beating recently amid worries that a recession may be arriving this year.But for a brief period, the broader index did trade above the 4,200 level last week and is now well positioned to push above it in the near term. This is because President Joe Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy ended their latest discussion over the debt ceiling crisis on an optimistic note.Kevin McCarthy himself said that it has been a “productive discussion,” which undoubtedly gave hope that the debt ceiling may be raised and the U.S. government won’t run out of cash to pay for its liabilities, thereby preventing the economy from heading into a recession.Meanwhile, run-on deposits led to the collapse of the Silicon Valley Bank. This led to a contagion effect and, in the end, impacted various other regional lenders, such as Signature Bank and First Republic Bank.However, the Federal Reserve has been pumping money into the banking system and has introduced a new Bank Term Funding Program that would protect the lenders in times of distress. Lest we forget, after the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. took over the Silicon Valley Bank, reserve balances with Federal Reserve Banks did surge.Story continuesLet us also admit fears of an imminent recession got dashed, thanks to a stronger-than-expected labor market. Jobs were added at a strong clip last month and reversed a cooling trend. Employers added 253,000 new jobs in April, way more than analysts’ estimate of job additions of 180,000.At the same time, the jobless rate matched the lowest reading since 1969 as it came in at 3.4% for April, down from 3.5% in March, added the Labor Department (read more: 4 Stocks to Gain as U.S. Job Market Remains on Solid Footing).Thus, banking on these recent strengths, it’s prudent for investors to place bets on fundamentally sound stocks listed on the S&amp;P 500 Index that are poised to scale upward along with the broader index.

Bigwigs for Solid Returns in the Near Term,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-must-buy-u-bigwigs-120700863.html,1684843620,STORY,"['META', 'MCD', 'BKNG', 'NOW', 'CMG']","[U.S. stock markets have witnessed rangebound trading in May. Investors seem confused about the movements of the market. The primary reason is that the economy is currently facing a dichotomy. At present, the positive factors and the negative factors carry equal weight. This makes market participants decisions tough.Market participants remained concerned about the next move that the Fed would announce after its June FOMC meeting. At present, the CME FedWatch is showing an 80% probability that the central bank will keep unchanged the benchmark lending rate at 5-5.25%. However, 20% of respondents have projected that the rate will be hiked by another 25 basis points.A few Fed officials have already started saying that an abrupt termination of the ongoing rate hike regime will not take inflation to the 2% target rate. However, more rate hikes will have severe consequences on the regional banking industry. In his post-FOMC statement in May, Fed Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged that the current banking turmoil in the United States has led to tighter credit conditions, and is likely to impact economic activities. Meanwhile, defying a rangebound market, a handful of stocks of U.S. corporate behemoths have provided double-digit or near double-digit returns in the past three months with more upside left. These stocks carry a favorable Zacks Rank indicating solid returns in the near-term.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five U.S. corporate giants (market capital &gt; $50 billion), which have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 30 days. Each of our picks sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The chart below shows the price performance of our five picks in the past three months.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMeta Platforms Inc. META is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific. Increased engagement for its products like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver. META is considered to have pioneered the concept of social networking.Story continuesHowever, as developed regions mature, Meta Platforms will take measures to drive penetration in the emerging markets of South East Asia, Latin America and Africa. Of all places, India deserves a-special mention in terms of user growth. The world’s most populated country offers tremendous potential for META. With China off the radar, India can prove to be a terrific growth engine for Meta.Meta Platform has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 9% and 22.5%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 15.2% over the last 30 days. The stock price of META has soared 45.3% in the past three months.Booking Holdings Inc. BKNG is benefiting from a substantial improvement in its booking trends. Solid growth in domestic bookings is contributing well. Further, BKNG is experiencing solid momentum in international regions, which is a positive. Strong growth in rental car, airline ticket units and booked room nights is another positive.Also, solid momentum across the agency, merchant, and advertising and other businesses is a tailwind for BKNG, with an expected year-over-year revenue rise of 2.3%, 18.7% and 8.2%, respectively, in 2023. Further, strengthening alternative accommodation business and flight capabilities are major positives. We expect 2023 total revenues to be up 9.5% from 2022.Booking Holdings has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 19.9% and 36.5%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 4.6% over the last 30 days. The stock price of BKNG has surged 10% in the past three months.Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. CMG has been benefiting from its strong comparable restaurant sales growth, digital efforts, Chipotlane add-ons and menu innovation.

MCD continues to impress investors with robust comps growth. MCD’s increased focus on menu innovation and loyalty program expansion is commendable. MCD is also undertaking every effort to drive growth in international markets. Robust digitalization is likely to help McDonald's in driving long-term growth and capture market share.

New solutions — Automated Service Suggestions, Service Request Playbook and Workplace Scenario Planning — are helping it win new customers.

Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends.

291,65334959-4b2b-30db-b926-394fc7241a73,UPS,2023-05-24,"Here is What to Know Beyond Why United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS) is a Trending Stock",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-united-parcel-130007603.html,1684846807,STORY,['UPS'],"[United Parcel Service (UPS) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this package delivery service have returned -12.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +1.6% change. The Zacks Transportation - Air Freight and Cargo industry, to which UPS belongs, has lost 8.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, UPS is expected to post earnings of $2.54 per share, indicating a change of -22.8% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -5.2% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.78 points to a change of -16.7% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -6.4%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $11.40 indicates a change of +5.7% from what UPS is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -2.3%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, UPS is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for UPS _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For UPS, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $22.93 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -7.4%. For the current and next fiscal years, $96.45 billion and $99.22 billion estimates indicate -3.9% and +2.9% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryUPS reported revenues of $22.93 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -6%. EPS of $2.20 for the same period compares with $3.05 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $22.94 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.05%. The EPS surprise was +0.46%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.UPS is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about UPS. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Click to skip ahead and see the 5 Best Spring Stocks To Buy Now.If historical trends are anything to go by (and they usually are), then financial stocks like Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), as well as a wide range of energy stocks will be some of the best stocks to buy this spring.The Running of the Spring BullsThe stock market has traditionally performed very well during the spring, which is then followed by a summer swoon as institutional investors like hedge funds pare back their holdings in anticipation of lower summer trading volumes (and the resultant spike in volatility) and more time off for staff.That’s particularly true of the NYSE, with April and May being the index’s strongest and third-strongest months over the past 20 years. The index has posted monthly gains during April over 16 of the past 20 years, while the index has risen during 14 of the past 20 Mays.It’s a similar story when it comes to the stocks that make up the S&amp;P 500, which have posted gains during 14 of the past 20 Marchs, 15 of the past 20 Mays, and 16 of the past 20 Aprils, the latter being the strongest performing month for the index. Spring has also been a good season for tech stocks, with the Nasdaq posting gains over 13 of the past 20 years in each of March, April, and May, ranking them in a tie as the third-best performing months for the index.Energy and Finance Stocks Do a Lot of Spring Cleaning (Up)When it comes to the performance of specific industries, energy and finance stocks have often been the runaway spring winners. According to CNBC, between 2001 and 2010, nearly half of all stocks that posted at least 20% gains during any given spring were either finance or energy stocks, with finance stocks leading the way.There’s a surprisingly strong historical correlation between the energy and financial sectors which makes their equally strong springs somewhat less surprising. Naturally, the energy sector is highly correlated with the price of West Texas crude, at 71%. What many investors may not know is that it’s also highly correlated with the finance sector, with the correlation between the S&amp;P 500 energy and finance indexes standing at 70% according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Story continuesIn terms of where the two sectors stand today, they’re somewhat at odds despite their strong stock market correlation. The banking sector is experiencing somewhat of a crisis, with many U.S. banks borrowing heavily but tightening their lending policies, which has some experts concerned about a forthcoming credit crunch.On the other hand, the energy sector looks like it has the potential to outperform the broader market for a third straight year in 2023 thanks to oil prices that are expected to steady but also rise this year, impressive free cash flow yields, and the lowest P/E ratio among all S&amp;P 500 sectors.With that in mind, let’s take a look at 12 spring stocks to buy now.12 Best Spring Stocks To Buy NowSource:unsplashOur MethodologyThe companies in the following list of the best spring stocks to buy now are gathered from the finance and energy sectors, traditionally the strongest performing sectors during the spring, and then ranked based on hedge fund sentiment. We follow a select group of hedge funds because Insider Monkey’s research has uncovered that their consensus stock picks can deliver outstanding returns.All hedge fund data is based on the exclusive group of 900+ funds tracked by Insider Monkey that filed 13Fs for the Q1 2023 reporting period.12 Best Spring Stocks To Buy Now12. Schlumberger Limited (NYSE:SLB)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 68 JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), and PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) are a few of the stocks that appear poised for strong springs. Another is oilfield services giant Schlumberger Limited (NYSE:SLB), which is coming off an exceptional 2022, growing revenue by 23% to $28.1 billion, including a 25% rise in services revenue. Earnings per share jumped by 70% to $2.18, while the company generated an impressive $3.7 billion in free cash flow.Schlumberger Limited (NYSE:SLB) believes the macro backdrop suggests a strong multi-year upcycle for the sector is ongoing, which should only increase the demand for Schlumberger’s services as investment in the space continues to pick up and new projects are launched.With things looking up over the longer term, Schlumberger has begun returning more cash to shareholders through buybacks and dividend hikes, though on the latter front, its dividend yield of 2.18% is still rather light compared to the industry average.VGI Partners made the following comment about Schlumberger Limited (NYSE:SLB) in its 2022 annual investor letter:“In addition to defence, we have focused our efforts on other new sectors where we see structural growth, including energy and medical technology. The long-term outlook for energy looks highly attractive given many years of under-investment and more recently amplified by ESG constraints and corporate discipline. Although we reviewed commodity owners (where we leveraged the expertise of the Regal resources team), we focused our efforts on the second derivative – the oil service companies. These are the picks-and-shovels of the industry and arguably the highest-quality way to gain exposure. As a result, we invested in Schlumberger Limited (NYSE:SLB) earlier this year and grew this to a circa 8% weight during the year (now circa 3%)”11. The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 70 The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) ranks as the 11th best spring stock to buy now and should be of particular interest to value investors. The company ranked third on our list of the Most Profitable Value Stocks Now after pulling in $8.79 in GAAP EPS during the first quarter, beating estimates by $0.69. Revenue did fall year-over-year however and analysts were mixed on the quarterly results.The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) is undertaking several initiatives to deal with the challenging macro environment, including the partial sale of its Marcus unsecured loan portfolio. With the pace of fundraising expected to slow throughout the rest of the year, the company is also scaling back its share repurchase program.Manole Capital Management discussed The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS)’s partnership with Apple in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Back in 2019, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) made a splash in the card industry by working with Apple and MasterCard on a credit card. The actual card is fairly sleek (as you can see below), as customers names are etched into an Apple titanium card. The no-fee card generated a lot of hype, as many early users were quick to post their latest card on various social media sites.The initial goal of Marcus (back in 2016) was to leverage Goldman’s wonderful name brand and build a full-service digital bank. This card was a large piece of GS’s ambitions to grow its retail banking franchise called Marcus. After 5 years, Marcus now has 14 million customers and $16 billion in loan balances. Surprisingly, Marcus now represents nearly 20% of the firm’s total revenue.We thought it would be interesting to look how the Apple Card is doing in terms of loans and exposures. With over $100 billion in assets, this has been a successful source of cheap deposits for GS. Despite having an institutional / “white shoe” brand in the investment banking and trading world, GS’s Apple Card has been a disappointment.” (Click here to read the full text)10. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 74 Hedge fund ownership of Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) has dipped by 14% over the past year after hitting a 10-year high in the first quarter of 2022. The company’s shareholders have been pressuring it to consider abandoning its fossil fuel investments, or at the very least to look into the potential costs of abandoning them versus the financial risks those investments could incur if the world achieves net-zero emissions by 2050. Exxon plans to invest as much as $25 billion annually over the next few years on various energy projects.While Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) believes the net-zero initiative is unlikely to succeed, it’s nonetheless looking into other ways to diversify into renewables, including the recent purchase of a 120,000-acre tract of land in Arkansas that’s believed to be rich in lithium. The company has also been expanding its EV charging network.First Eagle Investments Global Fund likes some of the other things Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) has been doing with its cash, as relayed in the fund’s Q2 2022 investor letter:“Integrated oil and gas giant Exxon Mobil performed well in the second quarter as continued high prices for energy products supported the stock. As the largest refiner in the US, the company has benefitted from wide “crack spreads,” or the margin between the cost of crude oil and the petroleum products extracted from it. Exxon continues to invest in refining capacity in the US, which industrywide has been in steady decline since 2019. We are pleased that Exxon has been using its strong cash flows to reduce debt and to return cash to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases.”9. ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 75 Hedge funds have been swarming into ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) in recent quarters, with ownership of the stock jumping by 50% since Q3 of 2021, which helped push the stock up to ninth on the list of top spring stocks to buy now. Steve Cohen’s Point72 Asset Management opened a new COP stake in Q1, while Louis Bacon’s Moore Global Investments did so in the fourth quarter of last year.ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) achieved record production of 1,792 MBOED in the first quarter beat earnings estimates by over 10% at $2.38. That could be just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to company’s earnings potential, as it recently unveiled a 10-year plan in which it projects to generate $225 billion in free cash flow at a modest West Texas price point of $60 per barrel. After accounting for capital expense during that timeframe, that could leave it with $100 billion or more in excess cash, the bulk of which will likely be returned to shareholders.Oakmark Global Fund revealed why it believes ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) shares to be undervalued in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) is one of the largest and lowest cost U.S. exploration and production companies in the country, led by CEO Ryan Lance—in our view one of the best value creators in the industry. ConocoPhillips’s share prices fell in the first quarter as oil prices receded, which is not atypical. We were buying the company at prices where it could generate its entire market cap in free cash flow over the next decade while growing the production such that at the end of that time, the base of production would be one-third higher. This sort of reinvestment opportunity is unique to ConocoPhillips and clearly not reflected in the current share price.”8. American Express Company (NYSE:AXP)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 79 The number of hedge funds long American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) hit a 10-year high in the first quarter and has risen in each of the past three quarters. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway maintained its gargantuan AXP holding during Q1, owning nearly 152 million AXP shares worth over $25 billion as of March 31.American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) was one of ten companies with “Great” Earnings Reports Jim Cramer is Talking About after the company grew revenue by 21.7% year-over-year to $14.3 billion, though its EPS of $2.40 missed estimates. Cramer characterized it as “a gigantic quarter with tremendous growth”.Some analysts weren’t quite as bullish on the results however. BMO Capital lowered its price target on American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) to $185 from $194, noting that the company’s growth is moderating while its credit losses are on the rise. Piper Sandler also lowered its price target on the stock, dropping it to $172 from $179, given expectations that comps will become more challenging later this year and into 2024 as consumer leverage rises.7. Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 81 Hedge funds continued to sell off Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) during Q1, with the number of funds long Citigroup falling for the 16th time in the last 21 quarters. Ownership of the stock has fallen by 37% during that time. Citigroup is another finance stock that Warren Buffett loves, while Lee Ainslie’s Maverick Capital was at the other end of the spectrum, selling off its Citi stake during Q1.Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) appears to be rather attractive from several standpoints, including its industry-low price-to-book ratio of 0.43x and its moderate price-to-earnings ratio of 6.39x. While Citi hasn’t raised its dividend payout in four years and still has a relatively high payout ratio compared to the industry average despite that, the company is expected to begin repurchasing shares again later this year.Diamond Hill Long-Short Fund noted that some of Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C)’s initiatives may be dilutive to the company’s earnings in the near-term as of the fund’s Q1 2022 investor letter:“Shares of Citigroup declined in the quarter as investors became increasingly negative on capital markets activity. The company is also continuing to divest certain consumer banking geographies which may be dilutive to earnings in the near term.”6. Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 85 Closing out the first part of our list of the best spring stocks to buy now is Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC). Several hedge funds bailed on Wells Fargo in the first quarter, including Warren Buffett, who otherwise maintains high conviction in several other finance stocks. The company nonetheless ranks as one of hedge funds’ top five picks among investment banks.Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC) bought back $4 billion worth of shares in Q1 and appears poised to continue buying back shares in the coming quarters. CEO Charlie Scharf recently stated that the company feels good about the size of its buffer zone above the regulatory minimums required to be held by banks to balance out their risk-weighted assets, which would allow them to continue buying back shares while otherwise remaining fiscally prudent.Davis New York Venture Fund is impressed by the resiliency of Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC)’s customers, as expressed in the fund’s 2022 annual investor letter:“Our investment thesis for our next largest bank investment, Wells Fargo, is totally different. As is well known, Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC) is the country’s third-largest bank, serving one in three U.S. households. Years of regulatory missteps under prior managements resulted in reputational damage, higher-than-average expenses, numerous consent orders, caps on asset growth, all added to the negative impact of low rates on their interest income. However, where others see bad news, we see resiliency and gradual improvement. Wells Fargo’s resiliency is reflected in the fact that despite years of terrible headlines and congressional hearings, Wells Fargo’s core customers stayed put and customer attrition remains extraordinarily low.As to gradual improvement, new management has made steady headway in closing consent orders, settling regulatory matters and upgrading systems. Thus, rather than increasing profits from growth, Wells Fargo’s earnings growth for the next three-to-five years should come from the combined tailwinds of rising interest income, partially offset by normalizing credit costs, reduced expenses as systems improve and the scandals of the last decade are gradually put behind them, and the return of excess capital through share repurchases and rising dividends. The hypothetical earnings bridge displayed in Figure 6 gives some sense of the earnings power we see unfolding in the years ahead for this durable financial franchise.While our grounded optimism carries the day, we are mindful of the risk that Wells Fargo’s historically excellent credit culture may have deteriorated, or that exasperated regulators may choose to extract even more major penalties for past infractions.” PayPal Holdings, Inc.

ZBH is gaining from continued procedure recovery, solid execution and increasing traction around innovations. The company has been working to strengthen its foothold in emerging markets that provide long-term opportunities for growth.In the past year, the Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock has gained 13.4% against a 29.4% fall of the industry and a 7.1% rise in the S&amp;P 500.The renowned musculoskeletal healthcare company has a market capitalization of $28.37 billion. The company has a long-term projected growth of 7.3%.Let’s delve deeper.Factors At PlayGradually Stabilizing Market: Despite challenging market conditions in the form of pricing pressure, the last few quarters witnessed gradual stability in the global musculoskeletal market with better-than-expected sales growth in certain geographies, banking on improved procedural volume. This was driven by favorable demographics and growing utilization of musculoskeletal healthcare in emerging markets and under-penetrated developed markets.In line with this, during the fourth quarter earnings update, the company noted that it witnessed better than expected growth driven by continued procedure recovery, strong execution, and a solid momentum with the new innovation and also benefited from some favorable comps in the quarter.

The company’s recently released 2023 first-quarter results also generate investors’ optimism. However, escalating expenses and a substantial fall in drug delivery sales are discouraging.In the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has increased 40.8% compared to the 29.4% fall of the industry and a 7% rise of the S&amp;P 500 composite.The developer, manufacturer and distributor of insulin delivery systems has a market capitalization of $20.98 billion. Insulet projects a long-term estimated earnings growth rate of 35.1% compared with 13.6% of the industry. PODD’s earnings surpassed estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed the same in one, delivering an average surprise of 80.2%.Let’s delve deeper.UpsidesImpressive Q1 Results: Insulet delivered better-than-expected earnings and revenues in the first quarter of 2023. The company exceeded the high end of revenue guidance in the first quarter, led by solid 35% growth across the Omnipod portfolio of products. Internationally, high Omnipod revenues were supported by ongoing Omnipod DASH adoption.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchRobust new customer starts in both the United States and worldwide buoy optimism. Omnipod 5 continued to be a driving force of Insulet’s strong U.S. growth, representing almost 95% of the company’s U.S. new customer starts.On the first-quarter earnings call, Insulet updated its full-year 2023 revenue guidance range of 18-22% (from the earlier band of 14-19%). Across the Omnipod portfolio of products, Insulet anticipates 2023 revenues in the range of 21-25% (from the previous 17-22%).Omnipod 5 – a Key Growth Driver: In the first quarter, Omnipod achieved 49% revenue growth in the United States, driven by the company’s annuity-based model with cumulative record new customer starts and growing U.S. pharmacy volumes. These include increasing contributions from Omnipod 5 and a premium for the Omnipod 5 and Omnipod DASH pods in the U.S. pharmacy, where PODD provides a personal diabetes manager without any charge.Story continuesInsulet is set to begin its international rollout of Omnipod 5 — in the United Kingdom in the middle of 2023 and Germany during the fall. The company also plans to launch Omnipod 5 more broadly across international markets during 2024.Solid Manufacturing Capabilities: Insulet considers its global manufacturing capabilities critical to the long-term growth plan. The company is building a new manufacturing facility in Malaysia, expected to start functioning in 2024.Despite challenging macro-related headwinds, Insulet is securing components and producing pods ahead of forecasted demand levels. This ensures global supply for the company’s expanding customer base.DownsidesMounting Expenses: Insulet reported a 383-basis points contraction in the gross margin in the first quarter of 2023. A volume increase in the U.S. pharmacy channel, including the associated premium positively contributed to gross margin. However, it was more than offset by an expected higher mix of costs due to the ramping of Omnipod 5 and domestic manufacturing operations as well as an unfavorable mix from lower drug delivery revenues.The quarter’s adjusted operating margin was affected by a 26.4% year-over-year increase in SG&amp;A expenses and a 16.2% increase in Research and Development expenses compared to the prior year’s quarter.Lumpy Drug Delivery Business: In the first quarter, Insulet’s Drug Delivery Business was down 98.1% year over year. The company expects full-year revenues to decline 55%-45% from this segment, similar to the 2022 reported figures.With several investment opportunities to grow the diabetes side of the business, Insulet is currently not focusing on the drug delivery side.Estimate TrendInsulet has been witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for 2023. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 earnings per share (EPS) has moved up 2.4% to $1.27 in the past 30 days and 5.5% to $1.34 in the past seven days.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 revenues is pegged at $1.57 billion.

Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. See our latest analysis for Boston Scientific The MethodWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.24bUS$2.82bUS$3.11bUS$3.49bUS$3.64bUS$3.76bUS$3.87bUS$3.98bUS$4.08bUS$4.18bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x5Analyst x4Analyst x4Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 3.34%Est @ 2.97%Est @ 2.71%Est @ 2.53%Est @ 2.41% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.7% US$2.1kUS$2.4kUS$2.5kUS$2.6kUS$2.5kUS$2.4kUS$2.3kUS$2.2kUS$2.1kUS$2.0k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$23bWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.7%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$4.2b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (7.7%– 2.1%) = US$76bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$76b÷ ( 1 + 7.7%)10= US$36bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$59b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$51.5, the company appears slightly overvalued at the time of writing. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Boston Scientific as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.7%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.940. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Boston ScientificStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is well covered by earnings.WeaknessExpensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Annual revenue is forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Why is the intrinsic value lower than the current share price? For Boston Scientific, there are three important aspects you should assess:Risks: For instance, we've identified   3 warning signs for Boston Scientific (1 doesn't sit too well with us)  you should be aware of.Management:Have insiders been ramping up their shares to take advantage of the market's sentiment for BSX's future outlook?

AVTR recently announced its entry into an agreement with Labguru. The collaboration aims to integrate Avantor's Inventory Manager (IM) and e-commerce channel into Labguru's Lab Information Management Software and Electronic Lab Notebook (ELN).Avantor and Labguru's combined solution will offer a single source for scientists to access a wide range of high-quality products when needed at the lab bench. It is worth mentioning that Labguru is a research-to-production platform for leading global pharma, national research institutes and innovative startups.The latest partnership is expected to significantly boost Avantor’s Clinical Services business on a global scale.Rationale Behind the CollaborationAvantor's IM is a proprietary, vendor-agnostic cloud-based software designed to serve as the central transactional and intelligence hub for lab inventory management. IM provides real-time reporting and customized, on-demand replenishment of lab consumables.Following the tie-up, IM will now likely be able to integrate with ELNs from multiple providers. By integrating IM with Labguru, scientists who use their ELN will likely be able to easily view, check available stock and order products via Avantor's e-commerce channel. This is expected to aid customers while streamlining their lab workflows and driving efficiencies.Per management, the company is focused on providing researchers and scientists with a more streamlined and efficient way to manage their inventory and purchase research materials from Avantor via Labguru's ELN platform. The integration will likely enable Avantor to further enhance the user experience for researchers and provide them with a single source for their lab research needs.Labguru's management feels the partnership with Avantor will likely empower scientists and eliminate friction by providing efficiencies and data-based insights.Industry ProspectsPer a report by Precision Business Insights, the healthcare inventory management software market was valued at $22.1 billion and is expected to witness a CAGR of 5.4% between 2022 and 2028. Factors like the increasing demand for cloud-based medical inventory software and the growing need for healthcare organizations to manage their inventories effectively are likely to drive the market.Story continuesGiven the market potential, the latest partnership is expected to significantly strengthen Avantor's business worldwide.Notable DevelopmentsIn April, Avantor announced its first-quarter 2023 results, wherein it registered a year-over-year uptick in its Europe and AMEA core organic sales. Strength in Avantor’s end markets was also recorded.In January, Avantor entered into a multi-year supply and services agreement with Catalent.

MMSI has been gaining from its strong product portfolio. The optimism led by solid first-quarter 2023 performance and potential in its Cardiovascular unit are expected to contribute further. However, headwinds related to higher consolidation in the healthcare industry and stiff competition persist.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has gained 43.1% compared with an 8.1% rise of the industry and a 7.1% growth of the S&amp;P 500.The renowned medical device provider has a market capitalization of $4.86 billion. The company projects 11% growth for the next five years and expects to maintain its strong performance. It has delivered an earnings surprise of 20.2% for the past four quarters, on average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Strong Q1 Results: Merit Medical’s robust first-quarter 2023 results buoy optimism. The company witnessed a year-over-year uptick in the top and bottom lines. Solid revenue growth in both its segments and across all the product categories within its Cardiovascular unit was also recorded. Robust performances in the United States and outside were also seen. The company stands to benefit from the execution of its global growth and profitability plan.Strong Product Portfolio: Merit Medical has continued to gain significant momentum on the back of new products. The company is upbeat about the product pipeline, including radio and electrophysiology products, raising investors’ optimism. It has several electrophysiology products that are either on track for release or in several other stages of development.In March, Merit Medical announced the expansion of its SwiftNINJA Steerable Microcatheter product line, which belongs to its delivery systems portfolio.Potential in Cardiovascular Unit: We are optimistic about the unit’s robust potential. During the first quarter of 2023, Merit Medical witnessed a solid uptick in its Cardiovascular unit’s year-over-year revenues on a reported and at constant exchange rate, organic basis. Revenues in the unit’s product categories, Peripheral Intervention, Cardiac Intervention, Custom Procedural Solutions and Original Equipment Manufacturer, were also robust during the first quarter.Story continuesDownsidesHigher Consolidation in Healthcare Industry: Healthcare costs have risen significantly over the past decade. Thus, to provide healthcare solutions at a cheaper rate and eradicate competition, large-cap MedTech behemoths have started consolidating with mid-cap and small-cap companies. This enables the availability of healthcare products at low prices in the market. Per management, such trends compel Merit Medical’s customers to ask for price concessions on its products, which acts against its ongoing business strategies. This may also exert a solid downward pressure on the prices of Merit Medical’s products and reduce the customer base.Stiff Competition: Merit Medical operates in highly competitive markets, where it faces competition from many companies with greater resources. The company competes globally in several market areas, including radiology and interventional cardiology. Such resources and market presence may enable the competitors to market competing products more efficiently or at reduced prices to gain market share.Estimate TrendMerit Medical is witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for 2023. In the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings has moved 2.5% north to $2.89.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s second-quarter 2023 revenues is pegged at $309.9 million, suggesting a 5.1% rise from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.Other Key PicksA few other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

Many biotech companies work on drugs and therapeutics for some of the most pernicious conditions affecting our society and healthcare system. But finding the best biotech stocks to buy is not always simple. Many biotech companies work on drugs for years. And these biotech stocks will swing wildly on the news. Positive results from a clinical trial can send stocks soaring. Conversely, disappointing results can cause a sharp selloff.  Unfortunately, some biotech companies never get FDA approval. Even if they do, small cap companies may have to dilute stock many times throughout the clinical trial process. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsInvesting in biotech stocks is for risk-tolerant investors. But the reward is also clear. Investors only need to think back to the Covid-19 pandemic for examples of biotech stocks that soared after the company successfully launched a vaccine or therapeutic.  In 2023, there are several biotech companies that are on the verge of significant breakthroughs. Even though a couple of them have already made significant gains this year, each of these biotech stocks has room to run higher.  Biogen (BIIB) BIIB stock: Biogen Factory Building in: Luterbach Solothurn SwitzerlandSource: PictureDesignSwiss / Shutterstock.comBiogen (NASDAQ:BIIB) stock shot higher in October 2022 on the news that one of its Alzheimer drug candidates, Lecanemab received better than expected results in a clinical trial. Lecanemab is a monoclonal antibody that targets amyloid. The drug works with the body’s immune system to clear amyloid protein from the brain.  The stock moved about 10% higher after the drug received accelerated approval by the FDA in January. But BIIB stock didn’t hold those gains as some investors were concerned about the accelerated approval process. Currently, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) only cover the Lecanemab (which is marketed under the name Leqembi) to patients enrolled in clinical trials.  Story continuesThe agency says that could change if the drug receives standard FDA approval. A decision is expected by July 6. At that time, BIIB stock could surpass analysts’ forecast for 7% stock price growth. And trading at just 14x earnings, Biogen is offering good value for risk-tolerant investors.  Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) logo visible on display screenSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comNext on this list of biotech stocks to buy is Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:VRTX). The biotech giant is an undisputed leader in cystic fibrosis treatments. On April 26, 2023, the company received an expanded use authorization for Trikafta, its flagship cystic fibrosis drug. The drug can now be used for children with CF ages 2 through 5 provided they meet certain conditions.  VRTX stock climbed about 10% higher on the news. But there could be even more catalysts coming for the stock in 2023. Vertex has a partnership with CRISPR Therapeutics (NASDAQ:CRSP) to develop treatments in the areas of gene therapy and gene editing.   The companies have been working on breakthrough treatments for sickle cell disease (SCD) and transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia (TDT) in addition to Type-1 Diabetes. In April, several key milestones were reached that are pushing the companies closer to getting priority review of the drugs.  VRTX stock is butting up against its consensus price target but recent analyst ratings give the stock significant upside.  ImmunoGen (IMGN) A variety of pills, pill bottles, and droppers arranged on a table in multiple bright colors.Source: ShutterstockImmunoGen (NASDAQ:IMGN) was a mere penny stock until it received encouraging news on its Phase 3 trial for its antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) for treating platinum-resistant ovarian center. This type of ovarian cancer doesn’t respond to the current standard of care in chemotherapy which are platinum-based. Patients may respond favorably in the short term, but the cancer will recur. This is only the second ADC approved for cancer treatment and the first for ovarian cancer. Immediately after the report, IGMN stock surged and is up over 230% percent. The drug is currently being marketed under accelerated approval by the FDA. There is always the risk that the drug will not get approval.  But the positive results make it more likely that the drug will receive approval by the FDA at some point. If that approval happens, the drug will likely be covered by Medicare and other health insurers. That would likely give IMGN stock an additional catalyst for stock price growth.  On the date of publication, Chris Markoch did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Notably, the emerging trends in the combat aircraft space, such as fifth-generation technology aircraft, advanced composite materials and stealth technology have been substantially driving demand for military jets.The global military jet market is growing, with North America leading this space. Boeing, being the largest jet maker in the United States, enjoys a dominant position in the global military aircraft market.

""We'll get more information as a result of this hearing,"" Homendy said.The panels will include emergency response related to the initial evacuation, wayside defect detectors and hot bearings, the decision to vent and burn and rail tank car safety.Norfolk Southern CEO Alan Shaw and railroad union leaders issued a joint letter Tuesday committing ""to work together to enhance rail safety for our people and the communities we serve. ...We will collaborate, consult experts, review best practices, and listen to the people closest to the work.""In March, the NTSB and Federal Railroad Administration both announced special safety assessments of Norfolk. The NTSB opened a special investigation and urged the railroad to ""take immediate action ""to review and assess its safety practices.""Earlier this month, the NTSB said another Norfolk Southern freight train that derailed near New Castle, Pennsylvania received a warning several miles before the incident.Homendy said Tuesday the Pennsylvania derailment appears to be related to an overheated wheel bearing.The NTSB said earlier initial information indicated the train received an alarm ""from a wayside defect detector"" several miles before the train derailed. Homendy said Tuesday there were some reports that ""the crew on the train did not get a notification"" but that is still under investigation.

The elevated levels of inflation is likely to have raised oil and natural gas prices in the March quarter. Moreover, amid the prolonged Russia-Ukraine war, Europe is likely to have sought gas supplies outside Russia. This is expected to drive demand for LNG vessels.On the flip side, GLNG’s performance is expected to have been affected by supply-chain disruptions. Higher operating expenses due to the increased average number of vessels in its fleet are likely to have hurt the bottom line. Steep fuel costs are likely to have raised total expenses.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for FLEX LNG this time around. The combination of a positive  Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat, which is not the case here, as elaborated below.Earnings ESP: GLNG has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.

Accelerating digital investments also bode well. Companies are expected to gain from expansion into newer categories and adjacent categories, including capturing market share in the Ready-to-Drink (“RTD”) alcoholic beverage category through collaborations. Players like The Coca-Cola Co., PepsiCo Inc., Monster Beverage Corp. and Coca-Cola FEMSA, S.A.B. de C.V. are well-poised on robust innovation efforts.However, industry players are witnessing continued pressure from higher supply-chain costs, including transportation and commodity costs, particularly steel and aluminum. The companies’ actions, including price increases, reducing reliance on imported cans and moving production closer to markets, are poised to combat these headwinds. Elevated operating expenses related to increased spending on marketing and advertising to capture a share are likely to strain margins in the near term.About the IndustryThe Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry comprises companies that manufacture, source, develop, market and sell non-alcoholic beverages. Soft drinks mainly include sparkling drinks, natural juices, enhanced water, sports and energy drinks as well as dairy, RTD tea and coffee beverages. Notably, some industry players like PepsiCo produce and sell handy food with flavored snacks, which complement their beverage portfolio.The companies sell products through a network of wholesalers and retailers that include supermarkets, department stores, mass merchandisers, club stores and other retail outlets. Some also offer products via company-owned or controlled bottling, independent bottling partners and partner brand owners.Story continuesWhat's Shaping the Future of the Beverages - Soft Drinks Industry?Innovation &amp; Digital Growth: The soft drinks industry is poised to gain from innovations and accelerating digital investments. The companies have been optimizing their portfolio, focusing on core brands and investments in innovation to meet the evolving needs of consumers. The players remain committed to product launches and innovation to boost growth.

Companies in the industry have been accelerating investments to build strong digital capabilities by piloting numerous digital-enabled fulfillment options. They have been expanding digital offerings and investing in loyalty programs and fintech platforms to capture online demand. The investments are likely to position soft drink companies for long-term growth.Evolving Trends: Companies in the soft drinks space have been gaining from improved demand trends, which are aiding volume growth. Market share gains in at-home and away-from-home channels, owing to recovery across markets, have been boosting sales. Price increases to overcome the ongoing cost pressures have significantly lifted sales in recent quarters.The soft drinks industry has transformed as health consciousness, personal well-being, natural ingredients, varied flavors and better taste experiences are changing consumers’ consumption patterns. Companies in the industry are expected to benefit from the expansion into newer and adjacent categories, including capturing market share in the fast-growing RTD alcoholic beverage category through collaborations. RTD has emerged as the fastest-growing category since 2018. The industry players are also exploring CBD-infused drinks, which have been gaining popularity lately.Raw Material Cost Inflation and Supply Constraints: The beverage industry is plagued with higher supply-chain costs, including higher commodity input costs and transportation expenses. Raw material cost inflation, particularly steel and aluminum, has increased packaging costs. The ongoing supply constraints in the aluminum can industry have been other headwinds. The companies are also witnessing delays in procuring certain ingredients, both domestically and internationally, leading to shortages of some goods.The industry players have been facing freight inefficiencies and significant increases in domestic and international freight costs.

Accelerating digital investments also bode well. Companies are expected to gain from expansion into newer categories and adjacent categories, including capturing market share in the Ready-to-Drink (“RTD”) alcoholic beverage category through collaborations. Players like The Coca-Cola Company KO, PepsiCo Inc. PEP, Monster Beverage Corporation MNST and Coca-Cola FEMSA, S.A.B. de C.V. KOF are well-poised on robust innovation efforts.However, industry players are witnessing continued pressure from higher supply-chain costs, including transportation and commodity costs, particularly steel and aluminum. The companies’ actions, including price increases, reducing reliance on imported cans and moving production closer to markets, are poised to combat these headwinds. Elevated operating expenses related to increased spending on marketing and advertising to capture a share are likely to strain margins in the near term.About the IndustryThe Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry comprises companies that manufacture, source, develop, market and sell non-alcoholic beverages. Soft drinks mainly include sparkling drinks, natural juices, enhanced water, sports and energy drinks as well as dairy, RTD tea and coffee beverages. Notably, some industry players like PepsiCo produce and sell handy food with flavored snacks, which complement their beverage portfolio. The companies sell products through a network of wholesalers and retailers that include supermarkets, department stores, mass merchandisers, club stores and other retail outlets. Some also offer products via company-owned or controlled bottling, independent bottling partners and partner brand owners.What's Shaping the Future of the Beverages - Soft Drinks Industry?Innovation &amp; Digital Growth: The soft drinks industry is poised to gain from innovations and accelerating digital investments. The companies have been optimizing their portfolio, focusing on core brands and investments in innovation to meet the evolving needs of consumers. The players remain committed to product launches and innovation to boost growth. Expansion into newer markets has been a key focus for soft drink makers to boost market share. The companies are expected to reap the benefits of digital and technology-driven investments based on the shift in consumer preference for online shopping. Companies in the industry have been accelerating investments to build strong digital capabilities by piloting numerous digital-enabled fulfillment options. They have been expanding digital offerings and investing in loyalty programs and fintech platforms to capture online demand. The investments are likely to position soft drink companies for long-term growth.Evolving Trends: Companies in the soft drinks space have been gaining from improved demand trends, which are aiding volume growth. Market share gains in at-home and away-from-home channels, owing to recovery across markets, have been boosting sales. Price increases to overcome the ongoing cost pressures have significantly lifted sales in recent quarters. The soft drinks industry has transformed as health consciousness, personal well-being, natural ingredients, varied flavors and better taste experiences are changing consumers’ consumption patterns. Companies in the industry are expected to benefit from the expansion into newer and adjacent categories, including capturing market share in the fast-growing RTD alcoholic beverage category through collaborations. RTD has emerged as the fastest-growing category since 2018. The industry players are also exploring CBD-infused drinks, which have been gaining popularity lately.Raw Material Cost Inflation and Supply Constraints: The beverage industry is plagued with higher supply-chain costs, including higher commodity input costs and transportation expenses. Raw material cost inflation, particularly steel and aluminum, has increased packaging costs. The ongoing supply constraints in the aluminum can industry have been other headwinds. The companies are also witnessing delays in procuring certain ingredients, both domestically and internationally, leading to shortages of some goods. The industry players have been facing freight inefficiencies and significant increases in domestic and international freight costs. Logistic issues, higher input costs and freight inefficiencies have resulted in higher costs of sales and operating expenses, impacting gross and operating margins. Most players expect commodity cost inflation and higher transportation costs to persist in the near term.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Beverages - Soft Drinks industry is housed within the broader Consumer Staples sector.

323,549d0fc1-e50d-4740-906f-fc88d128d463,INTU,2023-05-24,Intuit CEO: Possible government-run tax filing system will cost taxpayers 'billions',Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intuit-ceo-possible-government-run-tax-filing-system-will-cost-taxpayers-billions-121809150.html,1684930689,STORY,['INTU'],"[Intuit (INTU) CEO Sasan Goodarzi has come out swinging against growing market angst about a potential government-run e-filing system for taxes that could dent his lucrative TurboTax franchise.""To have another sort e-tax software available is really immaterial. It's the way we think about it. And I'll remind us, by the way, it's actually not free — this is going to cost taxpayers billions of dollars,"" Goodarzi told analysts on a late Tuesday earnings call.The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) signed into law in 2022 ordered the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to assess the feasibility of developing and operating a government-run e-filing system for taxes. Such a system, if implemented, would be voluntary for taxpayers.In the IRS' feasibility report released last week, the agency estimated it would cost between $64 million and $249 million annually to create and operate the system.The report's findings were mixed at best on the risk to Intuit's TurboTax and tax-prep competitors like H&amp;R Block (HRB).One survey in the report found that 68% of taxpayers who presently use self-preparation software for their taxes would be either be ""very likely"" or ""somewhat likely"" to switch to a free IRS-powered tool.In another survey, 60% of respondents said they would choose their current commercial tax software if the IRS system could not prepare or file state returns.Nevertheless, the mere discussion of this IRS-run free filing option — which could snatch sales away from a paid service like Turbotax — has weighed on Intuit's stock price.Shares of the owner of TurboTax, Credit Karma, and MailChimp are off about 13.5% since hitting a record high in August 15, 2022. The Inflation Reduction Act was signed into law on August 16, 2022, by President Joe Biden.For the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022, TurboTax represented about 31% of Intuit's sales, according to SEC filings — or $3.9 billion. So the market angst is understandable.Story continuesDespite the threat, Wall Street analysts have stuck with upbeat ratings on Intuit's stock.To this community, a free government-run tax software option is off in the distance — if it's there at all.And even if the government stands up the filing platform, it has a well-documented, less-than-stellar track record in developing software that people would like to use, experts contend.""We don't expect this initiative to gain much traction given a number of issues, including lack of government track record in creating user-friendly software, conflict of interest (no government incentive to maximize refunds), consumer trust, no state tax filing, and wide availability of free options from commercial vendors, including Intuit. But there may be initial disruption at the margin due to consumer confusion,"" Jefferies analyst Brent Thill wrote in a recent client note.BRAZIL - 2021/09/05: In this photo illustration the TurboTax (Intuit) logo seen displayed on a smartphone. (Photo Illustration by Rafael Henrique/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) (SOPA Images via Getty Images)That vibe was echoed by BTIG analyst Isaac Boltansky.""Everything relating to the IRS remains politically charged and Congressional Republicans have a particular disdain for this effort,"" Boltansky said in a client note. ""Creating a system like this one would require a meaningful investment in tech and taxpayer support, and private alternatives have structural benefits given their state-level offerings, consumer comfort with the interfaces, and an embedded belief that private service providers have incentives to provide the taxpayer with the best possible return.""Intuit's Goodarzi sounds like a CEO unfazed by Uncle Sam entering the tax software game. Only time will tell if that confidence is proven out.""Our vision has been from what we declared four years ago — to really become a consumer platform of choice,"" Goodarzi said on the call.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

Good afternoon, and welcome to Intuit's Third Quarter Fiscal 2023 Conference Call. I'm here with Intuit's CEO, Sasan Goodarzi; and Michelle Clatterbuck, our CFO. Before we start, I'd like to remind everyone that our remarks will include forward-looking statements. There are a number of factors that could cause Intuit's results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in our press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our Form 10-K for fiscal 2022 and our other SEC filings.

GoodarziGreat. Thank you, Kim, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Third quarter revenue grew 7%, lower than our expectations, reflecting a unique tax season, while we exceeded operating income and earnings per share guidance. We continue to see strong growth in the Small Business and Self-Employed Group, which grew 21% in the quarter. Our overall performance this year demonstrates the strength of our platform and portfolio, including our ability to maintain earnings power in uncertain times, while investing in the most important areas to drive long-term, durable growth. We are raising our total company fiscal year revenue, operating income, earnings per share guidance. I'm very proud of our team as we now expect revenue and operating income to grow double digits and margins to expand even more than previously guided. Let's turn to tax. While this was a unique tax season, we're making good progress transforming the assisted segment with TurboTax Live. This year, we expect overall IRS returns to decline 2% through July 31, below our original expectations for total returns to grow 1%, which was more in line with historical trends. We also expect the DIY category share of total IRS returns to decline nearly 3/4 of a point of a point, also below our expectations. We believe the IRS and DIY category declines are driven by those who filed in order to receive pandemic-era stimulus and tax credit during the past several years but did not file taxes this season. As a reminder, every point of IRS returns growth equals about 1 point of TurboTax revenue growth, and every point of DIY category share growth equals about 2.5 points of TurboTax revenue growth. The expected decline in total IRS returns and DIY category share equates to approximately $200 million of negative impact to revenue for TurboTax versus our original expectations. We expect our share of total IRS returns to be down approximately 80 basis points this fiscal year, primarily reflecting pandemic-era stimulus filers who did not file taxes this season. Each tax season has been unique since the pandemic began 4 years ago, although average annual trends over this period are far more in line with longer-term trends. Over this 4-year period, we expect total IRS returns to be up approximately 1%, the DIY category share of total returns to be up 1/4 of a point, and our share of total returns to be up approximately 20 basis points and average revenue per return to be up 9 points. These trends exclude users of the TurboTax Free File offering in prior year periods. Our strategy to transform the assisted category with TurboTax Live is working, given the growth we've experienced in an environment where IRS returns are declining. We expect TurboTax Live customers to grow 13% this year, with TurboTax Live revenue up 19% and total average revenue per return to grow 12%. While TurboTax Live has driven strong growth over the last 6 tax seasons, we still have an immense opportunity to penetrate and transform the assisted tax segment at an accelerated rate. This remains our top priority as we prepare for next year. Turning to Small Business. While we're not immune to the macro environment, our platform is resilient. Total online payment volume growth moderated 5 points from Q2, growing 20%. Despite this, the shift to digitization and the power of our Small Business platform resonate with customers as they look to grow their business and improve cash flow. We continue to see strength in the areas that have the greatest impact, including growth of our online mid-market customers contributing to strong subscription revenue and higher ARPC. In Q3, growth in both the number of companies running online payroll and the number of employees paid on our platform remained strong. Our Small Business platform, including QuickBooks and Mailchimp, remain critical to our customers' success. Let me now step back and talk about our company game plan to win. Four years ago, we declared our strategy to become the global AI-driven expert platform and 5 Big Bets as the primary areas of focus to drive durable growth. We invested heavily in our data and AI capabilities to deliver accelerated innovation. Today, we have over 100 million customers on our platform and use 400,000 customer and financial attributes per small business and 55,000 tax and financial attributes per consumer to power 58 billion machine learning predictions per day. The acquisitions of Credit Karma and Mailchimp each contributed a rich and additive data set, which helped deliver a 360-degree view of our customers. The scale of our data is an important competitive advantage and building block for our existing and future innovations with AI. We are accelerating reimagining our customer experiences with generative AI capabilities, which we believe will be the driver of our long-term growth. Our platform capabilities are key to continued acceleration across all of our 5 Big Bets. I'd like to highlight some examples of recent progress across these Big Bets. As a reminder, our Big Bets are: revolutionize speed to benefit, connect people to experts, unlock smart money decisions, be the center of small business growth and disrupt the small business mid-market. Our first Big Bet is to revolutionize speed to benefit. This data and technology bet is foundational to everything that we do. We began investing in generative AI 2 years ago to accelerate our ability to fuel the success of consumers and small businesses. We've implemented generative AI in Mailchimp, powering the e-mail content generator, enabling customers to create faster e-mail campaigns based on industry, marketing intent and brand voice. We deployed large language models, which recognize, summarize and generate text in our virtual expert platform to automatically summarize calls, reduce call times by hundreds of thousands of hours per year and reduce work for experts while improving efficiency. Our strategic investment in data and AI over the last 4 years positions us to lead through this technological shift, and we look forward to sharing more in the coming months. With our third Big Bet, our vision is for Credit Karma to become a comprehensive, self-driving financial platform that propels our members forward wherever they are on their financial journey. We are focused on growing Credit Karma Money, increasing member confidence to access financial products with Karma Guarantee, building out a richer experience for Prime members and becoming the financial platform of choice for consumers, with the seamless integration of Credit Karma and TurboTax. We're innovating across all verticals and continue to have confidence in our long-term revenue growth expectations of 20% to 25% despite near-term headwinds. I'll share a few examples. This season, we further streamlined the TurboTax filing experience into the Credit Karma app, and the number of customers using the experience to file their taxes was over 5x higher last year. With Credit Karma Money, we're innovating to help members get faster access to cash and make financial progress. This year, we saw over 45% growth in the number of TurboTax online customers who received their Refund Advance in a Credit Karma Money account. This integration allowed approved members to get money in their hands in as little as 1 minute after the IRS accepted their return and drove increased debit card purchase activity, contributing to more than 100% increase in Credit Karma Money revenue during the quarter. Members who use this offering show higher engagement on Credit Karma, which creates additional monetization opportunities over time. And with the Mint team now part of Credit Karma, we're building a new experience for members with prime credit scores, where Credit Karma is underpenetrated today. During the quarter, we began rolling out Net Worth, which helps Prime members better understand their wealth. Our fourth Big Bet is to become the center of small business growth by helping our customers get new customers, get paid fast, manage capital and pay employees with confidence in an omnichannel world. In Payroll, our U.S. QBO payroll customers grew double digits this quarter and the mix of online customers choosing our high-end offerings increased by over 1 point, driving higher ARPC. And in Payments, we continue to innovate to drive digitization from creating an estimate, to invoicing a customer, to getting paid. Today, easier discovery, auto-enabled payments, instant deposits and get paid upfront are all helping drive adoption of our payments offering, leading to 20% total online payments volume growth this quarter. We're making significant progress digitizing B2B payments to accelerate and automate transactions between small businesses and ultimately improve their cash flow. We see a tremendous opportunity as 70% of B2B transactions are still completed with checks. And following our launch of the QuickBooks Business Network to millions of our QBO customers in January, we're piloting our own native bill pay solution and launched the initial beta of this functionality in QuickBooks earlier this month. Turning to Mailchimp. We're well on our way to becoming the source of truth for our customers to help them grow and run their business. We have 3 acceleration priorities with Mailchimp: first, delivering on our vision of an end-to-end customer growth platform; second, disrupting the mid-market by developing a full marketing automation, CRM and e-commerce suite; and third, accelerating global growth with holistic go-to-market approach. This quarter, we made great progress against these priorities. We're continuing to see better paid conversion, improving retention versus last quarter and stronger paid customer growth. This, along with higher revenue per customer, drove several point acceleration in revenue growth versus last quarter. Let me share some details around our progress. To help introduce new customers to Mailchimp and drive customer growth over time, we introduced 3 trials similar to what we offer in QBO. In early testing, this is already driving higher-pace conversion and a mix shift into our higher-end offerings. To drive stronger retention of mid-market customers, we continue to leverage our virtual expert platform to offer assisted onboarding, with the goal of guiding these customers to more advanced features and increasing awareness and usage. This quarter, we saw more than a 7-point increase in high-value customers going through this onboarding process versus last quarter, which we expect to help drive stronger retention over time. To drive accelerated global growth and execute our refreshed international strategy, we're translating the product into multiple languages. Early results indicate this translation work is driving increased activation and ultimately can drive revenue growth. And our fifth Big Bet is to disrupt the small business mid-market, representing a TAM of 1.7 million customers, of which 700,000 are already in our franchise today. Online mid-market customer growth remains strong, and we're driving ARPC expansion as we serve these mid-market customers across our full ecosystem of services. Wrapping up, with our durable AI-driven expert platform strategy, we're innovating at a high velocity, using the power of our platform, modern technology capabilities, data sets and artificial intelligence to deliver new offerings at scale. This is helping us put more money in our customers' pockets, saving them time and ensuring complete confidence in every financial decision they make. We're well positioned to power prosperity for the people and communities that we serve as we enter this next technological shift. Now let me hand it over to Michelle.Michelle M. ClatterbuckThanks, Sasan. For the third quarter of fiscal 2023, we delivered revenue of $6 billion, GAAP operating income of $2.8 billion versus $2.4 billion last year, non-GAAP operating income of $3.4 billion versus $2.9 billion last year, GAAP diluted earnings per share of $7.38 versus $6.28 a year ago and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $8.92 versus $7.65 last year. Turning to the business segments. Consumer Group revenue of $3.3 billion grew 3% in Q3. There are 4 primary drivers of our Consumer business. This data reflects our expectations through July 31, 2023, versus the prior year through July 31, 2022. The first is the total number of returns filed with the IRS. We expect total returns to decline 2% this year. This is below our original expectations of up 1% as overall industry growth continues to reflect the multiyear impact from the pandemic. The second is the percentage of those returns filed using do-it-yourself software. We expect the DIY category of total IRS returns to be down nearly 3/4 of a point by the end of the fiscal year, below our original expectations. The third is our share. We expect our share of total IRS returns to decline by approximately 80 basis points this fiscal year, primarily reflecting pandemic-era stimulus filers who did not file this season. As a result of these same industry dynamics, we expect our retention to decline this year. The fourth is average revenue per return, which we expect to increase 12% this year, as we expect TurboTax Live customers to grow 13%, with TurboTax Live revenue up 19%. Historically, each point of total IRS returns growth corresponds to approximately 1 point of revenue growth for the Consumer Group, and each point of DIY category share growth corresponds to approximately 2.5 points of revenue growth for the Consumer Group. Using these historical sensitivities, the expected decline in total IRS returns and DIY category share equates to an approximate $200 million negative impact to revenue for the Consumer Group versus our original expectations. As a result of this expected decline in IRS returns, we anticipate total customers to decline 5% this year. We expect TurboTax Online paying customers to decline 1% this year and a total of over 11 million customers, who pay us nothing, down from 13 million last year. We now expect full year Consumer Group revenue growth of 5% to 6% versus our prior guidance of 9% to 10%, reflecting the expected declines in IRS returns and DIY category share I mentioned earlier. Looking back over the last 4 years, including our updated guidance for this fiscal year, we expect our revenue to have grown over 10% on average annually, in line with our long-term expectations. We continue to anticipate Consumer Group revenue growth of 8% to 12% long term. Turning to the ProTax Group. Revenue declined 5% in Q3. For the full year, we now expect ProTax revenue growth of 2% to 3%. In the Small Business and Self-Employed Group, revenue grew 21% during the quarter and Online Ecosystem revenue grew 23%. With the goal of being the source of truth for small businesses, our strategic focus within the Small Business and Self-Employed Group is threefold: grow the core, connect the ecosystem and expand globally. First, we continue to focus on growing the core. QuickBooks Online Accounting revenue grew 25% in Q3, driven mainly by customer growth, higher effective prices and mix shift. Second, we continue to focus on connecting the ecosystem. Online Services revenue, which includes Mailchimp, Payroll, Payments, Capital and Time Tracking, grew 21% in Q3. Mailchimp revenue growth in the quarter accelerated several points from low teens growth last quarter. Growth was driven by higher effective prices and customer growth. Within Payroll, revenue growth in the quarter reflects an increase in Payroll customers and a mix shift to higher-end offerings. Within Payments, revenue growth reflects ongoing customer growth as more customers adopt our payment offerings to manage their cash flow and an increase in total payment volume per customer. Third, we continue to make progress expanding globally by executing our refreshed international strategy, which includes leading with Mailchimp. On a constant currency basis, total international Online Ecosystem revenue grew 12% in Q3, Desktop Ecosystem revenue grew 16% in the third quarter and QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise revenue grew approximately 20%. We're just over halfway through a 3-year transition to a subscription model for our desktop accounting solutions, making this revenue more predictable. We also raised our desktop prices for several products last September to price for value. Looking ahead, we expect continued strong desktop ecosystem revenue growth next quarter and as we complete the remaining part of the 3-year transition. We will continue to build out our Online Ecosystem and help our desktop customers migrate seamlessly to our online offerings when they're ready. We continue to expect the Online Ecosystem to be our growth catalyst longer term. As a result of the strong growth we're seeing in the Small Business and Self-Employed Group, we are raising our full year segment revenue growth guidance to 24% from 19% to 20%. Credit Karma delivered revenue of $410 million in Q3, down 12%. As a reminder, Credit Karma represented 14% of our total revenue in fiscal 2022. On a product basis, the decline was driven primarily by headwinds in personal loans, home loans, auto loans and auto insurance, partially offset by growth in Credit Karma Money and credit cards. We're seeing more stability across our core verticals. In both credit cards and personal loans, we continue to see some partners tighten eligibility, while some expanded eligibility during the quarter. In personal loans, we continue to see partners facing funding constraints. We added more partners to the platform to help diversify our partner base. However, we continue to expect personal loan revenue to decline this year after a very strong growth in fiscal 2022. We're updating our full year Credit Karma revenue growth guidance to a decline of 11% from a decline of 15% to 10%. Our financial principles guide our decisions remain our long-term commitment and are unchanged. We finished the quarter with approximately $4.3 billion in cash and investments and $6.6 billion in debt on our balance sheet. We repurchased $483 million of stock during the third quarter. Depending on market conditions and other factors, our aim is to be in the market each quarter. The Board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.78 per share payable July 18, 2023. This represents a 15% increase versus last year. As I shared consistently in the past, we have an operating system we use to run the company, and this includes a proven playbook for operating in both good and difficult economic times. Our first priority is to do the right thing for customers, giving them access to the tools and offerings they need most. We manage for the short and long term and control discretionary spend to deliver strong results while investing in what is most important for future growth. The scale of our platform, along with our rich data, gives us the unique ability to see leading indicators that allow us to be forward-looking and adjust quickly. I'm proud of the team for how effectively we have used our playbook to invest in the most important growth drivers to position Intuit for the future while maintaining earnings power this year despite the macro impact we are experiencing. We will continue to accelerate our innovation, and our goal remains for Intuit to emerge from this period of macro uncertainty in a position of strength. Moving on to guidance. We are increasing our fiscal 2023 guidance. This includes total company revenue growth of 12% to 13%, up from prior guidance of 10% to 12% growth; GAAP operating income growth of 19% to 20%, up from prior guidance of 9% to 13% growth; non-GAAP operating income growth of 21%, up from prior guidance of 17% to 19% growth; GAAP diluted earnings per share to grow 7% to 8%, up from prior guidance of a decline of approximately 5% to 1%; and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share growth of 20%, up from prior guidance of 15% to 17% growth. Our guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 includes revenue growth of 9% to 10%, GAAP loss per share of $0.34 to $0.29 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.43 to $1.48. We expect a significant increase in our cash tax payments related to fiscal 2023 as a result of the tax law changes that require capitalization of certain R&amp;D costs. With the recent IRS disaster area tax relief, we expect to pay approximately $700 million related to fiscal 2023 in Q1 of fiscal 2024. You can find our full fiscal 2023 and Q4 guidance details in our press release and on our fact sheet. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Sasan.Sasan K. GoodarziExcellent. Thank you, Michelle. I know you'll be with us for another couple of months, but since this is your last earnings call, I wanted to express my sincere appreciation for all that you've contributed to Intuit over the last 20 years. You have made me, my leadership team and the entire company better, and I am forever grateful. Wrapping up, we feel confident in our AI-driven expert platform strategy and our 5 Big Bets and in an uncertain macro (inaudible) mission-critical than ever to our customers. Let's now open it up to your questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick from Deutsche Bank.Brad Alan ZelnickMichelle, congrats on a phenomenal run. We will miss you next quarter, for sure, on the earnings call. I've got one for Sasan and maybe let me sneak one in for Michelle, especially since it's her last call. Sasan, how should we think about your Big Bet in helping customers overcome their lack of confidence by connecting them to live experts in a world where generative AI is advancing at breakneck speed? Because I think you spoke about how you're using generative AI to deliver the live platform. But how is Intuit positioned in a world where LLMs may be able to deliver human-like guidance and interaction? And maybe for you, Michelle, your Consumer segment operating margin was consistent with last year despite the pressure on the top line, for all the reasons that you've mentioned. Just curious, how much visibility that you might have had into how tax would play out, and if you scaled back investment at all, perhaps even marketing dollars, into the end of the season?Sasan K. GoodarziGreat. Brad, thank you so much for your question. And I heard that I fell off when I was reading the last part of the script. So if I have bad connection, I will switch phones and hop back to make sure I answer your question. But let me start with the question that you asked. First of all, I would take us back to what we declared 4 years ago. As you know, I've been on the record 4-plus years ago to say that I believe, and we believe as a company, that artificial intelligence is going to ignite global growth. And I believe that it's the biggest thing next to what we've experienced over time with electricity and the Internet. It's that big, and it's that critical of a platform of innovation, which is why data and AI have been core to our investments in the last 4-plus years. And with that as context, it's why we've been investing specifically in machine learning, knowledge engineering, natural language processing. And several years ago, we really started accelerating our investments in generative AI. And if I take it back to your question around confidence, when we talked about solving the biggest unsaid problem that customers have, which is around confidence, it is really about solving it by helping them feel confident in their decisions. And it doesn't necessarily always mean people. And in fact, if you look at our interactions today across all of our platforms, a large number of our interactions is actually -- are machines that are solving the customers' largest problems. The reason we are so excited about AI from 4-plus years ago is that you couple our data, which is a 360 view of the customer, it's actually where Credit Karma and Mailchimp has played such an important role to add to our rich data set. You couple that with the investments in AI and now with generative AI, we can actually accelerate penetrating nonconsumption. And this is across every customer that we serve, whether it's Consumers, across Credit Karma, whether it's Tax, whether it's Small Business, we have an incredible opportunity to accelerate on making things more easier, more digestible and more confident and inspiring for our customers. And in fact, it's generative AI that gives us the ability to do things that we could never imagine possible because of the data that we have. So for us, we saw this as an accelerant several years ago. It's why we accelerated our investments, and it's why we're so excited about the future because of the large language models, coupled with AI, coupled with machine learning and the investments that we've made, we believe that we can actually accelerate our innovation as we look ahead. And hopefully, I was loud and clear.Michelle M. ClatterbuckYes. That was good. And Brad, first off, thank you for the kind words. Your question around our ability to maintain the earnings power within CG really is a focus for us as a whole company, and it started last year when we were going through our 3- and 1-year planning process. We assumed that there would be economic uncertainty this year. And so as we were going through the process, we made sure that we had funded those things that were most important to delivering for customers and being able to drive our revenue growth. And then we were -- made a list of the levers that we had that we could pull as we went throughout the year to be able to maintain our earnings power. And those are some of the discretionary things we had, which were -- whether it's travel or advertising or moderating, hiring. And so our lower-tax units also this year did result in lower expenses for that segment, specifically in customer success. But really, it's about us looking at maintaining not CG margins, but really, at the company level, and it started last year in planning.OperatorAnd your next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan from Goldman Sachs.Kasthuri Gopalan RanganGoodbye to you, Michelle. We'll miss you. Question for Sasan and the team. Sasan, in order to get back to the targets of 8% to 12% longer-term Consumer, you're going to have to reaccelerate the Tax business. So if we can go back to the basics from the old days, how does it -- do you plan to grow the category? And how do you gain share of that category? That would be great.And also as it pertains to generative AI, does this open up more opportunities netted against maybe potentially new competitive entrants? Because there is a -- there are thesis, which I'm sure you will have a different view on, that it actually makes it easier to file for taxes. Brad was talking about that -- Brad Zelnick earlier. So does it expand the opportunity set, at the same time attracting new competition? Or how do we think about how it nets out for you guys?Sasan K. GoodarziYes. Thank you for the question, Kash. So a couple of things I would start with. I'll take your question around reaccelerating revenue growth. First of all, if I step back and look at the $200 million of impact that we experienced this year because of the lower number of returns and based on all the analysis that we've done, it's really the pandemic-era filers that came in to get access to their stimulus into their tax credits. And those have, based on our own analysis, have really all now left the category.One, we believe we'll get to sort of a more normal environment. That is really what drove the performance -- the lower performance than we expected this year. The second thing, to get to your question around reacceleration, this is where I feel very good about the performance in an environment where there were lower returns with our TurboTax Live business. If you think about it, this is now $1 billion-plus business growing 19%. And I believe, in the next several years, this will actually be the largest part of the TurboTax business. And it's really in context of getting after the $30 billion of TAM, that is consumers that go to an assisted offering to get their taxes done or businesses that get their business tax done.And we believe, based on what we learned this year with our full-service offering, that we have an enormous chance to be able to really penetrate at a much more accelerated rate as we look ahead, and therefore, very confident in not only our performance this year, if you exclude the lower number of returns, but also the green sheets that we saw going into next year, inclusive of the fact that we had 5 extra growth in the Credit Karma platform, and we learned a number of things that we're going to double down on going into next year.And let me couple that with your second question around AI. Listen, I would say, [leading] the ones 4-plus years ago, that said, and we're on the record that we believe that AI will absolutely be disruptive. And it's why we made investments in data because AI, particularly generative AI, is really meaningless without data. And so with the investments that we've made in having a 360 view of data for consumers and small businesses, we actually kind of see it as an incredible accelerant.And I'll just remind us of -- we often talk about we have a $300 billion TAM with 5% penetration. And most of our customers use Excel, Google Sheets, Shoeboxes, whether it's a small business or a consumer, and manage their life to manage their business, or they go have a bookkeeper help them run their business. And the reason it's 5% because it all comes down to confidence.So we're actually able to see our investments in the last 4-plus years in data and AI with what we are now investing in with generative AI. We, for us, think it's going to accelerate because we have incredible scale. We have data scale, AI scale, customer scale, and we have sort of rich data sets that is really undisputed, which means we can do things for customers that is hard for anybody else to do. So we actually see it as an accelerant, and we're excited about the possibilities given the proof points that we've seen and given the investments that we are currently making. So that's the way we think about it.OperatorThe next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne from Evercore ISI.Kirk MaterneCongrats, Sasan. Michelle, good luck on your next endeavor. I guess, Sasan, can you just talk about the state of the Small Business? There's a lot of debate on that right now. Obviously, you all had a nice quarter in SBSE. Can you just talk about what you're seeing there in terms of the different verticals you play in, and frankly, the ability for you all to upsell some of your offerings like Payroll, Payments?Sasan K. GoodarziYes. Yes, sure. Let me frame my answer in 2 dimensions. One, what we see across all small businesses on our platform and off of our platform. There's a couple of things that we see. One is there is an impact to small businesses revenues. They're still growing. It depends on the sector, but in aggregate, they're -- what we see is that they are still growing. They also -- depending on the sector they serve, they have profit pressures. So if they're in real estate or if they're in lending, they certainly have more profit pressure than those that don't serve those sectors.We also see that customers -- we put them in the bucket of the older, more tenured customers, 70% of those customers actually have more cash reserves than they did pre-pandemic. It's more of the younger, newer businesses that have started since the pandemic that generally they have less cash reserves than maybe the (inaudible) sort of the state of the small businesses. They feel the impact and the pressure of the environment from a consumer spending standpoint. But net-net, when you look in aggregate, they are still growing with some of the data points that I mentioned a moment ago.With that said, when we look at our platform, it's why we're just being -- continuing to be intentional about sharing the proof points that we shared today. Our platform is not immune, but we are resilient. And so when you look at some of the data points that we shared, our Payments -- our total Payments -- online Payments volume is 20%, which is actually quite healthy, but it's down 5 points.At the same time, when you look at our overall performance across Mailchimp and QuickBooks, we actually are seeing strength in serving our mid-market customers and continuing to serve our customers that have been on the platform for a long time. The proof points that I shared was our customer growth in mid-market is strong. We're growing Payroll -- U.S. Payroll double digits, and we're actually seeing a migration to our higher-end Payroll offerings. And net-net, we are not immune, but we are resilient, and we feel really good about the sustained growth that we've delivered and the trajectory of the KPIs that we see as we look into next year.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley.Keith WeissMichelle, it's been great working for you -- or with you over the years. So congratulations on all the great work that you've done. Sasan, a question for you on just tax and kind of how it unfolded throughout this season. I understand sort of overall filings down because of less people kind of getting the refunds, right? And I understand DIY is probably a bigger component of it. I don't quite understand why TurboTax lose the share in that dynamic. Like what's the mechanism by which you guys get hit harder than others, and therefore, kind of lose share? That's question number one.And question number two, there has been some concern about an extended tax season and the ability for approximately 10% of filers to be able to file at a later date that pushes out of your fiscal year. You didn't mention that. Was there any significant impact from that side of the equation that some of this tax strength might just push into next fiscal year?Sasan K. GoodarziYes. Sure, Keith. Great question. Let me start with your share question. First and foremost, the majority of -- in fact, we would say, close to all of those that came into the category of taxes, to get access to their stimulus dollars and to their tax credit that were not tax filers before, almost all of them came into the do-it-yourself category because it is so much easier and faster to get access to, in essence, all their credit. And those are the filers that we see that have left the do-it-yourself category.The reason our share is down is actually pure math. We're the largest share player in the do-it-yourself category, and we got the largest share of those folks that actually came in during the pandemic era. And when they left the category, just by pure math and the cohort of customers that we review in our retention, what we, in essence, see is those cohort of customers that came in that did not file taxes before to get access to credits are the ones that left, which is actually what gives us confidence, when we look at our key retention forwards looking ahead, but also our TurboTax Live performance that we talked about earlier. So that's where -- that's how the share plays out. It's pure math. We got the majority of them, and when they left the category, they left TurboTax. In terms of extensions, yes, there's dollars attached to it, Keith. But in context of a $14 billion company, it's really -- we don't consider it material. So that's why we didn't show, and I didn't really spend much time talking about it.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Siti Panigrahi from Mizuho.Sitikantha PanigrahiMichelle, it was great working with you. Good luck with your next endeavor. And Sasan, I want to dig into Mailchimp. It's good to see that acceleration to mid- to high-teens growth in Mailchimp. So could you talk about -- like you made some changes. How much of that contributed to growth versus what are you seeing in the demand environment? Is macro really a headwind at this point? What are you seeing in the spending pattern on marketing from your customer base? And how sustainable going forward?Sasan K. GoodarziWas the last part of your question how sustainable is that going forward?Sitikantha PanigrahiYes.Sasan K. GoodarziOkay. So thank you for the question. First of all, very consistent with what I've shared in the last probably 18 months or so, we felt, and I felt very strongly that the opportunity that we had with Mailchimp is how we bring it together with QuickBooks to truly create one platform that becomes the source of truth for running your business. And in an environment where now we have access to, with our customers' permission, the data, applying AI and generative AI, we can now shift the platform to a place where we can do everything for you and deliver insights to help you manage your cash flow, to help you grow your customers. And that's really the ultimate game changer that we are focused on.With that said, the thing that I've been very consistent with you all is that this is all about execution. So all of the progress that you're seeing us talk about in Mailchimp is all better execution. It is not any macro tailwinds. This is from the talent that we've put in place at the leadership level and the talent that we have upgraded across Mailchimp to then end-to-end.We've been revamping the website. We have the -- looking at business model, innovation in our lineup, and we've made improvements. We're improving the product. We're doubling down on mid-market and not only getting our existing customers to understand what features and functionality that we have to deliver the benefit, which helps us with retention and expansion revenue, but also the new customers that we're getting at assisted onboarding and using a lot of our AI and virtual expert platform capabilities.So those were sort of illustrative examples relative to why we're seeing paid conversion increase, paid customers increase. We're seeing better retention and better revenue per customer. It is all execution, and I expect this to continue to improve our execution, and coupling that with what we're doing across the QuickBooks platform, truly creating one platform that becomes a source of truth for your business. I am excited and bullish about the future possibilities of what we can do for small businesses, particularly with what's possible with data and gen AI.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer.Scott Andrew SchneebergerMichelle, best wishes for sure. Sasan, I guess this could be a double tax question. The IRS is down 1% year-to-date. You're saying down 2% through the end of July. Just curious, what's going to take it down more in your eyes and how that looks in future years as you continue to think this is more just a pandemic-related year and we get back to normalcy? That's part number one.And part number two, historically, when we look at unit growth of TurboTax, which was -- you anticipated to be negative 5%, and then revenue per return, which you anticipate to be plus 12%, usually A plus B equals the Consumer segment revenue growth. But you have -- and that would be 7%-plus, but you're guiding 5% to 6%. So is there conservatism in there? Or is there maybe some financial products that you were unable to sell so you're getting a little less -- that maybe is not qualified as revenue per return but something else? Or maybe it's something that's not TurboTax-related directly in the category?Sasan K. GoodarziSure, Scott. Let me take your first question. There are 2 assumptions that we are making based on all the data that we have and what we see from last year. One is there was actually a lot more extensions last year than we view will take place this year, even with the states that have pushed out. Plus last year, there were more filers. This is in the bucket of the pre-pandemic era -- or the pandemic-era filers that came in to get their stimulus money in their tax credits. There was still a lot of those filers last year through July and a little bit beyond. And so when we take out those filers and we compare to the extensions last year, our view is that IRS will be down 2%. And so that has, of course, an impact, 2%, which has an impact on the performance that we talked about.Secondarily, we really did an incredible amount of analysis to make sure that we had an understanding of these pandemic-era filers and are they all sort of out. And the reality is there's no more stimulus for tax credits to be had by those filers. So based on all of our analysis, they are out. And so therefore, we expect this year that IRS, at a minimum, is going to be flat. And of course, when we guide, we'll share with you what we've assumed in our guidance in August. But we would assume, at a minimum, it will be flat, maybe even up but, at a minimum, flat based on the reasons that I just mentioned. So that's the first part of your question.The second part of your question is a really good one, and I'll get to the specifics in a moment. I think just sort of reiterate, even in an environment where IRS returns went down, our future is TurboTax Live. And our future is the growth of what we can do with our Live platform, especially with the data and AI capabilities that we have to really disrupt the assisted segment. And our real compass going forward is going to be the growth of our TurboTax Live platform, both in terms of customer growth and revenue growth.And I may just ask Michelle to weigh in on this, but this sort of comes down to just pure math in terms of when we look at our units and we look at what folks paid for, it sort of adds up to the 12 points seen up in ARPC. It's really nothing beyond that, but let me just ask Michelle. Michelle, would you weigh in on that point at all beyond what I just shared?Michelle M. ClatterbuckSorry. I was having trouble with the mute button there. No, Sasan. Some of it can just be also rounding with units and returns. And so I wouldn't get overly concerned on that, Scott.Scott Andrew SchneebergerGot it. So the headline is the 12 points in ARPC growth is sort of very tangible relative to the units that we got?Michelle M. ClatterbuckYes. You got the 12 points of ARPC. And then as you said, Scott, we shared we expect the units to be down 5%. So...OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Daniel Jester from BMO Capital Markets.Daniel William JesterA couple more on tax. I think you mentioned before that overall retention, because of the factors you mentioned on the call already, is going to be down this year. But could you focus in on just Live retention, given how important that's going to be for the future of the platform? How did that shake out this year? And if you could share in terms of Live customer growth, are you getting more from -- takeaways from competitors? Or is these DIY customers trading up to Live? Any color you could provide there would be helpful.Sasan K. GoodarziYes. Sure, Daniel. First of all, yes, you're right in what you heard us say earlier, which is we would expect retention to be down 1 point-plus. And we'll talk about it, of course, more at Investor Day. And it's really because of these pandemic-era filers that came in and have now left the categories.Overall, we like the mix of what we've seen across our Live platform, and we'll share again more of the specifics as we get into Investor Day. But our retention and sort of existing customers coming back, we felt very good about what we expected and what we saw.I would say the second thing is it's a mix. It's a mix of both those that did taxes themselves the prior year that ultimately chose to upgrade to a sort of a Live platform because something changed in their life, inclusive of getting customers that were prior-year assisted in that. And remember, our -- really, our competition is those that go to mom-and-pop shops. It's the 88 million folks, where the majority of them will ultimately go to a local mom-and-pop shop to get their taxes done, and that's where we get a lot of the switchers also from those mom-and-pop shops.So we have a good mix of retention. Those that did taxes themselves last year and chose to use the Live platform because of a confidence question or some concern and then getting those that were prior assisted. And that's a mix we like, and that's a mix we believe will continue.Now it will be different as we take full service to use either in a further scale because we believe we'll accelerate full-service penetration at a much higher rate than even today. So that's the way I would have you think about it.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow from Barclays.Raimo LenschowOne question on Credit Karma. You kind of raised the guidance there, and that came after a quarter where we had a lot of turmoil in the financial services industry with the regional banks, et cetera. Can you talk a little bit about what you saw this quarter in terms of the extra headwinds that obviously played out there, but you're actually doing better than what you had guided previously?Sasan K. GoodarziWe're actually continuing to see strength based on our innovation in a couple of areas. One is in cards and in some parts driven by our Karma Guarantee, which is really unique to Credit Karma, where the certainty is very high for a member to get approved for what they are looking for because of the data and AI capabilities that we have.The second is Credit Karma Money. And this is where, as I always have shared, we are building a consumer platform to be the destination for consumers with the integrations that we're doing with TurboTax and Credit Karma. And in essence, we saw a 45% increase in the number of TurboTax customers that chose to put their money on a Credit Karma Money account. And not only do we make some revenue on that, but over time, based on the higher frequency of the engagement that we can ultimately monetize even further, which were not in the numbers that I just mentioned.So really, it's across our innovation across cards and Credit Karma Money. That's why we saw the performance that we saw in the quarter. And then with 1 quarter left in the year, we, of course, have confidence to improve the guidance that we provided to what Michelle shared earlier.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Jackson Ader from MoffettNathanson.Jackson Edmund AderWe saw the press release related to the IRS direct filing program, but I just thought maybe, Sasan, if we could hear what you're thinking are maybe the largest potential threat of that study that came out as part of the Inflation Reduction Act last year?Sasan K. GoodarziYes. Sure. Thank you for the question. I'll share a couple of perspectives that is really consistent with what we've talked about, but this is probably an important time to reiterate how we think about it. First and foremost, I can't vouch for their study. I can simply vouch for the facts that we have and the facts that are already in the market. And I think the first one is free tax software is already available to all consumers, and the awareness is actually quite high. So that's the first thing that I would just remind us of.I think the second thing I would say is a reminder of this will yet be another free tax software in the marketplace. And I would just say, if you look at the last 4-plus years, there were several entrants, big entrants, into the free tax software. One was Credit Karma before we acquired them, where they have 100 million-plus customers, a trusted platform. And they entered into the market of providing free tax software with sort of very little to no impact.And then another very large player that we sold Credit Karma tax to when we acquired Credit Karma. And you can, of course, observe what their results are. The point is that free tax software is already available, has been available to every consumer, and the awareness is extremely high. And so to have another sort of free tax software that's available is really immaterial is the way we think about it. And I'll remind us, by the way, it's actually not free. This is going to cost taxpayers billions of dollars, and so it's really not free.And I think the last thing I would say is really back to our vision. Our vision has been from what we declared 4 years ago to really become a consumer platform of choice, which means that beyond serving you to help you get your taxes done, we're delivering benefits through Credit Karma beyond tax, which means we can monetize beyond tax.And really, out of the $35 billion TAM in tax, less than $5 billion is do-it-yourself. And really, our biggest opportunity is the other $30 billion we're going after, $20 billion of it being consumers that have somebody else get their taxes done and $10 billion being business tax. That's our future. That's our presence. That's where we are focused. And so net-net, when I think about the IRS study that was announced, I think it's a study. Facts friendly, you look at the facts in the marketplace. This is for us, this is really not a threat at all.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Brad Sills from Bank of America.Bradley Hartwell SillsI wanted to ask a question around the TurboTax ARPU number. Such a nice increase that you're expecting this year at 12%. Could you help unpack that a little bit for us, please? Obviously, TurboTax Live was a key driver there. I guess, 2 questions. Were there other contributors here, premium mix shift or other items, perhaps?And then also on TT Live, what would you attribute the strength to? We've seen the ads this tax season: don't do your taxes, we'll do them for you. Is it just growing awareness of QuickBook -- sorry, of TurboTax as a solution to help with assisted? You've been at this for a number of years. So just kind of, I guess, what's working there?Sasan K. GoodarziYes. Sure, Brad. A couple of things. You actually nailed that our ARPU increase -- on top of ARPU increases in the last several years has come from TurboTax Live. It is a disruptive price offering. At the same time, it's got much higher ARPU and some of the more premium customers that chose -- they're either self-employed or they're investors and, of course, chose our premium SKU, which has a higher ARPU. So those are a couple of big drivers.I would tell you that the thing that I am sort of most excited about were the insights and the learnings that we got this year that really informs what we're going to double down on right now as we prepare for next year. One is full service. Full service is not an offering that is -- has product market fit. It's at scale. It's -- we got an 84 Net Promoter Score this year, which is the highest Net Promoter of anything across the company we have ever had. And you've heard me say it before around Credit Karma, well, this is even a higher Net Promoter. And that contributed to a small amount this year because we were really being thoughtful and careful about ensuring we get to -- we have the right product market fit and we can deliver for customers. Well, we surprised ourselves in terms of the product market fit, and we're going to be really intentional about doubling down on that next year.I think, I would say, the other thing, back to your question around learning, is we really learned where and how experts. And remember, experts are not just human. It's both our AI and generative AI capabilities and/or humans, depending on the need of the customer, engaging around the money experience, helping customers understand their refund, changes in their refund or their balance due and changes in their balance due.We learned, coupled with our go-to-market strategy, how to really nail that benefit, and that's what drove the growth. But we believe we are capable of so much more growth as we look ahead based on the insights we got towards the end of the season, and that's what we'll be focused on as we head into next year.OperatorThat's all the time we have today for questions, and this concludes our question-and-answer session. Would you like to close with any additional remarks?Sasan K. GoodarziYes. Just to say thank you for all your great questions, and many thanks to our employees and customers for their amazing focus and being part of this storied franchise, and we look forward to seeing all of you at next earnings. Thank you, everybody.OperatorLadies and gentlemen, thank you for participating. This concludes today's conference call.]"

However, the figure was around 1% below estimates, according to analysts at Wolfe Research.California-based Intuit noted that many Americans who filed taxes during the pandemic to receive federal stimulus funds failed to deliver their returns this season. Total tax filings are seen declining by around 2% in its current fiscal year, while TurboTax's share of these returns is projected to slide by approximately 80 basis points.Meanwhile, elevated interest rates also ate into the performance of Intuit's Credit Karma personal finance platform, where revenue fell by 12%.Despite these headwinds, quarterly income of $8.92 per share still managed to top projections of $8.48.But the company said it predicts that fourth-quarter adjusted earnings per share will be between $1.43 to $1.48, which, according to Refinitiv data cited by Reuters, would be below expectations of $1.51.Chief Executive Sasan Goodarzi noted in an earnings call that the group had invested heavily in building up its data and artificial intelligence capabilities. Intuit is in a race to enhance its offerings in a bid to fend off competitors like Oracle's (NYSE:ORCL) NetSuite and Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Dynamics 365 Platform.Additional reporting by Scott Kanowsky.Reuters contributed to this report.Related ArticlesIntuit slips after third-quarter revenue misses estimatesEU willing to consider changes to Italy reform plan, but Rome must be quickAnalysis-EU power battle risks denting planned safeguards for financial products]"

Analysts, on average, estimated $6.09 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The period that ended April 30 — including tax season — is the most critical for the maker of TurboTax and other finance software. Profit, excluding some items, was $8.92 a share, while analysts expected $8.45.Intuit said the number of federal tax returns will decline about 2% by the end of the fiscal year and the market share among customers doing their own taxes will fall about three-quarters of a point.“This was driven by taxpayers who filed in order to receive pandemic-era stimulus and tax credits during the past several years but did not file taxes this season,” Intuit said in the statement.The decrease in the expected number of tax filers “equates to approximately $200 million of negative impact to revenue per TurboTax, versus our original expectations,” Chief Executive Officer Sasan Goodarzi said on a conference call after the results.The shares fell about 5.5% in extended trading after closing at $449.80 in New York. The stock has gained 16% this year.Revenue from the consumer group, including TurboTax, gained 3% to $3.3 billion in the quarter, short of analysts’ estimates of $3.53 billion. The IRS said last week that it will test a free agency-run online tax-filing tool, following an infusion of money from the Biden administration. Wall Street analysts still say it’s a remote possibility that a government-run system would disrupt TurboTax.Story continuesGoodarzi, in an interview, dismissed the potential effect of the government’s program. The IRS “and their partners don’t know how to build software at scale — this is the government,” Goodarzi said.Intuit’s has been steering users toward a live, full-service version of the TurboTax service this year, in an attempt to compete with traditional accountants. “Our future is TurboTax live,” Goodarzi said. “Especially with AI capability, we can really disrupt the assisted segment.”Goodarzi added that TurboTax already uses artificial intelligence to communicate with customers. The company had about 740 million digital interactions with customers this year, including through automated chat bots, compared with 24 million human interactions, he said.Intuit said sales in the current quarter will increase 9% to 10%, raising its fiscal year revenue forecast to as much as $14.3 billion. Analysts, on average, estimated of $14.2 billion. Annual earnings, excluding some items, will be $14.20 to $14.25 a share.

However, stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financials over the long term, which in this case look pretty respectable. In this article, we decided to focus on Sempra Energy's  ROE.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. View our latest analysis for Sempra Energy How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Sempra Energy is:9.3% = US$2.8b ÷ US$30b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.09.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.Sempra Energy's Earnings Growth And 9.3% ROEAt first glance, Sempra Energy's ROE doesn't look very promising. However, its ROE is similar to the industry average of 8.7%, so we won't completely dismiss the company. Looking at Sempra Energy's exceptional 24% five-year net income growth in particular, we are definitely impressed. Taking into consideration that the ROE is not particularly high, we reckon that there could also be other factors at play which could be influencing the company's growth. For example, it is possible that the company's management has made some good strategic decisions, or that the company has a low payout ratio.Story continuesNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Sempra Energy's growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 2.7% in the same period, which is great to see.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. If you're wondering about Sempra Energy's's valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry.Is Sempra Energy Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?Sempra Energy's significant three-year median payout ratio of 64% (where it is retaining only 36% of its income) suggests that the company has been able to achieve a high growth in earnings despite returning most of its income to shareholders.Additionally, Sempra Energy has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Based on the latest analysts' estimates, we found that the company's future payout ratio over the next three years is expected to hold steady at 52%. As a result, Sempra Energy's ROE is not expected to change by much either, which we inferred from the analyst estimate of 11% for future ROE.SummaryOverall, we feel that Sempra Energy certainly does have some positive factors to consider. While no doubt its earnings growth is pretty substantial, we do feel that the reinvestment rate is pretty low, meaning, the earnings growth number could have been significantly higher had the company been retaining more of its profits. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down.

LYB recently stated that its board has declared a quarterly dividend of $1.25 per share, a 5% increase over its first-quarter 2023 payout. With an ex-dividend date of May 26, 2023, the amount will be paid out on Jun 6, 2023, to shareholders on record as of May 30, 2023.LYB said that 2023 marks the 13th straight year of its annual dividend hike. The rising dividend reflects the company's continuous dedication to offering its shareholders high returns. In addition, it is consistent with LyondellBasell's long-term goal, which was disclosed by the company at its Capital Markets Day, of returning 70% of free cash flow to shareholders. The company will continue to deploy capital prudently as it takes the lead in developing innovations for regular, sustainable living.Notably, LyondellBasell generated $482 million in cash from operating activities during the first quarter. The company returned $460 million as dividends and share repurchases during the quarter.Shares of LYB have lost 16.8% over the past year compared with industry’s decline of 7.1%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe company, on its first-quarter call, noted that it anticipates a slight increase in global demand driven by usual seasonal trends.  The demand for transportation fuels is expected to increase over the summer, supporting oxyfuels and refining margins.  Delays at the beginning of industry-wide capacity expansions for polyethylene in North America are likely to lower new market supply and support polyethylene margins.  To keep pace with the market expectation, LyondellBasell estimates operating Intermediates &amp; Derivatives assets at 80%. It anticipates modestly raising global olefins and polyolefins operating rates to 85%.  The company will continue to monitor the impact of shifting global monetary policies and strengthening economic conditions in China on petrochemical markets in the second half of 2023.Story continuesLyondellBasell Industries N.V.

(NYSE:LYB) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next 2 days. The ex-dividend date is usually set to be one business day before the record date which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. In other words, investors can purchase LyondellBasell Industries' shares before the 26th of May in order to be eligible for the dividend, which will be paid on the 6th of June.The company's next dividend payment will be US$1.25 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$4.76 per share. Last year's total dividend payments show that LyondellBasell Industries has a trailing yield of 5.2% on the current share price of $90.68. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! We need to see whether the dividend is covered by earnings and if it's growing. Check out our latest analysis for LyondellBasell Industries Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. LyondellBasell Industries is paying out an acceptable 51% of its profit, a common payout level among most companies. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. It paid out 99% of its free cash flow in the form of dividends last year, which is outside the comfort zone for most businesses. Companies usually need cash more than they need earnings - expenses don't pay themselves - so it's not great to see it paying out so much of its cash flow.Story continuesLyondellBasell Industries paid out less in dividends than it reported in profits, but unfortunately it didn't generate enough cash to cover the dividend. Were this to happen repeatedly, this would be a risk to LyondellBasell Industries's ability to maintain its dividend.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with shrinking earnings are tricky from a dividend perspective. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. Readers will understand then, why we're concerned to see LyondellBasell Industries's earnings per share have dropped 5.4% a year over the past five years. Ultimately, when earnings per share decline, the size of the pie from which dividends can be paid, shrinks.The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. In the last 10 years, LyondellBasell Industries has lifted its dividend by approximately 0.9% a year on average.The Bottom LineIs LyondellBasell Industries an attractive dividend stock, or better left on the shelf? LyondellBasell Industries had an average payout ratio, but its free cash flow was lower and earnings per share have been declining. It's not the most attractive proposition from a dividend perspective, and we'd probably give this one a miss for now.Although, if you're still interested in LyondellBasell Industries and want to know more, you'll find it very useful to know what risks this stock faces. To help with this, we've discovered 3 warning signs for LyondellBasell Industries that you should be aware of before investing in their shares.Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see.

The latter phenomena are not really surprising, given the huge increases in the utilization of renewable energy, along with the electric-vehicle revolution.Among the new technologies rising to the forefront are innovative types of energy storage, devices that enhance solar energy and wind energy projects, the use of artificial intelligence to enhance electricity usage and new technologies that enhance the electric grid.Here are three energy stocks with game-changing technologies:InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsArray Technologies (ARRY)An image of a solar panel in the shape of a piggy bank on a rooftop; concept for solar stocksSource: Andreas Prott / ShutterstockArray (NASDAQ:ARRY) has developed DuraTrack, a “tracking system” for solar projects.  According to Solar Power World, “Trackers direct solar panels or modules toward the sun.”Trackers can reportedly increase the “energy production [of solar projects] by about 30%.” That’s a really meaningful increase, particularly for utilities that are deploying huge amounts of solar panels. Given the proliferation of EVs, electricity is likely to keep getting more expensive, particularly in parts of the world that do not strictly regulate electricity utilities. Consequently, Array’s DuraTrack is going to be able to save consumers and companies a great deal of money over the longer term.Array says that DuraTrack features the “innovative use of fewer components combined with [a] failure-free wind design.”Critically, solar project owners appear to very much like DuraTrack, as the company’s top line jumped to $376.77 million from $300.586 million during the same period a year earlier, while its income from operations came in at $47.458 million, versus a loss of $38.344 million during the same period a year earlier.Stem Inc (STEM)A photo of two men installing a solar panel.Source: ShutterstockStem (NYSE:STEM) offers multiple products, but its “bread-and-butter” technology is its artificial intelligence-driven software, Athena. Despite the low price of STEM stock, the company is a leader in using artificial intelligence (AI) technology which, of course, is quite “hot” right now and rightfully so.Story continuesAthena uses AI “to maximize energy asset performance and investments.” It does that by jointly managing “solar, storage, and EV charging” systems. Additionally, when Athena manages the latter systems, it takes into account ” data about weather, market prices, utility rates, and other factors.”As electricity gets more expensive and many more companies utilize solar, storage and EV charging, Athena will become much more valuable and popular.But utilization of the system is already growing quite rapidly, as Stem’s revenue soared 63% year-over-year last quarter.Making the shares even more attractive, they’re changing hands for about 0.75 times analysts’ mean 2024 sales target for the company.General Electric (GE)Company breakups: The General Electric GE logo on a buildingSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comGE (NYSE:GE) has some very impressive technology in the energy sector. According to the company, its Haliade X turbine is “the most powerful offshore wind turbine to date” and significantly lowers the cost of producing electricity for operators. Haliade is the first turbine to have a capacity of over 12 megawatts of electricity.The company is also working on creating a larger “17-18 megawatt (MW) Haliade-X offshore wind turbine,” Elektrek reported in March. The publication noted that “Wind turbine manufacturers keep building larger turbines because the more power a turbine captures, the more the cost of electricity is reduced.”Moreover, GE’s High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) systems sound both extremely useful in today’s new-energy world and likely to move the needle for GE stock. These products “enable utilities to move more power further, efficiently integrate renewables, interconnect grids and improve network performance,” GE reports.In March, two consortia led by GE signed huge deals worth a total of $10 billion “to build state of the art” HVDC systems in Europe.As of the date of publication, Larry Ramer owned shares of GE and STEM.

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this oil refiner have returned -6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +1.6% change. The Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry, to which Valero Energy belongs, has lost 4.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Valero Energy is expected to post earnings of $5.56 per share, indicating a change of -51.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -25.3% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $22.35 points to a change of -23.4% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -14.1%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $14.58 indicates a change of -34.8% from what Valero Energy is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -11.8%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Valero Energy is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for VLO _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Valero Energy, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $35.65 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -31%. For the current and next fiscal years, $143.41 billion and $136.74 billion estimates indicate -18.7% and -4.7% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryValero Energy reported revenues of $36.44 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -5.5%. EPS of $8.27 for the same period compares with $2.31 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $28.89 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +26.14%. The EPS surprise was +14.23%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Valero Energy is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Valero Energy.

For more stocks, head on over to Billionaire Andreas Halvorsen's Viking Global Portfolio: Top 5 Stock Picks. The world of investing is full of uncertainty. After all, there's no such thing as a free lunch, and trying to gauge the mood of the countless investors that make up the stock market carries with it its own set of risks. However, these moods are also often influenced by broader macroeconomic sentiments, and this factor has been true for the past couple of years as well. The stock market was dealt a major shock as investors fearful of the economic impact of the coronavirus exited the market in droves. Then, they rushed back as technology stocks boomed due to a favorable environment created by the lockdowns. However, yet again, this victory would be short lived since the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the after effects of the coronavirus led to fiscal expansion harbored in inflation and cut down the markets for growth companies.All these ups and downs appeared to be over as 2023 set in and major stock markets were eager to rise. But, as if the stock market gods weren't happy, the latest debate about the future of the market surrounds one of the most catastrophic events to hit the American economy - if it occurs. This phenomenon, often limited to struggling developing countries, is also knocking on the doors of the U.S. - the world's largest economy and a global financial sector. This threat is that of default, and in simple terms, it implies that the Treasury Department might not be able to meet its obligations if it is prevented from raising more debt. Or, in other words, the Treasury has to borrow to spend - and there's no way around it.The Treasury's ability to borrow is mandated by Congress - the sole governing body with authority to manage America's spending. However, Treasury itself is part of the Executive branch of America, headed by the Secretary appointed by the President. So, right now, it's back and forth between Congress and President Biden - or to be more specific, the Republican Party and the President - since the Democrats represent Mr. Biden's own party. Both sides have their own view on the debt ceiling, and the President's side released a rather ominous white paper in May 2023 where it predicted that should the U.S. default on its debt, the stock market might fall a stunning 45%.Story continuesTo quote the White House:The costs would be even greater under a protracted default. A CEA simulation of the effect of a protracted default shows an immediate, sharp recession on the order of the Great Recession. In 2023 Q3, the first full quarter of the simulated debt ceiling breach, the stock market plummets 45 percent, leading to a hit to retirement accounts; meanwhile, consumer and business confidence take substantial hits, leading to a pullback in consumption and investment. Unemployment increases 5 percentage points as consumers cut consumption, and businesses lay off workers. Unlike the Great Recession and the COVID recession, the government is unable to help consumers and businesses. As the breach continues, the economy heals slowly, and unemployment is still 3 percentage points higher at the end of 2023.On the flip side, the House Republicans maintain that they are earnestly striving to find a solution to avoid a default - and it's the Democrats who are refusing to negotiate. House Speaker McCarthy, speaking in April 2023, continued to express willingness to negotiate as he stated:Even members of his [BIDEN] own party think this approach is extreme. Democrat Senator Joe Mansion recently said, “Recent actions make clear to me that the Biden Administration is determined to pursue ideological agenda.” Senator Mansion is right. Make no mistake: the longer President Biden waits to be sensible, defined an agreement, the more likely it becomes that this administration will bumble into the first default in our nation’s history. Addressing the debt requires us to come together, find common ground, and reduce spending. Let me be clear. Defaulting on our debt is not an option, but neither is a future of higher taxes, higher interest rates, more dependency on China, an economy that doesn’t work for working Americans.So, amidst this back and forth between politicians, what does the regular investor do? Well, one approach is to follow the professionals. And one such professional is Ole Andreas Halvorsen of Viking Global. Mr. Halvorsen is worth $5.9 billion, and he set up his hedge fund in 1999.

The Zacks Medical - HMOs industry, to which UnitedHealth belongs, has gained 0% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection.

352,61f0d394-b69c-3076-8acd-c7e67db52b57,PFG,2023-05-24,Principal Financial Group (NASDAQ:PFG) Has Announced A Dividend Of $0.64,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/principal-financial-group-nasdaq-pfg-143130030.html,1684852290,STORY,['PFG'],"[Principal Financial Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:PFG) will pay a dividend of $0.64 on the 30th of June. Based on this payment, the dividend yield on the company's stock will be 3.6%, which is an attractive boost to shareholder returns. See our latest analysis for Principal Financial Group Principal Financial Group's Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsWe like to see robust dividend yields, but that doesn't matter if the payment isn't sustainable. However, Principal Financial Group's earnings easily cover the dividend. This means that most of what the business earns is being used to help it grow.Over the next year, EPS is forecast to fall by 53.3%. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we believe the payout ratio could be 33%, which we are pretty comfortable with and we think is feasible on an earnings basis.historic-dividendPrincipal Financial Group Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $0.84 in 2013, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $2.56. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 12% over that duration. So, dividends have been growing pretty quickly, and even more impressively, they haven't experienced any notable falls during this period.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowInvestors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. It's encouraging to see that Principal Financial Group has been growing its earnings per share at 17% a year over the past five years. With a decent amount of growth and a low payout ratio, we think this bodes well for Principal Financial Group's prospects of growing its dividend payments in the future.Principal Financial Group Looks Like A Great Dividend StockOverall, we like to see the dividend staying consistent, and we think Principal Financial Group might even raise payments in the future. The company is generating plenty of cash, and the earnings also quite easily cover the distributions. If earnings do fall over the next 12 months, the dividend could be buffeted a little bit, but we don't think it should cause too much of a problem in the long term. Taking this all into consideration, this looks like it could be a good dividend opportunity.Story continuesIt's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one.

The S&amp;P 500 and the tech-heavy NASDAQ both are delivering positive returns to shareholders this year, gaining 9.39% and 22.2%, respectively, as of May 23. This market rally has boosted investors’ confidence. According to a survey conducted by Bankrate in March, analysts expect the S&amp;P 500 to rise by 8% over the next four quarters. The survey also highlighted that 46% of the respondents believe that the bull market may begin in the second half of the year.Despite these positive signs, many investors still prefer to steer clear of risks and prefer safe stocks that pay dividends. Blue chip companies are generally regarded as more stable and less volatile than smaller or riskier investments. According to a report by Wall Street Journal, exchange-traded funds that specialize in quality stocks have grown to over $60 billion over the past few years. The same report also quoted Denise Chisholm, director of the quantitative market strategy at Fidelity Investments. She said that quality stocks have outperformed about 80% of the time in the past three decades during periods of economic downturn.In addition to their strong performance, many blue chip companies have a history of paying consistent dividends. Investors seeking regular income through dividends may consider these quality stocks as they often have the financial strength to maintain and increase dividend payments over time. In our article titled 25 Things Every Dividend Investor Should Know, we mentioned data that shows the strong performance of companies with strong dividend growth track records. Dividend Aristocrats, companies that have raised their payouts for over 25 years, delivered a 12.13% return to shareholders from 1990 to 2018, compared with a 9.96% return for the broader market during this period.Story continuesBest Blue Chip Dividend Stocks To BuyPhoto by Joshua Hoehne on UnsplashMedtronic plc (NYSE:MDT), NextEra Energy, Inc.

Ltd. CWCO, Global Water Resources Inc. GWRS and SJW Group SJW.Industry: Water UtilityLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2098028/4-water-utility-stocks-to-watch-in-a-promising-industryWater utilities work day in and day out to ensure an uninterrupted supply of clean potable water and reliable sewer services to millions of customers in the United States. These are essential for healthy and hygienic living.The aging of pipelines is concerning but water utilities continue with their upgrade and maintenance projects to minimize disruptions in operations. American Water Works Company, with its widespread operations, provides services to domestic customers and military bases and offers an excellent opportunity to stay invested in the water utility space. Other utilities worth retaining in one’s portfolio are Consolidated Water Co. Ltd., Global Water Resources Inc. and SJW Group.About the IndustryThe Zacks Utility - Water Supply industry includes companies providing drinking water and wastewater services to industrial, commercial, residential customer classes and numerous military bases. Water utility operators own nearly 2.2 million miles of pipelines that are getting old. Utilities continuously replace old pipelines and add new ones to expand operations.Utility operators own storage tanks, treatment plants and desalination plants to supply uninterrupted potable water across customer classes. High per capita usage and increasing population are resulting in higher demand for potable water and water utilities, apart from necessitating proper maintenance and upgrade of aging infrastructure to supply water, utilize technology to treat saline water and make it fit for consumption.3 Trends Pivotal for Shaping the Water Supply Industry's FutureFragmented Water Industry Needs Consolidation:  Since the U.S. water utility industry is highly fragmented, upgrading aging assets to provide quality services is the need of the hour. Per the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE), at present, 50,000 community water systems and 16,000 community wastewater systems in the United States are providing water solutions to customers. Per the ASCE finding, due to the delay in pipeline repairs and maintenance, 6 billion gallons of treated water is lost every day in the United States.Story continuesThe highly fragmented industry creates operational challenges in meeting the requirement for replacement, and adding to the aging water and wastewater infrastructure. Large water utility companies continue to acquire small companies to ensure the extension of high-quality services to customers and the investment required to upgrade old and acquired assets. Water conservation and initiatives taken by large water operators in educating their consumers on efficient use of appliances and detecting leakage should help to prevent wastage.Aging Infrastructure Needs Huge Investments: The water and wastewater infrastructure is aging and gradually nearing the end of its effective service life. Per the findings of the ASCE, water main breaks occur every two minutes in the United States due to the aging of the existing water infrastructure. It is evident that this industry needs more investment for maintenance and upgrade.Per the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), an estimated $744-billion investment is necessary to maintain and expand the drinking water and wastewater service to meet demand over the next 20 years. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provided $50 billion to EPA to strengthen the drinking water and wastewater systems of the United States. A major portion of the investment will be directed to upgrading water infrastructure serving disadvantaged communities.Efficient Use is Saving Precious Water: An interesting trend in the water industry is the reduction in per-capita water usage. The reasons for the drop are the use of water-efficient techniques, heightened awareness among customers courtesy of the water utilities, the use of advanced water-efficient appliances and actions taken to fix pipeline leaks.Efficiency in water usage in irrigation for farming and lower water usage in thermoelectric power due to better cooling methods reduce water usage. Lower use per person allows water utilities to meet the need of an expanding customer base without increasing capacity to a great extent. In a way, efficient usage and a reduction in wastage allow water utilities to keep their service rates unchanged for a longer period for consumers and assist water utility operators in increasing their earnings by serving a larger population with the same water supply capacity.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Utility Water Supply industry is a 12-stock group within the broader Zacks Utilities sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #87, which places it in the top 35% of more than 251 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bullish prospects for the near term. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are optimistic about this group’s earnings growth potential.Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock market performance and valuation.Industry Outperforms Sector, Lags S&amp;P 500The Zacks Utility Water Supply industry has outperformed its sector but lagged the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite over the past 12 months.

Here's How He's Positioning His Portfolio,Benzinga,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/itll-cost-us-system-know-192430167.html,1684869870,STORY,['PEP'],"[The U.S. is on track to default on its payments obligations if the debt ceiling is not raised.But according to Ray Dalio, founder of the world’s largest hedge fund Bridgewater Associates, the problem could extend beyond a debt crisis.“The debt ceiling negotiations is ridiculous because it’s not dealing with the problem,” he said in a YouTube video.The billionaire investor explains that if the debt ceiling is raised, the U.S. will just keep piling on debt. And if the limit does not increase, the country will have to either default or cut expenditures.“The problem is that we’re spending more than we’re earning, and it doesn’t have to be that way,” he said.“If we don’t fix that, we are going to have a debt crisis problem and social problem that’s going to cost us dearly — it’s going to cost us our system as we know it.”The situation is unsettling. But Dalio knows a thing or two about navigating uncertain waters. Here’s a look at some notable investment themes in Bridgewater’s portfolio.Don't miss:'People-First' Real Estate Fund Shares Rent With Tenants While Generating Strong Returns For InvestorsWhy Warren Buffett's Investing Strategy Is More Relevant Than Ever In Today's Real Estate MarketEmerging Market EquitiesDalio’s investment horizon extends beyond U.S. borders.According to Bridgewater’s latest Form 13F filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Dalio’s fund held 17,862,641 shares of iShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (NYSEARCA: IEMG) at the end of the first quarter. With the position valued at $871.52 million at the time, IEMG was the largest publicly traded holding in Bridgewater’s portfolio.IEMG holds more than 2,600 stocks and provides exposure to a broad range of emerging market companies. Its top three holdings are Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd., Tencent Holdings Ltd. and Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd.Bridgewater also owned 8,471,104 shares of Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF (NYSEARCA: VWO) at the end of March, a stake valued at $342.23 million.Story continuesVWO is another exchange-traded fund (ETF) that gives investors access to emerging markets like China, India, Brazil and South Africa. It holds more than 5,000 stocks.In a MarketWatch interview published in October, Dalio said that opportunities will “come in different regions” over the next five years.“As we look at the world, we have to recognize that there are bright spots and there are less bright spots, and places like emerging Asia, places such as Singapore and Vietnam and Indonesia and places like that are bright spots,” he said. “India, I think, is going to be a brighter spot.”Consumer StaplesIn an era where artificial intelligence and cutting-edge technologies dominate the headlines, consumer staples may not seem like an exciting business on the surface.But Dalio still likes the segment.Bridgewater’s third-largest publicly traded holding at the end of March was Procter &amp; Gamble Co. (NYSE: PG), a company deeply entrenched in the consumer staples business. With well-known brands like Tide, Bounty, Gillette and Pampers, the company offers a range of products that households buy on a regular basis, allowing it to generate consistent revenue through thick and thin.Beverages are another part of the consumer staples category. And rather than choosing between Pepsi and Coke, Dalio is going with both.Bridgewater’s Form 13F filing revealed that the firm held 2,807,523 shares of PepsiCo (NASDAQ: PEP) and 8,145,223 shares of Coca-Cola Co. (NYSE: KO) as of March 31, valued at $511.81 million and $505.25 million, respectively.It’s easy to see why both companies can be resilient: Even in a recession, a can of Coke or Pepsi is still affordable to most people.Another reason many investors are attracted to consumer staples companies is their ability to pay reliable dividends.Earlier this month, PepsiCo announced its 51st consecutive annual dividend increase. Coca-Cola’s board approved the company’s 61st consecutive payout increase in February. Meanwhile, Procter &amp; Gamble has paid a higher dividend to shareholders for 67 years straight.Stocks are volatile — and even big consumer staple names are not immune to the market’s wild swings. If your goal is to earn a steady stream of passive income, you might want to look into reliable dividend plays outside the stock market.Read next: How These Accredited Investors Pulled In Better Returns Than Warren BuffettWhile REITs Are Struggling, Private Market Real Estate Pulls In Huge ReturnsDon't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!

Supported by a solid liquidity position, the company is expected to continue with efficient capital deployment activities, thus enhancing shareholder value.However, significant outflows in AMP’s Asset Management segment make us apprehensive. Moreover, steadily rising expenses are expected to hurt the bottom line to some extent.Looking at its financials, the company’s net revenues (GAAP basis) witnessed a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 2.7% over the last five years (2018-2022). The momentum continued in the first quarter of 2023. AMP’s efforts to launch products are likely to keep supporting top-line growth in the quarters ahead. We project GAAP net revenues to grow at the rate of 10.5%, 7.3% and 4.3% in 2023, 2024 and 2025, respectively.Moreover, Ameriprise has grown inorganically and restructured its business from time to time to remain profitable by focusing on its core operations.In November 2021, the company closed the deal to take over BMO Financial Group’s EMEA asset management operations, which are likely to bolster its wealth and asset management businesses and global diversification efforts. In 2019, Ameriprise divested the Ameriprise Auto &amp; Home business. These initiatives are expected to further support revenue growth.In April 2023, Ameriprise announced a dividend hike for the 16th time since 2010. In January 2022, its board of directors authorized an additional repurchase plan worth $3 billion (expiring on Mar 31, 2024). As of Mar 31, 2022, the company had $1.1 billion worth of shares left to be repurchased. Given its strong balance sheet position, it is expected to sustain efficient capital deployments.However, analysts seem pessimistic regarding AMP’s earnings growth prospects. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company's 2023 earnings has been revised marginally lower over the past 30 days. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Story continuesOver the past year, shares of Ameriprise have gained 16.6% compared with the industry’s rise of 4.7%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe company’s Asset Management segment, which remains one of the major sources of revenues (accounting for 21.6% of total adjusted operating net revenues in the first quarter of 2023), has been witnessing significant outflows. While the segment witnessed overall net inflows in 2020 and 2021, outflows are expected to continue in the quarters ahead amid a tough operating backdrop. This will likely continue to adversely impact the segment’s performance.Further, while AMP's GAAP expenses declined in 2020, the same increased, witnessing a CAGR of 1.7% over the five-year period ended 2022. The uptrend persisted in the first quarter of 2023. Although the company’s initiatives to focus on cost management have resulted in controlled general and administrative expenses, overall costs are expected to remain elevated in the near term due to advertising campaigns, inflation, hiring and technology upgrades. Our estimates for GAAP expenses indicate a CAGR of 10.6% over the next three years.Finance Stocks Worth a LookA couple of better-ranked stocks from the finance space are Pathward Financial, Inc.
