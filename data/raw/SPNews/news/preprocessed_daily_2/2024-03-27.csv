Druckenmiller, worth over $9 billion, is going long on AI as he believes AI could be as big and transformative as the internet. In June last year, the billionaire said that he does not believe AI is a bubble and that’s why AI was dominating his long portfolio. Druckenmiller almost always thinks long term and that’s the open secret behind his success. Earlier this year, in an interview with How Leaders Lead with David Novak, Druckenmiller advised investors never to invest in the present and instead keep the next 18-24 months in mind and try to imagine how the world would be in the future. These thoughts are reflected in the billionaire’s portfolio as well. Duquesne Capital, which Druckenmiller founded in 1981, bought a new position in NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) in the last quarter of 2022, buying over 582,000 shares. Back then the contemporary generative AI boom was just getting started. Nvidia was trading at around $146 as of December 30, 2022. Today the stock is hovering around $926. As of the end of the last quarter of 2023 Duquesne Capital had a $306 million stake in the GPU company.\xa0 Nvidia is among the top picks of the fund, in addition to other big names like Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Eli Lilly And Co (NYSE:LLY).', 'Druckenmiller isn’t a huge fan of portfolio diversification. He said during the interview that if you really believe in a company, you’d take “massive” positions in it instead of putting your money in hundreds of companies. He said legendary investors like Warren Buffett, Carl Icahn and George Soros invest in a handful of companies they really like and believe in. Druckenmiller said instead of having “lazy longs” in your portfolio, if you put your money in just a few companies, you won’t get careless in the investing game.', 'Methodology', ""In this article we decided to see which stocks in Druckenmiller's portfolio are also seeing buying activity from corporate insiders. For that we scanned Druckenmiller's Q4'2023 portfolio and picked 11 stocks that saw insider buying activity over the past few months. But why is it important to keep tabs on hedge fund and insider activity? Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here)."", ""Billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller's Stake:\xa0$3,767,000 "", ""Canadian biotechnology company Abcellera Biologics Inc.

Additions in 2023 included Liberty Broadband, Charles Schwab, Elevance, and Capital One Financial.', 'Charles Schwab is notable because the business and the stock both had a challenging year. The regional banking panic in the spring of 2023 created an opportunity for us to add to our position below $50 per share. Rising interest rates have impacted the business in ways both predictable and unpredictable, but the net result has been a crimping of earnings that will likely persist for another year or two. Critically, we do not believe any of these transitory dynamics pose, or ever posed, any existential risk to the business. Further, Schwab’s enviable, high-return franchise remains, in our view, entirely intact. If we are right on both these counts, we should generate an attractive return from the current stock price across a range of long-term interest rate scenarios.', 'Shares in Charles Schwab returned -16% last year, making it the Fund’s worst-performing stock. By holding steady in the down market of 2022, it was one of the Fund’s best-performing stocks that year.

After the spin in the spring, I rotated the bulk of our investment from MSGE to\xa0Sphere Entertainment Co. (NYSE:SPHR), as I thought MSGE was trading at a reasonable valuation while SPHR remained deeply discounted. Since then, SPHR has completed construction of the Las Vegas Sphere, which opened to broadly positive reviews, and SPHR has appreciated further. However, we have substantially reduced our investment in SPHR. I was comfortable owning MSGE in significant size due to its unlevered ownership of the Madison Square Garden arena, an iconic venue with stable cash flows and modest growth. After the split, SPHR has no ownership of the arena and is instead a riskier growth company, with significant upside potential but also higher odds of a miss. As a result, we retain a smaller position in SPHR. Looking forward, I remain bullish on the Las Vegas Sphere and believe additional sphere developments could be a significant catalyst, offset somewhat by my worries regarding refinancing the MSGN loan while SPHR is still bearing a great number of front-end loaded growth expenses.”', ""Billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller's Stake:\xa0$10,220,000 "", ""Amy Banse, who is a director at Adobe Inc's\xa0(NASDAQ:ADBE)\xa0board, bought\xa0just 40 shares of Adobe Inc (NASDAQ:ADBE)\xa0on June 21, 2023, at $492 per share.

Acuity Brands' decent returns aren't reflected in Acuity Brands'mediocre five year net income growth average of 4.2%. We reckon that a low growth, when returns are moderate could be the result of certain circumstances like low earnings retention or poor allocation of capital."", ""Next, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Acuity Brands' reported growth was lower than the industry growth of 15% over the last few years, which is not something we like to see."", ""The basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. What is AYI worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether AYI is currently mispriced by the market."", ""Acuity Brands' low three-year median payout ratio of 4.9% (or a retention ratio of 95%) should mean that the company is retaining most of its earnings to fuel its growth. This should be reflected in its earnings growth number, but that's not the case. So there might be other factors at play here which could potentially be hampering growth. For example, the business has faced some headwinds."", ""In addition, Acuity Brands has been paying dividends over a period of at least ten years suggesting that keeping up dividend payments is way more important to the management even if it comes at the cost of business growth. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company is expected to drop to 3.4% over the next three years. Despite the lower expected payout ratio, the company's ROE is not expected to change by much."", ""Overall, we feel that Acuity Brands certainly does have some positive factors to consider. However, given the high ROE and high profit retention, we would expect the company to be delivering strong earnings growth, but that isn't the case here. This suggests that there might be some external threat to the business, that's hampering its growth. That being so, the latest analyst forecasts show that the company will continue to see an expansion in its earnings.

NCLH expects to complete the full fleet by 2024-end.NCLH is enhancing the guest experience on its ships by improving pre-cruise planning and leveraging digital tools across its brands. NCLH recently introduced the Regent onboard mobile app on Seven Seas Grandeur. These enhancements are well-received by guests, offering a smoother experience before, during, and after their cruise while also yielding positive returns.Focus on Fleet Expansion: Norwegian Cruise is constantly looking to expand its fleet size. It has plans to introduce five more ships through 2028. For the Oceania Cruises brand, the company has one Allura Class Ships to be delivered in 2025. For the Norwegian brand, the company has four Prima Class Ships on order, with scheduled delivery dates from 2025 through 2028. These additions are expected to increase its total Berths to approximately 82,500.The company’s new build pipeline is likely to pave a path for approximately 28% capacity growth by 2028, registering a CAGR of approximately 5% (from 2023 levels). This signifies the company's long-term strategy to deliver measured capacity growth and optimize the fleet to drive strong financial results.In 2023, the company added three new world-class ships to its fleet, one for each of its three award-winning brands."", 'High Costs: Norwegian Cruise has been bearing the brunt of high expenses for quite some time now. During the fourth quarter of 2023, total cruise operating expenses came in at $1.32 billion, up from $1.22 billion reported in the year-ago quarter. The company reported a rise in payroll, fuel and Commissions, transportation and other expenses. NCLH is cautious about increased expenses in terms of fuel and capacity additions. For 2024, our model predicts total cruise operating expenses to rise 6.9% year over year to $5,845 million.Geopolitical Uncertainties: The company’s operations are likely to be influenced by several geopolitical occurrences, including the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war. The conflict in Israel and the Red Sea led NCLH to cancel and redirect all calls to Israel in the fourth quarter of 2023. Moreover, all calls to Israel and the Red Sea have been canceled and redirected for the entirety of 2024. This impacted occupancy rates for the quarter and year.', 'Here are some better-ranked stocks from the Consumer Discretionary sector.Adtalem Global Education Inc.

The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period.

In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.3%) to estimate future growth.

You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Microchip Technology as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.8%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.423. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole.

DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued.

Let's see how Salesforce generated those massive gains -- and if it still has room to run."", ""From fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2024 (which ended this January), Salesforce's annual revenue grew at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 34% as its net income increased at a CAGR of 61%. That growth was driven by the rapid adoption of its CRM services and the expansion of its cloud ecosystem with more marketing, e-commerce, analytics, data visualization, and enterprise collaboration services. To support that expansion, it acquired a long list of companies -- including Slack, Tableau, MuleSoft, Demandware, ExactTarget, ClickSoftware, and Vlocity."", 'According to Gartner, Salesforce controlled 22% of the global cloud-based CRM in 2023. Its four closest competitors -- Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Oracle, SAP, and Adobe -- each held low- to mid-single-digit shares.', ""Salesforce's market-leading position in a growing market made it a popular tech stock over the past two decades but sales cooled off significantly over the past three years.

That could be a bright red flag that suggests Microsoft's investment in OpenAI -- which allowed it to integrate the start-up's AI tools into its cloud-based services -- is giving it an advantage against its enterprise software competitors."", ""Salesforce believes it can counter those threats by expanding its own Einstein AI platform. However, it could be difficult to sharpen Einstein's competitive edge if Salesforce's management focuses too much on cutting costs and buying back shares."", 'Salesforce had a great run since its IPO but is gradually aging from a growth play into a mature blue-chip tech stock.

During the fourth quarter of 2023, the company reported strong consumer demand, achieving record-high bookings and pricing levels during Black Friday and Cyber Monday week. NCLH continues to witness healthy demand across all markets, brands, and products.As of Dec 31, 2023, the company’s advance ticket sales balance came in at $3.2 billion, reflecting nearly 56% growth from comparable 2019 levels.The company intends to focus on strategic marketing efforts to drive demand and high-value bookings in the upcoming periods. For 2024, the company expects healthy net yield growth of approximately 5.4% on a constant currency basis on the back of improved occupancy and pricing strength.Digital Initiatives to Drive Growth: Increased focus on digital initiatives bodes well. Norwegian Cruise is focused on strategically enhancing the guest experience through smart ROI-driven investments and digital innovations across its fleet. The company recently rolled out Starlink high-speed Internet. It swiftly deployed the technology across half of its fleet since spring 2023. NCLH expects to complete the full fleet by 2024-end.NCLH is enhancing the guest experience on its ships by improving pre-cruise planning and leveraging digital tools across its brands. NCLH recently introduced the Regent onboard mobile app on Seven Seas Grandeur. These enhancements are well-received by guests, offering a smoother experience before, during, and after their cruise while also yielding positive returns.Focus on Fleet Expansion: Norwegian Cruise is constantly looking to expand its fleet size. It has plans to introduce five more ships through 2028. For the Oceania Cruises brand, the company has one Allura Class Ships to be delivered in 2025. For the Norwegian brand, the company has four Prima Class Ships on order, with scheduled delivery dates from 2025 through 2028. These additions are expected to increase its total Berths to approximately 82,500.The company’s new build pipeline is likely to pave a path for approximately 28% capacity growth by 2028, registering a CAGR of approximately 5% (from 2023 levels).

During the fourth quarter of 2023, total cruise operating expenses came in at $1.32 billion, up from $1.22 billion reported in the year-ago quarter. The company reported a rise in payroll, fuel and Commissions, transportation and other expenses. NCLH is cautious about increased expenses in terms of fuel and capacity additions. For 2024, our model predicts total cruise operating expenses to rise 6.9% year over year to $5,845 million.Geopolitical Uncertainties: The company’s operations are likely to be influenced by several geopolitical occurrences, including the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war. The conflict in Israel and the Red Sea led NCLH to cancel and redirect all calls to Israel in the fourth quarter of 2023. Moreover, all calls to Israel and the Red Sea have been canceled and redirected for the entirety of 2024.

It stems from investors' behavioral tendencies, where individual actions reinforce market trends. Moreover, momentum rewards may offset the risk of short-term underperformance that some investors avoid. Despite occasional short-term setbacks, like those seen in 2001, 2009, and 2023, momentum consistently offers lasting benefits. Both risk-based and behavioral-based explanations play a role in its persistence, supporting the belief that momentum will remain a viable strategy in the future."", ""The renewed interest in Bitcoin and the stock market suggests that there might be a big bubble forming. While gold's record contradicts this notion to some extent, hinting at genuine caution driven by concerns over unsustainable fiscal spending, signs of things getting too heated are still there. According to a recent Bloomberg report, when looking closely at how stocks in the S&P 500 index are moving, there is a similar pattern to what happened during the big bubble in the late 1990s and early 2000s. People are doing really well by purchasing stocks that have been doing well lately and investing in companies with growing earnings, putting momentum trading and growth investing in the spotlight. These strategies have been doing better than value investing. The current market rally seems to follow these patterns, especially with momentum trading making a strong comeback. Notably, the emergence of the Magnificent Seven as the prevailing investing theme in early 2023 led to a challenging period for momentum trading. However, the current situation differs, with momentum gaining momentum once again."", 'In January 2024, Charles Schwab’s chief investment strategist Liz Ann Sonders participated in CNBC’s “Last Call” to discuss the markets. Sonders noted that when benchmarks like the S&P 500 and Dow hit record highs, it drives the momentum higher – at least for a while when the market ignores earnings and market fundamentals, focusing on performance only. Similarly, Jeremy Siegel, Wharton School professor, joined CNBC’s ‘Closing Bell’ on March 8, 2024. Siegel talked about momentum investing trending these days, but he also said that in his experience, trending stocks might see a slump of a few days before getting back on an upwards trajectory. However, by then, most momentum investors have already pulled out of their holdings. The investors then quickly hop onto the trades they just sold to reap the benefits of the ongoing market rally. He noted that individuals need ‘nerves of steel’ for momentum investing. Siegel observed that momentum followers usually do not care about a company’s valuation, its management, or its operational efficiency. They just look at current performance charts and jump on, leading select companies to skyrocket, sometimes even without proper fundamentals supporting the growth. Siegel stated that momentum investors believe in ‘making the trend your friend’ and they are confident that they can ‘jump off the train before it falls off the cliff’.\xa0', ""However, on March 26, 2024, Liz Young, SoFi head of investment strategy, appeared on\xa0'Closing Bell' and said that momentum in equities is fading. Breaking down her statement, she highlighted that from October to December 2023, momentum and high beta led the markets. Heading into 2024, momentum was still leading but slightly slowing down, with investor focus shifting to low volatility and quality stocks. Young observed that in March, low volatility, quality, value, and dividends are leading the rally. In terms of the momentum behind the market rally itself, Young commented that the velocity and fervor is fading but the rally is not about to be over entirely. There is room for stocks to continue skyrocketing. Although, the rebalance at the end of Q1 2024 could pose a risk to momentum followers.\xa0"", 'Some of the top momentum stocks to buy include Meta Platforms, Inc.

But not every Magnificent Seven component could be considered a true artificial intelligence (AI) play.', 'If there were a new Magnificent Seven purely for AI stocks, then I would keep Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), but swap out Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, and Tesla for Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE), and Deere (NYSE: DE).', ""Here's why these seven companies are all excellent ways to invest in AI from various industries."", ""The poster child of the AI craze, Nvidia's growth is mostly due to sales to data centers. Faster and more secure processing power is needed to support complex AI solutions. And that's exactly what Nvidia is giving the industry."", 'The greatest risk to Nvidia is a slowdown in demand from its data center business. Operating income from its compute and networking segment (led by data centers) increased more than sixfold between fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023.', ""If demand slows, the growth could shrink as fast as it rose. However, an extreme slowdown is unlikely if AI investments pay off for Nvidia's customers."", 'Meta Platforms plans to spend $10 billion on Nvidia GPUs by the end of 2024. To quote Nvidia CFO Colette Kress on the Q4 fiscal 2024 earnings call:', 'Companies from search to e-commerce, social media, news and video services and entertainment are using AI for deep learning-based recommendation systems. These AI investments are generating a strong return by improving customer engagement, ad conversation, and click-through rates. Meta in its latest quarter cited more accurate predictions and improved advertiser performance as contributing to the significant acceleration in its revenue.', ""Meta is leveraging AI to boost user engagement, improve its algorithm, and better align ads to interested users. Instagram has become arguably the most valuable digital real estate in the world, and will likely stay that way thanks to Meta's AI investments."", ""The third and final Magnificent Seven stock that also deserves to be in the AI Magnificent Seven is Microsoft. The company's results show how AI can improve performance and accelerate growth even from established solutions."", 'Microsoft Copilots for Microsoft 365, GitHub Copilot, Security Copilot, Azure AI, and more are some of the many ways Microsoft uses AI to improve solutions without breaking what already works.', 'Microsoft makes so much money that it can invest in AI, fund its long-term growth, and still have plenty of cash to buy back stock and raise its dividend. The company is positioned to continue monetizing AI across business-to-business and business-to-consumer platforms.', ""AMD often traded in tandem with Nvidia, but the company is actually quite different. For one, AMD isn't growing as fast -- yet. However, optimistic investors believe it can unlock explosive growth by competing with Nvidia in the GPU market for AI applications and CPUs for AI-enabled PCs."", ""In 2023, data center revenue grew just 7.5% year over year and made up less than 29% of total revenue. So while AMD's growth is expected to happen, Nvidia's growth is occurring right now."", ""AMD will have to deliver to justify its lofty valuation, but it's certainly one of the most innovative and exciting AI plays out there for risk-tolerant investors."", 'Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, commonly known as TSMC, is perhaps the safest way to invest in the AI-fueled semiconductor space.', ""TSMC manufactures chips for Nvidia, AMD, Broadcom, Intel, and others. It's a similar dynamic to Apple, which designs its products but relies on its suppliers for materials, manufacturing, and assembly."", 'While these suppliers are usually low-margin, high-volume businesses, TSMC fabs handle some of the most complex and precise workflows in the world. TSMC is compensated accordingly, with an operating margin that has mostly ranged from 35% to 50% over the last decade -- far higher than your typical manufacturer.', ""In this vein, TSMC wins as long as chip demand goes up. It doesn't matter if AMD takes market share from Nvidia, so long as the industry is growing."", 'TSMC is not nearly as expensive as other top chip stocks, with a forward price-to-earnings ratio of just 21.7.', ""It wasn't long ago that Adobe's growth was slowing. Subscription-based software-as-a-service (SaaS) business models are great for their consistent revenue.

It's a good long-term strategy that focuses on where Adobe could be several years from now, not on where it is today. Patient investors may want to consider buying Adobe now, with the understanding that Wall Street may sell the stock if Adobe puts up weak quarterly results."", 'You may be wondering how we went from hypergrowth chip stocks to a tractor company. Well, part of the reason was to spice up the list with something outside the tech sector. Deere is a sleeper AI play -- and has been for some time now.', ""Deere released its Smart Industrial strategy in 2022. And it's already having an impact on its results. The company is betting that farms will become increasingly automated in the future. Examples would include automated crop spacing, how much fertilizer to use and where, and even a fully autonomous tractor."", ""Buzzwords aside, the idea is to use technology to lower costs and boost crop yield. It doesn't really matter how it's packaged, so long as these tools are boosting business for Deere's customers."", 'AI can benefit farm sustainability and efficiency, and Deere is one of the easiest ways to invest in that trend.', 'From obvious plays like Nvidia to a well-known legacy brand like Deere, companies across industries are investing in AI to accelerate growth.

On Wednesday, SIG stock suffered a devastating drop of more than 12%. While the company posted an earnings beat, investors didn’t respond well to its disappointing guidance. Still, the broader fundamentals are positive, suggesting that at least a dead-cat bounce is in order.', 'Signet reported adjusted earnings per share of $6.73 for its fiscal fourth quarter. This print beat the consensus target of $6.37. On the other hand, revenue of $2.5 billion missed analysts’ view of $2.55 billion. In addition, same-store sales declined 9.6% against the year-ago quarter.', 'However, what may have alarmed Wall Street was the guidance. For fiscal Q1, management anticipates total sales to land between $1.47 billion and $1.53 billion, while projecting same-store sales to decline 7% to 11%. In contrast, analysts were looking for revenue of $1.61 billion.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'For the full year, Signet anticipates the top line to reach between $6.66 billion and $7.02 billion. Here, analysts had targeted sales of $7.17 billion. Given the difficulties facing the consumer economy, it’s not surprising that investors dumped SIG stock. Still, a solid recovery pop could be in order.', 'Let’s talk data. According to ResearchAndMarkets.com, the U.S. wedding management market reached a valuation of $7.03 billion last year. Further, it should rise to $7.69 billion by 2029, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 1.5%. Obviously, the wedding industry isn’t a growth machine, but it’s a steady, reliable revenue generator.', 'In turn, some of that sentiment should rub off on SIG stock. After all, many consumers today focus on experiences; hence, the revenge travel phenomenon. And what could be more impactful than a wedding? Naturally, the engagement ring plays a big role within the ecosystem and therefore Signet should benefit.', 'Chart by Josh Enomoto, InvestorPlace.com', 'On Wednesday, SIG stock closed at $90.08. Barchart’s technical resources indicate that there’s strong support at $88 to $89. In the premarket session Thursday, the dynamic is suggesting that SIG may open around $91. If so, there may be concerted resistance between approximately $97 to the psychologically important $100.', 'Until then, we might dead-cat bounce a ride to some quick profits.', 'To speculate on a possible bullish reaction to Signet stock, I’m looking at the 28 March 2024 SIG $92 call option. This derivative contract would give us until next Friday for SIG to jump toward the $97 level. However, exiting at $95 wouldn’t be a bad idea as there could be resistance there based on prior trading activity.', 'On Wednesday, the $92 call closed with a premium of $1.85. Should SIG stock hit $95 with three days remaining to expiration, this contract’s premium could soar to $3.46. That would be a massive return and it wouldn’t be unreasonable given the surprisingly stable fundamental backdrop.', 'As always, with near-expiry options, you need to be quick on the trigger. Further, you don’t want to stick around for longer than necessary.

Roy, why don't you tell us about yourself a little?"", ""Roy Tuscany: Hi everybody. My name is Roy Tuscany. I'm originally from Vermont. I am a husband, father, philanthropist and adaptive athlete. In 2009 I got to start the High Fives Foundation, a nonprofit organization that's located in Truckee, California, that serves all of North America. It was a way for myself to pay it forward, after I sustained a life-changing injury in a ski accident: I went 130 feet on a ski jump and came down from 30 feet in the air. The resultant impact into the snow burst fractured my T12 vertebrae."", ""I was supported by all these amazing communities. And it hit me that other people would fall into the same shoes that I did. So in 2009, I started High Fives with this simple goal to help an individual that sustains a life changing injury return to the sports they love. And now, nearly 15 years later, we've served over 700 athletes - 25% of those being veterans - getting them through life changing injuries, and getting reconnected back to community through sport."", ""MEC: That's an amazing story, and it's an amazing organization. Thank you so much for founding it. It's just been incredible working with you. Big question for you: between Bike, Fish, Dirt, Snow and Surf, if you had to pick a favorite of the High Fives in terms of reintroducing a wounded athlete or veteran to a sport, which one would it be?"", ""RT: You know, it's tough. All five of those are like my five favorite things to do - hence why we focus on them - but I would definitely say dirt or surf. I'm just coming off a dirt trip and the experiences, the smiles, the amount of dirtiness that we got down with this group, was through the roof. And it's accessible to all. Same thing with surfing. I think surfing has found so many different ways to adapt, the different ways to surf after a disability, that it gives the opportunity to be incredibly inclusive for all. So I think surf and dirt. One you get really dirty, one you get really wet. So they're a good match for each other!"", 'MEC: How personally rewarding to you is running this organization?', ""RT: I think what's been most rewarding is the fact that the last couple of years, there's been a lot of attention that's gone over to DEI: Disability, Equity, and Inclusion. But for the longest time, I've been waving the largest flag for the disabled community. Obviously in the last couple of years, there's been a lot of attention to it. But before that, that's been the most rewarding, serving what I think is the most underserved population in the country."", ""And the wildest thing? We're all going to become disabled at some point. Every single day we're getting a little bit closer, we break down a little bit more. So why not support those that might be where we all end up?"", ""MEC: We've been really excited about this partnership - how do you think this partnership is going for you with Monster Energy?"", 'RT: This smile I think tells a lot about it! I think it\'s really amazing. Monster is such a recognizable brand, a recognizable brand within a vertical of sport that I feel we\'re on the back end of. Monster gets to celebrate and promote and highlight all these incredible athletes that do these amazing feats. And unfortunately, once in a while, an individual is going to sustain a life-changing injury. And so to be partnered with a brand that not only helps promote it, but then on the other side says ""Hey, if something does happen, we want to be there to support it."" There\'s very few brands out there that do that. So to be partnered with Monster Energy, Monster Energy cares, it\'s a blessing. It truly is a blessing.', 'MEC: You have an inspiring philosophy regarding life\'s obstacles: you don\'t try and circumvent them - you just go right through them! Tell me about ""Adapt and Destroy""?', 'RT: Ah my favorite saying, Adapt and Destroy! You know, it\'s a play on ""Skate and Destroy"" from the 80s and 90s Skate culture. Very similar to the way they took on skateboarding at that time. Let\'s smash through the barriers that society is placing on us and show that we\'re more than just a bunch of skate rats. Same thing here. It\'s showcasing that an individual, after sustaining a life-changing injury, has that opportunity to showcase that: just with that barrier that could exist? Let\'s smash through that barrier.', ""And the reason we adapt and destroy is because if we adapt and overcome, well, then everybody after us still has to overcome. We'll show them how to adapt… but everybody has to overcome. Well, when you adapt and destroy - that barrier is gone. And so now for everybody moving forward, the barrier no longer exists. We're allowed to adapt and destroy and enjoy the day."", ""MEC: I was able to spend some time with your absolutely gorgeous wife, Alana. She is an amazing adaptive athlete, just absolutely incredible. So what's your story? How did you guys meet?"", ""RT: Alana is an absolutely amazing adaptive athlete. First female in the world to have gold medals in the Summer and Winter Games. Got a gold medal in 2008. And then a second one in 2010. She has a collection of six medals, which is funny because you would think they'd be at our house in a display case or something… they're in a backpack in the back corner of our closet."", 'But in 2010 she\'d just came off the Vancouver Winter Olympics. I had just started the foundation. I was at this really great adaptive ski event. And she was there and when she came into the room, it\'s like every sound in the room stopped, and she was just like [choir of angels]. And lo and behold, that was my first time meeting her. Then eight years later, we were speaking together at a really great event in New York City, and dropped her off at the airport. I was like ""I\'m not gonna let this one go."" Gave her a kiss, and now we got a little dude whose birthday is coming up! We\'re together and having a great time.', ""MEC: That's awesome! So speaking of volunteer organizations, we have a couple of incentives in our philanthropy program at Monster Energy Cares, and one of them is paid volunteer time off. What can you tell our employees to help inspire them to use their VTO?"", ""RT: Well, first and foremost, amazing opportunity that monster gives each and every one of you; but second, Darlene can speak to this because Darlene has been to one of these volunteer experiences. Darlene has been to Montana with us for fly fishing, UTV, just overall amazing Montana adaptive trip. And I think that's a big call to action for each and every employee here, and I challenge you: you work for a brand that's built within sport. Well, why not come partner up with an organization that uses sport to reconnect people with community? And I think from the experience that Darlene has, she gets to see firsthand the impact these trips have. So I encourage every single one of you, you work for a brand that's embedded in sports. This is a foundation that uses sports to reconnect people to community. Come on out. Let's have some fun!"", 'MEC: So the second thing people can do, is have a donation to a charity matched by Monster Energy Cares. What does it mean to an organization like yours to get personal donations from people, and not just corporate sponsorships?RT: You know, when a when a corporate company like Monster comes on board for the foundation to support us, that means a lot. But what means more is when the employees get behind the mission, get behind the vision, get behind the philanthropic efforts and the impact that the organization makes. So as an employee of Monster, we would welcome you to the highest level to be a donor of High Fives - it would mean the world to us. And also, working for this brand, I think it aligns really well with the ethos that is Monster Energy; the people they support, the programs they support. And if you want to have the opportunity to make a donation that literally gives hope? Well that\'s what we do at High Fives. We provide individuals with life-changing injuries, the ability to have hope again. And that\'s what your donation will do. That\'s the simplest blurb about it: Hope is free when you donate to High Fives.MEC: One last and final question for you, but it\'s probably the most important: What\'s your favorite Monster drink?RT: (laughs) It\'s so funny, earlier as we were going in I looked at both refrigerators. I looked at all the flavors in there, and every single time I do the same thing. I look at all them and go ""Oh my God, that would be good to try… that would be good to try...""... and every single time I go to this one! [Ultra White]', ""There's just something about this can! I don't know what it is. It's Zero Ultra, I love the taste of it. I usually drink it for breakfast, which is kind of weird. Tastes better than coffee! So for me this is my go to for like everything. I recently quit soda too, so this has replaced a lot of things in my life.

PM has demonstrated impressive resilience amid rising costs due to its smoke-free strength and pricing power. The consistent success of IQOS and the impressive growth of ZYN have solidified the company’s position, keeping it well-placed to become a majority smoke-free company by 2030.', 'Given consumers’ rising inclination toward reduced-risk products (RRPs), Philip Morris is progressing well with its business transformation, with smoke-free products generating 39.3% of the company’s net revenues in the fourth quarter of 2023. The company aims to generate more than two-thirds of its total revenues from smoke-free products by 2030.To this end, the company’s IQOS, a heat-not-burn device, counts among one of the leading RRPs in the industry. In the fourth quarter, IQOS surpassed Marlboro in net revenues, becoming the leading international nicotine brand. The company expects such advanced and high-quality products to aid adult smokers in switching from traditional cigarettes to smoke-free options. IQOS ILUMA is expected to aid continued solid IQOS user growth in 2024 and ahead.', 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', 'Philip Morris recently unveiled its peak innovation, the IQOS ILUMA i, which offers an array of advanced features, promising users a cleaner, more seamless and highly flexible experience. Among other initiatives, Philip Morris became the majority owner of Swedish Match in November 2022 and witnessed impressive results, driven by the spectacular performance of ZYN in the United States.In the fourth quarter of 2023, revenues from smoke-free products (excluding Wellness and Healthcare) jumped 21.7% to $3,489 million (up 14.2% organically). Total IQOS users at the end of 2023 were estimated at roughly 28.6 million, up 3.7% year over year. This includes nearly 20.8 million who switched to IQOS and stopped smoking. In 2024, management expects an acceleration in organic smoke-free net revenues and an increase in smoke-free gross profit from the 2023 levels. It expects an adjusted in-market volume increase of 14-16% for HTUs.', 'In the fourth quarter of 2023, Philip Morris’ profits were partially hurt by increased marketing, administration and research costs (stemming from inflation), as well as escalated manufacturing costs. PM witnessed considerable inflationary pressures on leaf, direct materials and other manufacturing costs. Management expects the increased cost of leaf and wages to linger in 2024 before easing thereafter. Philip Morris is also focused on making innovation-related investments to grow its smoke-free portfolio, especially the IQOS ILUMA. These investments may impact profits.Additionally, cigarette volumes, in general, have been affected by consumers’ rising health consciousness and a shift to low-risk tobacco alternatives. In the fourth quarter, total cigarette and HTU shipment volumes fell by 0.5% to 185.1 billion units. In 2024, the total international industry volume for cigarettes and HTUs is estimated in the range of a decline of 2% to flat (excluding China and the United States). For Philip Morris, the total cigarette, HTU and oral smoke-free product shipment volume increase is likely to range between flat and rise 1%, mainly backed by smoke-free product strength.That said, Philip Morris has been benefiting from its strong pricing power. Though higher pricing might lead to a possible decline in cigarette consumption, it is seen that smokers tend to absorb price increases due to the addictive quality of cigarettes. Higher pricing variance was an upside to the company’s performance (mainly due to increased combustible tobacco pricing) in the fourth quarter of 2023 and is likely to be a driver. For 2024, management expects net revenues to increase 6.5-8% on an organic basis.Also, Philip Morris remains confident about its CAGR targets for 2024-2026, which include organic top-line growth of 6-8%, organic operating income growth of 8-10 and currency-neutral adjusted EPS growth of 9-11%.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have increased 0.9% in the past six months against the industry’s decline of 3.7%.', 'The Chef’s Warehouse CHEF, which engages in the distribution of specialty food products, currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

After all, why bother dealing with the volatility of publicly traded businesses when you can buy safe, secure government bonds? The thesis isn’t as irrational as it sounds.', 'Sure, you can grab 10-year Treasuries that yield 4.3%. For the buy-and-hold types, that’s admittedly quite a deal. However, with the Federal Reserve possibly toying with the idea of interest rate cuts down the line, the buying opportunity for bonds may eventually fade. Second, buying government debt doesn’t give you the chance for capital appreciation.', 'But arguably the most important reason to consider high-yield dividend stocks to buy is the possible rotation away from risk-on names. Recently, technology-related securities saw $4.4 billion of outflows, the biggest such outflow on record. Right now, you’re seeing the red-hot cryptocurrency sector hit pause on the rally.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Don’t get me wrong: I’m not saying run around like your hair’s on fire. Rather, it just might be prudent to consider enterprises that offer robust passive income. With that, below are attractive high-yield dividend stocks to buy.', 'Source: shutterstock.com/LCV', 'Yeah, yeah, yeah – I talk way too much about IBM (NYSE:IBM). However, after years of disappointing trading sessions, the company is starting to finally look appealing. Since the beginning of this year, shares gained just under 20%. Over the past year, the security moved up almost 54%. It’s almost like we’re not talking about Big Blue.', 'You can credit artificial intelligence, machine learning and similar directives for a good chunk of the upside. While investors chase the usual suspects tied to digital intelligence, what I appreciate about IBM is that it has a long legacy of AI-related research and development. Also, it features ample case studies of real, practical innovations leveraging AI.', 'So, when analysts are looking for average earnings per share of $10.09 on sales of $63.77 for the current fiscal year, I believe it. The projections might even be understated. Either way, while you’re waiting for the narrative to play out, IBM investors can enjoy a solid forward dividend yield of 3.43%.', 'Experts only rate IBM a consensus hold with a $191.69 price target. Here, the high-side target of $220 seems more reflective of current realities.', 'Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com', 'At first glance, identifying Chevron (NYSE:CVX) as one of the high-yield dividend stocks to buy might go against contemporary beliefs. After all, electric vehicles are the future, climate justice, go green, yada yada. However, hydrocarbons could very well be relevant for decades, maybe even centuries. Amid economic difficulties, you can’t just throw away infrastructure that’s been built for the combustion-powered paradigm.', 'We all got a taste of that recently. Following a key decision by the Department of Energy, EV stocks tumbled as government mandates to effectively force the electric transition have been softened. This update gives traditional automakers breathing room. It also means that there’s a runway for manufacturing gasoline-powered cars to 2030.', 'And who knows what could happen in the future? I’m almost certain that if President Joe Biden wins reelection this year, voters will pivot to the right in 2028. That could be very lucrative for CVX stakeholders.', 'Right now, Chevron pays a forward yield of 4.16%. Combined with a moderate buy rating, CVX ranks among the high-yield dividend stocks to buy.', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'One of the riskiest ideas for high-yield dividend stocks to buy, Dine Brands (NYSE:DIN) might even seem reckless. Since the start of the year, DIN lost more than 5% of equity value. But that’s not the worst of it. No, investors will quickly point to the loss of 31% over the past 52 weeks. That’s ugly and it’s not surprising given the consumer headwinds impacting the space.', 'However, many experts believe that revenge travel – or a similar sentiment or residual effect – will support a key segment of the discretionary retail sector. If that happens to be the case, then people may look to save money through cheap eateries. It doesn’t get that much cheaper than Dine Brands until you fall into the fast-food category.', 'It’s also worth noting that the company – despite significant sector headwinds – managed to beat earnings-per-share targets in all four quarters last fiscal year. The average positive earnings beat came out to nearly 17%.', 'Right now, Dine offers a forward yield of 4.4%. Carrying a strong buy consensus view, DIN should be on your radar.', 'Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com', 'Structured as a real estate investment trust (REIT), Agree Realty (NYSE:ADC) focuses on the acquisition and development of properties net leased to industry-leading, omnichannel retail tenants. Per its public profile, the REIT owns and operates a portfolio of 2,135 properties, located in 49 states and containing approximately 44.2 million square feet of gross leasable area.', 'So, a lot of companies make their business sound way more complicated than it needs to be. Here’s the deal with ADC stock. If you need something – groceries, a quick bite to eat, a home-improvement product – there’s a good chance that the store you go to will be located on a property that Agree owns. Unless you envision a world where commerce becomes obsolete, Agree should maintain permanent relevance.', 'To be fair, the company missed earnings targets last year. However, in the current fiscal year, analysts believe that Agree will print EPS of $1.86 on revenue of $593.58 million. Last year, the company delivered EPS of $1.63 on sales of $537.5 million.', 'Lastly, Agree pays out a forward yield of 5.32%. Combined with a strong buy view, ADC is easily one of the high-yield dividend stocks to buy.', 'Source: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock', 'A big tobacco firm, Philip Morris (NYSE:PM) undoubtedly represents one of the most controversial names in the market. Still, for those who are agnostic about people’s personal decisions, PM could rank among the high-yield dividend stocks to buy. Per the company’s public profile, Philip Morris’ product portfolio primarily consists of cigarettes and smoke-free products, heat-not-burn, vapor, and oral nicotine products.', 'Since the start of the year, PM stock slipped just a bit below parity. However, recent sessions suggest that a turnaround may be possible. For one thing, the company generally can be relied upon to produce solid earnings. That said, it did miss expectations in Q4. Nevertheless, analysts anticipate that EPS for the current fiscal year will come in at $6.40. That’s noticeably above last year’s print of $6.01.', 'Moreover, the top line could rise to $37.17 billion, 5.4% above last year’s result of $35.25 billion. And in fiscal 2025, revenue could hit $39.56 billion, implying over 6% year-over-year growth. Factor in the forward yield of 5.47% and a moderate buy consensus view and PM could be an intriguing wager.', 'Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com', 'A gold-mining enterprise, B2Gold (NYSEAMERICAN:BTG) operates the Fekola Mine in Mali, the Masbate Mine in the Philippines, and the Otjikoto Mine in Namibia. Per its corporate profile, B2Gold also has a 100% interest in the Gramalote gold project in Colombia among other endeavors. While gold-related investments occasionally perform well in periods of uncertainty, this didn’t rub off BTG stock.', 'Indeed, shares slipped almost 21% since the beginning of the year. Over the past 52 weeks, BTG is down nearly 34%. Obviously, B2Gold isn’t an investment for the faint of heart. To emphasize this point, just look at the financials. While the company handily beat the EPS target in Q1 last year, the other results weren’t so great. Overall, the average earnings surprise came out to a mere 0.45%.', 'Moreover, experts are anticipating a “lost” year in fiscal 2024. However, 2025 could see a turnaround, with revenue possibly coming in at $2.39 billion. While investors wait for the narrative to pan out, they can collect a forward dividend yield of 6.43%.', 'Analysts also peg shares a consensus moderate buy with a $4.15 price target, implying 67% upside potential. Thus, it could be one of the high-yield dividend stocks to buy for speculators.', 'Source: Pavel Kapysh\xa0/\xa0Shutterstock.com', 'If you want the most extreme of high-yield dividend stocks to buy, you might want to consider Alliance Resource Partners (NASDAQ:ARLP). Straight off the bat, you need to know that Alliance is structured as a master limited partnership (MLP). Now, MLPs provide the tax benefits of a partnership with the liquidity of publicly traded securities. Long story short, MLPs pass through the majority of their income and tax liabilities directly to their investors.', 'Part of the joy of owning an MLP like Alliance is the often-hefty dividend yield. In this case, we’re talking about a forward annual dividend yield of 14.08%. Further, the payout ratio is relatively reasonable at 58.21%. All other things being equal, investors can depend on the reliability of this source of passive income.', 'On the other hand, the pain associated with MLPs is that because the tax liabilities are passed through to individual unit holders, investors must file a Form K-1, which details their share of the partnership’s income and losses on their individual tax returns.', 'Still, one last positive parting shot is ARLP’s moderate buy rating with a $27 price target.', 'On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\xa0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\xa0Publishing Guidelines.', 'A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

The Zacks Oil and Gas - Field Services industry, to which Schlumberger belongs, has gained 11.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?"", ""While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making."", 'Earnings Estimate Revisions', ""Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock."", ""We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements."", 'Schlumberger is expected to post earnings of $0.75 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +19.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.', 'The consensus earnings estimate of $3.54 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +18.8%.

So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth."", 'For Schlumberger, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $8.67 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +12.1%.

After proving to a skeptical industry that online video services could be a real and profitable business, one could argue that Netflix created the streaming industry largely on its own.', 'Roku started out as the streaming hardware division of Netflix when digital media services were young and raw. But Netflix wanted a clear separation between its video service and the set-top box that sent those signals to your living-room TV, so Roku spun off as a separate company in 2009. Many rivals have developed viewer-friendly set-top boxes and streaming sticks, but Roku remains the name to beat with an unbeatable market share in 2024.', ""I'm looking at two pioneers of digital streaming, separated at Roku's birth. They're more like parent and child than siblings or cousins, yet definitely in the same family. But they address very different niches of the digital entertainment opportunity, and the stocks could hardly be more different."", 'So which one is the better buy in the spring of 2024?', ""It really depends on what you're looking for in an entertainment stock, and both belong in any portfolio focused on the digital media sector. But I've been buying a lot more Roku stock than Netflix shares."", ""Here's why."", 'Netflix and Roku are exploring the same enormous growth story. One is building the most popular content service on the planet. The other provides the hardware and software needed to display videos from Netflix (and its many rivals) on your favorite big-screen TV.', ""They have challengers and alternatives, and I honestly wouldn't want it any other way. Imagine a world with only one car model, or where you can get your phone in any color as long as it's black and made by Western Electric. Options and rivalries result in a healthier marketplace, where consumers get to express their individual tastes while enjoying lower prices and more new features overall."", 'That being said, Roku and Netflix occasionally come close to achieving monopoly status.', ""It's been a while for Netflix, as every movie and TV-series producer of note launched their own streaming services in recent years. Subscribing to every possible alternative could drive your streaming bills close to the stifling costs of full-service cable TV packages."", ""So Netflix only accounted for 8% of the average American household's video-viewing time in December 2023, according to reports from Nielsen Media. The same report also highlights the magnitude of the untapped opportunity, as old-school cable/satellite/broadcast TV held a 64% share of those valuable viewing hours."", ""Netflix clearly has plenty of growing left to do. Digital streaming is stealing cable TV's lunch, along with broadcast's snack and the theatrical film industry's dinner."", ""But that's not just good news for Netflix and its frenemies."", ""It's even better tidings for Roku."", 'The market for media-streaming platforms is deeply fragmented, but Roku is a firmly established leader.', '""We\'re the No. 1 in Mexico, as well as the US,"" said founder and CEO Anthony Wood in Roku\'s fourth-quarter earnings call. ""We\'re doing extremely well in Canada. We\'re doing well in all of Latin America. We\'re making great progress in Brazil.... We\'re also doing well in the UK.""', 'In other words, Roku is the largest platform provider in the most mature streaming markets, and growing quickly in other geographic expansions.', ""But it's not all about the number of users or units sold. You see, Roku also runs a highly successful advertising service in the menu spaces where users are looking for the next thing to watch. And I really mean successful. Privacy analytics firm Pixalate reported Roku's North American share of voice (SOV) at 51% last fall. After the holidays of 2023, that mighty market share jumped to 55%."", 'SOV measures ""the percentage of programmatic ads sold"" in a specific region. Roku also leads the pack in Latin America while splitting the Europe, Middle-East, and Africa (EMEA) market almost evenly with Amazon and Samsung.', ""That's a money-making metric, friends. Roku is an effective cash machine, even in a slow-growing period. The company generated $176 million of free cash flow in the fourth quarter of 2024, adding more reserves to its $2.0 billion cash wallet on a debt-free balance sheet."", ""In other words, Roku's business is running smoothly despite economic pressures and a stubborn downturn in the ad-sales market. Now imagine what this company could do in a healthy economy."", ""Netflix's stock is on the mend already. It trades below its four-year average price to sales (P/S) ratio, but the buying window may be about to close. Meanwhile, Roku's stock trades more than 85% below the all-time highs of 2021. Its P/S ratio of 2.6 is more appropriate for a slow-and-steady retailer or oil producer, not a skyrocketing growth stock with ambitious long-term market goals."", ""Yes, I recommend Netflix if you're looking for a top-quality media service trading at a modest price. But Roku comes with a bright red bargain-bin price tag, and its growth opportunity over the next few years may be even greater than Netflix's."", ""The choice is clear. With Roku's explosive growth potential and current fire-sale price, it's the smarter investment right now. Don't miss out on this opportunity to buy into the future of streaming entertainment."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Roku right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Roku, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Roku wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.', 'Stock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

In recent years, most online brokers have eliminated commission fees on common stocks trades and done away with minimum deposit requirements. For everyday investors, it means any amount of money -- even $500 -- can be the perfect amount to get started or add to your existing portfolio.', ""If you have $500 ready to invest, and you're absolutely certain you won't need this cash to pay bills or cover emergencies as they arise, the following three stocks stand out as no-brainer buys right now."", 'The first phenomenal company that would be a genius buy with $500 right now is the largest electric utility in the U.S. by market value, NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE).', ""The lure of utility stocks has long been their reduced volatility and market-topping dividends. One of the very few things that tends to disrupt this harmony is rapidly rising interest rates. The Federal Reserve's aggressive rate-hiking cycle that began in March 2022 sent short-term Treasury yields soaring, which in turn made utility stocks less attractive to income seekers."", ""On the other side of the coin, the nation's central bank looks to be at the tail-end of its tightening cycle. Although shelter inflation remains stubbornly high, the prevailing rate of inflation has notably declined from its June 2022 peak of more than 9%. This suggests Treasury yields will fall and utility stocks like NextEra Energy will soon regain their luster."", ""But there's a lot more to like about NextEra than just a favorable macroeconomic outlook. What's set NextEra Energy apart from dozens of other publicly traded electric utilities is its investments in renewable energy. As of the end of 2023, the company has 72 gigawatts (GW) in operation, 36 GW of which are tied to renewable sources. The 24 GW of capacity NextEra generates from wind power, along with the 7 GW from solar, are both high-water marks globally from an electric utility."", ""Admittedly, investing in renewable energy projects isn't cheap. However, making these investments has led to outsized adjusted earnings growth. Thanks to meaningfully reduced electricity generation costs, NextEra's adjusted earnings have grown by annualized 10% over the trailing decade. It's effectively a growth stock in a sector known for low-single-digit earnings growth."", ""NextEra Energy isn't taking its foot off the accelerator, either. From the start of 2023 through the end of 2026, it expects to bring between 32.7 GW and 41.8 GW of renewables and storage solutions online. In short, its competitive advantage as a leader in clean-energy solutions is only growing."", 'Opportunistic investors have the opportunity to scoop up shares of NextEra Energy right now for 17 times forward-year earnings, which represents a 34% discount to its average forward-year earnings multiple over the trailing-five-year period.', 'A second amazing stock that has all the hallmarks of a no-brainer buy if you have $500 ready to invest is cybersecurity company SentinelOne (NYSE: S).', ""Two weeks ago, SentinelOne released its fiscal fourth-quarter operating results (the company's fiscal year ends Jan. 31) and provided sales guidance for fiscal 2025. Wall Street was less-than-thrilled with the company's forecast of $812 million to $818 million in full-year sales for current year, compared to the consensus estimate from analysts of $818 million. In a richly valued market, companies that don't wallop Wall Street's expectations get creamed."", ""However, this looks like a classic overreaction if investors widen their lens. Though SentinelOne didn't clobber the consensus, the midpoint of its forecast ($815 million in full-year sales) implies year-over-year sales growth of 31%. That's not too shabby. In the coming four years, SentinelOne is expected to sustain a roughly 30% growth rate and triple its sales."", 'The catalyst behind its steady growth is its Singularity platform. Singularity relies on artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to proactively identify and prevent endpoint security threats. Leaning on AI should help Singularity become more effective over time.', ""This is a great time to mention that cybersecurity has become something of a basic necessity service. Businesses with an online or cloud-based presence don't have the luxury of crossing their fingers and hoping hackers won't steal their data. Regardless of how well or poorly the economy and stock market are performing, demand for third-party endpoint solutions should remain steady. In short, we're talking about a recipe for predictable operating cash flow."", 'Among the many key performance indicators headed in the right direction, the one that really stands out is the sheer number of customers now generating in excess of $100,000 in annual recurring revenue (ARR). SentinelOne closed out fiscal 2024 with 1,133 customers generating north of $100,000 in ARR, which is a 30% increase from the prior year. Bigger customers are its key to reaching recurring profitability in the current year.', ""The third no-brainer stock that's begging to be bought with $500 right now is none other than fintech leader PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ: PYPL)."", 'Since reaching its all-time high during the summer of 2021, shares of PayPal have retraced around 80%. Increasing competition in the digital payment space, coupled with the fear of higher inflation reducing the discretionary spending power of consumers, has weighed on this former highflier. But there are plenty of reasons to be believe PayPal can shine bright, once more.', ""To start with the obvious, fintech solutions are still early in their growth ramp. According to estimates from Boston Consulting Group that were released in May 2023, global fintech revenue can grow sixfold to $1.5 trillion by 2030. There's more than enough room for multiple winners with an addressable opportunity this large."", ""More importantly, most of PayPal's key performance metrics point to sustained double-digit growth. Even amid stagnant active account growth, PayPal recorded $1.53 trillion in total payment volume (TPV) across its networks (primarily PayPal and Venmo) in 2023. That's up 12% on a currency-neutral basis. As I've pointed out previously, if PayPal can deliver 12% currency-neutral TPV growth amid palpable economic uncertainty and with active accounts stagnant, imagine what it can do when active account growth returns and the U.S. economy really finds its footing."", ""PayPal's active account engagement might be the top selling point to investors. At the end of 2020, the average active account was completing close to 41 payments on a trailing-12-month (TTM) basis. But when the curtain closed on 2023, the company's average active account had completed almost 59 payments on a TTM basis. PayPal is primarily driven by fees. If people are using the platform more frequently, it bodes well for an increase in gross profit over time."", ""New CEO Alex Chriss provides another reason for current and prospective shareholders to be optimistic. Prior to becoming PayPal CEO in late September, he headed Intuit's Small Business segment. He understands what growth initiatives will resonate with smaller merchants, but also isn't afraid to tighten PayPal's belt to improve its margins."", ""Shares of PayPal can be scooped up by growth and value seekers for less than 12 times forward-year earnings. That's roughly 50% below its average forward-year earnings multiple over the last five years."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in NextEra Energy right now?', 'Before you buy stock in NextEra Energy, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and NextEra Energy wasn’t one of them.

The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.', ""This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement.

So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision."", 'Zacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR', 'In spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.', 'The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28).

Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them."", 'In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.', 'In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.', 'There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.', 'Should You Invest in QCOM?', 'In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Qualcomm, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $9.57.', ""Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term."", ""The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Qualcomm.

And Poland has earmarked a further $1.7 billion to spend on RTX Corporation (NYSE: RTX) AIM-120C-8 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missiles (AMRAAMs) -- 745 of them -- for its fighter jets.', 'Together, that\'s another $3.5 billion worth of American missiles that Poland wishes to buy. It\'s also $3.5 billion worth of revenue that is essentially guaranteed to flow to Lockheed and RTX, because Congress has literally never denied approval of a foreign arms sale after receiving DSCA notification that one is in the works. (Not that it should. In both of last week\'s arms deals, as in most deals of this sort, DSCA notes that the U.S. State Department has already signed off on the sales as supporting ""the foreign policy goals and national security objectives of the United States by improving the security of a NATO Ally."")', ""Thus, with DSCA notifications in hand, it's pretty safe for investors in Lockheed and RTX to assume these sales will go through, and that they will turn into revenue (and profits) for the defense companies in due course. Now what does this mean for investors?"", 'Lockheed Martin and RTX (formerly known as Raytheon) have a lot in common. Both are sprawling defense conglomerates generating tens of billions of dollars of revenue ($67.6 billion for Lockheed, $68.9 billion for RTX) every year. Both are profitable companies, too, although from a big-picture point of view, Lockheed does a lot better than RTX at turning its revenue into profits.', 'Last year, RTX reported an operating profit margin of just 7.8% across its several business divisions, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. Lockheed Martin, however, with a 13.4% profit margin, generated 72% more profit per dollar of revenue. Admittedly, much of this divergence in profitability owes to RTX having just gone through a manufacturing crisis in 2023 that dragged down profits -- actually, wiped them out\xa0-- at its Pratt & Whitney aircraft engines business.', 'But even so, Lockheed seems to enjoy stronger profits throughout its business.', ""Take the specific company divisions responsible for manufacturing missiles, for example. RTX houses its missile operations within a unit bearing the historic name Raytheon and generates a 9% profit margin in that division. Lockheed's missiles come from the more descriptively named missiles and fire control segment, which churns out a 12.9% operating profit on its revenue. So the numbers are closer -- but even so, Lockheed still outearns RTX by 43% per dollar of revenue, which is pretty impressive given that RTX's Raytheon division is much larger in scale, with more than twice the revenue of Lockheed's missiles division."", ""So what does this mean for investors? Lockheed Martin's superior ability to transform revenue into profit means that, even though RTX is the more valuable company (with $126 billion in total market capitalization to Lockheed's $105 billion), Lockheed is actually the cheaper stock. Not only does Lockheed sell for a lower price-to-sales ratio of 1.6 versus RTX's 2.0. Lockheed's more robust profit margins (and profits, period) give the company an even more attractive price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of just 15.9, versus RTX's 42.5."", 'Granted, these valuations will drift closer as time goes by and RTX puts its Pratt & Whitney engine problems behind it. But even so, based on forward earnings projections, most analysts still see Lockheed earning so much in 2024 and RTX so little that Lockheed stock remains cheaper than RTX on a forward P/E basis and a trailing P/E basis.', 'And so long as that remains the case, investors seeking good value in defense stocks should choose Lockheed Martin over RTX.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Lockheed Martin right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Lockheed Martin, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Lockheed Martin wasn’t one of them.

You can skip our detailed analysis on the increase in defense expenditure by NATO’s European members after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and head over directly to NATO Spending by Country Per Capita: Top 5 Countries.', 'Moscow’s assault on Ukraine in 2022 sent shockwaves across Europe, signaling the return of war to the continent after decades of peace. Finland and Sweden are the latest countries to join NATO following the start of the war, while several other countries across the region are actively racking up their military expenditure to bolster national defense.', 'Global defense spending reached a record high of $2.2 trillion in 2022, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), with Europe witnessing its steepest rise in 30 years, having spent $480 billion in military expenditure during the year. NATO’s defense spending in 2022 was also 0.9% higher than in 2021, totaling $1.2 trillion. Final, aggregated figures for 2023 are still awaited, however, another recent report by SIPRI noted a 94% increase in arms imported by European countries between 2019-2023, compared to the previous five-year period from 2014-18. The United States was the origin of 55% of the arms procured by Europe in the last five years.', 'The surge in military expenditure amid growing calls from the United States and NATO for members of the treaty to meet the expectation of spending at least 2% of their GDP on defense has created a boom in the armaments and aerospace industries. Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)’s full-year financial statements for 2023 reported a 2.4% increase in revenue compared to the previous year to total $67.6 billion. The company’s net profit has also grown from $5.7 billion in 2022 to $6.9 billion in 2023.', 'NATO members are actively pursuing measures to upgrade their fleet of fighter jets, by replacing aging aircraft with newer, advanced fighters – most notable of which is Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)’s F-35. Last year, Canada announced it was buying 88 of these fifth-generation fighter jets to enhance Arctic security and also get closer to NATO’s spending expectations. Earlier in December 2022, Berlin also clinched a $8 billion deal with the United States to procure 35 F-35 fighters, with the first set of planes set to be delivered in 2027.', 'Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)’s stock price has risen more than 9% since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022. RiverPark Advisors made the following comment about the company in its Q3 2023 investor letter:', 'LMT is the world’s largest aerospace and defense contractor. With about 70% of its $66 billion in revenue from the U.S. government, the company is well positioned to benefit from U.S. defense budget growth, historically 5%-6% per year, as well as increased global military spending. With a $158 billion backlog and almost 30% of its revenue coming from building F-35 aircraft with deliveries forecast to reach 180 per year (up from 141 in 2022) in the coming years, we believe the company could grow at a higher rate than overall defense budget growth and Street expectations over the next several years. Further, strategic acquisitions, debt repayment, a 2.9% dividend yield, and continued share buybacks from more than $6 billion per year of free cash flow should lead to even greater shareholder returns. We re-initiated a small position in August.', 'RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX)’s figures are also soaring. The company generated revenues of $68.9 billion in 2023, a year-on-year increase of 3%, with contracts continuing to flow to the company from NATO countries seeking to enhance national security. This week, RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) was awarded a $1.2 billion contract to develop and supply Germany with Patriot air and missile defense systems.', 'Hungary also boosted its aerial security in November 2023 after it received delivery of the first two units of the NASAMS air defense system from RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) and Kongsberg Defence & Aerospace. According to a report in Bloomberg, the American defense conglomerate is also in talks with French aerospace company Safran, with the latter showing interest in RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX)’s flight control units.', 'Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) on the other hand generated $39.3 billion in sales in 2023, at a 7% increase in comparison to 2022. The company reported impressive growths in its aeronautics, defense, mission, and space systems. Projecting a sustained demand for its weapons in 2024, Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) has forecasted $41 billion in revenue for this year. Its share price has increased 16% since the beginning of the conflict in Ukraine.', 'The company, in June last year, modernized the air defense capabilities of Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia under a $14.3 million fund provided by the US. Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) is also cooperating with Terma, a Danish company, on electronic warfare training in Northern Europe.', 'We have listed the top 15 NATO countries in ascending order of their estimated military spending per capita in 2023. Data has been sourced from NATO’s July 2023 press release titled Defence Expenditure of NATO Countries (2014-2023).

Despite that its military spending per capita is above $500. This figure is likely to rise as Brussels plans on increasing its military expenditure to 1.54% of the GDP by 2030.', 'Military Spending Per Capita: $578', 'Estonia borders Russia to the East. The country’s military spending has continuously (since 2015) been above NATO’s 2% target for member states. Last year, Estonia allocated 2.73% of its GDP on defense expenditure – the fourth highest in NATO. The per capita military spending in Estonia has increased by nearly 75% over the last decade, from $328 in 2014 to $378 in 2023.', 'Military Spending Per Capita: $622', 'Canada boasts one of the most powerful militaries in the world. The country spent $28.9 billion on defense in 2023, which amounted to 1.38% of its GDP. In March this year, Canada announced $1.3 billion in defense spending cuts over the next three years, which is likely to reduce the country’s military spending per capita.', 'Military Spending Per Capita: $622', 'Greece’s defense spending soared from $5.2 billion in 2014 to $8.5 billion in 2022, before dropping slightly to $7.1 billion last year.

This is a significant jump from 2.42% in 2022. As a result, since 2022, the country’s military spending per capita has more than doubled from $325 in 2020 to $657 now.', 'Military Spending Per Capita: $677', 'Germany is on ninth spot in our list of NATO spending by country per capita. However, the country has consistently remained under target as far as NATO’s 2% spending goal is considered. Last year, it only spent 1.57% of the GDP on defense. In February, the government pledged to meet NATO’s goal by next decade, and stated that its defense spending could rise up to 3.5% of the GDP by then.', 'Military Spending Per Capita: $737', ""France boasts one of Europe's strongest and largest militaries, and spent 1.9% of its GDP on defense expenditure in 2023. Last January, French president Emmanuel Macron announced to raise the country’s military budget by 40% for 2024-2030 to enable the French military to be combat ready, amid the volatile situation in Ukraine. This move is likely to increase the country’s military spending per capita, which has grown by a meager 5% since 2019 ($700)."", 'Military Spending Per Capita: $773', 'Luxembourg has the lowest contribution of military spending as a share of the GDP in NATO (0.72%), but it is among countries with the highest spending per capita in the alliance. One factor for that is its tiny population of 640,000. Having said that, the country deserves credit that despite its small size, it has more than doubled its defense spending from $250 million in 2015 to an estimated $609 million in 2023, with its per capita military spending increasing 76% in this time period.', 'Military Spending Per Capita: $848', 'The Netherlands is in sixth position in the list of NATO spending by country per capita, with $848 being spent per head in the country on defense expenditure. In 2023, the Dutch government is estimated to have spent 1.7% of its GDP on military expenditure.

In fact, AI stocks have helped drive the market gains we've seen in recent months, pushing the S&P 500 to a record high -- and confirming that we are indeed in a bull market."", ""AI has become such a big deal because it could transform our routines, save companies time and money, help scientists make new discoveries -- and more. Many industries are likely to benefit. But my prediction is that healthcare stocks could become the biggest winners of all. Here's why."", ""First of all, it's important to note that a key player in the AI landscape -- Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) -- also is highly optimistic about AI in this sector. Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang said at the company's GTC conference last week that AI will have the most impact in healthcare. At the same time, Nvidia has launched several new services to help healthcare companies advance their AI projects."", ""Second, market forecasts indicate tremendous growth for AI in the healthcare market this decade. The Statista chart below shows the market is set to soar to more than $187 billion in 2030. That's an 800% gain from today."", ""Now, let's consider why Huang and analysts are so bullish about AI in the healthcare environment. The technology could be transformative in many ways. It could solve one of drugmakers' biggest problems: the lengthy process of bringing a potential product from drawing board to market. That's because AI can help researchers more quickly identify promising drug candidates -- saving time and resulting in better products."", 'AI already is also helping medical device companies improve outcomes. For example, Medtronic (NYSE: MDT) has developed AI-powered devices to plan spinal surgery and detect cancerous polyps in gastroenterology procedures.', 'How can investors benefit from this exciting market?

', 'J&J has received clearances to sell Varipulse in the European Union and Japan this year. The next step is to win approval in the U.S., a market that is central to predictions that PFA will help add billions of dollars to atrial fibrillation (AFib) ablation sales in the coming years.', 'Varipulse is J&J’s initial play for the PFA market. The platform features a multi-electrode catheter, PFA generator and 3D mapping software. J&J CEO Joaquin Duato discussed the role the Carto software mapping plays in the company’s PFA strategy on an earnings call in January.', ""“[Carto] is a fundamental pillar of our strategy in cardiac ablation that supports procedural efficiency and, very importantly, now low to zero fluoroscopy workflow,” Duato said. “For the electrophysiologist, it's very important to know where they are and what they are doing to the heart anatomy. Otherwise, they are flying blind if they don't have a mapping system.”"", 'Neither Boston Scientific’s Farapulse nor Medtronic’s Pulseselect have integrated mapping, although Medtronic received a CE mark for its Affera Mapping and Ablation System one year ago. Abbott has a mapping system, EnSite X, but is lagging the front three in the PFA race. The company started a clinical trial of its PFA device early this year, leading analysts to predict it could reach the U.S. market in 2026.\xa0', 'J&J has deployed 5,000 Carto systems globally, Duato said, and is developing a range of catheters to pair with the software.

Duato contends radiofrequency ablation, a separate ablation procedure,\xa0is “here to stay” despite the gaining momentum of PFA.', 'J&J’s electrophysiology unit reported nearly 25% year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter, with U.S. and ex-U.S. sales both increasing by more than 20%.', 'This story was originally published on MedTech Dive.

With stocks regularly hitting new highs, it seems everything has already been bid up to nosebleed valuations. Determining a stock’s fair value requires art as much as science – and predicting the unpredictable whims of Mr. Market is a fool’s errand.', 'However, by taking a long-term view and focusing on fundamentals, it’s possible to identify stocks trading at tempting discounts. For investors seeking market-trouncing returns, these undervalued stocks could supercharge portfolio performance. At the same time, their beaten-down prices provide a margin of safety that adds ballast in stormy seas. As investing legends like Warren Buffett and Benjamin Graham preached, buying high-quality companies at bargain prices is one of the surest paths to wealth creation.', 'With that in mind, here are seven undervalued stocks trading under $20 to look into:', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com', 'Qurate Retail Group (NASDAQ:QRTEA) specializes in video commerce and advertising across various platforms. We’ve been witnessing a seismic shift in how digital advertising is executed as the world transitions away from televisions to mobile and computer screens. This explains why companies have dumped substantial amounts of money into the internet-driven digital realm. Firms like Qurate Retail stand out in this space.', 'What differentiates Qurate Retail is its focus on live shows featuring product demonstrations and exclusive sales to entice customers to purchase items. Management has also expanded the business into mobile apps and online commerce to keep the company relevant in today’s marketplace.', 'However, Qurate Retail has faced immense pressure in recent years, as evidenced by the admittedly ugly stock chart. I believe a turnaround is brewing though, and getting in now could easily generate multibagger returns in the coming months or over the next few years if this turnaround proves successful.', 'The stock has plunged 93% over the past five years, but the bleeding has slowed and shares have traded sideways for over a year near $1. The primary problem is the $7.3 billion debt load causing substantial interest payments due to rate hikes, leading to rapid balance sheet erosion in recent years. Revenue declines due to scaled-back expansion have also impacted the top line, but helped stabilize the situation by improving profits. Losses are currently not at critical levels, and analysts actually expect EPS of 66 cents for 2024, putting the forward price-to-earnings ratio at just 1.7x. The stock also trades at 0.04x forward sales. I believe once rates inevitably decline, the company would be able to power out of the storm with massive cash flow that can then fund further top-line growth.', 'Source: Roman Tiraspolsky / Shutterstock.com', 'The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company (NASDAQ:GT) is a global leader in tire and rubber product manufacturing, operating across various regions worldwide. Their primary business involves developing, producing, distributing, and selling tires for diverse applications. Like many auto-related firms, Goodyear has faced challenges in recent years. While not as distressed as QRTEA, Goodyear faces headwinds nonetheless. However, I believe this stock is also gradually recovering and can generate multibagger gains moving forward.', 'Goodyear is deleveraging its balance sheet, which has $8.65 billion in debt against just $902 million in cash. Still, the company is keeping losses manageable despite substantial interest payments and rate hikes depressing car sales and the broader tire industry. Analysts foresee massive margin expansion in coming years. EPS is projected at $1.24 for 2024, equating to a forward P/E of just 10x. EPS is expected to nearly double from 2024 to 2026. Revenue is also projected to stop declining in 2025 and resume modest but steady growth. I’m focused on margins now. Once rate cuts commence, I expect Goodyear’s business to make a rapid turnaround.', 'Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com', 'StoneCo (NASDAQ:STNE) is a Brazilian fintech company (operates more like a bank) that boasts solid top-line growth, unlike the previous two turnaround plays. Revenue is expected to climb from $2.6 billion in 2024 to $4 billion in 2027, with accelerating growth, plus 20% average annual EPS expansion over the same period. Although the stock sits 82% off its 2021 peak, it has traded sideways for nearly two and a half years, an ideal setup for a discounted fintech stock at just 13x forward earnings. Fintech stocks broadly face pressure amid an unattractive financial sector, but I foresee improvement in the coming years as the economy normalizes.', 'Notably, Brazil has been more successful with rate hikes and cuts, responding to inflation earlier. Ongoing rate cuts provide tailwinds, with the business already recovering. The guidance calls for a 31% net income CAGR from 2024-2027. This is along with a staggering 90% credit portfolio CAGR. I believe the higher profits will fund expanding growth.', 'Revenue growth is far below the triple-digit rates seen just two years ago. However, rekindling 30%+ annual growth could prompt a major rerating. With $2.5 billion in cash against $1.1 billion in debt, StoneCo has ample capital to fund this growth when conditions allow. Thus, it is one of the must undervalued stocks, in my opinion.', 'Source: rafastockbr / Shutterstock.com', 'PagSeguro (NYSE:PAGS) is another Brazilian fintech playing in many developing countries with immense potential for fintech growth. Its stock chart somewhat mirrors StoneCo’s. However, PAGS has nearly doubled from its November 2023 trough, and I foresee further upside as the business prospers in a more favorable environment. Analysts anticipate 7-8% annual revenue growth moving forward, plus 15-20% average annual EPS expansion. This is terrific growth for a stock trading at just 11x forward earnings. With $597 million in cash against only $67 million in debt, the balance sheet appears very healthy too.', 'Brazil’s rate cuts are morphing into growth tailwinds, evidenced by PagSeguro’s 11.8% TPV growth in Q4. Furthermore, micro-merchant TPV grew 14% YoY in Q4, now benefiting from a mobile tap-on-phone solution. Combined with TPV in merchant acquiring, this led to a record R$27.6 billion in deposits, up 33% year-over-year. To me, these metrics point to a very bright future for PagSeguro. It also demonstrates that rate cuts are having a profoundly positive effect on Brazil’s fintech sector. As cuts continue, I anticipate PagSeguro’s share price will climb higher.', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'Qifu Technology (NASDAQ:QFIN) is a Chinese Credit-Tech platform delivering comprehensive tech services to aid financial institutions, consumers, and SMEs throughout the loan lifecycle. Offerings range from borrower acquisition and initial credit evaluation to fund matching and post-funding services. Before you run away from this stock given China concerns, let’s examine the fundamentals. Although shares are down 57% from the 2021 peak, they are essentially flat compared to March 2022 levels. I believe the latest spike could spur a breakout. The stock trades at a bit above $18 as of writing, and may break above $20 by the time you read this. I apologize if that turns out to be the case.', 'QFIN posted strong Q4 results, with 15% YoY revenue growth beating estimates by 5.55%. That’s alongside a 25% net margin. Qifu also unveiled a new $350 million buyback program starting in April 2024. Bearish China sentiment leaves shares at just 4.4x forward earnings. With $590 million in cash versus $113 million in debt, the balance sheet looks solid too. QFIN also pays a 4.4% dividend and churns out substantial profits. I expect this shareholder-friendly stock to appreciate further as analysts forecast ongoing double-digit EPS expansion. That makes it one of the most undervalued stocks you can buy right now.', 'Source: shutterstock.com/CC7', 'Rush Street Interactive (NYSE:RSI) has also been rangebound for nearly two years after initially sliding when the post-Covid boom subsided. However, I foresee significant upside ahead. RSI provides real-money online casino, online and retail sports betting, and social gaming services across the U.S., Canada, Mexico, and Latin America. Gambling and betting are booming – slower growth perhaps, but remarkable expansion as more states legalize it thanks to intense lobbying efforts. RSI is positioned to capitalize on this megatrend.', 'Shares have already recovered 90% over the past year, and I anticipate this trajectory will persist. Revenue growth of 15% is expected in 2024, while the stock trades at just 0.56x forward sales. It also goes for 30x 2025 EPS, a steal given further 31% projected growth in 2026 and ongoing rapid expansion thereafter. RSI trounced EPS estimates by 46% in 2023, and positive EPS is expected by mid-to-late 2024.', 'Source: Motortion Films / Shutterstock.com', 'Super Group (NYSE:SGHC) is another online sports betting and gaming operator via its Betway and Spin brands. It benefits from the same tailwinds as Rush Street, so there’s little to add except that SGHC is another turnaround candidate that could quickly break its two-year sideways trend. Based in Guernsey, it is expanding globally. As a SeekingAlpha analyst noted, SGHC should have no trouble accelerating growth to the ~10% industry rate as Canada opens online gambling.', 'While analysts forecast nearly 100% EPS growth over 2024-2028, I believe SGHC could dramatically outdo expectations with more jurisdictions approving online betting and gambling. It exceeded EPS projections by 322% in 2023.', 'On the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

WINREVAIR was previously granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the FDA. WINREVAIR is the first FDA-approved activin signaling inhibitor therapy for PAH, representing a new class of therapy that works by improving the balance between pro- and anti-proliferative signaling to regulate vascular cell proliferation underlying PAH.', '""Pulmonary arterial hypertension is a rare, progressive and ultimately life-threatening disease in which blood vessels in the lungs thicken and narrow, causing significant strain on the heart,"" said Dr. Marc Humbert, Professor of Medicine and Director of the Pulmonary Hypertension Reference Center at the Université Paris-Saclay and investigator on the Phase 3 STELLAR study. ""Based on the Phase 3 STELLAR trial, adding WINREVAIR to background PAH therapy demonstrated significant clinical benefits compared to background PAH therapy alone. This approval is an important milestone, as it offers healthcare providers a novel therapeutic option that targets a new PAH treatment pathway.""', 'The approval is based on the Phase 3 STELLAR trial, which compared WINREVAIR (n=163) to placebo (n=160), both in combination with background standard of care therapies in adult patients with PAH (WHO Group 1 FC II or III). Results showed adding WINREVAIR to background therapy increased six-minute walk distance from baseline by 41 meters (95% CI: 28, 54; p<0.001; placebo-adjusted) at Week 24 and significantly improved multiple important secondary outcome measures, including reducing the risk of death from any cause or PAH clinical worsening events by 84% versus background therapy alone (number of events: 9 vs 42, hazard ratio=0.16; 95% CI: 0.08, 0.35; p<0.001).', 'Healthcare providers should monitor hemoglobin and platelets before each dose of WINREVAIR for the first 5 doses, or longer if values are unstable, and periodically thereafter to determine if dose adjustments are required. WINREVAIR may increase hemoglobin and may lead to erythrocytosis, which if severe may increase the risk of thromboembolic events or hyperviscosity syndrome. WINREVAIR also may decrease platelet count and lead to severe thrombocytopenia, which may increase the risk of bleeding; thrombocytopenia occurred more frequently in patients also receiving prostacyclin infusion. Treatment should not be initiated if platelet count is <50,000/mm3. See additional Selected Safety Information below.', '""The Pulmonary Hypertension Association welcomes the development of new therapies for those with PAH,"" said Matt Granato, president and chief executive officer, Pulmonary Hypertension Association. ""A diagnosis of PAH is a life-changing experience for patients and families due to its chronic, progressive nature.

Called Winrevair, the drug is the first treatment that targets the underlying cause of the lung condition, which typically leads to death within a decade of diagnosis.', 'The FDA’s approval was based on clinical trial data showing Winrevair improved exercise duration and quality of life, as well as delayed death or worsening of the disease.', 'The shot, known scientifically as sotatercept, blocks proteins that contribute to the thickening of blood vessel walls in the lung and lead to rising blood pressure, an overworked heart and symptoms like shortness of breath, fatigue and chest pain. It’s administered every three weeks.', '“Sotatercept is a paradigm shift and a huge step forward in the treatment of PAH,” said Ioana Preston, a study investigator and director of the pulmonary hypertension center at Tufts Medicine, in an interview.', '“I’ve had some amazing stories from a few of the patients who I enrolled who went from really impaired and short of breath and very close to being on ... rescue therapy, to getting off oxygen and going back to their jobs, and maintaining the improvement for more than a year,” Preston said.', ""Several types of drugs are are currently used to treat PAH, all of which are vasodilators that help widen blood vessels. Johnson & Johnson’s Opsumit and Uptravi, as well as United Therapeutics' Tyvaso, are among the products prescribed for the condition."", 'However, those drugs only curb symptoms, rather than the underlying disease. While they can improve exercise capacity, for instance, they don’t address the biological factors that cause PAH to progress.', ""“Even with everything that's out there [these patients] still carry a high mortality rate,” said Joerg Koglin, Merck’s senior vice president of global clinical development."", 'Winrevair’s approval hinged on a Merck-run trial named Stellar, which enrolled 323 people with PAH who were stable on current medications. The participants were randomized to receive either Winrevair or a placebo once every three weeks. Investigators assessed the drug’s effectiveness based on a commonly used measure in cardiovascular disease called the six-minute walk test.', 'After six months of treatment, people who received Winrevair walked a median of 34 meters in that test, compared to just 1 meter among those who received a placebo. By one method of estimatation, the difference between the groups in change from baseline was 41 meters — a statistically significant result. Physicians usually consider a difference above 30 meters meaningful.', 'Winrevair-treated participants also scored statistically better on seven of eight other efficacy measures, including one that evaluated time to death or a “clinical worsening” event. On that score, the relative risk was 84% lower among people who received Merck’s drug instead of a placebo.', 'The most notable side effect was increased levels of hemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying blood protein. Elevations can lead to blood clots and other health problems. This adverse event was reported in more than 5% of patients, but doctors managed it by interrupting or reducing doses. No participants stopped treatment as a result.', 'The FDA’s labeling for the drug asks physicians to monitor patient hemoglobin levels before each of at least the first five doses.', 'People taking Winrevair also experienced other side effects like spider veins and bleeding gums and noses.', 'Merck acquired Winrevair through an $11.5 billion buyout of Acceleron Pharma in 2021. It’s part of a pipeline that the New Jersey-based drumaker estimates will bring in $35 billion in annual sales by the middle of the next decade.', 'Winrevair will be available in either a 45 milligram or 60 milligram vial, each costing $14,000 apiece. Dosing is based on patients’ weight, and Merck expects two-thirds of patients to need one vial every three weeks, equating to an annualized cost of around $238,000.', 'The price is more than double what Leerink Partners analyst Daina Graybosch had forecast.', 'Citing data company EvaluatePharma, Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Louise Chen expects Winrevair to achieve $2 billion in sales in 2028. Among investors, the range of peak annual sales forecasts ranges as low as $1 billion to as high as $8 billion, Chen wrote in a March 10 note to clients.', 'A strong launch might reassure investors Merck can overcome the looming loss of exclusivity for its biggest seller, the cancer drug Keytruda. Some of Keytruda’s key patents will expire later in the decade.', 'Success in two ongoing follow-up studies could be crucial to Winrevair’s market adoption. One, called Hyperion, is evaluating its use in newly diagnosed patients. The other, called Zenith, is testing it in advanced patients who are at elevated risk of death.', 'Those trials, along with long-term results from Winrevair’s other studies, will be necessary for physicians to understand the drug’s clinical profile, said Preston, of Tufts. “We need to learn more of the long-term effects.”', 'Editor’s note: This story has been updated to include Winrevair’s price.', 'This story was originally published on BioPharma Dive.

The 13th might be the most important yet.', 'As Boeing begins its search for a new CEO, the company is facing its worst-ever crisis. It has struggled through more than five years of safety incidents and bad news that created unprecedented doubt about the quality of its aircraft.', 'It faces multiple federal investigations into its commercial plane practices, as well as an outcry from the airline customers that buy its planes.', 'In addition to two fatal crashes that cost 346 lives, the company has run up more than $31 billion in losses since 2019, with no end to the red ink in sight. It has grabbed unwanted attention with incidents like a blown-out door plug that left a gaping hole in an Alaska Airlines flight in January.', 'Those incidents were followed by Monday’s decision by the current CEO, Dave Calhoun, to step down by the end of the year, leaving the company to search for a new chief executive.', 'When picking a new CEO, the company likely has two pools of choices.', 'It can go with someone who has an engineering background, as was the background of many of the past CEOs who led the company in its heyday. Four of the company’s first five CEOs were engineers by training, running the company for 46 of the first 70 years of Boeing’s existence.', 'Or it can once again pick a leader like outgoing CEO Calhoun, who has a financial background and an undergraduate degree in accounting. Critics have said an increased focus on financial results over engineering excellence over the last 25 years has led to the company’s current problems.', 'Some say it’s crucial that Boeing get back to its engineering roots in its next CEO.', '“To fix Boeing’s issues the company needs a strong engineering lead as its head coupled to a governance model which prioritizes safety and quality,” said Sir Tim Clark, president of Emirates Airlines, which ordered 373 planes from Boeing since 2009, but only two of those since 2019. “Whether, yet again, this changing of the guard will resolve Boeing’s issues only time will tell, but time, unfortunately, is not on their side.”', 'In an interview with CNBC on Monday morning, Calhoun was asked about what he wants to see in his successor.', '“I want somebody who knows how to handle a big, long, long-cycle business like ours,” Calhoun said. “It’s not just the production of the airplane. It’s the development of the next airplane. It will be a $50 billion investment. I would like somebody who clearly has the experience inside our industry.”', 'Calhoun did not give any potential names, or say whether Boeing is looking more at internal or outside candidates. But a number of potential choices are surfacing, according to Richard Aboulafia, managing director at AeroDynamic Advisory.', 'Pat Shanahan is the “top of the list,” according to Aboulafia. A former Boeing executive for 31 years, he became known as “Mr. Fix It” at the company for dealing with various problems during his tenure.', 'He was deputy secretary of the US Department of Defense under President Donald Trump and was nominated to be secretary, serving nearly six months in an acting capacity in 2019. His name was withdrawn before his confirmation due to media reports involving domestic incidents involving violent actions by his son and ex-wife.', 'He has held a number of different posts in the years since, and in September became CEO of Boeing’s major supplier, Spirit AeroSystems, which makes the fuselages for the Boeing 737 Max among other items.', 'Spirit AeroSystems faces its own safety and quality issues, which have caused problems for Boeing, forcing temporary halts of production on some jets. But most of those problems occurred before Shanahan took the CEO job there.', 'Boeing is in talks to reacquire Spirit, the companies confirmed, which would be something of a homecoming. Spirit was part of Boeing before the larger company spun it off in 2005.', 'If Boeing acquires Spirit, it’s possible Shanahan would be tapped as Boeing’s next CEO as part of the merger.', 'Most of the companies where candidates mentioned in this story now work declined to comment when questioned by CNN or did not respond to a request for comment. Spirit was the only one to comment, but it did not address the possibility of Shanahan becoming Boeing CEO.', '“Mr. Shanahan remains solely focused on driving a zero-defects culture across all aspects of Spirit AeroSystems,” said Joe Buccino, a Spirit spokesperson.', 'Larry Culp has already turned around one major American industrial icon, becoming  CEO of General Electric in 2018 and spinning off many of the company’s parts. One of the parts that remains is GE Aerospace, which makes engines used on Boeing jets and other planes.', 'Under its longtime CEO Jack Welch, GE grew to corporate success with a strong focus on cutting costs to improve financial performance. Three of the last four Boeing CEOs, including Calhoun, spent part of their careers at GE. Some Boeing critics say those CEOs’ emphasis on the GE playbook of cost cutting, profitability and shareholders rewards rather than quality was the source of much of Boeing’s current problems.', 'But Culp has moved GE away from the Jack Welch era, a time when Calhoun and some of the other earlier Boeing CEOs cut their teeth, said Aboulafia.', 'Culp joined GE as an outsider in 2018 after spending 24 years at Danaher Corp., moving up the ranks to CEO from 2000 to 2014. Many industrial analysts believe Danaher, during Culp’s tenure, outperformed GE and many other manufacturing and industrial companies during that time. Culp has an undergraduate degree in economics and an MBA from Harvard, a business background more than an engineering background.', '“I know he’s done incredibly well at Danaher and GE. This is a new GE. Culp is being very open to being transformative,” he said. “They needed to escape from that Jack Welch culture. What looks like a negative is actually a positive.”', 'GE did not comment when asked about whether Culp would be interested in the Boeing job.', 'Kathy Warden has had a lot of success as CEO of Northrop Grumman since she began in the company’s top job at the start of 2019.', 'The military contractor’s revenues have grown 30% during that period. Its stock price has nearly doubled under her tenure. And while Northrop doesn’t make commercial jets, Boeing is also a major defense contractor in addition to a commercial aircraft maker. Warden has an MBA and worked at GE for a decade and two other industrial companies before joining Northrop.', '“That’s a wonderful idea,” Aboulafia said. “I don’t now how you’d convince her to make that leap, but she’d be perfect.”', 'One reason that the Boeing board might be interested in her, besides her success, is what’s known as the “glass cliff” phenomenon, in which companies, especially those in male dominated fields like tech or manufacturing, are more open to looking at women CEOs when they’re in trouble.', 'Think of General Motors picking Mary Barra to be the first woman to run a major global automaker just before a major crisis — the ignition switch problem that killed more than 100 drivers and passengers and cost the company billions — became public. Sometimes the new woman CEO is not as successful as Barra in steering the company through the crisis, and thus a woman who has shattered the “glass ceiling” finds herself pushed off the “glass cliff.”', 'Greg Smith left his post as CFO of Boeing soon after the company’s board granted a five-year waiver of the normal retirement age limit of 65 to Calhoun in 2021. Smith, who was 54 at the time, clearly saw his path to the CEO job had been blocked.', 'Since he left, he joined a number of corporate boards, most notably American Airlines, where he serves as chairman.', 'RIght now, one of Boeing’s biggest problems is relations with its airline customers, many of whom are frustrated with repeated missed deadlines to deliver new jets, groundings by regulators and for the quality of the jets it is delivering.', 'One way for the Boeing board to signal it is listening to those customer concerns would be to name someone who now is on the airlines’ side of that crucial relationship but who also has experience with Boeing. That describes Smith. But picking him would also mean another CEO with a finance background rather than an engineering background.', 'Aboulafia suggested there could be a number of executives who have left Boeing who might be good fits if they could come back, although their age could be an issue.', 'At the top of that list is Alan Mulally. He was a long-time veteran of the Boeing Commercial Airplane unit, rising to be its CEO. He left Boeing in 2006 to become CEO of Ford. At the time, Ford was struggling more than the other Detroit automakers, GM and DaimlerChrysler, as Chrysler was then known.', 'Mulally helped turn around the company, which allowed Ford to be the only Detroit automaker to avoid a federal bailout and bankruptcy, as GM and Chrysler experienced three years later. He retired from Ford in 2014 with a nest egg worth nearly $300 million thanks to the turnaround the stock experienced during his eight years on the job. Mulally has degrees in aeronautical engineering and in management.', 'It’s not clear if Mulally, now 78, would want to come out of retirement for a challenge as big as turning around Boeing. He did not respond to an email from CNN about the job on Monday.', 'It’s also not clear if the Boeing board would consider someone that old. But in a year in which the US presidential election appears likely to pit an 81-year old candidate versus a 77-year old candidate, it seems tough to argue a well respected 78-year-old is too old to run Boeing.', 'Normally, internal candidates might be seen as the likely picks to replace Calhoun. Most of the 12 CEOs in Boeing’s history were internal candidates, with Calhoun being an exception.', 'However, the problems at Boeing during the last five years could lead the board to give preference to outside candidates.', '“Boeing is in need of drastic cultural overall, which is cultivated from the top, but sprouts from the bottom,” said Bank of America aerospace analyst Ron Epstein in a note to clients Monday. “We see the changes [announced Monday] as the first right steps of removing the ‘old guard’ and making way for a new team which can work from a less sullied slate.”', 'But among the internal candidates who might be considered are Stephanie Pope, who has been rising rapidly at Boeing and was promoted to chief operating officer just this past January. She was then promoted to CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes on Monday.', 'Another internal candidate could be CFO Brian West, another GE veteran, having served as CFO of GE Aviation and CFO GE Engine Services before coming to Boeing. Both Pope and West come from a finance background, not an engineering background.', 'It’s also possible that Boeing could tap Elizabeth Lund, who is senior vice president of quality at Boeing Commercial Airplanes, a new position that was created just a month ago. She does have an engineering background and experience dealing with Boeing suppliers, a major issue for the company’s efforts to get back on track.', '“I don’t know her, but she’s well regarded,” Aboulafia said.', 'A Boeing spokesperson declined to provide any comments on behalf of any of the internal candidates.', 'For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com']"

A Boeing spokesperson said that details of his compensation will be shared in company filings in the coming weeks.', 'But we already know that Calhoun has made about $63 million over the past three years in total compensation, according to regulatory filings. That includes a $1.4 million base salary, plus millions in stock-based incentives.', 'According to Boeing’s most recent proxy statement, Calhoun is set to walk away with about $15 million worth of stock, cash and options in retirement. But that doesn’t account for incentives along the way that could boost his potential future earnings. One estimate, according to Fortune, suggests Calhoun could walk away with $24 million, with the potential to collect $45.5 million more if Boeing’s stock goes up 37%. That gives Calhoun a pretty hefty incentive to choose his successor carefully.', 'If history is any guide, Calhoun could have done a much worse job and still made out startlingly well.', 'His predecessor, Dennis Muilenburg, was fired over his mishandling of Boeing’s response to two crashes that killed 346 people. And while Muilenburg was denied severance pay, he still walked away with $80 million worth of stock and other assets.', 'Post-Muilenburg, the board tapped one of their own to take over.', 'Calhoun, an accountant by training and a longtime Boeing director, ascended as CEO in January of 2020 with a message that Boeing would be getting back to its roots and focusing on safety and quality.', 'The honeymoon period didn’t last long.', 'Even as the board heaped praise on Calhoun, Boeing’s own customers started sounding off about their frustrations with the leadership.', 'In 2022, the CEO of Ryanair said “Boeing management is running around like headless chickens,” and that executives needed an immediate “reboot, or a boot up the a**.” Around the same time, the head of aircraft leasing company Avalon said Boeing had “lost its way” and might need “fresh leadership.”', 'Under Calhoun, labor relations at Boeing have been badly frayed. The company laid off at least 16,000 employees in response to the pandemic, and moved production of the 787 Dreamliner from its unionized plant in Washington to a non-unionized plant in South Carolina. This summer, more than 30,000 Seattle-area mechanics are set to vote on a strike authorization that could result in a work stoppage when their contract expires in September.', 'Still, Calhoun has held on, thanks to a loyal board and a business model that makes it virtually impossible for Boeing to lose customers or go bankrupt.

The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years."", 'A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:', '2024', '2025', '2026', '2027', '2028', '2029', '2030', '2031', '2032', '2033', ' Levered FCF ($, Millions) ', 'US$529.0m', 'US$760.0m', 'US$1.03b', 'US$1.24b', 'US$1.43b', 'US$1.58b', 'US$1.72b', 'US$1.83b', 'US$1.93b', 'US$2.01b', 'Growth Rate Estimate Source', 'Analyst x1', 'Analyst x2', 'Analyst x1', 'Est @ 20.27%', 'Est @ 14.88%', 'Est @ 11.10%', 'Est @ 8.46%', 'Est @ 6.61%', 'Est @ 5.31%', 'Est @ 4.41%', ' Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.8% ', 'US$495', 'US$667', 'US$848', 'US$956', 'US$1.0k', 'US$1.1k', 'US$1.1k', 'US$1.1k', 'US$1.1k', 'US$1.0k', '(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$9.4b', ""After calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.3%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.8%."", 'Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$2.0b× (1 + 2.3%) ÷ (6.8%– 2.3%) = US$46b', 'Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$46b÷ ( 1 + 6.8%)10= US$24b', 'The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$33b.

The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.', ""We would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Illumina as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.8%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.972. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole.

It’s a bit like going to an orchard: if you get there too late, the low-hanging fruit is all gone, and you’ll have to work harder to find the best pieces. Orcharders have ladders and pruning hooks to make the job easier; retail investors can turn to the Smart Score.', 'The Smart Score uses a combination of AI and natural language processing, through an algorithm by TipRanks, to gather and collate the mountain of raw data tossed up by the regular daily activity of the stock market – and then it compares every stock to the data, using the collected information and the analysis results to give each stock a simple score.', 'The score is set on a scale of 1 to 10, and the stock analysis is based on a comparison to a set of factors that are known as sound predictors of future share outperformance. A ‘Perfect 10’ from the Smart Score indicates a stock that is likely to show strong gains going forward.', 'Then those ‘Perfect 10s’ are also getting love from the Street’s analysts, which is a clear sign of stocks that are sending a bullish signal – and investors should pay attention. So, let’s do that; here are the details of 3 stocks that have earned the ‘Perfect 10,’ and have recent Buy ratings from the professional stock watchers.', 'LiveRamp Holdings (RAMP)', 'The first stock on our list is LiveRamp, a tech firm based in San Francisco and excelling in data enablement. LiveRamp’s platform allows its enterprise customer base to make their data accessible, usable, and secure; in short, the company offers data solutions that are customizable and scalable. It’s a necessary niche, and has found acceptance from numerous big-name firms. LiveRamp’s customers include such giants as Google, Walmart, Marriott, Hulu, and Office Depot.', 'At the user level, LiveRamp gives its customers a platform capable of connecting devices and people with data across the digital and real worlds. The result: faster integration, more efficient workspaces, and improvements in digital security.', 'The company’s strong product has led to some solid business numbers. LiveRamp reported 895 direct subscription customers at the end of fiscal 3Q24 – the quarter ending on December 31, 2023 – and of those, 105 have subscription contracts worth $1 million or more in annual revenue. The company’s total subscription revenue for the quarter was up by 5% year-over-year, reaching $132 million.', 'This was one part of the company’s total revenue for the quarter, which came to $174 million, representing a 10% year-over-year gain and exceeding the forecast by $2.15 million. The company realized a 29% year-over-year increase in ‘marketing and other’ revenue, reaching $42 million in the period. At the bottom line, LiveRamp’s non-GAAP earnings per share were 47 cents, 7 cents better than had been expected. Looking at the company’s share performance, we see that RAMP has risen by more than 58% over the past 12 months, but has been slipping since the early-February earnings release and is down more than 10% year-to-date.', 'For Evercore analyst Kirk Materne, this stock represents a turnaround story after some recent slowdowns. He writes of the company and its shares, “We continue to believe that following a material (largely macro-induced) slowdown in growth in 2023, the company is well positioned to reaccelerate growth in 2024 (FY25) and beyond as the digital ad environment continues to improve, and LiveRamp benefits from being able to deliver identity, activation, addressability, and measurement at scale. The acquisition of Habu (announced in January) rounds out the ‘clean room’ capabilities of the company, adding increased integrations with the public cloud providers (namely Azure and Databricks with the addition of Habu) as well as expanding measurability in ‘walled gardens’, which account for ~3/4 of non-search digital advertising.”', 'Looking ahead, the analyst adds some explanation on just why he thinks these shares are going to climb higher, saying, “Finally, the company is working towards a ‘rule of 40’ operating profile, expanding operating margins by ~500bps in FY24 (as of the most recent guide) and expects similar expansion in FY25. The company’s margin expansion is further augmented by share repurchases ($60-80mn expected in FY24). Given these improving fundamental factors and solid initial F3Q (Dec.) results, we view the current valuation of ~3x EV/CY25 as leaving some room for upside.”', 'For Materne, this all adds up to an Outperform (Buy) rating, and his $50 price target implies the shares will gain 49% in the 12 months ahead. (To watch Materne’s track record, click here)', 'Overall, LiveRamp holds a Strong Buy consensus rating, based on 6 unanimously positive analyst reviews. The shares are trading for $33.50 and their $48.75 average price target suggests an upside of 45.5% on the one-year horizon. (See LiveRamp stock forecast)', 'BridgeBio Pharma (BBIO)', 'For the second stock on our list, we’ll shift over to the biomedical research field, where BridgeBio Pharma focuses on developing new treatments for genetic diseases with clear genetic drivers. These are conditions that are known to be genetically linked – and known to be caused by a single genetic mutation for each disease. Per BridgeBio, there are more than 8,000 disease conditions that meet this description, affecting millions of patients. That’s a huge potential customer base for a biopharmaceutical researcher, especially when we realize that there are fewer than 50 therapeutic agents approved by the FDA in this area.', 'BridgeBio is working to expand this area of treatment and has more than 15 active research tracks in its pipeline, targeting more than 20 disease conditions. The most advanced drug candidate, acoramidis, is a potential treatment for transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM). The company’s new drug application (NDA) for this candidate has been accepted for review by the FDA, with the PDUFA date set for November 29, 2024. In addition, the European Medicines Agency has also accepted the company’s MAA (Marketing Authorization Application) for acoramidis.', 'The company has also recently released data from the Japanese Phase 3 human clinical trial of the drug. The study, which focused on Japanese ATTR-CM patients, showed positive results – particularly, no patient mortality over a 30-month period.', 'BridgeBio generates most of its revenue through licensing agreements. That revenue track is facing pressure due to an ongoing legal suit involving Pfizer. Pfizer is undertaking a defense of its own ATTR-CM drug against generic copies; if Pfizer is successful, it will protect its intellectual property – and open up the field to BridgeBio, which will then face reduced competition.', 'When we look at the analysts, we find Danielle Brill, of Raymond James, taking a bullish stance on this company, based mainly on the strength of acoramidis. She writes, “We believe oral TTR-stabilizers (BBIO’s acoramidis/ PFE’s tafamidis) will remain as the gold-standard first-line therapy for patients with ATTR-CM. While there was some concern that the silencers (i.e., ALNY’s vutrisiran) might have a strong case for use ahead of the stabilizers, that now seems highly unlikely given the recent setback and change of stats plans for ALNY’s Ph 3 HELIOS-B trial.”', 'Brill sees the IP lawsuits as a potential booster, too, and also outlines the financial potential of the ATTR-CM market for BridgeBio: “There is still an IP overhang on BBIO, as PFE continues to litigate with generic filers — but we are cautiously optimistic that PFE’s patent estate will be protected until 2035. As the lawsuit progresses, there have been positive signs that PFE will be successful in defending their IP. If PFE’s patent holds, we think BBIO could capture ~20% of the projected $15B TAM, which translates to ~$3B in peak sales. Given the uncertainty, our model reflects risk adjusted peak net sales of ~$1.6B.”', 'The bottom line for Brill is an Outperform (Buy) rating on the shares, along with a price target of $45 that indicates her confidence in a 51% one-year upside potential. (To watch Brill’s track record, click here)', 'The Strong Buy consensus rating on BBIO shares is based on 12 recent analyst reviews, including 11 Buys and 1 Hold. The average price target, $50.73, and the $29.76 trading price, together suggest a 12-month gain of 70.5%. (See BBIO stock forecast)', 'IDEAYA Biosciences (IDYA)', 'We’ll wrap up with another biotech company in the biopharmaceutical field. IDEAYA is a precision medicine company, with a pipeline of drug candidates that have the potential to become first-in-class or best-in-class therapeutic agents. The company’s pipeline is made up of small molecule compounds and targets various cancers. IDEAYA uses molecular diagnosis methods to screen its patient populations, allowing for the fine targeting of synthetic therapeutic agents tested in clinical trials.', 'The most advanced products in those clinical trials are darovasertip, also called IDE196. It is a PKS inhibitor targeting genetically-defined cancers based on GNAQ or GNA11 mutations. IDE397 has wide applications as it is an MAT2A inhibitor, targeting cancer tumors that include an MTAP gene deletion – a class that includes some 15% of solid tumors. Finally, IDE161 is a PARG inhibitor being studied for efficacy against tumors with HRD, or homologous recombination deficiency.', 'Darovasertip is the subject of multiple clinical trials, with the most recent positive results coming from its trial as a combo therapy with crizotinib. In this trial, it showed ‘evidence of superior clinical efficacy in any-line and first-line MUM (metastatic uveal melanoma) patients compared to standard of care.’ The company has recently expanded its Phase 2 trial of darovasertip in combo with crizotinib against GNAQ/11 metastatic cutaneous melanoma. On the IDE397 track, the company has set up a collaboration with Gilead to study the IDE397-trodelvy combo in a clinical study for the treatment of MTAP bladder cancer.', 'The company’s most recent development was the announcement earlier this month of a clinical collaboration with Merck to evaluate IDE161 in combination with Keytruda as a treatment for patients with MSI-high and MSS endometrial cancer. IDEAYA will sponsor the clinical trials based on this collaboration.', 'This stock caught the eye of Justin Zelin, a 5-star analyst from BTIG. Zelin is bullish on IDYA’s high-quality pipeline, and writes of the company, “Lead drug daroversitib has demonstrated encouraging clinical data in the untapped HLA-A2(-) uveal melanoma pt population, who are ineligible for tx with Immunocore’s KIMMTRAK. We view positively IDYA’s MAT2A program, IDE397, as having a differentiated approach towards MTAP-deleted tumors, and we will keenly follow synergistic data from the PRMT5i combination program, which we believe could potentially be best-in-class. We believe the early pipeline is underappreciated and see value-creation opportunities on the generation of additional de-risking POC data for IDE161 and Werner helicase programs.”', 'Quantifying his stance, Zelin rates the stock as a Buy, with a $55 price target implying a 29% increase in share price in the coming year. (To watch Zelin’s track record, click here)', 'This is a stock with a unanimously positive Strong Buy consensus rating, based on 10 analyst reviews. The shares are trading for $42.51 and their $52.90 average target price points toward a 24.5% upside potential over the next year.

As investors brace for the Federal Reserve's upcoming release of crucial inflation data later this week, a sense of prudence prevails. Japan's Finance Minister issued a cautionary note against excessive fluctuations in the yen, underscoring the sensitivity of currency markets amid uncertain economic conditions. In this landscape, Julius Baer discerns a trend of capital flowing into Japanese equities, marking a potential shift in investment patterns. This observation hints at evolving investor sentiments and strategic reallocations within the financial markets."", ""Looking ahead, all eyes are on the Federal Reserve's forthcoming release of its key inflation gauge data, slated for Friday. This data release is expected to provide crucial insights into the trajectory of inflation, influencing market sentiment and potentially steering investor strategies in the days to come. As traders navigate through these uncertain waters, the cautious stance underscores the importance of strategic positioning and prudent risk management in the ever-fluctuating landscape of global financial markets."", 'In February, new home sales in the U.S. unexpectedly dropped by 0.3%, attributed to rising mortgage rates during the month. Despite this decline, the overall trend remains robust amidst a persistent shortage of existing homes in the market, reported Reuters. Notably, the median price of new homes recorded its lowest figure in over 2-1/2 years, while the supply reached its highest level since November 2022. Builders are responding to market dynamics by increasing construction efforts, offering price reductions, and adjusting floor plans to enhance affordability. This strategy seems to be stabilizing housing activity, with sales maintaining a relatively steady pace and prices experiencing moderate declines year-over-year. Although economists had anticipated a rise in new home sales, the actual figures reflect a slight contraction, emphasizing the volatility inherent in monthly data. Despite multiple interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve since March 2022, the new homes market has remained resilient, primarily due to the limited availability of existing homes for sale. While the housing market appears to be turning a corner, the persistent supply shortage continues to exert upward pressure on house prices, hindering access to homeownership for many. However, the recent decline in the median new house price is welcomed by economists as it suggests improvements in affordability and could help mitigate inflationary pressures. Looking ahead, despite some regional variations, surveys indicate a positive outlook for new home sales, supported by builder optimism and ongoing efforts to expand supply. Nonetheless, the sustainability of current incentives offered by builders remains uncertain, posing potential challenges to future market dynamics. Overall, amidst fluctuations in mortgage rates and supply dynamics, the new homes market in the U.S. demonstrates resilience, though challenges persist in achieving long-term affordability and accessibility for prospective homebuyers.', 'In financial markets, notable equities such as Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE:VLO), SolarEdge Technologies, Inc.

Despite maintaining a positive view on the overall electric vehicle (EV) sector and its gradual transition toward electrification, the analyst highlighted near-term hurdles affecting Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) performance. These challenges include constraints in current EV demand and tightening liquidity, which could pose difficulties for the company through 2025. Despite the downgrade, Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock saw a modest increase of 1.05% following the announcement, closing at $172.63 on the same day.

(NASDAQ:PZZA), downgrading the stock from Buy to Neutral. This adjustment in rating reflects Saleh's assessment of the pizza chain's performance within the restaurant industry. It reflects a shift in Saleh's perception of the company's potential performance. While previously advocating for a bullish outlook, Saleh now views the stock more neutrally, possibly due to changing market conditions or company-specific factors. Despite the downgrade, Papa John's International, Inc. (NASDAQ:PZZA) stock experienced a slight uptick of 0.88% following the announcement, closing at $66.32 on March 25.

Mr. Lynch brings previous leadership experience at large franchisors Arby’s and Taco Bell—where he worked alongside current Chipotle CEO Brian Niccol—and a marketing background at P&G. At Arby’s, Mr. Lynch led a turnaround effort where he shaped the company’s successful “We have the meats!” marketing campaign. Mr. Lynch has focused on reestablishing Papa John’s premium positioning with new food options, advertising campaigns and operational cost-cutting measures meant to improve margins.

(NYSE:PFE), a leading player in the pharmaceutical industry. The analysts downgraded Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) stock rating from Buy to Hold, citing concerns about ""near-term headwinds"" that the drugmaker is expected to encounter in its journey toward revenue growth. The decision to downgrade Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) likely reflects a comprehensive assessment of various factors affecting the company\'s performance, including its revenue projections, margin outlook, and patent expiration risks. The analysts pointed out that Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) revenue growth forecast of 3% to 5%, excluding COVID-19 products and the Seagen acquisition, represents a decrease from the 7% growth experienced in 2023. They also highlighted the anticipated decline in revenue from COVID-related products, which is expected to result in lower gross and operating margins. Moreover, Pfizer faces the challenge of offsetting revenue declines from products that will lose patent protection and exclusivity between 2025 and 2030. This necessitates finding alternatives to compensate for the approximate $17 billion in annual revenue that these products are projected to lose due to loss of exclusivity (LOE). As a result of these factors, the analysts have revised down their adjusted earnings per share (EPS) estimate for Pfizer in 2024 to $2.15 from the previous estimate of $3.25.', ""Looking ahead, the analysts have set a new EPS estimate of $2.70 for 2025 and adjusted the forecast for the five-year EPS growth rate to 7%, down from the earlier projection of 9%. These adjustments reflect the analysts' cautious outlook on Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) future earnings potential and growth prospects within the pharmaceutical sector. Despite the downgrade, investors responded with a modest increase in Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) stock price, which rose by 0.26% on March 25, closing at $27.43. This reaction suggests that while some investors may have tempered their optimism about Pfizer's near-term performance, others may still see potential value in the company's long-term strategy and pipeline of products. The market's response underscores the complexity of evaluating pharmaceutical stocks and the importance of considering various factors impacting their performance."", 'Price Reaction after the Downgrade: +0.02\xa0(+0.04%)', ""On March 22, Mizuho analyst Nitin Kumar made a notable adjustment to his assessment of PBF Energy Inc. (NYSE:PBF), a prominent player in the oil refining industry. Kumar downgraded PBF Energy's stock rating from Buy to Neutral, indicating a shift in his recommendation for investors. Despite the downgrade, Kumar raised the price target for PBF Energy from $52 to $58, suggesting a revised expectation for the company's future valuation. While the downgrade indicates a more neutral stance on PBF Energy Inc. (NYSE:PBF) stock, the upward revision of the price target suggests that Kumar still sees potential upside for the company, albeit at a more moderate level than previously anticipated. This nuanced approach may reflect Kumar's belief that while PBF Energy Inc. (NYSE:PBF) may not offer the same level of investment opportunity as before, it still has room for growth and value appreciation. Following the downgrade, investors responded with a marginal increase in PBF Energy Inc. (NYSE:PBF) stock price, which rose by 0.04% on March 25, closing at $56.30. This reaction suggests that while some investors may have adjusted their expectations in light of the downgrade, others may still perceive PBF Energy Inc. (NYSE:PBF) as a viable investment option within the oil refining industry.

However, we decided to study the company's mixed-bag of fundamentals to assess what this could mean for future share prices, as stock prices tend to be aligned with a company's long-term financial performance. Specifically, we decided to study Fox's  ROE in this article."", 'Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.', ' See our latest analysis for Fox ', 'Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Fox is:', '8.0% = US$849m ÷ US$11b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).', ""The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.08 in profit."", 'So far, we\'ve learned that ROE is a measure of a company\'s profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company\'s future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.', ""On the face of it, Fox's ROE is not much to talk about. A quick further study shows that the company's ROE doesn't compare favorably to the industry average of 12% either. For this reason, Fox's five year net income decline of 7.6% is not surprising given its lower ROE. We believe that there also might be other aspects that are negatively influencing the company's earnings prospects. Such as - low earnings retention or poor allocation of capital."", ""However, when we compared Fox's growth with the industry we found that while the company's earnings have been shrinking, the industry has seen an earnings growth of 13% in the same period. This is quite worrisome."", 'Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if Fox is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.', ""Fox's low three-year median payout ratio of 21% (implying that it retains the remaining 79% of its profits) comes as a surprise when you pair it with the shrinking earnings. This typically shouldn't be the case when a company is retaining most of its earnings. So there could be some other explanations in that regard. For example, the company's business may be deteriorating."", ""Moreover, Fox has been paying dividends for five years, which is a considerable amount of time, suggesting that management must have perceived that the shareholders prefer consistent dividends even though earnings have been shrinking. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 18%. However, Fox's ROE is predicted to rise to 13% despite there being no anticipated change in its payout ratio."", ""In total, we're a bit ambivalent about Fox's performance. Even though it appears to be retaining most of its profits, given the low ROE, investors may not be benefitting from all that reinvestment after all. The low earnings growth suggests our theory correct. With that said, we studied the latest analyst forecasts and found that while the company has shrunk its earnings in the past, analysts expect its earnings to grow in the future.

One of the very few things that tends to disrupt this harmony is rapidly rising interest rates. The Federal Reserve's aggressive rate-hiking cycle that began in March 2022 sent short-term Treasury yields soaring, which in turn made utility stocks less attractive to income seekers."", ""On the other side of the coin, the nation's central bank looks to be at the tail-end of its tightening cycle. Although shelter inflation remains stubbornly high, the prevailing rate of inflation has notably declined from its June 2022 peak of more than 9%. This suggests Treasury yields will fall and utility stocks like NextEra Energy will soon regain their luster."", ""But there's a lot more to like about NextEra than just a favorable macroeconomic outlook. What's set NextEra Energy apart from dozens of other publicly traded electric utilities is its investments in renewable energy. As of the end of 2023, the company has 72 gigawatts (GW) in operation, 36 GW of which are tied to renewable sources. The 24 GW of capacity NextEra generates from wind power, along with the 7 GW from solar, are both high-water marks globally from an electric utility."", ""Admittedly, investing in renewable energy projects isn't cheap. However, making these investments has led to outsized adjusted earnings growth. Thanks to meaningfully reduced electricity generation costs, NextEra's adjusted earnings have grown by annualized 10% over the trailing decade. It's effectively a growth stock in a sector known for low-single-digit earnings growth."", ""NextEra Energy isn't taking its foot off the accelerator, either. From the start of 2023 through the end of 2026, it expects to bring between 32.7 GW and 41.8 GW of renewables and storage solutions online. In short, its competitive advantage as a leader in clean-energy solutions is only growing."", 'Opportunistic investors have the opportunity to scoop up shares of NextEra Energy right now for 17 times forward-year earnings, which represents a 34% discount to its average forward-year earnings multiple over the trailing-five-year period.', 'A second amazing stock that has all the hallmarks of a no-brainer buy if you have $500 ready to invest is cybersecurity company SentinelOne (NYSE: S).', ""Two weeks ago, SentinelOne released its fiscal fourth-quarter operating results (the company's fiscal year ends Jan. 31) and provided sales guidance for fiscal 2025. Wall Street was less-than-thrilled with the company's forecast of $812 million to $818 million in full-year sales for current year, compared to the consensus estimate from analysts of $818 million. In a richly valued market, companies that don't wallop Wall Street's expectations get creamed."", ""However, this looks like a classic overreaction if investors widen their lens. Though SentinelOne didn't clobber the consensus, the midpoint of its forecast ($815 million in full-year sales) implies year-over-year sales growth of 31%. That's not too shabby. In the coming four years, SentinelOne is expected to sustain a roughly 30% growth rate and triple its sales."", 'The catalyst behind its steady growth is its Singularity platform. Singularity relies on artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to proactively identify and prevent endpoint security threats. Leaning on AI should help Singularity become more effective over time.', ""This is a great time to mention that cybersecurity has become something of a basic necessity service. Businesses with an online or cloud-based presence don't have the luxury of crossing their fingers and hoping hackers won't steal their data. Regardless of how well or poorly the economy and stock market are performing, demand for third-party endpoint solutions should remain steady. In short, we're talking about a recipe for predictable operating cash flow."", 'Among the many key performance indicators headed in the right direction, the one that really stands out is the sheer number of customers now generating in excess of $100,000 in annual recurring revenue (ARR). SentinelOne closed out fiscal 2024 with 1,133 customers generating north of $100,000 in ARR, which is a 30% increase from the prior year. Bigger customers are its key to reaching recurring profitability in the current year.', ""The third no-brainer stock that's begging to be bought with $500 right now is none other than fintech leader PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ: PYPL)."", 'Since reaching its all-time high during the summer of 2021, shares of PayPal have retraced around 80%. Increasing competition in the digital payment space, coupled with the fear of higher inflation reducing the discretionary spending power of consumers, has weighed on this former highflier. But there are plenty of reasons to be believe PayPal can shine bright, once more.', ""To start with the obvious, fintech solutions are still early in their growth ramp. According to estimates from Boston Consulting Group that were released in May 2023, global fintech revenue can grow sixfold to $1.5 trillion by 2030. There's more than enough room for multiple winners with an addressable opportunity this large."", ""More importantly, most of PayPal's key performance metrics point to sustained double-digit growth. Even amid stagnant active account growth, PayPal recorded $1.53 trillion in total payment volume (TPV) across its networks (primarily PayPal and Venmo) in 2023. That's up 12% on a currency-neutral basis. As I've pointed out previously, if PayPal can deliver 12% currency-neutral TPV growth amid palpable economic uncertainty and with active accounts stagnant, imagine what it can do when active account growth returns and the U.S. economy really finds its footing."", ""PayPal's active account engagement might be the top selling point to investors. At the end of 2020, the average active account was completing close to 41 payments on a trailing-12-month (TTM) basis. But when the curtain closed on 2023, the company's average active account had completed almost 59 payments on a TTM basis. PayPal is primarily driven by fees. If people are using the platform more frequently, it bodes well for an increase in gross profit over time."", ""New CEO Alex Chriss provides another reason for current and prospective shareholders to be optimistic. Prior to becoming PayPal CEO in late September, he headed Intuit's Small Business segment. He understands what growth initiatives will resonate with smaller merchants, but also isn't afraid to tighten PayPal's belt to improve its margins."", ""Shares of PayPal can be scooped up by growth and value seekers for less than 12 times forward-year earnings.

But over the past five years, its share prices have declined about 36% as the S&P 500 advanced 87%.', ""PayPal's stock slumped as its growth cooled off, its former parent company eBay switched over to its European rival Adyen, and more competitors carved up the fragmented market. Inflation also curbed consumer spending, rising interest rates compressed its valuations, and it broadly missed its own lofty long-term goals."", ""So should investors buy, sell, or hold PayPal's stock at these depressed levels?"", 'The bulls still like PayPal for three reasons:', 'Its sales growth is stabilizing.', 'Its margins are improving.', 'Its stock looks historically cheap.', ""PayPal's revenue only rose 7% in 2022. That represented a significant slowdown from its compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 18% from 2015 to 2021. It struggled to gain new active accounts after more competitors entered the market, eBay shifted its merchants toward Adyen, and inflation curbed consumer spending."", 'But in 2023, its revenue climbed 8% as it increased its total transactions per active account by 14%. That growth was mainly driven by Braintree, which handles its unbranded backend payment services, and Venmo, its peer-to-peer payments app. Analysts expect its revenue to rise 7% in 2024 and 8% in 2025.', ""As PayPal's growth slowed down, it reined in its spending. In 2023, its adjusted operating margin expanded 110 basis points to 22.4% and its adjusted EPS grew 24%. Analysts expect its adjusted EPS to dip 1% this year as it ramps up its spending on newer features, followed by 10% growth in 2025."", ""Based on those expectations, PayPal looks like a value play at 13 times forward earnings. That's probably why PayPal's insiders purchased about 10% as many shares as they sold over the past 12 months, and why it bought back $5 billion in shares in 2023."", 'Yet the bears will argue that PayPal deserves to trade at that discount for three reasons:', ""It's bleeding active accounts."", 'Its take rates are declining.', 'It lacks a meaningful moat.', ""PayPal ended 2023 with 426 million active accounts, which equaled a 2% decline from its 435 million active accounts at the end of 2022. It lost active accounts sequentially in each quarter of 2023. To offset those persistent losses, PayPal needs to aggressively grow its transactions per active account by rolling out new features -- but that's a wobbly strategy that could run out of steam and crush its margins."", ""PayPal's annual transaction take rate, or the percentage of each transaction it retains as revenue after splitting its fees with credit card processors and other payment networks, fell from 2.89% in 2015 to 1.76% in 2023 and has never improved year over year."", ""That decline suggests that PayPal doesn't have much pricing power in the crowded fintech market. Its growing dependence on Braintree and Venmo -- which both have lower take rates than its namesake platform -- will exacerbate that pressure."", ""Many of PayPal's competitors -- especially big tech companies like Apple and Alphabet's Google -- can afford to take losses on their digital payment platforms to expand their ecosystems. PayPal also doesn't have any clear competitive advantages against Adyen, Block, Stripe, and other similar players, and it's still scrambling to keep up with buy now, pay later (BNPL) platforms by hastily rolling out its own BNPL services."", 'PayPal\'s high-growth days are over, and its new CEO, Alex Chriss, warned that 2024 would be a ""transition year"" during its latest conference call.

I think Mary pointed out just exactly what's happening. We're in this lull period. You had a lot of demand that picked up. The early adopters buying their $60,000, $70,000 Teslas. A lot of money from the pandemic that came in, low interest rates."", 'So I think it was just a pull forward of demand. And some of the things she pointed out are very true.

So for them, they need to sell these products. So a lull winds up being really problematic from a cash flow perspective. And that's why the large caps, the legacy players like a GM, like a Volkswagen, like these guys, are actually better positioned to weather the storm."", ""SEANA SMITH: When you're talking about weathering the storm here-- and you laid out the fact that pricing was too high. There's also some concerns just about the accessibility of chargers and how people are going to charge these vehicles, when we talk about mass adoption."", 'When you take a look at the next generation of EV vehicles that we are expecting, say, over the next 12 to 18 months, do they address any of those issues?', ""TOM NARAYAN: Yes. That's a great point. And what you had happening for years now is the same EV type. This small crossover or a sedan. Why? Because the biggest drag on range is aerodynamics.

But the field narrows once you factor in companies that have not only paid a dividend, but also raised it every year.', 'To accomplish that feat, a company has to sport earnings growth, navigate downturns and recessions, and maintain a healthy balance sheet. In other words, companies with multidecade streaks of dividend raises are balanced -- which can be especially valuable to investors focused on preserving capital and supplementing income in retirement.', ""But investing isn't so much about where a company has been as it is about where it is going. ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM), Emerson Electric (NYSE: EMR), and McCormick (NYSE: MKC) have paid and raised their dividends for over 30 consecutive years, but they also have what it takes to keep growing their payouts for decades to come.

For 41 consecutive years, oil supermajor ExxonMobil has hiked its dividend, making the stock -- and its 3.4% forward yielding dividend -- an attractive choice for those looking to power their portfolios with prodigious passive income.', ""Tried-and-true dividend payers like ExxonMobil provide investors with the added reassurance that rewarding shareholders is embedded in the company's culture. Plus, it suggests that management has demonstrated prowess at navigating challenging times while continuing to hike the company's distribution."", 'This is particularly true for ExxonMobil, which is sensitive to the energy markets. While the price of oil has popped and plummeted at various times over the years, ExxonMobil has maintained its streak of raising the dividend.', 'Unlike some businesses that sacrifice their financial well-being to placate shareholders with a growing dividend, ExxonMobil finds itself in sound financial health. At the end of 2023, ExxonMobil had an extremely conservative ratio of net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA)\xa0of 0.8. Moreover, over the past three years, the company has averaged a payout ratio of 44%.', ""While there's no guarantee that ExxonMobil will have another 41 consecutive years of dividend growth, there's certainly cause to be optimistic about what lies ahead. For one, ExxonMobil has been working to achieve greater efficiencies since 2019 by consolidating its supply chain. So far, it has recognized $9.7 billion in cost savings, and it's targeting another $5.3 billion in cost savings by 2027. With a wider profit margin, ExxonMobil can continue returning capital to shareholders, pursue growth projects, and make acquisitions. On the company's recent fourth-quarter 2023 conference call, management spoke favorably about its recent Denbury and Pioneer Natural Resources acquisitions."", 'ExxonMobil is a leading option for those prospecting for a dividend stock in the oil patch.', ""Lee Samaha (Emerson Electric): Management's plans to transform Emerson and refocus on automation and associated markets appear to be progressing well. The integration of automated test and measurement company NI (closed in October) is ahead of schedule. Moreover, management raised its full-year 2024 sales and earnings guidance on its first-quarter earnings call in February."", 'After completing a deal to contribute its industrial software business and $6 billion in cash, Emerson Electric now owns a majority 55% stake in industrial software company Aspen Technology. The deal was completed in 2022, as was the agreement to sell a majority stake in its climate technologies business in 2022.', ""These moves were part of management's aim to focus on its core automation business (industrial software powers automation), and the next step was the $8.2 billion acquisition of NI. The acquired company's automated test and measurement solutions help customers (notably in semiconductors, consumer electronics, and the automotive industry) to reduce development times for new electronics and also cut costs."", 'The good news from the fiscal first-quarter earnings report (for the period ended Dec. 31, 2023) is management believes it will achieve $185 million in cost synergies from NI by the end of the third year, compared to the original estimation of $165 million by the fifth year. Moreover, there are signs of improvement in the semiconductor and consumer electronics markets.', ""While there are signs of weakness in automation spending in China, Emerson Electric's exposure to markets like liquefied natural gas, life sciences, metals, energy, and mining stands it in good stead in 2024."", 'Daniel Foelber (McCormick): Shares of the spice and seasoning company have gone practically nowhere in the last five years. And for good reason.', ""Earnings have flatlined. Domestic performance has been good, but McCormick has struggled to sustain growth outside the U.S. CEO Brendan Foley said the following on the company's Q4 2023 earnings call:"", ""And I would say broadly, our outlook for the Chinese consumer does remain cautious.

The upside can be attributed to positive pricing actions, product mix and cost savings from Comprehensive Continuous Improvement (“CCI”) and Global Operating Effectiveness (“GOE”) programs. This was partly countered by escalated cost inflation.Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses escalated year over year due to elevated brand marketing and investments in research and development, partly offset by cost savings from the abovementioned programs.At cc, the adjusted operating income rose 4%, mainly backed by sales growth and gross profit margin expansion, somewhat offset by increased SG&A expenses.', 'Consumer: Sales went up 1% to $921.5 million, with a negligible impact of currency movements.

ISRG is well poised for growth in the coming quarters, courtesy of its strength in robotics. The optimism, led by solid 2023 results and its progress on the artificial intelligence (AI) front, is expected to contribute further. Risks pertaining to procedure adoption and stiff competition persist.', 'Shares of this currently Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have risen 16.1% so far this year compared with the industry’s 6.8% increase. The S&P 500 Index has gained 9.3% during the same time frame.', 'Intuitive Surgical, the pioneer of robotic-assisted surgery and the renowned provider of minimally invasive care, has a market capitalization of $139.68 billion.

The da Vinci System is powered by robotic technology that has provided the company with solid exposure to medical mechatronics, robotics and AI for the healthcare space. The company gained FDA clearance for its da Vinci 5 fifth-generation multiport robotic system earlier this month. The system is believed to be the smoothest and most accurate device in ISRG’s portfolio.', 'On the fourth-quarter 2023 earnings call, the company stated that its installed base of the da Vinci system grew approximately 14% year over year. The utilization of clinical systems in the field, measured by procedures per system, was up 15% from the prior-year quarter’s level.', 'Progress on the AI Front: We are also positive about the growing adoption of minimally-invasive robot-assisted surgeries, self-automated home-based care, the use of information technology for quick and improved patient care, and the shift of the payment system to a value-based model. These indicate the high prevalence of AI in the MedTech space.', 'Per management, the rise of medical mechatronics, powerful computing, improved sensing, microfabrication and molecular imaging has enabled new solutions to old problems. AI has been enhancing Intuitive Surgical’s product portfolio with clinical applications, diagnostic support, operational efficiency, electronic health record systems, practice workflows and supply-chain management.', 'Strong Q4 Results: ISRG’s solid fourth-quarter 2023 results also buoy optimism. Revenues were primarily driven by continued growth in the company’s da Vinci procedure volume. Intuitive Surgical has also been raising the price of procedures to fight inflationary pressure that also aided sales growth.Meanwhile, the absence of any significant disruptions from COVID-19 during the fourth quarter seems promising. This may continue to boost procedure growth going forward.Although the gross margin contracted, the operating margin improved during the fourth quarter. The declining trend in operating expenses is likely to continue in 2024 as well.', 'Risk of Procedure Adoption: Procedure adoption growth takes time, as each procedure needs to gain credibility. Furthermore, the wide use of the company’s products requires the training of surgical teams.

According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.', 'Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.', ""This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements."", ""With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision."", 'Zacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR', 'In spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.', 'Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.', ""It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them."", 'On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.', 'Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.', ""Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements."", 'Is ISRG a Good Investment?', 'Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Intuitive Surgical, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $6.18.', ""Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term."", ""The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Intuitive Surgical.

However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.', ""Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether."", ' View our latest analysis for Analog Devices ', ""Over the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Executive Vice President of Global Operations & Technology, Vivek Jain, for US$3.1m worth of shares, at about US$184 per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even below the current price of US$189. When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. We note that the biggest single sale was 75% of Vivek Jain's holding."", ""Analog Devices insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year.

Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. It's great to see that Analog Devices insiders own 0.4% of the company, worth about US$350m. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders."", ""An insider hasn't bought Analog Devices stock in the last three months, but there was some selling.

Since the company went public in 2010, the shares have gained more than 10,000%. This meteoric rise helped place the company in the Magnificent Seven, a list of superstars that also includes the likes of Alphabet and Meta Platforms.', ""While most of the Magnificent Seven stocks have performed exceptionally well during the past three years, Tesla stock has actually lost nearly a third of its value. What went wrong with Tesla versus the rest of the Magnificent Seven? It's not that Tesla is a broken company, but that its business model depends on a different set of economics. Making cars is capital intensive, and over the long term, low margin. Tech companies like Alphabet and Meta, meanwhile, are asset light. These businesses generate high profit margins and can expand much more rapidly than the manufacturer of a physical product."", ""Right now, there's a company that doesn't get the attention it deserves even though it has a lot in common with the rest of the Magnificent Seven. Its market cap recently surpassed Tesla's, and I wouldn't be surprised to see it take Tesla's place in the Magnificent Seven as early as this year."", ""The company is Visa (NYSE: V), one of the most overlooked stocks in recent memory. Since is went public in 2007, the shares have risen in value by nearly 1,900%. Its performance has matched or surpassed that of some Magnificent Seven stocks. During the same time period, for example, the shares of Alphabet have gained only 1,300%. That's still a terrific performance, but many investors may be surprised to learn that Visa has bested some of the most well-known growth stocks on the planet."", ""To be fair, Magnificent Seven stocks like Tesla have grown much more quickly than Visa during some short periods. From 2020 through 2022, for instance, Tesla's market cap zoomed from around $50 billion to roughly $1.2 trillion. During the same time period, Visa's market cap barely budged, hovering just above the $400 billion mark."", ""Of course, there's a catch to Tesla's heroic performance: It hasn't always been a smooth ride. Right now, Tesla's market cap is less than Visa's after giving up most of its gains in recent years. Visa's market cap, meanwhile, continues to steadily climb. As we'll see, that's because Visa shares a lot more in common with other Magnificent Seven stocks than Tesla. It's a commonality that could help the company become the next $1 trillion stock."", ""When comparing Visa and Tesla with the rest of the Magnificent Seven, both companies stand out, but in different ways. Looking at each company's operating margin -- a measure of how profitable a company is -- Tesla's capital-intensive business model stands out. It costs the company a lot of money to produce vehicles, and mounting competition in the electric vehicle market means there's a limit to how much it can charge."", ""While Tesla manages an operating margin of only 9.2% -- the worst metric of any Magnificent Seven stock -- Visa actually tops the list with an operating margin of 67.3%. It's no fluke, either. Since 2010, none of the Magnificent Seven stocks listed below were ever able to beat Visa on this profitability metric."", ""Why does Visa have significantly higher operating margins than Tesla?

Both companies essentially run a bunch of software, which is then used by billions of users. The more people engage with Google or Facebook, the more valuable that platform becomes.

Visa operates with the same advantage.', ""More than 90% of Americans now own a debit or credit card. Roughly half of those cards run on Visa's payment network. There's good reason for this. Merchants don't want to accept a payment method used by a small group of shoppers. Shoppers, meanwhile, don't want to use a payment method accepted by only a small number of merchants. The natural result is industry concentration and high barriers to entry, limiting the competition. The more Visa grows, the more powerful it becomes.

SoFi started in student loans, giving it brand recognition with rising generations like Millennials and Gen Z."", ""The company obtained a bank charter in 2022, leading to surging net interest income (where banks tend to make their profits). This is the spread between the interest it earns on lending and what it pays on deposits. These profits have grown enough to offset all the company's overhead, making the business profitable in Q4. Net income should rise rapidly as SoFi's banking operations grow."", ""Such strong user growth, including a 44% year-over-year bump in Q4, shows SoFi's momentum isn't slowing much.

Also, the tokens can be utilized for payments through a wide array of devices, such as smartphones, wearables and smart appliances.', 'The ulterior motive of Visa tokens remains to enhance the payment outcomes for both merchants and consumers as well as infuse greater security within the online environments. For each transaction, the tokens protect the payment credential, lead to the seamless transfer of data, exert greater control and boost the processing of payments.

If you want to skip our discussion on momentum investing and the stock market outlook, head over to 5 Best Momentum ETFs To Buy.\xa0', ""Momentum investing refers to a strategy that increases portfolio exposure to stocks with robust performance while lowering exposure to those with weaker performance. This approach revolves around buying stocks with upward-trending prices and it has been historically backed by economic theory and empirical evidence. Typically targeting a 12-month timeframe, momentum strategies consistently record positive returns and add diversity to investment portfolios. According to BlackRock, the concept of momentum can be best grasped through behavioral finance theories. It stems from investors' behavioral tendencies, where individual actions reinforce market trends. Moreover, momentum rewards may offset the risk of short-term underperformance that some investors avoid. Despite occasional short-term setbacks, like those seen in 2001, 2009, and 2023, momentum consistently offers lasting benefits. Both risk-based and behavioral-based explanations play a role in its persistence, supporting the belief that momentum will remain a viable strategy in the future."", ""The renewed interest in Bitcoin and the stock market suggests that there might be a big bubble forming. While gold's record contradicts this notion to some extent, hinting at genuine caution driven by concerns over unsustainable fiscal spending, signs of things getting too heated are still there. According to a recent Bloomberg report, when looking closely at how stocks in the S&P 500 index are moving, there is a similar pattern to what happened during the big bubble in the late 1990s and early 2000s. People are doing really well by purchasing stocks that have been doing well lately and investing in companies with growing earnings, putting momentum trading and growth investing in the spotlight. These strategies have been doing better than value investing. The current market rally seems to follow these patterns, especially with momentum trading making a strong comeback. Notably, the emergence of the Magnificent Seven as the prevailing investing theme in early 2023 led to a challenging period for momentum trading. However, the current situation differs, with momentum gaining momentum once again."", 'In January 2024, Charles Schwab’s chief investment strategist Liz Ann Sonders participated in CNBC’s “Last Call” to discuss the markets. Sonders noted that when benchmarks like the S&P 500 and Dow hit record highs, it drives the momentum higher – at least for a while when the market ignores earnings and market fundamentals, focusing on performance only. Similarly, Jeremy Siegel, Wharton School professor, joined CNBC’s ‘Closing Bell’ on March 8, 2024. Siegel talked about momentum investing trending these days, but he also said that in his experience, trending stocks might see a slump of a few days before getting back on an upwards trajectory. However, by then, most momentum investors have already pulled out of their holdings. The investors then quickly hop onto the trades they just sold to reap the benefits of the ongoing market rally. He noted that individuals need ‘nerves of steel’ for momentum investing. Siegel observed that momentum followers usually do not care about a company’s valuation, its management, or its operational efficiency.

Both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite have soared to record levels. Make no mistake about it -- both indexes are rising on the heels of a euphoric narrative surrounding artificial intelligence (AI).', 'The thing with AI is that it can take many forms. From machine learning to big data analytics, AI has an evolving number of use cases. One of the prominent pillars of the AI revolution are semiconductor chips. Companies such as Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices are leading the charge in high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs) and data center services.', ""But outside of these two giants lay a number of other players in the chip space. Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) has also garnered a lot of attention, with many analysts on Wall Street calling for further upside. Given the rocket ship Nvidia is currently on, is now a good time to look for other opportunities in the chip space such as Broadcom? Let's take a look."", 'There are many aspects to the semiconductor industry. Nvidia and AMD are known for designing GPU chips that are used for a number of generative AI applications, such as accelerated computing or training large language models (LLMs).', 'On the other hand, Super Micro Computer is more of an IT architecture solution, helping Nvidia build storage clusters and server racks. Lastly, there are fabrication specialists like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, which helps Nvidia actually bring its chips to life through a specialized manufacturing process.', 'Broadcom is different. The company specializes in networking solutions -- an area that has applications in carrier networks, both cloud-based and on-premises data centers, as well as hardware including routers or mobile devices.', ""For the first quarter of fiscal 2024, ended Feb. 4, Broadcom increased its revenue 34% year over year to $11.9 billion. Before getting too excited, it's important to note that this year's growth includes contributions from VMware, which Broadcom acquired last year."", ""Broadcom's semiconductor business reported $7.4 billion in sales for the quarter, up a modest 4% annually. While this level of growth may be mundane for some, commentary from management likely encouraged investors. Within semiconductors, $2.3 billion was attributed to AI-driven sales -- up more than fourfold year over year."", 'Additionally, back in December management forecast that about a quarter of total semiconductor business would be attributed to artificial intelligence (AI) this year. But following the first-quarter report, management is now calling for 35% of semiconductor revenue to stem from AI -- totaling $10 billion this year.', 'The chart below benchmarks Broadcom against a cohort of businesses operating in the semiconductor realm on a price-to-sales (P/S) basis. At a P/S multiple of 15.2, Broadcom is in the middle of this peer group.', ""But like many of its semiconductor counterparts, shares of Broadcom have soared -- rising 110% over the last year. I think even though Broadcom's surface level growth may not catch your attention, it's clear that the secular demand fueling the broader semiconductor market is a bellwether for the company's largest revenue stream. This could lead to significant gains in the long run as the AI narrative takes shape."", ""It's this dynamic that has Wall Street raising price targets. Analysts from Benchmark, J.P. Morgan, Rosenblatt Securities, Citigroup, and Goldman Sachs all see upside in the range of 10% to even 25% from Broadcom's current trading levels."", ""It's nice to see such consensus among Wall Street institutions. But analyst upgrades are not reason enough to buy a stock.

However, we decided to study the company's mixed-bag of fundamentals to assess what this could mean for future share prices, as stock prices tend to be aligned with a company's long-term financial performance. Specifically, we decided to study Fox's  ROE in this article."", 'Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.', ' See our latest analysis for Fox ', 'Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Fox is:', '8.0% = US$849m ÷ US$11b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).', ""The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.08 in profit."", 'So far, we\'ve learned that ROE is a measure of a company\'s profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company\'s future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.', ""On the face of it, Fox's ROE is not much to talk about. A quick further study shows that the company's ROE doesn't compare favorably to the industry average of 12% either. For this reason, Fox's five year net income decline of 7.6% is not surprising given its lower ROE. We believe that there also might be other aspects that are negatively influencing the company's earnings prospects. Such as - low earnings retention or poor allocation of capital."", ""However, when we compared Fox's growth with the industry we found that while the company's earnings have been shrinking, the industry has seen an earnings growth of 13% in the same period. This is quite worrisome."", 'Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if Fox is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.', ""Fox's low three-year median payout ratio of 21% (implying that it retains the remaining 79% of its profits) comes as a surprise when you pair it with the shrinking earnings. This typically shouldn't be the case when a company is retaining most of its earnings. So there could be some other explanations in that regard. For example, the company's business may be deteriorating."", ""Moreover, Fox has been paying dividends for five years, which is a considerable amount of time, suggesting that management must have perceived that the shareholders prefer consistent dividends even though earnings have been shrinking. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 18%. However, Fox's ROE is predicted to rise to 13% despite there being no anticipated change in its payout ratio."", ""In total, we're a bit ambivalent about Fox's performance. Even though it appears to be retaining most of its profits, given the low ROE, investors may not be benefitting from all that reinvestment after all. The low earnings growth suggests our theory correct. With that said, we studied the latest analyst forecasts and found that while the company has shrunk its earnings in the past, analysts expect its earnings to grow in the future.

The Moody’s rating is particularly notable — and valuable — to RXO because the company’s rating at competing ratings agency S&P Global (NYSE: SPGI) is BB+, one notch below investment grade.', 'The report by Moody’s (NYSE: MCO) attributes the weaker outlook directly to the state of the freight market. “The negative outlook reflects Moody’s view that RXO’s credit metrics will be weak through the remainder of 2024 given the prolonged weakness in the freight transportation sector that will not improve materially until the second half of 2024,” the ratings agency writes.', '', 'A key metric for the ratings agencies is debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Moody’s said it believes that ratio at RXO will remain above 2.5X for the next 12 months.', 'In discussing the possibility of upgrading the Baa3 rating, the agency said it would need to see the 3PL “sustaining debt-to-EBITDA below 2.0X.”', 'But the rating could be downgraded if the 2.5X ratio is “sustained” for an unspecified period of time. A downgrade would put the Moody’s rating into non-investment-grade territory.', 'The report reflected the pessimism that would be expected given the lowering of the outlook to negative.', '', '“Moody’s believes that increasing freight volumes in the second half of 2024 will result in improvements in both leverage and liquidity given the highly variable cost structure of RXO,” it wrote. “However, any delay in a turnaround in the transport market will keep RXO’s metrics outside of its downgrade factors until early 2025 and limit the company’s ability to absorb negative developments at the current rating level.”', 'When RXO announced its earnings for the first quarter of 2023, it posted numbers that seemed to defy a weak freight market that was hitting the bottom line of both carriers and 3PLs. But its earnings in the fourth quarter of the year reflected the same challenging freight market as other companies facing tough market conditions.', 'RXO’s stock in the past 52 weeks is up 12.52%, though in the most recent three months it is down 13.2%. That has far outpaced peer company C.H. Robinson (NASDAQ: CHRW), which in the past year is down 22.4% and in the most recent three months is down 15.1%.', 'C.H. Robinson has an investment-grade BBB+ rating from S&P Global and a negative outlook. Moody’s rating of C.H. Robinson is Baa2 with a stable outlook. Baa2 is also investment grade but is considered a notch down from the BBB+ rating of S&P.', '(The investment-grade credit rating at C.H. Robinson, which has been in place for several years, is important enough to the company that it has been brought up by management on earnings calls with analysts several times in the recent past. In November, discussing third-quarter earnings at C.H. Robinson, CFO Mike Zechmeister said “our capital allocation strategy is grounded in maintaining investment grade credit rating which allows us to optimize our weighted average cost of capital.”)', 'Asked to comment on the report, a spokesperson for RXO said, “The entire industry continues to feel the effects of the prolonged soft freight market. RXO maintains an investment-grade rating with Moody’s and is well-positioned to continue to outperform and deliver rapid earnings growth when the market turns. “', 'The weak market has affected covenants with some of RXO’s lenders, Moody’s said. Its failure to reach net leverage covenants has limited its access to its $600 million revolving credit facility, Moody’s said, with access to only about $160 million. However, Moody’s also noted that RXO generally doesn’t rely on its revolver to fund operations.', 'Moody’s sees RXO’s management as tackling its issues but confronting macroeconomic issues that it can’t control. “There are several actions that management is taking that will improve profitability in 2024 that don’t rely on an improvement in market fundamentals,” Moody’s wrote. “However, a shrinking of excess carrier capacity and an improvement in brokerage volume will ultimately be necessary to return to growth in profitability.”', '', 'And in an unusual reference to the relatively brief history of RXO, Moody’s said in discussing the possibility of an upgrade of the 3PL’s credit rating: “Moody’s will be looking for the company to have a longer track record as a standalone entity and evidence in its ability to maintain performance through all points in the cycle.”', 'More articles by John Kingston', 'Flat sequential performance at 3PL RXO leaves Wall Street unimpressed', 'RXO exec at UBS conference says 3PL’s market share still rising', 'Vote on insurgent effort at Norfolk Southern set for May 9', 'The post RXO gets negative outlook from Moody’s but keeps investment-grade rating appeared first on FreightWaves.']"

It didn't take long for other streaming services to follow suit, including The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS) with its Disney+ streaming service."", ""There's a lot happening in the background with digital advertising and Disney just announced major upgrades. Moving forward, the company is looking to Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) and The Trade Desk (NASDAQ: TTD) to better monetize its streaming services. Here's what it means for investors."", ""Disney is a publisher -- it publishes video content on various platforms, including Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+. These platforms have slots available for advertising, and it's the company's goal to sell these slots for maximum revenue."", 'Back in 2021 -- before the launch of an ad-supported subscription tier for Disney+ -- Disney laid out a five-year advertising plan to automate its platform. The plan necessarily had incremental steps, and its announcement on March 20 of partnerships with Alphabet and The Trade Desk was just the latest step forward.', ""Disney is unlike many of its streaming service peers. The company has a massive first-party dataset because of how many subscribers it has and because of how long it's been in business -- many competing services are either much smaller or relatively new."", ""Therefore, Disney's consumer data is extremely valuable when trying to sell ad slots for maximum revenue."", ""For years now, Disney has worked with supply-side platforms (SSPs) such as Magnite (NASDAQ: MGNI) to sell its slots. However, Magnite works with many content publishers. Any advertiser that goes through Magnite bids on ad inventory that includes Disney but isn't limited to it. But advertisers and demand-side platforms (DSPs) such as The Trade Desk want a more direct connection to Disney's audience."", ""It's understandable: Disney+ has around 150 million subscribers worldwide -- the audience is massive on its own."", ""Alphabet's DV360 platform and The Trade Desk will now connect to Disney's DRAX (Disney's Real-Time Ad Exchange). DRAX Direct will let these two DSP adtech platforms peek into Disney's ad slots and audience information to allow for more targeted advertising."", ""This should be a win for everyone: Disney, Alphabet, and The Trade Desk. And if Disney's management is to be believed, it's surprisingly not a loss for Magnite."", ""For Disney, this is a win because it moves the company forward in its goal to maximize revenue. In theory, Alphabet's DV360 and The Trade Desk will direct more advertising dollars to the company's various streaming platforms. This will increase competition for the ad slots and consequently push rates up, which is good for Disney stock."", ""For Alphabet and The Trade Desk, both companies are trying to deliver better results for their advertising customers. The direct integration with Disney's DRAX could provide better data for targeting. It seems likely that both companies will have more satisfied customers because advertisements will reach target demographics within Disney's massive audience more precisely."", ""That said, Alphabet's market capitalization is $1.9 trillion compared to a market cap of just $42 billion for The Trade Desk. Therefore, this news has a better chance of moving the needle for the latter as a much smaller company."", ""Finally, Magnite stock has plunged on this news that Disney is working more directly with DSPs, but according to AdExchanger, management teams at Disney and The Trade Desk don't believe this is bad news for SSPs like Magnite. Disney's move to allow direct access to its DRAX platform can be seen as a way to increase demand without taking business away from Magnite."", ""Indeed, Disney reportedly works with around 30 DSPs, and the company only partnered with Alphabet's DV360 and The Trade Desk for direct access because these two have the most scale. Giving these biggest players more buying options is just a sensible business decision."", 'However, Alphabet and The Trade Desk can still do both: They can use some ad dollars when shopping for ad slots directly and leave some for transacting through SSPs. Moreover, there are still plenty of DSPs working with Disney as they always have, providing ongoing business for Magnite.', ""That said, I believe the two biggest winners here are Disney and The Trade Desk. Disney should see material improvements to its streaming business as it finds way to grow advertising demand. And The Trade Desk continues to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of advertising's multiyear migration from linear content to digital."", 'Where to invest $1,000 right now', 'When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

To be more specific, ROCE has fallen from 17% over the last five years.

It's worth keeping an eye on the company's earnings from here on to see if these investments do end up contributing to the bottom line."", ""Bringing it all together, while we're somewhat encouraged by Walt Disney's reinvestment in its own business, we're aware that returns are shrinking.

Shares of the entertainment giant were moving higher Monday after Disney got an analyst upgrade from Barclays. Analyst Kannan Venkateshwar raised his rating on Disney to overweight and lifted his share price target to $135.', 'Venkateshwar anticipates positive revisions to earnings estimates and believes the company is still in the early stages of its turnaround, which comes as returned CEO Bob Iger spent much of the last year restructuring the company to better take advantage of growth in the streaming era.', ""The upgrade, which helped push the stock to a new 52-week high, was the latest bullish signal for Disney and the stock price is now up roughly 50% from its 52-week low. However, there are several reasons to believe the stock can continue climbing from here. Let's look at three of them."", ""It's easy to talk about a turnaround, but for many companies, they don't materialize. That's not the case for Disney as the company is delivering real results that show the business is fundamentally improving."", ""There's no question that Disney has struggled with the transition from streaming. Its once-highly profitable linear media business has shrunk and the streaming side of the business has yet to pick up the slack. However, that seems to be changing."", ""Disney set a target several months ago of reporting a profit in its direct-to-consumer segment in the fourth quarter this year, which ends in September, and it's on track to do so. In the most recent quarter, it narrowed its loss in streaming from $984 million to $138 million, showing it's made significant strides toward streaming profits."", 'At the same time, the company is tapping new revenue streams, including the newly announced joint venture sports-focused streaming service with Warner Bros. Discovery, and Fox, and the launch of the flagship ESPN streaming service, which is now set for the fall of 2025.', ""Iger is also making moves to unlock value from Disney's legacy assets, including merging its Indian TV and streaming assets with Reliance Industries in an $8.5 billion deal."", ""For the past several months, Disney has been embroiled in a high-profile proxy fight with activist investors, the most prominent of which is Nelson Peltz's Trian Capital, though Blackwells Capital is also agitating for change. Disney has pushed back against Peltz, calling him disruptive and dismissing his ideas, but the attention from activists seems to be a positive for the stock as they are essentially arguing that Disney is undervalued based on the company's potential."", ""On the surface, that looks true. Disney is the best-known entertainment brand in the world. Its empire spans the globe and includes television (children's, sports, broadcast, and entertainment), multiple film studios, theme parks, cruise ships, and consumer products, and the company's struggles in recent years are clear."", ""The proxy fight raises the stakes for Iger's success and has forced the company to make the case that its turnaround strategy is the best for the business."", ""We'll soon learn the results from the shareholder meeting next week, but the attention from activist investors seems to be a positive for the stock, even if it's a thorn in the side of Disney management."", 'In addition to internal challenges with the business, Disney stock also fell in 2022 and 2023 because of fears of a recession. Disney is one of the biggest consumer discretionary businesses in the world, and consumers are less likely to visit one of its theme parks, buy its toys, or subscribe to one of its streaming services when times are tough.', 'However, forecasts of a recession in the U.S. have gone down substantially in recent months, and consumer sentiment is on the rise. That favors a continued recovery in Disney stock and support for its business.', 'Even as its media business has been challenged, its theme parks continue to see record traffic levels and have been able to pass along price increases. Disney also said it would nearly double capex spending on its theme parks over the next decade to $60 billion, a sign of increased confidence in that business.', ""A stronger economy also makes it more likely that the company's password crackdown on its streaming services will pay off as it adds new subscribers."", ""It's the start of a new bull market, and if the economy continues to expand, as looks increasingly likely, Disney should be a major beneficiary."", 'Where to invest $1,000 right now', 'When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of Exelon Corporation (NASDAQ:EXC)."", ""Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Exelon ', 'The formula for ROE is:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Exelon is:', '9.0% = US$2.3b ÷ US$26b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).', ""The 'return' is the yearly profit. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.09 in profit."", 'One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. You can see in the graphic below that Exelon has an ROE that is fairly close to the average for the Electric Utilities industry (9.0%).', ""So while the ROE is not exceptional, at least its acceptable. Although the ROE is similar to the industry, we should still perform further checks to see if the company's ROE is being boosted by high debt levels. If a company takes on too much debt, it is at higher risk of defaulting on interest payments. You can see the 2 risks we have identified for Exelon by visiting our risks dashboard for free  on our platform here."", 'Companies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.', ""Exelon clearly uses a high amount of debt to boost returns, as it has a debt to equity ratio of 1.71. Its ROE is quite low, even with the use of significant debt; that's not a good result, in our opinion. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it."", ""Return on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE."", ""Having said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward. So I think it may be worth checking this free report on analyst forecasts for the company."", 'Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

Carbon credit registries are seen as having the power to address many of these challenges and unlock the potential of the industry.', 'Roland Chai, Executive Vice President and Head of European Market Services, at Nasdaq said: “Global carbon markets are at a critical juncture. Truly scalable, trusted carbon markets can have a profound and lasting impact; the question is how we get there. By identifying the structural inefficiencies holding the market back, we can propose long-term solutions and help build global consensus. Addressing these barriers to scale can only come from a coordinated push from policymakers, market infrastructure providers, and participants across the financial services ecosystem.”', 'Demand for carbons credits is being constrained ', 'Demand for carbon credits arises from a broad range of players and objectives: 67% of corporates are driven by their ESG priorities, 50% of commercial banks purchase credits to decarbonize their investment portfolio, and 45% of investors are primarily seeking a financial return. There is also a clear desire for companies to expand their activity with more than half of corporates expressing a desire to double their exposure to the asset class.', ""However, despite the diversified demand for carbon credits, current market structures are stifling demand as well as the broader evolution of the market. Challenges in issuance, verification, trading, reporting, and retirement processes prevent 18% of all survey respondents from participating in today's voluntary carbon markets. A further 11% saw their volumes capped at less than half of their targets due to the same issues, with 40% constrained by at least a quarter."", 'Price transparency, inefficiencies, and market fragmentation', 'Nearly one-third (30%) of all respondents had low confidence in the pricing of carbon assets, leaving them unable to efficiently discover price or benchmark credits on the demand side. A lack of pricing transparency prevents brokers from trading and investors from holding the asset, leaving volumes capped at an artificially low level. This rate of low confidence rises to 66% in commercial banks, which constrains supply because financiers can’t accurately model risk or efficiently deploy capital.', 'The overall structure of voluntary carbon markets is characterized by inconsistency across credit types, with a heavy reliance on manual interactions and onerous data collection tools. This lack of standardization not only hampers trading but also limits the accessibility of local markets to foreign investors. The persistent need to perform manual due diligence and pricing for individual projects remains a significant barrier to scale: For example, 63% of respondents handled project listings via phone and email, but 79% would ideally like to manage such activities through a registry platform. Higher costs stemming from non-standardization and manual methods will inevitably drive commercial banks, corporates, and investors to seek out larger deals, cutting out smaller project owners, leading to decreased deal volumes and bottlenecked financing.', 'These challenges are further compounded by widespread fragmentation. Almost half of survey respondents across project owners, financiers, intermediaries, and investors are forced to interact with four or more registries. With little to no standardization or interoperability, this market inefficiency and fragmentation forces small “puddles of liquidity""—each isolated, devoid of scale, and requiring entirely bespoke, manual resources to interact.', 'How global carbon markets can achieve scale', 'A clear and proven source of transparency for all securities is exchange trading, which is the preferred market model for 58% of all respondents. Positively, pioneering exchange venues are receiving extensive support from governments, regulatory authorities, and banks, addressing some market constraints. However, much more work is needed to address post trade infrastructure.', 'Two-thirds of respondents (66%) see registries as the most important facilitator to improving markets and leading change. As the guarantors of quality in the voluntary carbon markets, registries have two core levers to drive confidence. The first is their traditional strength of project verification and methodology, where evolution continues. And second, as the key enabler of buyer confidence, is their ability to drive standardization in the products that they hold, in the data that describes them, and in the availability of that data across multiple platforms.', 'Through standardization they can enable automation and connectivity, which accelerates due diligence, increases price transparency, and reduces transaction costs. In doing so they can address the fundamental confidence issues that undermine the industry today and help to put the world’s voluntary carbon markets on a scalable growth path.', 'Magnus Haglind, Senior Vice President and Head of Marketplace Technology, at Nasdaq said: “Without a credible foundation for building trust, liquidity, and connectivity across voluntary carbon markets, they cannot scale. We must evolve the structure of the market, drawing on the institutional knowledge and framework of other global asset classes, to establish an institutional ecosystem around carbon credits. Registries lie at the heart of the solution, with the ability to embrace new technologies, set internationally consistent standards, and accelerate the market’s growth trajectory.', 'About Nasdaq Nasdaq (Nasdaq: NDAQ) is a leading global technology company serving corporate clients, investment managers, banks, brokers, and exchange operators as they navigate and interact with the global capital markets and the broader financial system.

If there is something concrete to announce Disney is likely to announce it at its D23 conference in early August.

The seven stocks include:', 'Nvidia ', 'Meta Platforms', 'Apple ', 'Microsoft ', 'Alphabet (Google)', 'Amazon ', 'Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA)', ""However, the Magnificent Seven has splintered in the early stages of 2024, with Apple and Tesla trading in the red despite the 10% gain in the S&P 500. Tesla's whopping 31% year-to-date loss has prompted some Wall Street analysts to call for its removal from the Magnificent Seven."", ""Tesla is working on several artificial intelligence (AI)-powered innovations like fully autonomous self-driving software and humanoid robots, but 85% of its revenue still comes from selling electric vehicles (EVs). The company sold a record-high 1.8 million cars last year, but it represented growth of 38% compared to its 2022 result, which was far below CEO Elon Musk's 50% target."", ""Growth will likely decelerate further in 2024. Tesla neglected to offer a forecast for vehicle deliveries, leaving some analysts to speculate the number could come in at around 2.2 million. That would represent an increase of 22%, and it's worth noting Musk also omitted his usual 50% average annual growth target in Tesla's most recent financial report."", 'Tesla slashed the price of its vehicles by an average of 25.1% throughout 2023 to spur demand in the wake of tough economic conditions, which sent its earnings per share (profit) sinking 23% to $3.12. That places its stock at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 54.7, which is still significantly more expensive than the 31.1 P/E of the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 index.', ""Therefore, there is a clear case for further downside in Tesla stock in the short term. The long term might be a different story, depending on the success of the company's other initiatives beyond EV sales."", 'The current Magnificent Seven companies have one thing in common: They are developing AI technologies. If Tesla were removed from the group, I think Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) would be a stellar replacement.', ""Oracle has emerged as a powerhouse in cloud computing, and it's building some of the best data center infrastructure for AI developers using Nvidia's industry-leading graphics processing units (GPUs). Chairman Larry Ellison says Oracle's GPU cluster technology inside its new Gen2 Cloud infrastructure allows businesses to train AI twice as fast and at half the cost of competing clouds."", ""As a result, Gen2 Cloud has already attracted billions of dollars in commitments from some of the AI industry's leading start-ups, from Cohere to Elon Musk's xAI, but Ellison says Oracle simply can't keep up with demand. The company has 40 AI bookings worth at least $1 billion each that haven't come online because they are waiting for additional infrastructure to be built."", ""During the fiscal 2024 second quarter (ended Nov. 30, 2023), Oracle said it had 66 active data center regions around the world. It's currently upgrading all of them to suit AI, and it's in the process of building 100 more, which is a substantial increase in the company's footprint."", ""Oracle reports Gen2 Cloud revenue under its Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) segment. OCI revenue soared 49% year over year to $1.8 billion during Q3, making it the company's fastest growing component. It still only accounted for 13.5% of Oracle's total revenue, but Ellison thinks OCI will grow by 50% for several years to come so it won't be long before it's a significant contributor."", ""Oracle's data center technology is also unique in that it's completely automated. That means there is very little cost difference between operating 10 locations and 100 locations, so it scales incredibly well and delivers strong profitability."", ""On that note, despite Oracle's total revenue growing by just 7% to $13.3 billion in Q3, the company's earnings per share jumped 25% to $0.85. Careful cost management was a contributor to the strong result, but there was also a significant increase in gross profit margin on the infrastructure side. The latter will continue to improve as more data centers come online."", ""Oracle stock is up 22.8% this year, which is more than twice the gain of the S&P 500 index, and it's sitting near an all-time high. The company will wrap up its fiscal 2024 full year on May 31, and Wall Street predicts its earnings per share will land at around $5.59."", ""That will place Oracle stock at a P/E ratio of 22.8, which is less than half the P/E ratio of Tesla. It's also a 27% discount to the Nasdaq-100 index, implying Oracle is much cheaper than most of its peers in big tech."", ""But it gets better. Oracle's bookings (which are expected to eventually convert to revenue) hit a record high of $80 billion during Q3, which was a 29% year-over-year increase. Bookings clearly grew substantially faster than the company's revenue during the quarter, which implies its top line could accelerate in the near future."", ""Given Oracle's relatively cheap valuation, its rapid growth in OCI, and its large bookings backlog, the company's stock might be poised for several years of steady upside. In fact, Oracle is worth $351 billion as of this writing and I think it could reach a $1 trillion valuation within the next decade."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Oracle right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Oracle, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Oracle wasn’t one of them.

YUM is benefiting from continued focus on off-premise channels, strategic investments in digital technology and robust same-store sales. However, high costs remain a concern for the company.This currently Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has an impressive long-term earnings growth rate of 11.1%. Its earnings and sales in 2024 are likely to witness improvements of 10% and 10.7% year over year, respectively.', 'The company continues to focus on deploying technologies to enhance the guest experience. It has been working toward accelerating its delivery services and the results have been positive so far. In 2023, the company reported digital sales of more than $30 billion (up 22% year over year), with a digital mix of more than 45%. Moreover, YUM reported solid adoption of Dragontail Systems. The initiative paves the path to tap the powers of Artificial Intelligence to streamline the end-to-end food preparation process, as well as improve delivery capabilities. The company expanded its global adoption of the platform to 28 markets across both KFC and Pizza Hut brands.Despite the challenging macro environment, the company impressed investors with robust same-store sales growth in fourth-quarter 2023. It reported consolidated same-store sales growth of 1% year over year. The upside was primarily backed by a rise in dine-in traffic, digital initiatives and strategic third-party partnerships. During the quarter, same-store sales at Taco Bell and KFC rose 3% and 2% year over year, respectively. The company has been benefiting from robust growth in emerging markets. Given the emphasis on consumer value proposition, expanded digital access and franchise partners, management anticipates this momentum to continue in the upcoming periods.On the other hand, Yum! Brands aims to revamp its financial profile. This, in turn, will improve the efficiency of its organization and cost structure globally. It believes that a “slimmer Yum Brands” would lead to efficiency gains. Considering its existing footprint of more than 58,000 restaurants worldwide, Yum! Brands believes it can roughly triple its current global presence over the long term and consolidate franchisees in Latin America and the Caribbean to drive growth.In 2024, significant milestones are on the horizon as the company surpasses 30,000 restaurants at KFC, exceeds 20,000 locations at Pizza Hut and achieves a global presence of more than 60,000 establishments for Yum! Brands.', 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', 'An increase in the cost of employee wages, benefits and insurance, and other operating costs such as rent and energy costs, puts significant pressure on margins.

I'm just curious how you're thinking about that dynamic as you kind of pursue these twin revenue and margin targets. And would you be willing, Brian, to reduce share if that meant looking ahead to protect your margins?"", ""BRIAN NEWMAN: Josh, it's a great question. We have fairly balanced the algorithm. Right now, we're calling in the domestic business. 3% volume growth over the next three years."", ""And 2.5% what we call RRP revenue per piece growth, which generates that 5 plus percent revenue. We always evaluate the trades here. Net, net I want to ensure though better and bolder means returning to growth.

Is it a bit of both?"", ""BRIAN NEWMAN: Yes, Josh. The answer is yes. It's both of those. We have a mutual beneficial relationship with Amazon. We are not their supply chain. We deliver a large amount of packages for them."", ""But over the past few years, Josh, we've basically glided down the business with Amazon to a place where now we think it's the right volume in the network. So, at this point, we've reached somewhat of an equilibrium. And we feel like there's a glide path forward with Amazon finding those right packages in the market"", ""JOSH LIPTON: Brian, you reached that new labor deal, new union labor deal last year. And I'm curious given just how much wages went up, Brian, did that deal kind of accelerate your decision to bring more AI in-house, more robotics in-house?"", ""BRIAN NEWMAN: Well, for sure. Look, the labor deal, we reached, Josh, was a five-year deal, in aggregate over the five years. It's an inflation of 3.3%. That's a very good number in aggregate."", ""The challenge we had was the first year of the labor deal was worth about 46% of the contract. So the good news is we're going to go from, and when we anniversary the first year of the contract in August, our labor inflation, wage inflation will go down to less than 2%. What that does for us is allow us to balance the RRP, the pricing, and the cost per piece management to reflect positive margins, which then drives cash, et-cetera."", ""In terms of your question on technology, absolutely, we're trying to be more efficient and effective in everything we do. AI allows us to go faster. It also allows us to reduce the amount of reliance on labor in terms of efficiency."", ""JOSH LIPTON: You're also targeting capital spending US here, Brian. It looks like 24, 26, about 5.5% of total revenue. Any color of what and where you're spending on, Brian?"", ""BRIAN NEWMAN: Yeah, Josh, the CapEx over the next three years will be about 5.5% of our revenue. So 17 to $18 billion. Very consistent with what we've been spending the last couple of years."", ""The focus of that, the single biggest project is something called network of the future.

Terrible situation as far as our business and your question.

This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of PPL Corporation (NYSE:PPL)."", ""Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders."", ' Check out our latest analysis for PPL ', 'ROE can be calculated by using the formula:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for PPL is:', '5.3% = US$740m ÷ US$14b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).', ""The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.05 in profit."", ""By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. As shown in the graphic below, PPL has a lower ROE than the average (9.0%) in the Electric Utilities industry classification."", ""Unfortunately, that's sub-optimal. That being said, a low ROE is not always a bad thing, especially if the company has low leverage as this still leaves room for improvement if the company were to take on more debt. A high debt company having a low ROE is a different story altogether and a risky investment in our books.  Our risks dashboard should have the 3 risks we have identified for PPL."", ""Companies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same."", ""It's worth noting the high use of debt by PPL, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 1.12. The combination of a rather low ROE and significant use of debt is not particularly appealing. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time."", 'Return on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.', 'But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too.

Discover’s share, 4% last year, has dipped from 6% in 2011.', 'In an effort to reverse the decline, Capital One plans to quickly add scale to Discover’s networks, shifting debit and credit volumes to those networks and investing to build brand awareness and expand merchant acceptance, Capital One said in its application.', 'Capital One “has the resources to make these investments, but Discover does not,” Capital One asserts in its application.', 'The savings Capital One expects to retain by tapping the closed-loop network will allow Capital One “to invest in and grow its banking product portfolio, including by expanding and making more attractive its consumer-friendly checking and credit card portfolios to the benefit of consumers,” Capital One said.', 'The lender also noted plans to invest with the aim of improving the payments network’s technology stack and risk management and compliance efforts. By seeking to reduce transaction declines and fraud, and improve payment and fraud dispute resolution processes, Discover’s network will be better positioned to compete with Visa, Mastercard and Amex, Capital One said.', 'Given possible antitrust concerns, the proposed combination is likely to draw the attention of the Department of Justice. In its application, Capital One contended that the “intensely competitive” credit card industry is diverse and dynamic. The changing nature of issuers’ product offerings and the ease with which consumers can add or switch between credit card providers “prevent the exercise of market power or successful coordinated anticompetitive behavior in any segment of the industry,” Capital One argued.\xa0', 'The company also sought to make that argument with respect to banking competition, which it faces from the likes of JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo, and from fintechs and neobanks, including Chime, Ally and Varo, Capital One said.\xa0', 'With more scale and profitability, the combined company and bank can better compete against the biggest banks and larger regional banks, Capital One said. The lender also noted Discover customers would immediately gain access to Capital One’s more than 300 branch and café locations.', 'The deal would put Capital One ahead of JPMorgan as the largest credit card issuer in the U.S. Still, Capital One’s and Discover’s combined shares of credit card purchase volume — 13.6% — and outstanding balances — 19% — would be “well within safe harbor levels,” Capital One contended.\xa0', 'A number of lawmakers have called on regulators to block the deal, and more than two dozen advocacy organizations have urged regulators to ensure a thorough and transparent review of the merger. In a letter last week to bank regulators, advocates argued the tie-up would increase the combined firm’s market power, potentially disadvantaging depositors, customers, merchants and communities.', 'Marketplace push-back over the deal has increased, and approval could take longer than Capital One has identified, noted David Schiff, head of retail and consumer banking at consulting company West Monroe.', 'In making the case to regulators, Schiff expects Capital One to play up the company’s ability to elevate the smallest of the card networks and help Discover overcome its regulatory issues.\xa0', 'To that end, Capital One also flagged the risk and compliance work it expects to undertake with Discover, given the recent regulatory scrutiny Discover has faced.\xa0', '“Capital One believes it will need to materially strengthen and enhance Discover’s existing risk management functions, and in particular compliance, to comply with both Capital One’s internal standards and those of its regulators,” the acquiring company said in its application. Those improvements “will include extensive work to address outstanding remediation under the two orders and possible future supervisory findings.”', 'Additionally, Capital One pledged to expand its risk management capabilities by establishing “dedicated teams” to oversee risk management for Discover’s debit and credit networks.', 'This story was originally published on Banking Dive.

Thus, companies pursuing this venture are classified as AI robotics stocks, due to contributing to the integration of the technologies.', 'For investors, determining if one of these experimental applications of AI presents a successful investment opportunity comes from two factors.

Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value.

Specifically, it relates to the manner in which a sample is sufficiently enriched with ctDNA so that it can be detected, if present, with high sensitivity and specificity. The company filed the patent in 2016 at the advent of MRD development, envisioning the potential role of tumor-derived cell-free DNA in the expanding field of cancer diagnostics.', 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', 'The Precise MRD assay leverages MYGN’s existing technology, laboratory systems and processes, infrastructure and intellectual property and builds upon its FDA-approved MyChoice companion diagnostic and FirstGene platforms.

Revenues were primarily driven by continued growth in the company’s da Vinci procedure volume. Intuitive Surgical has also been raising the price of procedures to fight inflationary pressure that also aided sales growth.Meanwhile, the absence of any significant disruptions from COVID-19 during the fourth quarter seems promising. This may continue to boost procedure growth going forward.Although the gross margin contracted, the operating margin improved during the fourth quarter. The declining trend in operating expenses is likely to continue in 2024 as well.', 'Risk of Procedure Adoption: Procedure adoption growth takes time, as each procedure needs to gain credibility.

Yet Vertiv’s portfolio of power, cooling, and IT infrastructure solutions and services could grow steadily for decades because AI and other technological advancements require practically endless, always-available data.', 'Vertiv’s job is to keep the computing power needed to drive the modern, digitally connected economy running as smoothly as possible around the clock.', 'VRT provides investors the\xa0opportunity\xa0to benefit from the AI-super cycle without picking artificial intelligence winners since Vertiv is a high-tech picks and shovels-type AI investment.', 'The rapid rise of cloud computing, AI, cryptocurrencies, and cutting-edge technologies yet to come all require an increasingly enormous amount of data and energy. Vertiv’s pitch to potential customers and Wall Street is straightforward and compelling: “The world depends on the data we power and cool.”', 'Vertiv’s portfolio of power, cooling, and IT infrastructure solutions and services operates across data centers, communication networks, commercial and industrial facilities, and beyond. Vertiv’s product categories include critical power, thermal management, racks & enclosures, and monitoring & management.', ""The Ohio-based firm's services range from DC power and electrical reliability to safety and compliance. Vertiv’s clients include enterprises and small and medium-sized businesses across healthcare, telecom, tech, retail, education, and beyond."", 'Vertiv expects the push for greater energy efficiency across data centers will boost its liquid cooling technologies since more traditional air-cooling systems cannot as effectively cool new high-density racks jam-packed with CPUs and GPUs.', 'Vertiv is expanding inside the pre-fabricated/modular data industry, as data centers proliferate globally. Meanwhile, its micro data centers offer all-in-one solutions for power, cooling, monitoring, and racks.', 'VRT in December agreed to acquire liquid cooling infrastructure solutions firm CoolTera, bolstering its ability to support the deployment of AI at scale. Plus, Vertiv partnered with AI chip superstar Nvidia ((NVDA) to help solve future data center efficiency and cooling challenges.', 'The firm’s nearly two dozen global manufacturing plants are helping it ramp up production. Vertiv said last year that its “existing footprint was built with the idea that future growth would need to be accommodated.”', 'Vertiv, which went public via a SPAC in early 2020, posted 14% revenue growth during its first two full years. VRT grew its revenue by 21% in fiscal 2023.', ""The company's organic orders climbed by 23% in Q4 and it closed the year with a record backlog of $5.5 billion. CEO Giordano Albertazzi sees “tremendous opportunity ahead as the data center needs of AI drive additional market demand.”"", 'Vertiv is projected to post 11% revenue growth in fiscal 2024 and nearly 10% higher sales in FY25 to climb from $6.86 billion last year to $8.34 billion next year.', 'VRT’s adjusted earnings are projected to soar by 33% and 24%, respectively. Vertiv is also boosting its adjusted free cash flow, which helps support the acceleration of its long-term capital deployment framework.', 'Vertiv’s post-Q4 release EPS revisions help it land a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and mark the continuation of its improving bottom line outlook over the last year.', 'VRT’s FY24 consensus EPS estimate has jumped 80% over the last year from $1.31 a share to its current $2.35 per share, while its FY25 figure has soared by 112% ($1.38 to $2.92 per share).', 'Vertiv shares have surged by 325% during the last three years to outpace the S&P 500’s 31% and the Zacks Technology sector’s 35%. VRT has skyrocketed roughly 530% during the last 12 months to double Nvidia and blow away Tech 48%.', 'Vertiv trades solidly above its 21-day and 50-day moving averages, driven by a 72% YTD climb. VRT might be overheated in terms of RSI levels, and some investors might want to wait for a pullback.', 'That said, playing the market-timing game is not easy and can prevent long-term investors from buying great stocks at prices that could look like steals down the road even if they prove a tad pricey in the near term.', 'Vertiv trades at a discount to its Computers - IT Services industry at 33.2X forward 12-month earnings vs. 36.1X. That is solid bang for your buck since VRT has climbed 325% in the last three years vs. its industry’s 12% run.', 'Vertiv’s PEG ratio, which factors in its longer-term earnings growth outlook, sits at 1.2. This represents a 60% discount vs. its industry, 36% value vs. the Zacks Tech sector, and an 8% discount to Nvidia.', 'Wall Street is bullish on Vertiv, with nine of the 10 brokerage recommendations Zacks has at “Strong Buys.” VRT appears worth considering as a way to gain exposure to the never-ending growth of data and, of course, the AI age.', 'JinkoSolar Holding Co., Ltd.\xa0is one of the largest solar panel manufacturers in the world. JinkoSolar shares have tumbled alongside most of the solar industry over the last few years amid higher interest rates, tough-to-compete-against periods of expansion, and other headwinds.', 'JKS fell way short of our Q4 earnings estimate on March 20 and provided disappointing guidance.', 'JinkoSolar makes various types of solar panels for different aspects of the market. The company sells residential rooftop solar panels, as well as high-performance systems for localized industrial and commercial energy production.', 'JinkoSolar benefited greatly from the Chinese government’s efforts to boost solar panel production in the country. JinkoSolar’s vertically integrated manufacturing process has helped it lower the costs of producing complicated, high-tech PV panels.', 'Solar went on a tear during Covid, spurred by government incentives, lower rates, and more. JKS expanded greatly since 2019, soaring from roughly $4.27 billion in sales to around $16.62 billion in fiscal 2023.', 'Still, JKS posted adjusted fourth earnings of $1.21 a share, missing our estimate by 47%. Worse yet, JinkoSolar’s downbeat guidance forced analysts to slash their earnings outlooks.', 'JinkoSolar’s first quarter consensus plummeted from +$2.10 a share before its March 20 release to a loss of -$0.44 per share. JinkoSolar’s FY24 consensus EPS estimate tumbled by 47%, with its FY25 outlook 30% lower.', 'JinkoSolar’s downward earnings revisions help it land a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) right now. “As module prices fell more than expected in the fourth quarter and nearly 50% of our modules were sold to the Chinese market at lower prices, gross margin for the fourth quarter decreased significantly to 12.5% from 19.3% in the third quarter,” CEO Xiande Li said in prepared remarks.', 'JinkoSolar could be a long-term winner. The solar industry might be nearing a bottom because interest rates have likely peaked. Plus, solar is still projected to grow alongside the wider energy transition.', 'That said, JinkoSolar stock only performed well during the Covid boom. The stock is down 22% over the last 10 years. All in, it might be best for investors to stay away from JKS until it proves to Wall Street that a turnaround is on the horizon.', 'In the Global Week Ahead, inflation signals from the United States, Australia and Japan are a key focus, for bond and stock traders alike.', 'This follows a deluge of central bank meetings last week. Ones that included a historic Bank of Japan (BoJ) rate hike.', ""This week, Sweden's Riksbank could add to drama around who cuts rates. Now that Switzerland has kicked off easing among big central banks."", ""Finally, Europe's IPO wheels are turning."", '(1) This Week, Two of the Biggest European IPO’s in the Last 12 Months Happen. ', ""The launch of two of the biggest European initial public offerings (IPOs) of the last 12 months is in traders' sights."", 'The market wants some equity market success to unlock a vital cog in the financial system and spur more dealmaking.', ""CVC's perfume retailer Douglas raised around 850 million euros ($922.93 million). It priced its shares at bottom of an indicated range. They plummeted more than 12% on their debut on Thursday."", 'But skincare company Galderma (GALD), opens new tab priced its 2.3 billion swiss franc ($2.56 billion) IPO at the top of an indicated price range and soared on its first day trading Friday.', 'A good performance might help other companies follow suit, including CVC itself.', 'That should help release pressure building on private equity firms needing to exit investments, return capital and deploy funds.', '(2) On Friday, watch out for the U.S. Personal Consumption Expenditure Price Index (PCE). The Fed’s preferred inflation measure lands.', 'A March 29th U.S. inflation reading is critical for markets after the Federal Reserve stuck with a view for rate cuts this year, even with a stronger economic outlook.', ""The February Personal Consumption Expenditures Price index is expected to show a +0.4% monthly increase, according to a Reuters poll. January's PCE index rose +0.3%, while the annual increase in inflation was the smallest in three years."", 'The Fed just upgraded its view on inflation - projecting that the PCE index excluding food and energy would rise at a +2.6% annual rate by year-end, compared with +2.4% in its December projections. It also lifted 2024 economic growth estimates.', 'Any suggestion in the data that inflation is picking up could dash hopes that Fed easing will start soon, with a go-slow approach likely to continue.', '(3) What Other Moves Come from the World’s Central Banks? ', 'Traders love a bit of excitement, and there has been plenty lately - a BOJ rate hike and a surprise Swiss cut.', ""The Swiss move, plus the Bank of England (BoE)'s hint at easing, means it is game on for June rate cuts from other big central banks."", 'Data and central-bank speak in coming days will be watched closely.', 'The question is the U.S. Fed. It is sticking with a plan for three rate cuts for now, but strong data and sticky inflation could derail that.', 'Where does that leave investors? They favor government bonds in Europe and selling currencies where rate differentials with the Fed are opening up.', ""No surprise that the Swiss franc slumped after Thursday's SNB cut and even the buoyant U.K. pound took a knock from a dovish BoE."", '(4) In Asia-Pacific, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) Sets Monetary Policy. ', 'Just as the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) thought inflation was finally coming to heel and the time was ripe to tone down its tightening bias, blowout employment figures have delivered a nasty shock.', ""The RBA will likely watch Wednesday's inflation print for any upside surprises, given February's data will capture more price changes for a range of services - which has been declining at a slower pace than for goods."", 'Across Asia, any further easing of inflation in Singapore and neighboring Malaysia is unlikely to significantly sway policymakers, who are expected to keep monetary policy unchanged for some time.', ""Tokyo's consumer price figures caps off a data-light week for Japan on Friday. That may be met with less excitement given that the Bank of Japan, has finally now hiked rates for the first time in 17 years."", '(5) In Europe on Wednesday, Sweden’s Central Bank, the Riksbank, Sets Policy. ', ""Sweden's central bank, the world's oldest, is expected to keep its key rate unchanged on March 27th. But it could announce that a cut, the first since it began tightening policy in spring 2022, is nearing."", ""Headline inflation has slowed to near the Riksbank's 2% target and growth has ground to a halt as households and businesses struggle with rates at over 15 year-highs."", 'In February, the central bank said rates had peaked and that it could even start to ease policy in the first half of 2024.', 'Rate-setters remain worried, however, about the risks of setbacks - particularly the chance of a weaker Swedish crown if the Riksbank gets out of step with the ECB and U.S. Federal Reserve.', 'As a result, markets see a first rate cut in May or June.', '(1) ARM Holdings PLC Sponsored ADR: This is a $133 stock in the Technology Services industry.

GE Vernova will begin trading on April 1, while the rest of the business, to be called GE Aerospace, will retain the GE ticker. In advance of that event, it would be a good idea to run through a few items that investors might find helpful.', 'The record date for the spinoff is March 19; holders of GE stock will receive one share of GE Vernova for every four shares they hold in GE. For example, if you hold 100 shares in GE, you will receive 25 in GE Vernova. Naturally, the 100 GE shares you will still hold (which will now be GE Aerospace) will drop in value on April 2 to reflect that the businesses becoming GE Verona are no longer part of the parent company.', ""However, that's not the whole story of the spinoff because investors can get approximations of how the market values each business before April 2. This is because there will be different trading markets for GE and GE Vernova from March 27 and continuing through April 1."", '""When issued"" trading in GE Vernova will run from March 27 through April 1 under the symbol ""GEV WI.""', 'GE Vernova will begin regular trading on April 2 under the ticker ""GEV.""', 'GE will trade in a ""regular way"" under the ticker ""GE"" and holders of those shares will have the right to receive GE Vernova stock through April 1.', 'GE shares will trade as GE Aerospace from March 27 through April 1 under the symbol ""GE WI,"" but those shares will not include the right to receive GE Vernova stock.', 'While all of this may sound complicated, the key takeaway is that by monitoring the market valuations on GEV WI from March 27, investors will be able to see how the market is valuing GE Vernova. Similarly, monitoring GE WI will tell you how the market values GE Aerospace on its own. In this way, retail investors can prepare for the ""regular way"" listings on April 2.', ""Ge Vernova will own GE's power (primarily a gas turbine equipment and services business), renewable energy (onshore wind and offshore wind), and electrification (electrification systems and software) segments."", ""I've covered this business at more length in a previous article outlining the case for a $27.3 billion valuation for the GE Vernova spinoff and provided an estimated value for GE Aerospace previously, too."", ""My GE Vernova estimate may prove conservative because it has plenty of growth potential.

That backlog was $6 billion at the start of 2023, and down to $4 billion by the end of it."", ""In recent years, the offshore wind industry has suffered as wind power companies, including Siemens Energy and Vestas, have struggled with soaring raw material costs and supply chain difficulties. At the same time, they've been working through contracts they inked in far less inflationary times."", ""As such, GE's management is focused on working through the backlog while improving the profit margin by being highly selective about new contracts. It's a strategy that worked in its onshore wind business, which turned profitable in the third quarter of 2023."", ""GE Vernova's management believes its free cash flow (FCF) will grow. These figures follow on from the dramatic increase in earnings outlined above. For reference, a mature industrial company with top-line growth in the low single-digit percentages is often considered fairly valued at around 20 times FCF."", 'GE Vernova', '2022', '2023', '2024 (Estimate)', '2025 (Estimate)', 'Free cash flow', '($600 million)', '$100 million', '$700 million to $1.1 billion', '$1.2 billion to $1.8 billion', 'Data source: GE Vernova presentations.', ""Still, with a dramatic increase in offshore wind's profitability to come, it will be a few years before GE Vernova's growth rate settles down, and investors may be willing to pay a significant premium to the 20 times estimated FCF in 2024 to reflect that prospect.

The 13th might be the most important yet.', 'As Boeing begins its search for a new CEO, the company is facing its worst-ever crisis. It has struggled through more than five years of safety incidents and bad news that created unprecedented doubt about the quality of its aircraft.', 'It faces multiple federal investigations into its commercial plane practices, as well as an outcry from the airline customers that buy its planes.', 'In addition to two fatal crashes that cost 346 lives, the company has run up more than $31 billion in losses since 2019, with no end to the red ink in sight. It has grabbed unwanted attention with incidents like a blown-out door plug that left a gaping hole in an Alaska Airlines flight in January.', 'Those incidents were followed by Monday’s decision by the current CEO, Dave Calhoun, to step down by the end of the year, leaving the company to search for a new chief executive.', 'When picking a new CEO, the company likely has two pools of choices.', 'It can go with someone who has an engineering background, as was the background of many of the past CEOs who led the company in its heyday. Four of the company’s first five CEOs were engineers by training, running the company for 46 of the first 70 years of Boeing’s existence.', 'Or it can once again pick a leader like outgoing CEO Calhoun, who has a financial background and an undergraduate degree in accounting. Critics have said an increased focus on financial results over engineering excellence over the last 25 years has led to the company’s current problems.', 'Some say it’s crucial that Boeing get back to its engineering roots in its next CEO.', '“To fix Boeing’s issues the company needs a strong engineering lead as its head coupled to a governance model which prioritizes safety and quality,” said Sir Tim Clark, president of Emirates Airlines, which ordered 373 planes from Boeing since 2009, but only two of those since 2019. “Whether, yet again, this changing of the guard will resolve Boeing’s issues only time will tell, but time, unfortunately, is not on their side.”', 'In an interview with CNBC on Monday morning, Calhoun was asked about what he wants to see in his successor.', '“I want somebody who knows how to handle a big, long, long-cycle business like ours,” Calhoun said. “It’s not just the production of the airplane. It’s the development of the next airplane. It will be a $50 billion investment. I would like somebody who clearly has the experience inside our industry.”', 'Calhoun did not give any potential names, or say whether Boeing is looking more at internal or outside candidates. But a number of potential choices are surfacing, according to Richard Aboulafia, managing director at AeroDynamic Advisory.', 'Pat Shanahan is the “top of the list,” according to Aboulafia. A former Boeing executive for 31 years, he became known as “Mr. Fix It” at the company for dealing with various problems during his tenure.', 'He was deputy secretary of the US Department of Defense under President Donald Trump and was nominated to be secretary, serving nearly six months in an acting capacity in 2019. His name was withdrawn before his confirmation due to media reports involving domestic incidents involving violent actions by his son and ex-wife.', 'He has held a number of different posts in the years since, and in September became CEO of Boeing’s major supplier, Spirit AeroSystems, which makes the fuselages for the Boeing 737 Max among other items.', 'Spirit AeroSystems faces its own safety and quality issues, which have caused problems for Boeing, forcing temporary halts of production on some jets. But most of those problems occurred before Shanahan took the CEO job there.', 'Boeing is in talks to reacquire Spirit, the companies confirmed, which would be something of a homecoming. Spirit was part of Boeing before the larger company spun it off in 2005.', 'If Boeing acquires Spirit, it’s possible Shanahan would be tapped as Boeing’s next CEO as part of the merger.', 'Most of the companies where candidates mentioned in this story now work declined to comment when questioned by CNN or did not respond to a request for comment. Spirit was the only one to comment, but it did not address the possibility of Shanahan becoming Boeing CEO.', '“Mr. Shanahan remains solely focused on driving a zero-defects culture across all aspects of Spirit AeroSystems,” said Joe Buccino, a Spirit spokesperson.', 'Larry Culp has already turned around one major American industrial icon, becoming  CEO of General Electric in 2018 and spinning off many of the company’s parts. One of the parts that remains is GE Aerospace, which makes engines used on Boeing jets and other planes.', 'Under its longtime CEO Jack Welch, GE grew to corporate success with a strong focus on cutting costs to improve financial performance. Three of the last four Boeing CEOs, including Calhoun, spent part of their careers at GE. Some Boeing critics say those CEOs’ emphasis on the GE playbook of cost cutting, profitability and shareholders rewards rather than quality was the source of much of Boeing’s current problems.', 'But Culp has moved GE away from the Jack Welch era, a time when Calhoun and some of the other earlier Boeing CEOs cut their teeth, said Aboulafia.', 'Culp joined GE as an outsider in 2018 after spending 24 years at Danaher Corp., moving up the ranks to CEO from 2000 to 2014. Many industrial analysts believe Danaher, during Culp’s tenure, outperformed GE and many other manufacturing and industrial companies during that time. Culp has an undergraduate degree in economics and an MBA from Harvard, a business background more than an engineering background.', '“I know he’s done incredibly well at Danaher and GE. This is a new GE. Culp is being very open to being transformative,” he said. “They needed to escape from that Jack Welch culture. What looks like a negative is actually a positive.”', 'GE did not comment when asked about whether Culp would be interested in the Boeing job.', 'Kathy Warden has had a lot of success as CEO of Northrop Grumman since she began in the company’s top job at the start of 2019.', 'The military contractor’s revenues have grown 30% during that period. Its stock price has nearly doubled under her tenure. And while Northrop doesn’t make commercial jets, Boeing is also a major defense contractor in addition to a commercial aircraft maker. Warden has an MBA and worked at GE for a decade and two other industrial companies before joining Northrop.', '“That’s a wonderful idea,” Aboulafia said. “I don’t now how you’d convince her to make that leap, but she’d be perfect.”', 'One reason that the Boeing board might be interested in her, besides her success, is what’s known as the “glass cliff” phenomenon, in which companies, especially those in male dominated fields like tech or manufacturing, are more open to looking at women CEOs when they’re in trouble.', 'Think of General Motors picking Mary Barra to be the first woman to run a major global automaker just before a major crisis — the ignition switch problem that killed more than 100 drivers and passengers and cost the company billions — became public. Sometimes the new woman CEO is not as successful as Barra in steering the company through the crisis, and thus a woman who has shattered the “glass ceiling” finds herself pushed off the “glass cliff.”', 'Greg Smith left his post as CFO of Boeing soon after the company’s board granted a five-year waiver of the normal retirement age limit of 65 to Calhoun in 2021. Smith, who was 54 at the time, clearly saw his path to the CEO job had been blocked.', 'Since he left, he joined a number of corporate boards, most notably American Airlines, where he serves as chairman.', 'RIght now, one of Boeing’s biggest problems is relations with its airline customers, many of whom are frustrated with repeated missed deadlines to deliver new jets, groundings by regulators and for the quality of the jets it is delivering.', 'One way for the Boeing board to signal it is listening to those customer concerns would be to name someone who now is on the airlines’ side of that crucial relationship but who also has experience with Boeing. That describes Smith. But picking him would also mean another CEO with a finance background rather than an engineering background.', 'Aboulafia suggested there could be a number of executives who have left Boeing who might be good fits if they could come back, although their age could be an issue.', 'At the top of that list is Alan Mulally. He was a long-time veteran of the Boeing Commercial Airplane unit, rising to be its CEO. He left Boeing in 2006 to become CEO of Ford. At the time, Ford was struggling more than the other Detroit automakers, GM and DaimlerChrysler, as Chrysler was then known.', 'Mulally helped turn around the company, which allowed Ford to be the only Detroit automaker to avoid a federal bailout and bankruptcy, as GM and Chrysler experienced three years later. He retired from Ford in 2014 with a nest egg worth nearly $300 million thanks to the turnaround the stock experienced during his eight years on the job. Mulally has degrees in aeronautical engineering and in management.', 'It’s not clear if Mulally, now 78, would want to come out of retirement for a challenge as big as turning around Boeing. He did not respond to an email from CNN about the job on Monday.', 'It’s also not clear if the Boeing board would consider someone that old. But in a year in which the US presidential election appears likely to pit an 81-year old candidate versus a 77-year old candidate, it seems tough to argue a well respected 78-year-old is too old to run Boeing.', 'Normally, internal candidates might be seen as the likely picks to replace Calhoun. Most of the 12 CEOs in Boeing’s history were internal candidates, with Calhoun being an exception.', 'However, the problems at Boeing during the last five years could lead the board to give preference to outside candidates.', '“Boeing is in need of drastic cultural overall, which is cultivated from the top, but sprouts from the bottom,” said Bank of America aerospace analyst Ron Epstein in a note to clients Monday. “We see the changes [announced Monday] as the first right steps of removing the ‘old guard’ and making way for a new team which can work from a less sullied slate.”', 'But among the internal candidates who might be considered are Stephanie Pope, who has been rising rapidly at Boeing and was promoted to chief operating officer just this past January. She was then promoted to CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes on Monday.', 'Another internal candidate could be CFO Brian West, another GE veteran, having served as CFO of GE Aviation and CFO GE Engine Services before coming to Boeing. Both Pope and West come from a finance background, not an engineering background.', 'It’s also possible that Boeing could tap Elizabeth Lund, who is senior vice president of quality at Boeing Commercial Airplanes, a new position that was created just a month ago. She does have an engineering background and experience dealing with Boeing suppliers, a major issue for the company’s efforts to get back on track.', '“I don’t know her, but she’s well regarded,” Aboulafia said.', 'A Boeing spokesperson declined to provide any comments on behalf of any of the internal candidates.', 'For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com']"

As investors brace for the Federal Reserve's upcoming release of crucial inflation data later this week, a sense of prudence prevails. Japan's Finance Minister issued a cautionary note against excessive fluctuations in the yen, underscoring the sensitivity of currency markets amid uncertain economic conditions. In this landscape, Julius Baer discerns a trend of capital flowing into Japanese equities, marking a potential shift in investment patterns. This observation hints at evolving investor sentiments and strategic reallocations within the financial markets."", ""Looking ahead, all eyes are on the Federal Reserve's forthcoming release of its key inflation gauge data, slated for Friday. This data release is expected to provide crucial insights into the trajectory of inflation, influencing market sentiment and potentially steering investor strategies in the days to come. As traders navigate through these uncertain waters, the cautious stance underscores the importance of strategic positioning and prudent risk management in the ever-fluctuating landscape of global financial markets."", 'In February, new home sales in the U.S. unexpectedly dropped by 0.3%, attributed to rising mortgage rates during the month. Despite this decline, the overall trend remains robust amidst a persistent shortage of existing homes in the market, reported Reuters. Notably, the median price of new homes recorded its lowest figure in over 2-1/2 years, while the supply reached its highest level since November 2022. Builders are responding to market dynamics by increasing construction efforts, offering price reductions, and adjusting floor plans to enhance affordability. This strategy seems to be stabilizing housing activity, with sales maintaining a relatively steady pace and prices experiencing moderate declines year-over-year. Although economists had anticipated a rise in new home sales, the actual figures reflect a slight contraction, emphasizing the volatility inherent in monthly data. Despite multiple interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve since March 2022, the new homes market has remained resilient, primarily due to the limited availability of existing homes for sale. While the housing market appears to be turning a corner, the persistent supply shortage continues to exert upward pressure on house prices, hindering access to homeownership for many. However, the recent decline in the median new house price is welcomed by economists as it suggests improvements in affordability and could help mitigate inflationary pressures. Looking ahead, despite some regional variations, surveys indicate a positive outlook for new home sales, supported by builder optimism and ongoing efforts to expand supply. Nonetheless, the sustainability of current incentives offered by builders remains uncertain, posing potential challenges to future market dynamics. Overall, amidst fluctuations in mortgage rates and supply dynamics, the new homes market in the U.S. demonstrates resilience, though challenges persist in achieving long-term affordability and accessibility for prospective homebuyers.', 'In financial markets, notable equities such as Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE:VLO), SolarEdge Technologies, Inc.

It reflects a shift in Saleh's perception of the company's potential performance. While previously advocating for a bullish outlook, Saleh now views the stock more neutrally, possibly due to changing market conditions or company-specific factors. Despite the downgrade, Papa John's International, Inc. (NASDAQ:PZZA) stock experienced a slight uptick of 0.88% following the announcement, closing at $66.32 on March 25.

Mr. Lynch brings previous leadership experience at large franchisors Arby’s and Taco Bell—where he worked alongside current Chipotle CEO Brian Niccol—and a marketing background at P&G. At Arby’s, Mr. Lynch led a turnaround effort where he shaped the company’s successful “We have the meats!” marketing campaign. Mr. Lynch has focused on reestablishing Papa John’s premium positioning with new food options, advertising campaigns and operational cost-cutting measures meant to improve margins.

(NYSE:PFE), a leading player in the pharmaceutical industry. The analysts downgraded Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) stock rating from Buy to Hold, citing concerns about ""near-term headwinds"" that the drugmaker is expected to encounter in its journey toward revenue growth. The decision to downgrade Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) likely reflects a comprehensive assessment of various factors affecting the company\'s performance, including its revenue projections, margin outlook, and patent expiration risks. The analysts pointed out that Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) revenue growth forecast of 3% to 5%, excluding COVID-19 products and the Seagen acquisition, represents a decrease from the 7% growth experienced in 2023. They also highlighted the anticipated decline in revenue from COVID-related products, which is expected to result in lower gross and operating margins. Moreover, Pfizer faces the challenge of offsetting revenue declines from products that will lose patent protection and exclusivity between 2025 and 2030. This necessitates finding alternatives to compensate for the approximate $17 billion in annual revenue that these products are projected to lose due to loss of exclusivity (LOE). As a result of these factors, the analysts have revised down their adjusted earnings per share (EPS) estimate for Pfizer in 2024 to $2.15 from the previous estimate of $3.25.', ""Looking ahead, the analysts have set a new EPS estimate of $2.70 for 2025 and adjusted the forecast for the five-year EPS growth rate to 7%, down from the earlier projection of 9%. These adjustments reflect the analysts' cautious outlook on Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) future earnings potential and growth prospects within the pharmaceutical sector. Despite the downgrade, investors responded with a modest increase in Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) stock price, which rose by 0.26% on March 25, closing at $27.43. This reaction suggests that while some investors may have tempered their optimism about Pfizer's near-term performance, others may still see potential value in the company's long-term strategy and pipeline of products. The market's response underscores the complexity of evaluating pharmaceutical stocks and the importance of considering various factors impacting their performance."", 'Price Reaction after the Downgrade: +0.02\xa0(+0.04%)', ""On March 22, Mizuho analyst Nitin Kumar made a notable adjustment to his assessment of PBF Energy Inc. (NYSE:PBF), a prominent player in the oil refining industry. Kumar downgraded PBF Energy's stock rating from Buy to Neutral, indicating a shift in his recommendation for investors. Despite the downgrade, Kumar raised the price target for PBF Energy from $52 to $58, suggesting a revised expectation for the company's future valuation. While the downgrade indicates a more neutral stance on PBF Energy Inc. (NYSE:PBF) stock, the upward revision of the price target suggests that Kumar still sees potential upside for the company, albeit at a more moderate level than previously anticipated. This nuanced approach may reflect Kumar's belief that while PBF Energy Inc. (NYSE:PBF) may not offer the same level of investment opportunity as before, it still has room for growth and value appreciation. Following the downgrade, investors responded with a marginal increase in PBF Energy Inc. (NYSE:PBF) stock price, which rose by 0.04% on March 25, closing at $56.30. This reaction suggests that while some investors may have adjusted their expectations in light of the downgrade, others may still perceive PBF Energy Inc. (NYSE:PBF) as a viable investment option within the oil refining industry.

After\xa0Alan Jope\xa0expanded Unilever’s portfolio to about 400 brands, Schumacher decided to focus on 30 key brands which account for 70% of the company’s sales, while taking action to improve the gross margin, and excluding any major undertaking, including transformational acquisitions.', 'When it reported fourth quarter earnings\xa0last months, figures showed Unilever isn’t regaining lost market share as quickly enough, and that it needs to do more to rebuild it as well as to improve its margins. Its rival, the Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE: PG) reported mixed results at the end of January.

Skeptics don’t have to look further than “The Monthly Dividend Company,” Realty Income (NYSE:O), a perennial favorite among income and REIT investors for proof. Shares in the top commercial real estate stock are down more than 11% since Jan. 1st with limited upside in sight. The reasons run the gamut you’re no doubt familiar with — higher rates, work-from-home permanency, sluggish consumer sentiment and more.', 'But Realty Income isn’t the only commercial real estate sector struggling. As you can imagine, office space, once valued at a premium, is on a rapid downswing, taking REITs holding the properties along with it. The office space sector’s customers are increasingly late to pay, with 6% delinquency rates reported in a recent survey.', 'These commercial real estate stocks to sell represent the riskiest slice of the sector and now is the time to run while you still can.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Source: GaudiLab / Shutterstock', 'You don’t need to look further than its dividend outlook to see that commercial real estate stock Vornado Realty (NYSE:VNO) is in trouble. After suspending its dividend for most of 2023 amid falling income and higher rates, 2024’s outlook doesn’t seem much brighter. In December 2023, the company told investors that it expects to pay a single, solitary dividend in 2024’s fourth quarter rather than the four per year that most income investors have come to expect. That makes Realty Income’s problems pale in comparison. At least it hasn’t lost its “Monthly Dividend Company” moniker.', 'Vornado’s end-of-year report, as expected, is enough to spook even the most steadfast commercial real estate bulls. The company posted a fourth-quarter net loss of $0.32 per share while barely breaking into overall profitability for the year. Worse yet, its annual profit seems as much an accounting trick as it does a measure of business success, with non-cash transactions like credit losses, property impairments, and deferred tax liabilities giving its bottom line a boost.', 'Source: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock', 'Boston Properties (NYSE:BXP) owns or manages nearly 200 properties across Boston, New York and San Francisco, making it particularly vulnerable to the downturn in commercial real estate as work-from-home trends become the norm and corporations accelerate job cuts. Reflecting these challenges, its share price has fallen nearly 13% since Jan. 1st, and the outlook remains grim.', 'Office occupancy rates remain at 18% and well below their pre-pandemic figures, with a significant push towards a remote-centric office culture. In New York, office real estate values plummeted by 45% in 2020, continuing to decline to a staggering $453 billion loss. San Francisco’s commercial real estate is similarly struggling, with a 30% vacancy rate, further exacerbated by the city’s ongoing crime concerns.', 'These issues extend beyond just two of Boston Properties’ main markets. The company’s funds from operations — a key measure of REIT performance akin to earnings per share –are on a downward trajectory, registering at $1.86 per share in its latest report. That’s down 2.2% on a year-over-year basis. Although this report outperformed analyst expectations by a hair, it does little to alleviate their broader concerns.', 'Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com', 'Though it isn’t exclusively commercial real estate stock, New York Community Bancorp (NYSE:NYCB) is sufficiently invested in the sector that weakness presents a real risk to its bottom line. Bank managers spooked investors recently after hiking their provision for credit losses on the balance sheet (projected loan defaults, in other words) after looking closely at “the portfolio and risk posed by borrowers in the multifamily sector who face sharp increases in interest rates.” As much as 60% of the bank’s $100 billion worth of assets is closely linked to commercial properties in Manhattan, which, as you can imagine, puts the community bank at extreme risk if the dominoes begin falling.', 'On the residential front, NYCB isn’t faring much better. Analysts at Raymond James cut the bank’s lender rating this week and pinned its fair value per-share pricing at $3, or about 16% below current levels. Raymond James’ downgrade hinges not on commercial real estate but on risky residential underwriting and that “NYCB is more likely to sell problem loans at 30%-50% haircuts, hence substantial earnings difficulties.”', 'On the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

Those advantages, coupled with cheap land, made the city a favorite for homebuilders like DR Horton and Lennar that brought plenty of new inventory to market.', 'The pandemic supercharged movers’ interest in Florida, especially the First Coast. Listings jumped at both the state and city levels in 2021 and 2022. Brokerages took notice, resulting in a surge in companies and office locations competing for their share of listings, according to CoreLogic multiple-listing service data shared exclusively with HousingWire.', 'But high mortgage rates and high home prices proved too much for the listings boom in Jacksonville. Its listings in 2023 fell below its 2019 level, although the drop was less steep than that experienced outside of Florida and far less steep than other metros like San Diego.', 'In this environment of high rates and tight inventory, brokerages have had to become sharp elbowed. The competitive landscape has shifted, with some companies shutting down and others buying their way into the market.', 'In 2019, Watson Realty Corp. enjoyed an almost 1,000-listing lead over Keller Williams Jacksonville, its closest rival. Keller Williams Jacksonville, too, held a roughly 1,000-listing lead over the next company in line.', 'In 2023, not only is Watson Realty’s lead gone, but the company has fallen to 3rd place in listings. Keller Williams Jacksonville has taken its crown, and Florida Homes Realty has narrowly overtaken it for 2nd place.', 'Some newcomers have been able to carve out their space in Jacksonville’s housing market. Herron Real Estate exploded from two listings in 2019 to 417 in 2023; Momentum Realty grew from 12 listings to 612 over the same period.', 'Dallas-based United Real Estate burst onto the scene in October 2022 when it acquired EXIT Real Estate Gallery, which had ranked in Jacksonville’s top 10 in three of the four years from 2019-2022.', 'Software-powered startup beycome, too, has consistently grown its share of Jacksonville’s listings, nabbing 192 listings last year. The company collects a 3% buyer agent commission, keeps a third of it, and refunds the rest to the buyer; it does not charge a seller agent commission fee.', 'Other would-be disruptors have not fared so well. Listings by instant buyers (also known as “iBuyers”) plummeted last year, although the industry segment’s struggles are hardly limited to Jacksonville.', 'One thing that stands out in Jacksonville’s listings rankings is the recurring presence of homebuilders.', 'DR Horton and Dream Finders both ranked in the top 10 in 2019, and Lennar made a top 10 appearance in 2020. DR Horton, the country’s largest homebuilder, stayed in the top 10 every year – ranking 4th in 2021 and 2022. In fact, DR Horton alone was responsible for almost 5% of all of Jacksonville’s MLS listings in 2020, 2021 and 2022.', 'But it has significantly slowed its pace of deliveries in Jacksonville, while Dream Finders is no longer active in the area.', 'Homebuilders’ shrinking listing counts suggest Jacksonville is not immune to national trends affecting homebuilders. Homebuilders increasingly became more pessimistic, more prone to offering buyers incentives, and less eager to start construction last year as mortgage rates crushed prospective customers’ buying power.', 'With rates still high and no federal rate cut yet on the docket, some builders have decided to build for renters instead of buyers.', 'However, new-home sales were up 5.9% year-over-year in February and homebuilder confidence is on the rise. This could prompt builders to get more active on the First Coast again, offering some relief to tight inventories.', 'If not, expect brokerage competition to get even hotter.']"

If you want to skip our discussion on momentum investing and the stock market outlook, head over to 5 Best Momentum ETFs To Buy.\xa0', ""Momentum investing refers to a strategy that increases portfolio exposure to stocks with robust performance while lowering exposure to those with weaker performance. This approach revolves around buying stocks with upward-trending prices and it has been historically backed by economic theory and empirical evidence. Typically targeting a 12-month timeframe, momentum strategies consistently record positive returns and add diversity to investment portfolios. According to BlackRock, the concept of momentum can be best grasped through behavioral finance theories. It stems from investors' behavioral tendencies, where individual actions reinforce market trends. Moreover, momentum rewards may offset the risk of short-term underperformance that some investors avoid. Despite occasional short-term setbacks, like those seen in 2001, 2009, and 2023, momentum consistently offers lasting benefits. Both risk-based and behavioral-based explanations play a role in its persistence, supporting the belief that momentum will remain a viable strategy in the future."", ""The renewed interest in Bitcoin and the stock market suggests that there might be a big bubble forming. While gold's record contradicts this notion to some extent, hinting at genuine caution driven by concerns over unsustainable fiscal spending, signs of things getting too heated are still there. According to a recent Bloomberg report, when looking closely at how stocks in the S&P 500 index are moving, there is a similar pattern to what happened during the big bubble in the late 1990s and early 2000s. People are doing really well by purchasing stocks that have been doing well lately and investing in companies with growing earnings, putting momentum trading and growth investing in the spotlight. These strategies have been doing better than value investing. The current market rally seems to follow these patterns, especially with momentum trading making a strong comeback. Notably, the emergence of the Magnificent Seven as the prevailing investing theme in early 2023 led to a challenging period for momentum trading. However, the current situation differs, with momentum gaining momentum once again."", 'In January 2024, Charles Schwab’s chief investment strategist Liz Ann Sonders participated in CNBC’s “Last Call” to discuss the markets. Sonders noted that when benchmarks like the S&P 500 and Dow hit record highs, it drives the momentum higher – at least for a while when the market ignores earnings and market fundamentals, focusing on performance only. Similarly, Jeremy Siegel, Wharton School professor, joined CNBC’s ‘Closing Bell’ on March 8, 2024. Siegel talked about momentum investing trending these days, but he also said that in his experience, trending stocks might see a slump of a few days before getting back on an upwards trajectory. However, by then, most momentum investors have already pulled out of their holdings. The investors then quickly hop onto the trades they just sold to reap the benefits of the ongoing market rally. He noted that individuals need ‘nerves of steel’ for momentum investing. Siegel observed that momentum followers usually do not care about a company’s valuation, its management, or its operational efficiency. They just look at current performance charts and jump on, leading select companies to skyrocket, sometimes even without proper fundamentals supporting the growth. Siegel stated that momentum investors believe in ‘making the trend your friend’ and they are confident that they can ‘jump off the train before it falls off the cliff’.\xa0', ""However, on March 26, 2024, Liz Young, SoFi head of investment strategy, appeared on\xa0'Closing Bell' and said that momentum in equities is fading. Breaking down her statement, she highlighted that from October to December 2023, momentum and high beta led the markets. Heading into 2024, momentum was still leading but slightly slowing down, with investor focus shifting to low volatility and quality stocks. Young observed that in March, low volatility, quality, value, and dividends are leading the rally. In terms of the momentum behind the market rally itself, Young commented that the velocity and fervor is fading but the rally is not about to be over entirely. There is room for stocks to continue skyrocketing.

I've noticed that every successful person I've known, regardless of gender, race or other circumstances, has worked extremely hard and endured major setbacks. Expecting success without demonstrating commitment is presumptuous."", 'As a part of our series about ""Life and Leadership Lessons Learned In The Military,"" we had the pleasure of interviewing Virgil Miller.', ""Virgil Miller, who joined Aflac in 2004, was named President of Aflac U.S. in January 2023. In his current role, Virgil leads all aspects of operations in the U.S. market. He is responsible for setting strategy and managing performance for Aflac's multiple business segments and product sets in the United States, including Individual and Group Voluntary Benefits, Dental and Vision, and Life and Disability Solutions."", 'A former U.S. Marine who served in Operation Desert Storm, Virgil embarked on his professional career as a call center employee and worked his way up, holding several leadership positions during his time at Aflac. He is known for his ability to motivate teams and achieve results, as well as his passion for delivering innovative and caring customer experiences. He embodies Aflac\'s mission to provide ""care on purpose"" by helping customers attain financial freedom and providing philanthropic support to underserved communities.\u200b', 'Thank you so much for doing this with us! Can you tell us a bit about your childhood ""backstory""?', ""rowing up in rural Georgia, in a small town outside of Macon, my life revolved around my family and my faith. I was always good at math and good with numbers, so when I was 12, I joined the finance committee at my church. In retrospect, this experience - collecting money, writing checks and being accountable for paying the church's bills - laid the foundation for the career I have today."", 'I made the decision to join the Marines when I was in 11th grade, but it had always been something I had considered. My father served in the Army and had encouraged me to join the military to gain discipline and get financial assistance to go to college. From the time I was very young, I always aspired to have a professional career - to work with numbers and be a businessman. I never could have imagined how challenging and fulfilling my career journey has been, leading me to my current role at Aflac.', 'And what are you doing today? Can you share a story that exemplifies the unique work that you are doing?', 'In my current role, I oversee all U.S. operations for Aflac - everything from finance and technology to products and marketing. I joined Aflac in 2004 and have held roles across nearly all our workstreams, which gives me a holistic viewpoint of the company and the ability to bring people and teams together to ""connect the dots,"" innovate and collaborate.\u200b', ""\u200bOne of our biggest priorities at Aflac right now is incorporating emerging technologies like artificial intelligence to make the process of filing claims more efficient for our customers. At the same time, we're conscious of the fact that, as an insurance company, customers often reach out to us on their worst days. Our call center employees are on the frontlines of providing care to our customers when they need it most. Our goal is to implement technology that makes their jobs easier so they can focus on what they do best - providing reassurance and empathy to our customers during their time of need."", ""When I started my current role, one of the first things I did was ask all our company managers to file a claim - to literally go to Aflac's website, click through the process, read each instruction, and follow each prompt. Putting ourselves in our customers shoes allows us to show up better for them. For example, we recently decided that, when one of our customers contact us with a cancer diagnosis, the specialist they speak with that day is their specialist for the duration of their treatment. Cancer is one of the most disruptive medical events a person can go through, and having a familiar person who is dedicated to guiding them through the process is one small way we can ease what is a very heavy burden."", 'Can you tell us a bit about your military background?', 'My time was spent in the marines as an active duty marine and active reservist. I was called into duty and served in operation desert storm. Upon returning home, I finished my time as a reservist and then transitioned into corporate America, where I have worked since. I feel very fortunate to have my experience in the marines as there were incredible lessons and learnings that I still use and apply to what I do every day.', 'Can you share the most interesting story that you experienced during your military career? What ""take away"" did you learn from that story?', 'My Marine Corps drill instructor was right out of Full Metal Jacket - loud, intimidating and profane. Then, one day, another man in our basic training group attempted suicide. After binding his wounds, and while waiting for the medics, the drill instructor cradled the young man in his arms and said, ""It\'s alright, son. You\'re fine. We\'re getting you out of here. It\'ll be okay."" It was the warmest, sweetest voice - a voice I would have insisted, prior to that night, could never come from that man. And it revealed compassion and tenderness of which I thought him incapable. After that, he was no longer a ""type"" in my eyes, but a three-dimensional, full human being.', 'This experience made me realize that the tough, impenetrable drill instructor I knew was an act. It was an identity he put on, like a hat. In the military, and in business, sometimes you need to play the part. There are qualities and attributes you must embody in order to be successful. And just as important is knowing when to drop the act and meet people where they are, human to human.', ""I graduated number-one in my basic training program, in part because I embraced the persona of a Marine - tough, rambunctious, courageous. This lesson has carried over to my professional career as well - I believe authenticity is important, and that you should be yourself at work, but you also need behave in a way that's appropriate to your role (and the role you want to have)."", ""We are interested in fleshing out what a hero is. Did you experience or hear about a story of heroism, during your military experience? Can you share that story with us? Feel free to be as elaborate as you'd like."", 'Based on that story, how would you define what a ""hero"" is? Can you explain?', 'Does a person need to be facing a life and death situation to do something heroic or to be called a hero?', 'I will answer these together and begin with the end in mind so to speak. In short, heroism comes in many forms, and it does not have to be linked to life and death situations. The story that comes to mind first is a perfect example. When I was an active reservist, I was also attending college at the same time. During that time, I was actually originally called up and activated for Desert Shield. When that occurred, there was another active reservist with my same military occupational specialty volunteered to take my place. As an active sheriff deputy, he felt that it was important for me to finish my education, knowing that it would serve me well throughout my lifetime. He made a selfless decision - he put my interests ahead of his - and he went on in defense of our country. That is a hero. 3 months later, I was activated for Desert Storm, but I will never forget what that individual did for me.', 'Based on your military experience, can you share with our readers 5 Leadership or Life Lessons that you learned from your experience""? (Please share a story or example for each.)', 'My time as a Marine made me more patient, more confident, and, oddly, more competent as a business executive working my way up the ladder of a $22 billion corporation. Throughout my life and career, I have been guided by what my military service taught me, even if some of those lessons were inadvertent. They include:', ""Be confident. Whether it's an unseen enemy on the battlefield or impostor syndrome in your own head, you'll always have fears. Be confident anyway. Be the person who's entrusted with the toughest projects. I am where I am today because I spent a lifetime demonstrating trust in my own ability, taking on the assignment no one else wanted, showing good business acumen, making good decisions throughout my career and my personal life, and unabashedly absorbing leadership skills from all people and stages of my life. Confidence, particularly related to Black people, is sometimes misinterpreted as arrogance, but it's not - it's bold, and it's smart."", ""Know and be who you are. In the military and in the business world, there are certain protocols and etiquette that must be followed. But within those guardrails, it's important to embrace your individuality - your unique experiences, skills and points of view. Diversity is business imperative in an eclectic marketplace. Your individuality will benefit the overall team - if you work as a teammate. As a Marine, I learned that we are called upon to achieve individual accomplishments because they, in turn, help the unit thrive, and in some cases, survive. My point is you should be your own woman or man and balance that with being the employee your boss needs you to be. And remember, a supervisor who you make look good is much more likely to advocate on your behalf, particularly in higher level meetings that you cannot attend."", ""Work like hell and have reasonable expectations. I started my business career in a call center answering phones. It wasn't my life's ambition, but it was a good start, and I was contributing to the company's mission, providing best-in-class service for and with whomever I was in contact. Don't mail it in just because your current job isn't where you want to be. It is where you are now, and it will serve a purpose on your way to wherever your true ambitions lie - in the same way that boot camp, while taxing and often tedious, lays the groundwork to becoming a confident and competent Marine. No matter what you aspire to be, there are no shortcuts to success. It takes time, patience and a willingness to learn."", 'Dress for success. This sounds superficial, but it isn\'t. I take a lot of good-natured ribbing because I like to look good at work - not flamboyant, just good. And why not? When I look good, I feel good. When I feel good, I work well. When I work well, people notice. In the military, this meant taking the time to make sure my shoes were polished, and my uniform was clean and free of wrinkles. In business, this means presenting yourself appropriately in relation to your job so that leadership sees you as a serious person. It\'s important to note, however, that ""dressing for success"" is not one size fits all. With two daughters and my wife, I\'ve lived in a house filled with Black women, so I know that at times, they can be scrutinized for not fitting within society\'s idea of ""professional attire."" But no one should be afraid to express herself at the workplace, so I tell my daughters, my teammates and colleagues that it is okay to rock your natural hair or don professional attire that embodies your style. The key is ""professional,"" which comes in many forms, and that\'s a good thing.', ""Sweat the small stuff. In the Marines, you don't just march. You take 14 steps, each 40 inches in length, with the toe planted on the turn. Nothing is inexact or ambivalent. Attention to detail, in life-or-death situations, is crucial. In my business, which is about giving our customers peace of mind and helping them attain financial freedom, it matters a great deal."", 'Do you think your experience in the military helped prepare you for business? Can you explain?', ""I can't imagine better preparation for the work I do at Aflac today. In the military, many of the benchmarks by which your performance is assessed are objective. In the business world, this is not always the case."", 'Early on in my professional career, I developed something that I now call ""The Formula."" Any time I start a new role, I look at what\'s expected of me from three dimensions:', 'People: My ability to form strong relationships with my team and my direct supervisor', 'Process: What success looks like in this role', 'Performance: How to be a leader and push my team forward', 'I created a scorecard centered around these three things, and at the end of each year, I ""grade"" myself on how I\'m doing - using specific, concrete metrics. I\'ve gone on to use this process with many of my direct reports, since I find it can take the emotion out of performance reviews by focusing on the facts.', 'As you know, some people are scarred for life by their experience in the military. Did you struggle after your deployment was over? What have you done to adjust and thrive in civilian life that others may want to emulate?', 'There is a transition for everyone returning home - and it is unique for every person. For some it is short, for some it is long. Everyone will go through something different, but without a doubt, everyone has some will go through something. For me personally, what helped me greatly was my family. I was fortunate to have a strong support system; my family was there for me and helped remind me of the why. My why was defending my country. When you connect the dots and remember why your role was important, it helps to adjust as you move forward. In terms of advice to others, I would share that it helped me to take on new challenges in life. As a marine, you are highly challenged and facing challenges becomes part of your DNA in a sense. Because of that, I think taking on new challenges in life, whether professionally, personally, physically, is always helpful, and particularly for those transitioning out of deployment.', 'Are you working on any exciting new projects now? How do you think that will help people?', ""We are always working on new projects to expand the value we offer to our customers, and it is hard to pick but I will go back to our core - which is our cancer product. Since 1957, Aflac has been a pioneer in cancer insurance. Our passion for seeing our policyholder through this distressing time is at the very heart of who we are. The unfortunate reality is, cancer touches almost everyone at some point in their lives and everyone's story is unique, especially when it comes to cancer treatment. We re-imagined and improved the protection our cancer policy offers in 2023 but we are not stopping there. We are continuing to look for ways to enhance the value we can provide families going through a cancer diagnosis, and have some exciting new projects underway to do just that."", 'What advice would you give to other leaders to help their team to thrive?', 'My experience in the military shaped the way I manage and lead teams. Some of the lessons I go back to time and time again as a leader include:', ""Don't shun the grunt work. Whether it's cleaning latrines or working an entry-level call center position, the lowliest chore may yield the greatest returns. When you are in a position to manage others, it helps to have the credibility of their experience. And as a leader, you can build trust with your team by rolling up your sleeves and doing the work alongside them."", ""Keep your head up. In order to complete a successful mission - whether that's a military operation or a product launch - it's pivotal to observe and analyze every angle and potential outcome, and then cascade that information to your team so that everyone is rowing in the same direction. Making your team look like winners serves everyone's best interests."", 'Be the tops. Commit to becoming one of the best at what you do. Encourage your team to do the same. The top few performers in any unit are always in demand, and leaders are constantly vying for their participation.', 'Your record is your credential. Once you reach a certain point in your career, people care less about the school you attended and more about what you can do. I grew up in a small Southern town, finished high school and became a Marine, served in the Gulf War, and only later earned some degrees from not-so-famous colleges. And every day, I direct the activities of prestigious university alumni who have yet to do the work at which I have become expert.', ""Don't typecast. People are complex, and they can surprise you. Seeing every team member as a three-dimensional human being reveals and strengthens the bond between everyone. It also encourages empathy - all of us have challenges we struggle with, but what matters is that we show up to the best of our ability every day."", ""Success is earned, not given. I've noticed that every successful person I've known, regardless of gender, race or other circumstances, has worked extremely hard and endured major setbacks. Expecting success without demonstrating commitment is presumptuous."", 'What advice would you give to other leaders about the best way to manage a large team?', 'When businesspeople hear the word ""military,"" they sometimes hear ""militant,"" and they assume such rigor, inflexibility, and uniformity would never work in a corporate environment. But if my career is any indication, most businesses would be greatly enhanced by the patience, perseverance, discipline, fortitude, and prudence of those who have seen the world through a soldier\'s eyes. Such men and women know what it\'s like, and what it takes, to stretch themselves beyond typical limits to achieve success in a way that is always productive, always collegial, and always faithful.', ""My leadership style was undoubtedly shaped by my experience in the military, but I'm inspired by athletic coaches - like Deion Sanders, Dawn Staley, and Mike Krzyzewski - as well. Great coaches have a deep understanding of behavioral and performance management and how to get the best out of people. Just like in the military, in sports, each individual works hard to accomplish their mission, but the outcome - win or lose - is owned by the team. Coaches, military generals and business leaders alike must find the balance between having people's best interests at heart - creating an environment of psychological safety - while also holding them accountable for their results."", 'None of us are able to achieve success without some help along the way. Is there a particular person who you are grateful towards who helped get you to where you are?

Why? Because animals transcend different cultures and languages—and, simply put, people just love them. One of those most beloved and memorable (albeit sometimes annoying) animal mascots is the Aflac duck, whose story stemmed from an unlikely place.', '“Our advertising agency was in Central Park sitting on a bench. And they heard ducks and they noticed it sounded like Aflac,” the insurance giant’s CEO Dan Amos told Fortune in a recent interview. “And so the quack, quack, Aflac became the idea. And that’s how we got in.”', 'And with that, the Aflac duck campaign debuted in 2000 with the television commercial “Park Bench,” according to company history. New York City–based ad agency Kaplan Thaler Group pitched the idea that doubled the company’s business in three years.', 'Amos, at the time of the commercial launch, was actually reluctant to run with the idea because he thought it was making light of the company’s name. This was also right around the time that other insurance giants like Geico had started running funny and lighthearted animal-related ads. The Geico gecko first made its appearance in 1997, according to its company history.', '""We took a big chance making fun of our name, because you\'re not just doing it, you\'re actually making fun of your name,"" Amos told Yahoo Finance in 2021. ""And yet, it forever changed our life.""', 'Indeed, Aflac shares were worth about $28 million ($11.78 per share at 2,388,800 shares), but today company shares are worth about $257 million at $85.04 per share—making the Aflac duck a $200 million-plus success. Last year, the company had $18.7 billion in revenue.', 'The ""Park Bench"" commercial popularized Aflac’s brand and led to a pop-culture moment obsessed with the obnoxious yet lovable duck. In fact, between 2000 and 2014, Aflac’s brand recognition soared from 11% to 94%, making it one of the most well-known companies in the world, according to Aflac history. Plus, the ""Park Bench"" commercial became so popular that a short animated film from 2022 was named after it and followed a family dealing with sickle-cell disease. But the Aflac duck was there to help the family through the recovery.', 'While the Aflac duck was a cash cow for the business, he doesn’t make any money himself, Amos told Fortune.', ""“Well, he's king of the place, but he doesn't have a salary,” Amos said. “And that's about it.” But if it's any consolation, the Aflac duck was inducted into the Advertising Walk of Fame in 2004 and the PR News Public Relations Hall of Fame in 2011, the same year he first appeared in the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade, according to Aflac company history."", ""“The surveys showed us that he was wonderful,” Amos said. “And people enjoyed him, and he's continued to be [wonderful].”"", 'With such a big return to investors, it’s no surprise that Amos’s most admired Fortune 500 CEO is Warren Buffett.', ""“He's the most tenured CEO and he's given fabulous returns to the shareholders,” Amos said. Like Buffett, Amos has a long tenure at his company. He’s been CEO of Aflac for 34 years. And at age 72, Amos is now the fifth-longest-serving CEO of any Fortune 500 company. Buffett, at 93 years old, has the longest tenure."", ""“I've seen a lot, and I think when you work with a good organization, you have to stay with them,” Amos said. “And Aflac has been a great place to work.”"", 'This story was originally featured on Fortune.com']"

In the \'long\' context, investors will essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" And for investors following this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock\'s price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.', 'Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.', 'Below, we take a look at Universal Health Services (UHS), which currently has a Momentum Style Score of A. We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score, like price change and earnings estimate revisions.', ""It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Universal Health Services currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period."", 'You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here >>>', 'Set to Beat the Market?', ""In order to see if UHS is a promising momentum pick, let's examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this hospital and health facility operator holds up."", ""A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area."", ""For UHS, shares are up 3.79% over the past week while the Zacks Medical - Hospital industry is up 2.48% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 8.23% compares favorably with the industry's 4.51% performance as well."", 'While any stock can see a spike in price, it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market. Over the past quarter, shares of Universal Health Services have risen 16.67%, and are up 43.85% in the last year. In comparison, the S&P 500 has only moved 10.11% and 33.15%, respectively.', ""Investors should also pay attention to UHS's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. UHS is currently averaging 677,317 shares for the last 20 days."", 'Earnings Outlook', ""The Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things, including estimate revisions and a stock's price movement. Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank, and a nice path here can be promising. We have recently been noticing this with UHS."", ""Over the past two months, 6 earnings estimates moved higher compared to 1 lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost UHS's consensus estimate, increasing from $11.95 to $13.39 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 5 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period."", 'Bottom Line', ""Given these factors, it shouldn't be surprising that UHS is a #2 (Buy) stock and boasts a Momentum Score of A. If you're looking for a fresh pick that's set to soar in the near-term, make sure to keep Universal Health Services on your short list."", 'Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Druckenmiller, worth over $9 billion, is going long on AI as he believes AI could be as big and transformative as the internet. In June last year, the billionaire said that he does not believe AI is a bubble and that’s why AI was dominating his long portfolio. Druckenmiller almost always thinks long term and that’s the open secret behind his success. Earlier this year, in an interview with How Leaders Lead with David Novak, Druckenmiller advised investors never to invest in the present and instead keep the next 18-24 months in mind and try to imagine how the world would be in the future. These thoughts are reflected in the billionaire’s portfolio as well. Duquesne Capital, which Druckenmiller founded in 1981, bought a new position in NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) in the last quarter of 2022, buying over 582,000 shares. Back then the contemporary generative AI boom was just getting started. Nvidia was trading at around $146 as of December 30, 2022. Today the stock is hovering around $926. As of the end of the last quarter of 2023 Duquesne Capital had a $306 million stake in the GPU company.\xa0 Nvidia is among the top picks of the fund, in addition to other big names like Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Eli Lilly And Co (NYSE:LLY).', 'Druckenmiller isn’t a huge fan of portfolio diversification. He said during the interview that if you really believe in a company, you’d take “massive” positions in it instead of putting your money in hundreds of companies. He said legendary investors like Warren Buffett, Carl Icahn and George Soros invest in a handful of companies they really like and believe in. Druckenmiller said instead of having “lazy longs” in your portfolio, if you put your money in just a few companies, you won’t get careless in the investing game.', 'Methodology', ""In this article we decided to see which stocks in Druckenmiller's portfolio are also seeing buying activity from corporate insiders. For that we scanned Druckenmiller's Q4'2023 portfolio and picked 11 stocks that saw insider buying activity over the past few months.

Critically, we do not believe any of these transitory dynamics pose, or ever posed, any existential risk to the business.

Since then, SPHR has completed construction of the Las Vegas Sphere, which opened to broadly positive reviews, and SPHR has appreciated further. However, we have substantially reduced our investment in SPHR. I was comfortable owning MSGE in significant size due to its unlevered ownership of the Madison Square Garden arena, an iconic venue with stable cash flows and modest growth. After the split, SPHR has no ownership of the arena and is instead a riskier growth company, with significant upside potential but also higher odds of a miss. As a result, we retain a smaller position in SPHR.
