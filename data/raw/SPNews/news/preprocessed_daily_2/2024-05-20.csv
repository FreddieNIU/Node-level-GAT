This week’s list includes Walmart’s WMT, Target TGT, Amazon AMZN and Nvidia NVDA.', 'Walmart’s beat-and-raise quarterly release should ordinarily provide favorable read-throughs for Target, which is scheduled to report results before the market’s open on Wednesday, May 22nd. But the two companies have different business models, and that makes expectations off target.', 'To start, Walmart has effectively added a technological component to its well-established reputation for value. Walmart’s digital prowess has allowed it to offer a variety of convenient shopping options, allowing it to gain market share, with mostly high-income households finding the company’s service offerings hard to resist. The company’s revenues in the quarter increased +5.8% (in constant currency), with digital sales up +21% from the same period last year.', 'Another major point of distinction between the two retailers is their merchandise mix, with Walmart heavily weighted towards groceries and Target towards discretionary merchandise. Walmart enjoyed mid-single-digit same-store sales growth in the latest quarter, with the aforementioned high-income households attracted to the retailer for its convenient delivery and pick-up options.', 'Walmart’s general merchandise, which can roughly be considered comparable to the bulk of Target’s merchandise mix, continued to show soft results, with same-store sales down in the low single digits in the quarter. Most analysts expect Target to show low single-digit same-store sales declines but also expect some sequential improvement in the trend line', 'Target is expected to bring in $2.05 in EPS on $24.5 billion in revenues, with earnings unchanged from the year-ago period on -3.2% lower revenues. The stock was up big following each of the last two quarterly releases in March and November, as can be seen in the one-year performance chart below relative to Walmart and the Zacks Retail sector.', 'With respect to the Retail sector 2024 Q1 earnings season scorecard, we now have results from 23 of the 34 retailers in the S&P 500 index. Regular readers know that Zacks has a dedicated stand-alone economic sector for the retail space, which is unlike the placement of the space in the Consumer Staples and Consumer Discretionary sectors in the Standard & Poor’s standard industry classification.', 'The Zacks Retail sector includes not only Walmart, Target, and other traditional retailers, but also online vendors like Amazon and restaurant players.', 'Total Q1 earnings for these 23 retailers that have reported are up +38.7% from the same period last year on +6.4% higher revenues, with 69.6% beating EPS estimates and 56.5% beating revenue estimates.', 'Walmart beat both EPS and revenue estimates, but Home Depot missed on revenues. Aside from these two ‘conventional’ retailers, the scorecard at this stage primarily reflects the Q1 performance of the digital players and restaurant operators. As the above beats data shows, these companies have struggled to beat EPS and revenue estimates in Q1.', 'In fact, Q1 EPS and revenue beats percentages for these players remain below the average for this group of companies over the preceding 20 quarters (5 years) and are towards the lower end of the 5-year high-low range.', 'With respect to earnings and revenue growth rates, we like to show the group’s performance with and without Amazon, whose results are among the 23 companies that have already reported. As we know, Amazon’s Q1 earnings were up +278.7% on +12.5% higher revenues, beating top- and bottom-line expectations.', 'As we all know, digital and brick-and-mortar operators have been converging for some time now, with Amazon now a decent-sized brick-and-mortar operator after Whole Foods and Walmart a growing online vendor. This long-standing trend got a huge boost from the Covid lockdowns.', 'As noted earlier, we have started seeing signs of stress at the lower-end of income distribution, and one can intuitively project moderation in consumer spending as the economy further slows down under the weight of tighter monetary conditions. Inflation may be down from the multi-decade highs of a few quarters back, but it still remains a headwind, particularly for the lower end of income distribution. That said, the labor market remains very strong, with wages still going up.', 'We will hear more about issues on the Q1 earnings calls, likely in the context of their outlooks for the coming periods.', 'The bulk of the Q1 earnings season is now behind us, with results from 467 S&P 500 companies already out through Friday, May 17th. We have almost 150 companies reporting results this week, including 15 S&P 500 members. This week, the most keenly awaited earnings release isn’t from Target but rather from Nvidia, which reports after the market’s close on Wednesday, May 22nd. Lowe’s, TJX Cos, Macy’s, and Ralph Lauren are some of the other companies reporting this week.', 'Total Q1 earnings for these 467 index members are up +4.6% from the same period last year on +4% higher revenues, with 77.7% beating EPS estimates and 60.2% beating revenue estimates.', 'We have been flagging an acceleration in the earnings growth trend, which becomes more clear once the Bristol Myers drag is removed from the data; the pharma giant came out with a huge one-time charge.', 'Earnings growth for these companies would have been +7.5% instead of +4.6% had it not been for the substantial Energy sector drag.', 'As we noted in the context of the Retail sector, beats percentages have been weaker for the index as a whole, with the variance relative to other recent periods particularly notable on the revenues side.', 'Looking at Q1 as a whole, total S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +6.3% from the same period last year on +4.3% higher revenues, which would follow the +6.9% earnings growth on +3.9% revenue gains in the preceding period.', 'As you likely know already, the Tech and Energy and sectors are having the opposite effects on the aggregate growth picture. Excluding the Tech sector, Q1 earnings for the rest of the index would be down -0.7% while the growth pace improves to +9.2% on an ex-Energy basis.', 'For the current period (2024 Q2), total S&P 500 earnings are currently expected to be up +9% on +4.5% higher revenues.', 'The revisions trend has been very favorable for Q2 estimates. Looking at the overall earnings picture on an annual basis, total 2024 S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +8.9% on +1.6% revenue growth.', 'For a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>> Current Earnings Outlook Reflects Positivity ', ""Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

But perhaps his greatest achievement was being an amazing father, husband and grandfather. Our dad leaves a powerful legacy as a legendary business leader, a generous community citizen and a loyal friend.”', '“Bruce was truly instrumental in establishing the Nordstrom brand and what the Nordstrom name stood for, like how Stanley Marcus established the Neiman Marcus brand,” said Allen Questrom, another legend in the retail industry and the former CEO of Federated Department Stores, JCPenney, Neiman Marcus and Barneys New York.', 'Questrom recalled that when he was running the Bullocks regional department store chain in California, which eventually merged into Macy’s, a major Nordstrom store moved into South Coast Plaza, the regional mall in Costa Mesa, Calif.

They just treated me\xa0as a member of the family, and I wasn’t the only one.”', 'Bruce Nordstrom was the grandson of the company’s founder, John Nordstrom, who immigrated from Sweden to the U.S. at the age of 16. As the story goes, the young John Nordstrom first arrived in\xa0Minnesota\xa0in 1887 with $5 in his pocket, and worked in various areas of the country until settling down permanently in Seattle. He built up some savings, partly by prospecting for gold in Alaska in the late 19th century. Upon returning to Seattle, he opened a shoe store in 1901 with Carl Wallin, a shoemaker that he met in Alaska. The store took off right from the start, registering $12.50 in shoes on Day One.', 'Over the years, additional shoe stores were opened. The company survived the Great Depression and World War II and, eventually, seeing the need to diversify, purchased Best Apparel, a Seattle-based women’s clothing store, in the early 1960s, putting the company on an accelerated growth path. In 1967, when annual sales reached $40 million, the chain’s name was changed to Nordstrom Best. In 1971, the company went public, and two years later, topping $100 million sales, the company officially renamed itself Nordstrom Inc.', 'In 2018, during an interview a few months before he received the Lifetime Achievement Award from WWD’s sister publication Footwear News, Bruce\xa0admitted that being in the business\xa0wasn’t a mandate for the third-generation Nordstrom.', '“My daddy [Everett] said, ‘If you don’t want to do this, go do something else,’ but I never did,” said Bruce at the time. “It was the Second World War, and I was sweeping floors, emptying shoeboxes, breaking them up, flattening them and tying them into bundles. It was hard work, as I was a skinny little guy.”', 'That skinny kid, who “absolutely loved” retail and its simplicity at the time, inherited a tireless family work ethic. In fact, he used a 30-minute lunch break to propose marriage, at age 23. Bruce told his bride-to-be that his work was all-consuming, and the proposal came with a telling disclosure. “We decided to get married, but I told her I didn’t have much time off to do so. Maybe two weeks.”', 'To her credit, Fran was undeterred, allowing Bruce to dedicate hundreds of hours to the family company as his own family grew at home. “She was really something,” Bruce had said of his late wife. “She raised our boys beautifully and was up for whatever it was.”', 'Driven and detail-oriented, Bruce was asked to be president of the company at 30.', '“I felt like a lost dog in the tall grass,” he said. “But we were a much smaller company in those days, just a couple hundred employees and a few shoe stores in Portland [Ore.] and Seattle.”', 'Almost immediately, his father and Uncle Elmer retired — and Bruce was left to determine his path.', 'Wisely, he turned to “Uncle” Lloyd Nordstrom (chairman at the time) for guidance. Lloyd suggested he visit a friend, the late Stanley Marcus of Neiman Marcus fame, in Texas.', '“Stanley said he would love to have me down, and I jumped at the chance,” Bruce said. “They let me see everything, and I even ate in the executive dining room. They couldn’t have been nicer.”', 'Uncle Lloyd also suggested a trip to New York City to meet with buyers and brands. “I didn’t know anything, so I asked a lot of questions,” Bruce said. “I called on a lot of vendors and got to know what they thought. I did that for a couple of weeks, and I learned a lot.”', 'But specific advice was sometimes hard to come by. “I learned the most from my dad, but you had to know him,” Bruce said. “He was smart, but he didn’t want to interfere with anything. When I was made president, he almost stopped coming to the store. It was a sink-or-swim deal for me.”', 'Now with his own sons at the helm, Bruce acknowledged that he still liked to “go around and ask about everything….I [would] get to know the store manager and look around different departments. Of course, I can’t know everyone now, but they know Mr. Bruce. I’m walking around in their way all\xa0the time.”', 'Amid a period of great growth, Bruce and team took the company public in 1971, debuted the first Nordstrom Rack in 1973, and continued expansion throughout the U.S., in particular during the growth years throughout Washington, Oregon, Alaska and California, when Bruce led the business, before he officially retired in 1995.', 'His retirement was somewhat short-lived, though, as he returned to the chairman role in the year 2000 during a rocky time for the company — and then he retired for good in 2006.', 'Through much of its national expansion, which started on the West Coast, the Nordstroms resisted the temptation to open a flagship in Manhattan, figuring it would be too costly, overly complicated and posing lots of challenges and headaches that typically arise with new construction in New York City.', 'Bruce, however, at some point became an advocate for opening in Manhattan. The store would bring great brand awareness to the New York crowd and tourists, and help the merchants stay closer to designers and showrooms in the city.', 'The family ultimately embarked on a multiyear search for a site, examining several possibilities, including Wall Street, the East Side and even Hudson Yards on the far West Side, where the family got close to signing a lease and backed away from it. Instead, Neiman Marcus opened on the site in March 2019 but closed it just over a year later.', '“Bruce was very pro-New York and the opportunity it presented,” Harrison said, noting that the Seattle-based company had already ringed the metro area with stores that operate in Roosevelt Field shopping center in Garden City, Long Island; the Westchester Mall in White Plains, N.Y., and Garden State Plaza in Paramus, N.J.', '“He did pass on the Hudson Yards site, but it would have been perfect for the Nordstrom customer,” considering Nordstrom’s broader merchandise approach, rather than the more narrowly focused luxury-oriented Neiman’s, Harrison said.', 'After rejecting Hudson Yards, Nordstrom in October 2019 opened a seven-level, 320,000-square-foot women’s flagship at 225 West 57th Street, across from the\xa0much smaller Nordstrom’s men’s store,\xa0which launched in\xa0April 2018. The two locations remain Nordstrom’s only department stores in New York City.', 'I spent my entire career trying to live up to the standards that Bruce Nordstrom established as the bellwether of the shoe business.”', 'Sam Edelman', 'Bruce was present for the much-anticipated Big Apple debut in 2019. At the opening party, he said, “That building is a culmination of efforts and experiences. All the accomplishments, all the times you stubbed your toe. It’s sobering and humbling for a guy like me who’s been there the whole time.”', 'Not surprisingly, Manhattan was Nordstrom’s costliest project, reportedly hovering around $1 billion, far exceeding initial estimates. While the early weeks in business saw good traffic, generated by enormous local curiosity and expectations, COVID-19 took its toll on Nordstrom and other retailers, and stifled the Manhattan flagship’s ability to build a firm customer base. Recently, however, the Nordstroms have cited improving business at the location, as tourists and office workers return in larger numbers to the city.', '“Bruce was a great merchant. He had a vision that built a remarkable company. Not only that, he was a wonderful person and a lot of fun to compete against,” recalled Ken Hicks, executive chairman and former CEO of Academy Sports + Outdoors, and former CEO of Foot Locker and senior executive at JCPenney, Payless ShoeSource and May Department Stores.', 'On Bruce’s personal management style, Hicks commented: “He was very up front, candid, honest, open and not vindictive or tricky as sometimes people can be when you compete against them. He personified integrity, and passed that along to his kids.”', '“On behalf of everyone at Caleres, we are saddened by the loss of Bruce Nordstrom,” said Jay Schmidt, president and CEO of Caleres.\xa0“Under his leadership, Nordstrom grew into an outstanding retailer with an amazing culture of superior merchandising and customer service.”', 'Sam Edelman, cofounder and creative director of his eponymous brand, added, “I spent my entire career trying to live up to the standards that Bruce Nordstrom established as the bellwether of the shoe business.\xa0This is a deep loss to both the industry and his family.”', 'Kenneth Cole, founder and chief creative officer of Kenneth Cole Productions, said Sunday, “It’s truly remarkable how Bruce Nordstrom and his family (under his leadership), have forever transformed the shoe and fashion industry. Their revolutionary vision has completely reshaped the way fashion is presented, sold, and customer service is delivered. Today, the industry owes a great deal of gratitude to Bruce Nordstrom for his inspiring & visionary leadership and mentorship.”', 'Erik and Pete Nordstrom will miss the guidance and wisdom of their father whose demise comes at what could be considered a pivotal moment for the business. Last month, Nordstrom Inc. confirmed that the brothers are looking to take the retailer private and that a special committee has been formed to evaluate their proposal and any others that could arise.', 'The board indicated that a range of possible avenues for advancing shareholder value would be examined. “Nordstrom Inc. is committed to enhancing shareholder value and regularly evaluates a wide range of strategic, financial and operational alternatives as the company continues to execute its strategic plan,” the board stated. The board’s special committee retained Morgan Stanley & Co. and Centerview Partners as financial advisers and Sidley Austin LLP and Perkins Coie LLP as legal counsel.', 'Nordstrom’s corporate strategy largely revolves around opening new Rack stores, digital growth and increasing comparable-store sales. Rack has 22 new stores planned for this year on top of the 19 opened in 2023.', 'According to a regulatory filing, the Nordstrom brothers’ individual and combined ownership of the company stood at less than 5 percent in February, when they told the board of their desire to make a proposal. They also agreed that any going private transaction would have to be approved by investors holding a majority of the shares not controlled by the family.', 'The filing also indicated that, due to the health of Bruce, the Nordstrom brothers acquired shared beneficial ownership of 1,555,200 shares of common stock by accepting trusteeship of the 1976 Bruce A. Nordstrom Trust. They also acquired shared beneficial ownership of 6,935,360 shares of common stock by accepting the trusteeship of the Frances W. Nordstrom Trust.', 'He respected his competition, but he also clearly understood what his strengths were — his sellers on the floor.”', 'Michael Gould, ex-chairman and CEO of Bloomingdale’s', 'All told, the Nordstrom brothers on a combined basis are currently the beneficial owners of an aggregate of 15,538,791 shares of the company’s common stock, representing 9.52 percent of the outstanding shares.', '“Today, we mourn the loss of an industry titan who I have admired for his dedication to family, colleagues, product excellence, and an unwavering passion for serving the customer,” said Macy’s Inc. chairman and CEO Tony Spring. “We offer our heartfelt condolences to the entire Nordstrom family.”', '“He built an incredible business. The linchpin was customer service,” said Michael Gould, ex-chairman and CEO of Bloomingdale’s. Earlier in Gould’s career, when he ran the former JW Robinson’s on the West Coast, both Robinson’s and Nordstrom’s had several stores in the same shopping centers. “We always wanted to be in malls together because we felt we could be the right partners there,” Gould recalled. They could cohabit the same center with Bloomingdale’s having a reputation for designer and contemporary offerings, and Nordstrom being on the more traditional side, back then.', 'Gould recalled Bruce once saying to someone, “Just tell Mike that he has better buyers, and I have better sellers. But I knew Bruce didn’t mean it as a dig. He was being honest. Nordstrom having the best people on the selling floor, that described Nordstrom to a T. He respected his competition, but he also clearly understood what his strengths were — his sellers on the floor.”', 'Aside from his retail leadership, Bruce was a billionaire philanthropist, and served as president of the Children’s Hospital Foundation and Seattle Goodwill. He also once served as chairman of the United Way of King County Campaign and president of the Downtown Seattle Association.', 'Bruce Nordstrom is survived by his wife Jeannie; his sister Anne Gittinger; his sons Pete and Erik; daughter-in laws Brandy, Julie and Molly; and seven grandchildren, Alex, Andy, Leigh, Sam, Sara, Micki and Chet.', 'The family has not yet released details on funeral arrangements.', '— With contributions from Lisa Lockwood and Katie Abel', 'Best of WWD', 'Inside the Demise of Lord & Taylor\xa0', 'COVID-19 Spikes Elevate Retail Concerns', ""Selfridges' New Owners Bank On a Retail Renaissance in City Centers""]"

He said his company recently had begun using Manhattan Associates’ Point of Sale retail software, a relatively minor part of Manhattan’s business compared to its transportation management and warehouse management systems, which are industry juggernauts.', 'But Bob, the CIO at the retailer, had a problem. The retailer had been purchased a few years back by a much bigger company, publicly traded in fact. And as the new owners reviewed the technical capabilities of the purchased business, they saw one particular supply chain issue: The only person at the company who knew the ins and outs of the Point of Sale software was the guy who had written it decades earlier. And that guy was Bob.', 'So here he was at Momentum, a new Point of Sale customer for Manhattan Associates, but more importantly, part of the supply chain migration away from spreadsheets and other old applications and on to platforms that provide “convergence” — migrating key applications to a single platform to drive efficiency.', 'While Bob in his lunchtime chat at the conference here this week didn’t use the word “convergence,” the need for a system that could work smoothly with processes at his now larger company clearly met the definition of the term as laid out by Brock Johns.', 'Johns is a director analyst for supply chain technology at Gartner (NYSE: IT), the research firm whose placement of companies such as Manhattan into Gartner’s “Magic Quadrant” research reports is considered analogous to a triple A rating in the software industry. Magic Quadrant status is considered a big achievement, which makes Johns an important person in the world of transportation management systems.', 'In a presentation at Momentum about the state of transportation management, Johns talked about the levels of convergence.', 'Level 1 applications are basic solutions, such as key performance indicators (KPIs). But as a company moves up to Level 5 and the applications become more complex, convergence among the company’s operations becomes possible through greater adoption of technology that in turn is increasingly complex itself.', 'The result, Johns said, illustrating the process with an arrow, is that while convergence between warehouse management systems and transportation management systems was possible in the past, it is now spreading to activities such as yard management systems that are converging with TMS and WMS. The last addition to the arrow was supply chain planning.', '“Some of these things have come to fruition, and that’s where we really start to see a lot of the benefits,” Johns said, describing convergence as “bringing all these different parts of functional silos together.” And it’s happening, Johns said, because “we’re seeing the technology architectures change.”', 'The pace of change is “tremendous,” he added. As convergence occurs, it raises the prospect of a more integrated planning approach to a company’s supply chain.', 'But not everybody can do that. Companies that can use the convergence of various tools such as WMS and TMS are more “mature,” according to Johns.', '“They’re more forward-looking,” he said. “They’re trying to figure out, how do we get ahead? How do we improve our current state? One of the ways to do that is to better align that execution function.”', 'On a slide Johns presented, the goal of the convergence was spelled out: “Align the function of supply chain planning to supply chain execution.” His presentation made it clear that he believes convergence is making that possible.', 'But the solution is not just technology, Johns said. Part of it comes in culture.', '“How do we get the folks in other functional areas to come sit at the table?” he said. “How do we talk about shared data, shared information?”', 'A day earlier at Momentum, Bart De Muynck, a longtime independent supply chain consultant, spoke on a panel about supply chain execution and bringing in the disparate parts of a company’s supply chain. One of the clients he described sounded like an example of the need to share data and processes that Johns discussed.', 'Without identifying the company, De Muynck said he and the company’s executives realized that “to get more productivity out of our digital operations, we needed to get more visibility.” The lack of visibility was most stark in the fact that orders for particular products, some of them with strong demand, would come down to the sales team with a lead time of “like a few days.”', 'But the company’s planners had information about likely demand for the product, and it wasn’t shared. “The problem was the supply chain planning systems didn’t talk to the TMS system,” De Muynck said.', 'The fix wasn’t easy. “We ended up building something, but it took us about two years,” he said. “I’m not going to mention how many millions of dollars it cost us to build something in between the company’s [enterprise resource planning] that connected the supply chain planning systems to the TMS. We finally got something, but imagine if you have these systems that talk to each other. You wouldn’t have to go through all these challenges.”', 'And that was one of the points of Johns’ presentation about convergence: It is happening but not everywhere.', 'A day after Warren Barkley of Google (NASDAQ: GOOG) spoke about the AI capabilities that can be brought to bear on supply chains, Johns brought AI into his presentation on what’s brewing in transportation management.', 'He spelled out a few specific applications: using generative AI to create written content, such as drafting KPIs; writing standard operating procedure manuals; using chatbots (which Barkley also discussed); and summarizing meetings and communications.', 'But Johns was notably less boastful than Barkley about the prospects for AI in supply chain management.', 'He noted that AI is not just generative AI. Examples such as KPIs were “primary use cases.” But he added, “You’ve got people in your organization and on your team that think GenAI is going to solve world hunger, and it will not.”', '“These are things that can help us do processes better. They can help us have a better user experience,” Johns said. “There will be more use cases in logistics.” But for now, Johns said, there may be value in “pumping the brakes.”', 'More articles by John Kingston', 'New Class 8 truck orders in April up from a year ago, down from March', 'Truck transportation jobs break 6-month string of gains with slight loss', 'RXO, still suffering from weak market, touts Q1 volume growth', 'The post ‘Convergence’ key to efficient supply chain systems, Gartner exec says appeared first on FreightWaves.']"

This was accompanied by buy signals from nearly every indicator that we follow, including those that measure the “internals” of the stock market.', 'The S&P 500 staying above 5,260 will confirm the breakout and should create a support area at 5,200-5,260. Below that, there are other support areas, but if this breakout should fail, then a close below 5,070 would be highly negative. That doesn’t seem likely in the short term.', '‘Our prenup stirred up resentment’: My husband, 62, lives in my home. I pay for his credit card, car loan, vacations and groceries.

This now begins a new process that may result in an MVB sell signal, although it takes a while for the process to play out. First, the S&P 500 must close below the +3σ Band, which would create a “classic” sell signal (we don’t trade those). Then the index would have to decline further in order to confirm an MVB sell signal.', 'Equity-only put-call ratios are finally on confirmed buy signals for stocks as well. The standard ratio had moved to a buy signal a little over a week ago, but the weighted ratio did not achieve “official” bullish status from our computer analysis programs until just a couple of days ago. These ratios will remain bullish on the stock market as long as they continue to decline.', 'Market breadth has been extremely strong. Both breadth oscillators are on buy signals and are in deeply overbought territory. It is fine for these oscillators to be overbought when the S&P 500 is beginning a new leg upward. They could probably withstand two and maybe even three days of negative breadth and still maintain their buy signals.', 'Cumulative volume breadth (CVB) continues to make new all-time highs, thus confirming the new highs by the S&P 500. This indicator gave a buy signal a couple of weeks ago, with the target being new highs for the index. That has been fulfilled, so positions bought in line with that particular buy signal should be closed.', 'The number of new highs on the NYSE has continued to dominate the number of new lows. In fact, new highs have been greater than 100 for nine days in a row. That’s quite a long streak. In any case, this indicator remains bullish on stocks. The buy signal would be stopped out if new lows on the NYSE exceeded new highs for two consecutive days.', 'VIX VIX has continued to decline as this rally has unfolded. A “spike peak” buy signal (for stocks) was registered on April 22 and is still in effect. By the rules of the trading system that we designed around spike peaks on the VIX chart, this signal will remain in place for 22 trading days — or for another week or so. In addition, a new trend of VIX buy signal (for stocks) has been registered as of yesterday’s close. That’s because the 20-day moving average of VIX crossed below the 200-day MA. It is marked with a circle on the accompanying VIX chart. I’m not really too thrilled about entering a trending signal on VIX when VIX is already so low, but the signal is in effect.', 'The construct of volatility derivatives remains bullish for stocks, too. The term structures of the CBOE Volatility Indices and of the VIX futures continue to slope upwards.

Additionally, some international tobacco firms operate in the country through subsidiaries.', 'Cigarette Volumes Under Pressure: The tobacco industry is grappling with challenges related to the inflationary environment, which has significantly influenced consumer spending habits. Economic factors such as inflation, increased interest rates, and Adult Tobacco Consumers’ dynamics, including changing purchasing patterns, the adoption of smoke-free products, and shifts in disposable income, have affected cigarette sales volumes.', 'Additionally, stringent government regulations on sales, marketing, and manufacturing, prompted by the health hazards of nicotine consumption, have further impacted volumes. Some guidelines issued by the FDA include the mandatory use of precautionary labels on cigarette packets and self-critical advertisements. As cigarette sales constitute a significant portion of revenues for tobacco industry companies, the decrease in sales volumes within this category raises concerns.', 'Escalated Costs: Numerous industry participants have been affected by cost inflation.

The continued popularity and resilience of these products are expected to drive positive outcomes for industry players amid ongoing business transformations.', 'Pricing Power: Players in the tobacco industry have been leveraging the strong pricing influence of tobacco products, which also helps them make up for high taxes and soft cigarette sales volumes. Since smokers tend to be less responsive to price hikes due to their addiction, this approach is anticipated to continue benefiting companies within the tobacco sector.

The primary results showed that treatment with Tezspire led to a 17% numerical reduction in the annual rate of moderate or severe COPD exacerbations compared to placebo at week 52, which was not statistically significant (90% CI: -6, 36; p[1-sided]=0.1042). The results will be featured in presentations at the American Thoracic Society (ATS) International Conference, May 17-22, in San Diego.', 'Importantly, this proof-of-concept study showed that, in patients with BEC ≥150 cells/µL, tezepelumab led to a nominally significant reduction of 37% in the rate of moderate or severe exacerbations compared to placebo. Studies suggest that approximately 65% of bio-eligible patients with COPD have a BEC ≥150 cells/μL. Among patients with BEC ≥300 cells/µL, tezepelumab led to a numerical reduction of 46% in the rate of moderate or severe exacerbations (Table 1). Trends towards improved outcomes were also seen with tezepelumab use for pre-bronchodilator FEV1 and SGRQ total score.', '""Despite advances in treatments for patients with COPD,\xa0there is still a pressing need for effective therapies that can improve their clinical outcome, especially for those with eosinophil counts above 150 cells/µL,"" said Jay Bradner, M.D., executive vice president of Research and Development and chief scientific officer at Amgen. ""We are now actively planning a Phase 3 clinical program evaluating tezepelumab in patients with COPD.""', ""A subgroup analysis of the COURSE trial also showed treatment with tezepelumab resulted in numerical improvements in lung function as measured by forced expiratory volume (FEV1) (improvement of 63 mL and 146 mL in BEC ≥150 and ≥300 cells/μL respectively, compared to placebo) and in quality of life as measured by the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) score (reduction of 4.2 points and 9.5 points in BEC ≥150 and ≥300 cells/μL respectively). The safety and tolerability profile for tezepelumab was consistent with its approved severe asthma indication; the most frequently reported (>10%) adverse events for tezepelumab were worsening of COPD (12.1%) and incidents of COVID-19 infections (14.5%) (this trial commenced in July 2019) (Table 2)."", '""I believe biologics will play a critical role in the future care of COPD, and trials such as the tezepelumab COURSE trial are central to understanding and shaping the treatment landscape,"" said Dr. Dave Singh, professor of respiratory pharmacology at the University of Manchester and lead investigator on the trial.

The trial included a post-treatment follow-up period of 12 weeks.', 'About Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)COPD refers to a group of lung diseases, including chronic bronchitis and emphysema, that cause airflow blockage and breathing-related problems. COPD is a major public health threat that affects an estimated 391 million people around the world, with global costs connected to the disease expected to rise to US $4.8 trillion by 2030. COPD is a highly complex disease with multiple pathways and disease drivers, and a single COPD exacerbation can increase the risk of hospitalization. Baseline blood eosinophil counts are a key factor in how physicians select optimal treatments for COPD. Approximately 65% of patients with COPD who are eligible for biologic treatment have a BEC >150 cells/µL, 20-40% have a BEC >300 cells/µL.', 'About TEZSPIRE®\xa0(tezepelumab-ekko)TEZSPIRE is a first-in-class human monoclonal antibody that works on the primary source of inflammation: the airway epithelium, which is the first point of contact for viruses, allergens, pollutants and other environmental insults. Specifically, TEZSPIRE targets and blocks thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), a key epithelial cytokine that sits at the top of multiple inflammatory cascades and initiates an overreactive immune response to allergic, eosinophilic and other types of airway inflammation associated with severe asthma. TSLP is released in response to multiple triggers associated with asthma exacerbations, including allergens, viruses and other airborne particles.', 'Expression of TSLP is increased in the airways of patients with asthma and has been correlated with disease severity.\xa0Blocking TSLP may prevent the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines by immune cells, resulting in the prevention of asthma exacerbations and improved asthma control. By working at the top of the cascade, TEZSPIRE helps stop inflammation at the source and has the potential to treat a broad population of severe asthma patients.', 'Beyond severe asthma, TEZSPIRE is also in development for other potential indications including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, chronic spontaneous urticaria and eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE).

At the press event, he said faster AI assistants that run directly on a PC will be ""the most compelling reason to upgrade your PC in a long time.""', 'Global PC shipments dipped about 15% to 242 million last year, according to research firm Gartner, which suggests Microsoft expects the new category of computers to account for around one-fifth of all PCs sold.', '""People just need to be convinced that the device experience alone justifies this entirely new category of Copilot+ machines,” said analyst Ben Bajarin of Creative Strategies.', 'Microsoft\'s new ""Copilot+"" computer marketing category that highlights AI features is reminiscent of the ""Ultrabook"" category of thin-form Windows laptops that Intel promoted with PC manufacturers in 2011 to compete against Apple\'s MacBook Air.', 'Microsoft executives also said that GPT-4o, the latest technology from ChatGPT maker OpenAI, will ""soon"" be available as part of Copilot.', ""Microsoft also introduced a new generation of its own Surface Pro tablet and Surface Laptop that feature Qualcomm chips based on Arm Holdings' architecture. It also introduced a technology called Prism that will help software written for Intel and AMD chips run on chips made with Arm technology."", 'Microsoft showed its new devices in action against an Apple device, showing photo editing software from Adobe running faster on the Microsoft device. Apple earlier this month showed a new AI-focused chip that analysts expect to be used in future laptops.', ""After Intel's processors dominated the PC market for decades, Qualcomm and other makers of lower-power Arm components have tried to compete in the Windows-PC market."", ""The Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite chips include a so-called neural processing unit designed to accelerate AI-focused applications, such as Microsoft's Copilot software."", 'Microsoft held the product event a day before its annual developer conference.', 'Microsoft aims to extend its early advantage in the race to produce AI tools that consumers are willing to pay for. Its partnership with OpenAI allowed it to jump ahead of Alphabet as they race to dominate the field.', ""Last week, OpenAI and Alphabet's Google showcased dueling AI technologies that can respond via voice in real time and be interrupted, both hallmarks of realistic voice conversations that AI voice assistants have found challenging. Google also announced it was rolling out several generative AI features to its lucrative search engine."", ""Windows PC makers have been under increasing pressure from Apple since the company launched its custom chips based on designs from Arm and ditched Intel's processors. The Apple-designed processors have given Mac computers superior battery life and speedier performance than rivals' chips."", ""Microsoft tapped Qualcomm to lead the effort to move the Windows operating system to Arm's chip designs in 2016. Qualcomm has exclusivity on Microsoft Windows devices that expires this year. Other chip designers such as Nvidia have efforts under way to make their own Arm-based PC chips, Reuters has previously reported."", '(Reporting by Max A.

It just doesn't need Boeing (NYSE: BA), Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT), or Northrop Grumman (NYSE: NOC) to build them. That's the surprising upshot of a new contract announcement out of the Pentagon last month, in which the government chose none of its three leading publicly traded defense contractors to do the work -- and picked privately held General Atomics and Anduril instead."", 'For Boeing, Lockheed, and Northrop, the damage from this decision is substantial: At least $30 billion in lost potential revenues.', 'The Air Force calls the contract in question its Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) program, in which the aircraft that will be ""collaborating"" are piloted fighter jets, and their armed military drone sidekicks. All five of the named companies submitted drone designs to the Air Force for consideration. These five designs have now been winnowed down to two -- General Atomics\' ""Gambit"" drone and Anduril\'s ""Fury"" -- and those two companies will now proceed to build prototypes for further evaluation.', ""USAF intends to then pick at least one of these prototypes to order sometime in fiscal year 2026, meaning a decision could happen as early as next year. (The Pentagon's fiscal year begins on October 1, 2025.)"", 'Whoever wins that contest stands to inherit a real windfall of cash. As Breaking Defense reported in March, the Air Force wants to equip each of its 300 F-35 stealth fighter jets, plus a further 200 Next Generation Air Dominance fighters (a plane yet to be built) with two CCA drones each -- so 1,000 drones in all.', 'With an estimated $30 million production cost per drone, that makes CCA potentially a $30 billion program.', 'And that\'s just to start with. BD notes that 1,000 drones is just the Air Force\'s initial requirement through ""the end of the decade."" As CCAs are damaged or obsolesced, they will need to be replaced. Additionally, the U.S. currently possesses more than 450 F-35s, and intends to eventually fly nearly 2,500 of them.', 'Over time, the CCA program could theoretically grow five times in size -- and five times in value, to as much as $180 billion -- just by equipping pairing its F-35s with two drone wingmen apiece.', 'It\'s hard to overstate how bad this news looks for Boeing, Lockheed, and Northrop. ""$180 billion"" -- that\'s a number roughly equal to the entire annual revenue of all three of these giant defense contractors, combined, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. Admittedly, with the money spread out over six years, from now through 2030, the annual lost revenue is smaller, but it\'s still a pretty big number.', 'But all is not yet lost.', 'General Atomics and/or Anduril will supply CCA\'s initial requirement for 1,000 military drones. But as the Air Force noted, ""the companies not selected to build these production representative CCA vehicles, and execute the flight test program, will continue to be part of the broader industry partner vendor pool consisting of more than 20 companies to compete for future efforts, including future production contracts.""', ""So it's entirely possible that Boeing, Lockheed, and Northrop could still find work as subcontractors for whoever wins the first production contract(s). It's also possible that as the CCA program grows in size and expands beyond its initial requirements, the contract will be recompeted, and the publicly traded defense stocks will get a second bite at the apple."", ""In the meantime, however, momentum clearly favors the non-publicly traded defense contractors, General Atomics and Anduril. They've won the first round, and have pole position heading into the next round. At this point, investors' best bet on benefiting from the Pentagon's biggest-ever military drone program may be to hope for an Anduril IPO."", 'Before you buy stock in Northrop Grumman, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Northrop Grumman wasn’t one of them.

Over the past few years, 3M raised the payout by only a few cents at a time. It meant investors were receiving less income because of the ravaging effects of rampant inflation. To return some value to shareholders, 3M recently spun off its healthcare business Solventum (NYSE:SOLV) into a separately traded company.', 'However, the unit was responsible for 30% of 3M’s cash flows.

However, unit price growth probably won't be too difficult.

This week’s list includes Walmart’s WMT, Target TGT, Amazon AMZN and Nvidia NVDA.', 'Walmart’s beat-and-raise quarterly release should ordinarily provide favorable read-throughs for Target, which is scheduled to report results before the market’s open on Wednesday, May 22nd. But the two companies have different business models, and that makes expectations off target.', 'To start, Walmart has effectively added a technological component to its well-established reputation for value. Walmart’s digital prowess has allowed it to offer a variety of convenient shopping options, allowing it to gain market share, with mostly high-income households finding the company’s service offerings hard to resist. The company’s revenues in the quarter increased +5.8% (in constant currency), with digital sales up +21% from the same period last year.', 'Another major point of distinction between the two retailers is their merchandise mix, with Walmart heavily weighted towards groceries and Target towards discretionary merchandise. Walmart enjoyed mid-single-digit same-store sales growth in the latest quarter, with the aforementioned high-income households attracted to the retailer for its convenient delivery and pick-up options.', 'Walmart’s general merchandise, which can roughly be considered comparable to the bulk of Target’s merchandise mix, continued to show soft results, with same-store sales down in the low single digits in the quarter. Most analysts expect Target to show low single-digit same-store sales declines but also expect some sequential improvement in the trend line', 'Target is expected to bring in $2.05 in EPS on $24.5 billion in revenues, with earnings unchanged from the year-ago period on -3.2% lower revenues. The stock was up big following each of the last two quarterly releases in March and November, as can be seen in the one-year performance chart below relative to Walmart and the Zacks Retail sector.', 'With respect to the Retail sector 2024 Q1 earnings season scorecard, we now have results from 23 of the 34 retailers in the S&P 500 index. Regular readers know that Zacks has a dedicated stand-alone economic sector for the retail space, which is unlike the placement of the space in the Consumer Staples and Consumer Discretionary sectors in the Standard & Poor’s standard industry classification.', 'The Zacks Retail sector includes not only Walmart, Target, and other traditional retailers, but also online vendors like Amazon and restaurant players.', 'Total Q1 earnings for these 23 retailers that have reported are up +38.7% from the same period last year on +6.4% higher revenues, with 69.6% beating EPS estimates and 56.5% beating revenue estimates.', 'Walmart beat both EPS and revenue estimates, but Home Depot missed on revenues. Aside from these two ‘conventional’ retailers, the scorecard at this stage primarily reflects the Q1 performance of the digital players and restaurant operators. As the above beats data shows, these companies have struggled to beat EPS and revenue estimates in Q1.', 'In fact, Q1 EPS and revenue beats percentages for these players remain below the average for this group of companies over the preceding 20 quarters (5 years) and are towards the lower end of the 5-year high-low range.', 'With respect to earnings and revenue growth rates, we like to show the group’s performance with and without Amazon, whose results are among the 23 companies that have already reported. As we know, Amazon’s Q1 earnings were up +278.7% on +12.5% higher revenues, beating top- and bottom-line expectations.', 'As we all know, digital and brick-and-mortar operators have been converging for some time now, with Amazon now a decent-sized brick-and-mortar operator after Whole Foods and Walmart a growing online vendor. This long-standing trend got a huge boost from the Covid lockdowns.', 'As noted earlier, we have started seeing signs of stress at the lower-end of income distribution, and one can intuitively project moderation in consumer spending as the economy further slows down under the weight of tighter monetary conditions.

Further, the latest print represented a substantial drop from March’s result of 315,000 jobs added. As well, the unemployment rate ticked up to 3.9%. Expectations called for the rate to hold steady at 3.8%.', 'On one hand, this dynamic means that the Fed finally may have the excuse to lower interest rates. But on the other hand, a slowing economy could reward some enterprises over others. With that in mind, below are stocks to buy following April’s lackluster report.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Source: George Sheldon / Shutterstock.com', 'As a retailer of brand name merchandise at reduced rates, Ollie’s Bargain Outlet (NASDAQ:OLLI) offers a viable idea for stocks to buy. Under a challenging economic environment, it’s not that people are not opening their wallets. Rather, they want to do so with the least pain possible. The dynamic suits OLLI to a “T,” making it an attractive idea.', 'Certainly, the company deserves consideration thanks to its consistent performances. In fiscal 2024, the company’s average positive earnings surprise came out to 8.6%. It’s not the most sterling print ever. However, what I appreciate about Ollie is that it’s consistently profitable and it gets the job done.', 'For this consistency, OLLI stock trades at a trailing-year revenue multiple of 2.3X. That’s really hot for the industry and it’s one of the items that’s not on sale here. Still, analysts project solid fiscal expansion this year, with earnings per share landing at $3.21 on revenue of $2.27 billion. Last year, the company posted EPS of $2.91 on sales of $2.1 billion.', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'Falling under the apparel retail space, Ross Stores (NASDAQ:ROST) is an off-price department store retailer. At first glance, it might not seem that relevant of an idea. However, with the unemployment rate ticking higher, it implies that more companies are not hiring and even laying folks off. If that’s the case, people need to dress for success. Ross enables this endeavor to happen at a reduced cost.', 'While it might be an oddball narrative, the market appreciates the thesis apparently. In fiscal 2023, Ross Stores’ average positive earnings surprise came out to nearly 9%. Again, it’s not an exciting print but the company consistently beats its bottom-line targets. That’s all you can ask for during this challenging time.', 'As a retailer, ROST trades at a hot revenue multiple; we’re talking 2.21X trailing-year sales. However, analysts are looking forward to fiscal expansion for this year. EPS could reach $5.94 on sales of $21.3 billion. Last year, the company delivered earnings of $5.56 with a top line of $20.38 billion. Given the rising relevance, ROST is one of the stocks to buy.', 'Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com', 'A household goods giant, Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) benefits from everyday utility. It doesn’t matter what’s going on with the economy. Chances are, you’re going to eat. Moreover, you will engage in many other activities that require care items, which P&G provides. Further, as a family brand, the company benefits from generational awareness.', 'Basically, if your parents happened to use certain P&G products, there’s a good chance you’ll use them too. That familiarity just doesn’t apply to many other enterprises, which could give PG an edge as one of the stocks to buy. To be sure, this isn’t the most exciting company out there. However, it’s consistently profitable, yielding an average earnings surprise of 6.55% in the past four quarters since the first quarter of 2024.', 'For the current fiscal year, covering experts project EPS to land at $6.55 on sales of $84.36 billion. Last year, it delivered earnings of $5.90 per share on sales of $82.01 billion. With a forward dividend yield of 2.41%, PG makes a nice addition to your stocks to buy.', 'Source: gyn9037 / Shutterstock', 'A self-explanatory business, Grocery Outlet (NASDAQ:GO) operates in the grocery store industry. However, it distinguishes itself from the competition through its independent operations. It also offers various food categories – including fresh produce and meat – at discounted prices. Obviously, that presents an attractive business model during this challenging economic environment.', 'That said, GO stock is itself challenged. In the business week ending May 10, the company suffered a nearly 20% drop in equity value. Unfortunately, management didn’t impress with its latest Q1 earnings report. It’s a shame because, in the three quarters preceding Q1, the average earnings surprise stood at 16.8%.', 'However, with Grocery Outlet brought back to reality, it’s possible that GO could be a de-risked opportunity. It’s going to be a tough call and analysts have downgraded their expectations. Still, if the original revenue forecast for fiscal 2024 of $4.35 billion holds true, GO could be off to the races. It’s not unreasonable to think this given that consumers must spend on the essentials and thus forego discretionary items.', 'For speculators, it’s one of the stocks to buy.', 'Source: Pand P Studio / Shutterstock.com', 'A relatively small utility firm, Portland General (NYSE:POR) presents an intriguing idea for stocks to buy. As a utility company, it enjoys a natural monopoly. Basically, would-be competitors don’t even bother due to the high barriers to entry. At the same time, Portland General benefits from geographic advantages. Namely, young people are moving to more rural regions due to cost-of-living incentives.', 'In other words, Portland General – while it may be a smaller entity – is positioned where the money will be. That makes it a hidden gem among stocks to buy. Further, people must pay their utility bills and so the prioritization effect could benefit shares as well. While it’s trading flat for the year, over the past month, shares gained over 9%.', 'For the current fiscal year, experts believe EPS will reach $3.07 on revenue of $3.04 billion. Last year, the company posted earnings of $2.38 on sales of $2.92 billion. And in the following year, revenue could swing up again to $3.21 billion.', 'Portland General also carries a robust forward yield of 4.49%.', 'Source: shutterstock.com/MrIncredible', 'A terribly cynical idea for stocks to buy, Encore Capital (NASDAQ:ECPG) is a specialty finance firm. Per its public profile, Encore offers debt recovery solutions and other related services for consumers. The company purchases portfolios of defaulted consumer receivables at deep discounts to face value. It then “manages” these debts by working with individuals to repay their obligations.', 'Obviously, it’s not the most heartwarming company: no one likes being called hundreds of times to pay off financial obligations. At the same time, it’s a necessary service. Plus, consumers shouldn’t be in over their heads to begin with. However, with the challenges of the current economic cycle, you got to imagine that business will be good for Encore.', 'Indeed, for fiscal 2024, covering experts believe EPS will soar to $5.62. Last year, the company produced earnings of $2.13 per share. Further, the high-side target calls for $5.76 per share. On the top line, revenue could hit $1.41 billion, up 15.1% from last year’s print of $1.22 billion.', 'As an employment services specialist, Robert Half (NYSE:RHI) presents an interesting business. Yes, it’s somewhat controversial among some circles, with the criticism that it fleeces the flock. However, that’s really the case for any middleman entity. Still, in the current environment, Robert Half could rise to the forefront with its focus on accounting and similar roles.', 'As The Wall Street Journal pointed out, white-collar jobs are harder to get these days. That’s probably going to be truer as the months tick by. With companies suffering from economic troubles themselves, layoffs could materialize. Naturally, this dynamic suggests that the labor market could become much more competitive. That’s when Robert Half could flex its muscles with its connections.', 'To be sure, RHI represents the riskiest idea arguably on this list of stocks to buy. Currently, analysts rate shares as a consensus moderate sell. That’s based on downward expectations for earnings and revenue in fiscal 2024. However, a recovery could take place in fiscal 2025.', 'Still, what if the recovery occurred earlier than expected? That’s the crux of the buy argument for Robert Half.', 'On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\xa0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\xa0Publishing Guidelines.', 'A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Enterprise is preparing for growth with nearly $7 billion of major projects under construction."", ""Valuation shouldn't get in the way of Enterprise's growth either.

Applications in generative AI are fueling a new wave of demand for cloud storage, server racks, network infrastructure, and more.', 'While Nvidia is a major provider of data center services, other players are emerging with formidable solutions. Moreover, even big tech giants, such as Amazon, are investing significant sums into building their own data centers. Savvy investors understand that there are a host of opportunities making inroads in the growing data center realm -- a market expected to reach nearly $440 billion by 2028, according to Statista.', 'Stock analyst and media personality Jim Cramer recently named Constellation Energy (NASDAQ: CEG) as a top pick for data center services. While this may seem a bit out of the ordinary, Constellation Energy is currently discussing some interesting partnerships and could very well emerge as a big winner of the AI data center boom.', 'Below is an exploration of how the company could play a major role in the data center arena and whether now is a good time to scoop up some shares.', 'Data centers act as storage units for IT architecture and network infrastructure. These buildings house larger server racks that are filled with hardware such as graphics processing units (GPUs), which are used for accelerated computing.', ""While data centers play an integral role in the AI ecosystem, there's one big drawback: Data centers use a lot of electricity."", 'According to the Department of Energy, data centers use anywhere between 10 to 50 times more energy than a standard commercial office. This translates into roughly 2% of the total electricity consumption in the U.S.', 'Research from Goldman Sachs suggests that data center power demand will increase at a 15% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) through 2030 -- at which point it would reach approximately 8% of total power demand in the U.S. by 2030.', 'Considering that the secular tailwinds fueling AI are directly correlated to rising energy consumption -- electricity, in particular -- data centers are in need of an alternative solution sooner rather than later. Constellation Energy might just have the answer.', 'The company operates across many aspects of the energy industry including solar, wind, and natural gas. But another solution Constellation Energy brings to the table is nuclear power. And the best part? Big tech is interested.', 'During Constellation Energy\'s most recent earnings call, management alluded that the company is in discussions with ""Magnificent Seven"" members Microsoft and Alphabet about potentially partnering on nuclear-powered data centers.', 'Furthermore, Goldman affirmed rising interest in nuclear power, calling it ""an attractive generation source for data centers given it is zero carbon and reliable.""', ""As of the time of this writing, Constellation Energy was trading at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 28.4 -- well above the S&P 500's P/E of 24.8."", 'Furthermore, after benchmarking Constellation Energy against other regulated utilities, the company appears to be trading at a premium relative to some of its competitors.', ""While Constellation Energy might be pricey compared to other utilities, I see the company as an under-the-radar opportunity among AI investments. Although there will be obvious investment choices among big tech and peripheral competitors in IT infrastructure, energy stocks shouldn't be forgotten when it comes to AI."", 'For this reason, Constellation Energy might be seen as a better value compared to many technology stocks which have seen valuation multiples expand dramatically over the last year as AI tailwinds have fueled buying activity.', ""Considering nuclear power is garnering the interest of the biggest AI enterprises, I wouldn't overlook the energy sector, in general."", ""Given Constellation Energy's relationship with big tech and its capabilities at the intersection of data center services and nuclear power, I see the stock as an attractive buying opportunity for long-term investors."", 'Before you buy stock in Constellation Energy, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Constellation Energy wasn’t one of them.

Over the past year, they have gone from a peak above $90 a barrel to a low point in the $60s. That volatility can have a significant impact on the earnings produced by oil companies.', ""However, some oil stocks are much less susceptible to the ebbs and flows of crude prices. Midstream giants Enterprise Products Partners (NYSE: EPD), Oneok (NYSE: OKE), and Enbridge (NYSE: ENB) stand out to a few Fool.com contributors for the overall stability of their earnings, since they don't have much direct commodity price exposure. You won't care too much about oil prices if you own these pipeline stocks."", ""Reuben Gregg Brewer (Enterprise Products Partners): Oil and natural gas prices rise and fall dramatically over time. But demand for these fuels, which are vital to the global energy system, tends to remain fairly robust regardless of energy prices. After all, people still need power even when economic activity is weak. That's why master limited partnership (MLP) Enterprise Products Partners is such a reliable income investment."", ""Enterprise owns the energy infrastructure that helps to move oil and natural gas from where it is produced to where it gets used. It largely gets paid for the use of its assets. The price of the commodities flowing through its system is far less important than demand for those commodities. The best example of how reliable Enterprise's business is? The 25 years of annual distribution increases it has provided to unitholders."", ""That streak is backed by an investment grade-rated balance sheet. And the MLP's distributable cash flow covered its distribution by a robust 1.7 times in 2023, leaving plenty of room for adversity before there's a risk of a distribution cut. To be fair, Enterprise's 7.1% distribution yield is going to make up the lion's share of returns here. But add in distribution growth of just 3%, which is pretty reasonable to expect in the future, and you've gotten to a 10% return. That's the kind of story both income investors and growth investors (perhaps reinvesting that big yield) could get behind."", ""Matt DiLallo (Oneok): Oneok operates a diversified, integrated midstream system. The company owns 50,000 miles of natural gas, natural gas liquids, refined products, and crude oil pipelines. It also provides a variety of primarily fee-based midstream services to customers. These assets generate very stable cash flow based on the volumes flowing through its network, not the price of the underlying commodities. As long as energy demand grows, the company's earnings should keep rising, which has been the case over the past decade:"", ""Oneok's durable business model has enabled it to deliver more than 25 years of dividend stability. While the pipeline company hasn't increased its payout every year, it has grown the dividend by more than 150% over the last decade, leading its closest peers. "", ""The company is in a strong position to continue growing its earnings and dividends over the next four years. The primary catalyst is last year's $18.8 billion acquisition of Magellan Midstream Partners. That deal enhanced its diversification and growth profile. Oneok expects cost savings and commercial synergies to drive more than 20% free cash flow per share growth through 2027. The company recently sealed a smaller pipeline acquisition to accelerate its ability to capture those synergies. "", 'Oneok expects its growing free cash flow to give it the fuel to increase its already attractive 4.9%-yielding dividend by 3% to 4% annually over the next four years. In addition, the company plans to repurchase $2 billion of its shares during that timeframe. It expects to deliver those cash returns while investing in organic growth projects and strengthening its already solid balance sheet. ', 'So while oil prices might ebb and flow, Oneok should continue to grow its earnings, high-yielding dividend, and shareholder value in the coming years.', ""Neha Chamaria (Enbridge): No oil and gas stock is immune to the fluctuations in oil and gas prices, but some can withstand commodity price shocks better than others, primarily because of their business model and capital efficiency. Enbridge is one such stock: If you own it, you needn't really worry about where oil is going, as the stock is likely to reward you in the long run regardless of how oil may have fared, thanks largely to its dividends."", ""Enbridge has the largest liquids pipelines network in North America, transporting nearly 30% of all crude oil produced. It also moves large amounts of natural gas and has expansive gas distribution and storage facilities. These are regulated assets, and Enbridge provides its services under long-term contracts. In fact, as much as 97% of Enbridge's cash flows are underpinned by long-term contracts or toll settlements governed by the energy regulator. That makes its cash flows highly stable and predictable, which explains why Enbridge can afford to increase its dividend payout even amid falling oil prices. The energy infrastructure giant has increased its dividend every year for the past 29 consecutive years now and shareholders have reaped rich returns by reinvesting those dividends, as also evidenced in the chart."", ""Yet Enbridge plays it safe and pays out only around 60% to 70% of its distributable cash flows in dividends. That leaves the company with enough money to reinvest into its business and growth while ensuring its shareholders still receive bigger dividend checks every year. Overall, that makes Enbridge the kind of oil stock you can own at all times, with the stock's high dividend yield of 7.3% further adding to its appeal."", 'Before you buy stock in Enterprise Products Partners, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Enterprise Products Partners wasn’t one of them.

Companies simply rent space in a tank or cavern for a fee typically with a term of around three years. However, current market conditions and forward expectations are reinforcing the benefits of natural gas storage.', 'Today, companies with storage capacity can command higher rates in contract renewals or can directly benefit from arbitrage opportunities afforded by the futures curve. Longer term, natural gas storage will be important for meeting incremental demand for power generation from data centers (read more) and for liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports.', 'Currently, Henry Hub natural gas prices are in a fairly steep contango, which means future prices are noticeably higher than current prices. Specifically, the June 2024 contract is trading at ~$2.50 per Million British Thermal Unit (MMBtu), while the January 2025 contract is trading at $3.85/MMBtu.', 'While it’s normal for natural gas prices to be seasonally higher in the winter due to heating demand, other factors are contributing to the wider time spread. Another warm winter has led to a glut of natural gas, which is pressuring current prices. Meanwhile, future prices are being supported by expectations for stronger demand from the start-up of new LNG export capacity (read more). Removing the noise from seasonality, the June 2025 contract is trading at $3.25/MMBtu.', 'The contango in the curve makes storage more valuable as companies can buy gas today and sell it in the future at a higher price. The management team at Williams (WMB) highlighted the benefits of contango for their storage business on their recent earnings call. Management noted that they are renewing storage contracts at better rates than expected when they acquired a suite of gas storage assets from Hartree Partners for $1.95 billion earlier this year.', 'The strength in storage rates has even led Williams to consider expansion projects at existing facilities. Management has highlighted the underinvestment in storage as natural gas demand has grown. With demand likely to see a step change from LNG facilities and power generation for data centers, more storage capacity is likely needed and could be a growth opportunity.', 'ONEOK (OKE) also noted strong natural gas storage demand on its first-quarter earnings call. The company is reactivating idled storage capacity in Texas and adding to its capacity in Oklahoma. Both storage projects are supported by firm contracts that stretch beyond 2030.', 'Storage is also useful when regional natural gas prices see extreme weakness. In West Texas, natural gas prices have been mostly negative since the end of March due to oversupply and insufficient natural gas pipeline takeaway capacity. While frustrating for producers, midstream companies with storage capacity or extra space in their pipelines can profit from these temporary pricing events.

Therefore, these overpriced dividend stocks could hamper investors’ total return prospects.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Source: TY Lim / Shutterstock.com', 'Clorox (NYSE:CLX) has long been loved amongst conservative dividend growth investors looking for steady capital returns. Its household-name brands, among disinfectants, cleaning supplies and personal care products, have historically generated consistent sales even during economic downturns.', 'Clorox’s recession-proof business model is evident in its absolutely phenomenal dividend growth track record. It has 46 years of consecutive annual dividend increases. Its cleaning supplies and other day-to-day essentials stay in high demand regardless of the underlying condition of the economy. Clorox, therefore, retains exceptional pricing power. Consequently, this feat shouldn’t come as a surprise.', 'Nevertheless, CLX stock appears considerably overvalued. Its gross profit margins have been gradually getting compressed due to increased competition, dipping below 40% in recent years. Also, profitability has been worsening due to growing expenses and lackluster organic growth, which came in at just 2% in its most recent Q3 results. Thus, I find CLX a particularly overpriced dividend stock at a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 21.7.', 'Source: monticello / Shutterstock.com', 'Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) is another great example of a rock-solid company with an exceptional dividend growth history whose stock appears to be quite overpriced.

That can be attributed to the essential nature of its oral care, personal care and pet nutrition products in households worldwide.', 'Its renowned brands, such as the namesake Colgate and Palmolive, and others like Ajax, Speed Stick, and Fabuloso, have earned consumers’ trust.

Indeed, Colgate-Palmolive has increased its dividend annually for more than 60 years, demonstrating the qualities of its product portfolio.', 'That said, CL stock seems quite overpriced relative to its earnings growth prospects. Not only has it barely seen earnings grow over the past decade, but the trend will likely persist for years. Despite raising its FY2024 outlook, management sees sales growth of just 2% to 5%. With earnings growth charting a soft trajectory, I don’t see how CL stock’s forward P/E of 27.1 can be justified.', 'Source: BrandonKleinPhoto / Shutterstock.com', 'Moving from two consumer staples to a utility, Consolidated Edison (NYSE:ED) boasts one of the most extended dividend growth track records in the sector.

But he’s got tough competition in the eight-horse field, according to oddsmakers and racing analysts. Keep in mind it’s the rare horse that can win all three Triple Crown races — it’s happened just 13 times in history. The Belmont Stakes, set for June 8 this year, is the final leg.', 'Looking to place a Preakness bet? MarketWatch sought advice from professional handicappers — folks who make their livings on wagering — for some basic racing pointers. Following are eight tips they shared.', 'Buy the horse-racing bible (and read it thoroughly)', 'Investors have their go-to sources for information (including, ahem, this website). And so do horseplayers — namely, the\xa0Daily Racing Form.', 'What makes the Form invaluable is all the information it offers on every horse in every race, including past performance, pedigree and the trainers and jockeys in charge. These facts and figures constitute the basis for how every professional — and many a smart amateur — handicaps a race. Some handicappers will devote an hour to going over the Form for each race.', 'Understand that pace makes the race', 'If there’s a single factor that handicappers say shapes their view of how a race will play out, it’s the pacing. When a race appears to be dominated by speed horses that are known to rush to the front, a horse that usually hangs back may have a decided advantage. (The theory is that the speed horses will tire each other out by the time they reach the home stretch.) Conversely, when a race has lots of “closers,” a speed horse may be the best bet. (The theory is that while the closers are waiting to make their move, the speed horse will have already opened up an unbeatable gap.)', 'But how can a bettor determine the likely pace of the race? It’s about carefully reading the Form, which not only shows how horses have finished in their previous races but where they ranked at each stage (beginning, middle and end, plus other points in between) of those races.', 'Be a value investor (er, bettor)', 'For handicappers, it’s not necessarily a matter of betting on the horse that’s “best.” Rather, it’s about betting on horses that represent good value — the racing equivalent of Warren Buffett’s celebrated value-minded approach to investing. Experienced bettors are hesitant to put their money on favorites because they typically go off at low odds (and they win only about a third of the time), so the risk-and-reward equation is not an enticing one. Nor do handicappers necessarily like long shots: What good is placing a 50-1 bet if there’s really no chance the horse will win?', 'Ultimately, the ideal horse is one that goes off at higher odds than reality would suggest: a horse that should be 4-1, for example, but is instead offering an 8-1 payoff.', 'Know when to ask: ‘Who’s your daddy?‘', 'You’ll hear a lot of racing-industry folks speak about pedigree, as in a horse’s father and mother. The belief is that success breeds success — or why would there be talk of “stud fees” in the tens of thousands of dollars? Handicappers will tell you that pedigree counts, but mainly in instances where there’s not enough hard data to suggest how a horse will run. For example, if it’s the first time a horse has raced on grass (as opposed to the more common dirt track), it might be worth seeing how mom and dad handled grass.', 'Think exotic', 'If you’re just placing win-place-or-show bets, you’re probably not a professional. Serious handicappers like\xa0“exotic” bets\xa0— exactas (which means predicting the top two finishers of a race in exact order), trifectas (the top three) and superfectas (the top four). Another type of exotic involves picking the winners in multiple races — say, a Pick Three (three races in order), Pick Four (four races) or Pick Six (six races).', 'The attraction is obvious: The more complex the bet, the bigger the payoff (some winning Pick 6 wagers\xa0have paid in the millions). Given how little a straight win bet typically pays, those bigger payoffs are often the key to making real money at the track.', 'Don’t forget the jockey', 'In racing, horses don’t live in a bubble — they need a jockey to guide them from start to finish. And while handicappers generally pay more heed to the animal than the man (or woman) atop the animal, they don’t completely ignore the jockey. One handicapper advised looking for a jockey with at least a 12% winning record. That may not sound high, but in a competitive field, 12% is “a good thing,” the handicapper said.', 'Be fashionably (and profitably) late', 'Handicappers aren’t likely to be the first in line to place their bets. And there’s a reason for that — actually, two reasons. First, since odds are constantly changing, handicappers can’t fully determine the “value” until it’s gotten close to post time — like, the final two minutes. Otherwise, that 8-1 value-minded bet might end up being a not-so-valuable 4-1 wager. (Which is not to say handicappers don’t do their homework hours in advance. Nevertheless, they’re ready to adjust their betting strategy based on those last-minute odds.)', 'Also, handicappers like to take a look at the horses as they come out on the track — about 10 minutes before the race. That allows them to see if the horse is happy and ready to go (an arched neck is a good sign) or if the horse is stressed (sweating or “foaming” is a worrisome warning).', 'The smartest bet may be no bet at all', 'Sure, it’s fun to play every race. But handicappers are a selective group; they favor races where there’s value, and skip others where they just don’t see a risk worth taking. Of course, this advice best applies if you’re spending a day at the track and have several races ahead of you. With the Preakness, you’re talking a single opportunity to strike gold. So proceed with caution.', 'Rents just surged 10% in this affordable housing market.

Overconfident individuals, who overestimate the precision of their private information relative to publicly available information, are likely to make less accurate predictions.

Here's what you need to know before buying the stock."", ""The company's trailing-12-month dividend cost it about $5.4 billion, and as you can see below, following a disappointing 2023, its free cash flow (FCF) per share didn't cover its dividend last year. Clearly, that's not a sustainable situation, and investors should buy UPS stock more for where the company is going than where it just came from."", 'Though, in fairness, last year was a uniquely bad one for UPS. Its delivery volumes fell much more than management expected due to a slowing economy and a natural retraction from the boom of previous years caused by stay-at-home measures. In addition, a protracted labor dispute over a contract renewal caused customers to divert volumes in fear of strike action.', ""That said, management's plans involve significantly improving profit margins and delivery volumes and growing revenue per piece in excess of cost per piece by using technologies such as automation to consolidate facilities and smart facilities to improve productivity. In addition, UPS continues to grow its higher-margin small and medium-sized business (SMB) and healthcare-based revenue."", 'Management aims to hit FCF of $5.9 billion to $6.7 billion in 2024, and ultimately $17 billion to $18 billion from 2024 to 2026. The low end of that figure would produce an average of $5.6 billion per year, which would cover the dividend. Moreover, the guidance looks conservative given the target of $5.9 billion to $6.7 billion (before pension contributions) in 2024 and the aim of hitting roughly $7 billion in FCF in 2026.

In addition, margins should expand as they come up against the cost increases associated with the new labor contract in 2023.', ""Meanwhile, the technology investments are logical, and UPS is hitting all its internal targets for growth in healthcare and SMB revenue. On the downside, any economic deterioration, mainly when there's overcapacity in the delivery package industry, would hit UPS hard and lead to serious questions over its capital allocation strategy, starting with the dividend."", 'On the other hand, recent earnings saw management confirm that it expects a ""slight uptick"" in delivery volumes in its domestic business in the second quarter, leading into a low-single-digit increase in the second half.

A price jump can get investors excited, leading them to buy in only to see the stock fall. A drop can scare investors into selling shares of a company they had good reason to buy, leaving them to miss out on its recovery.', 'Nobody can consistently time the market, which is one of the reasons long-term buy-and-hold investing is the best way to go for retail investors.', ""Consider, for example, Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ: ULTA). The stock is down 22% over the past year, seriously underperforming the S&P 500, which is up 28% at the same time. But it has been a phenomenal stock to own over the long haul, and it has crushed the broader market's gains over the past 10 years, even with its recent drop."", 'At least one Wall Street analyst sees a major upside. Is now a good time to buy?', 'Ulta was a beauty industry disrupter when it opened its first stores more than 30 years ago, and it remains a differentiated contender in the industry today. Beauty has historically been split into two categories: upscale and expensive or mass and cheap. You would find upscale products at the department store and cheap products at the pharmacy.', ""Ulta has turned that binary on its head, selling products across a wide range of prices in its megastores, in addition to accessories. It also provides salon and beauty services that its peers don't offer."", ""The original categories still exist in this space, but today, there's a third: the direct-to-consumer segment, which ranges across both branded physical stores and e-commerce. Ulta still stands out with comprehensive offerings that straddle all three beauty categories."", ""Ulta's management understood something that's still at the core of its business: Beauty enthusiasts usually don't relegate themselves to just one category of products -- they'll purchase from all of them. In the past, a consumer would have to go to different venues for different types of products. At Ulta, they can find all of them under one roof."", ""There are two other main elements of Ulta's unique and successful model. One is its loyalty program. Beauty enthusiasts are steady in their shopping habits, and 95% of all sales at Ulta come from program members. Its services segment is also a major element of Ulta's model and reinforces loyalty."", ""Ulta has been reliably able to increase its sales and profits, but it has been struggling somewhat due to inflation. Since its customers come from a wide range of socioeconomic levels and it sells nonessential products, it's susceptible to shoppers holding back on discretionary spending when their budgets are under pressure. And since it offers wares across a wide gamut of prices, it's susceptible to its shoppers switching down when penny-pinching."", 'Considering the macroeconomic circumstances, its performance last fiscal year was admirable. Sales rose almost 10% in its fiscal 2023 (which ended Feb. 3, 2024), and more than 10% in its fiscal fourth quarter. Comparable sales increased 2.5% in Q4 -- a slowdown in growth, but still an increase.', ""The good news is that its customers are remaining loyal, even if they're buying cheaper products. That's reflected in the fact that transactions were up 4.5%, but the average ticket was down 1.9%. Ulta even managed to boost earnings per share (EPS) by 21% to $8.08, and expanded its operating margin from 13.9% in fiscal 2022 to 14.5% in fiscal 2023."", 'These earnings results were strong, but management gave a tepid outlook that disappointed investors. It guided for a 4% to 5% increase in comparable sales for fiscal 2024 with EPS of $26 to $27, which implies little to no growth. And its operating margin is expected to be in the 14% to 14.3% range -- below the 2023 level of 15%.', ""The market's strong disappointment looks more like a reaction to unmet expectations than finding fault in the business. Some companies like to provide conservative guidance so that they can beat it rather than fall short. Even if it isn't conservative, Ulta's forecast points more to external trends than problems in the business. Ulta looks healthy right now. It has plenty of growth opportunities, both from opening new stores and unlocking value from its loyal customers."", ""Currently, Ulta trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 15. It has rarely had a lower valuation, and then only briefly. Wall Street's average target price for the company over the next 12 to 18 months is 40% higher than today's price, and analyst Michael Lasser of UBS Group sees it heading 71% higher."", ""This looks like a bargain to me. Ulta could trade sideways while the macro trends are against it, but if it reports an earnings beat, the stock will jump. Still, if you're investing for the long term, that short-term move won't really matter. What does matter is that this is an excellent business trading at a low valuation, and a buying opportunity for smart investors."", 'Before you buy stock in Ulta Beauty, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Ulta Beauty wasn’t one of them.

Whether it’s waiting for the Fed, waiting for inflation, or waiting for the election, lots of investors may be holding off on making important moves. One option that may invite action right now, however, is small-caps. Small-caps combine a few important benefits and are poised to benefit from some macroeconomic trends on the horizon. So why choose small-caps?', 'See more: Where Are Asset Managers Taking on Credit Risk?', 'First, small-cap firms present some appealing upside. While large-cap firms can provide a bit more reliability given their size, they’re already done their growing. Small-cap firms aim to join that cohort, of course, and can present some serious growth opportunities.', 'For example, Textron Inc. (TXT) offers an attractive 14.1 forward P/E ratio, 12% quarterly year-over-year growth in diluted earnings per share, and has outperformed the S&P 500 Total Return index over the last year, per YCharts.

Well, those much-discussed rate cuts that did not materialize this year could do so late this year and early next. Rate cuts would benefit small-caps significantly given how much debt small-caps often take on to grow. Small-cap tech firms especially would benefit from cheaper debt costs and easier borrowing.', 'Amid a boom in active investing, investors can find a series of strategies that lean on active, fundamental research to seek out small firms. For example, strategies like the Avantis U.S. Small Cap Value ETF (AVUV) and the Avantis U.S. Small Cap Equity ETF (AVSC) could appeal.', 'AVUV looks for small-cap firms with an active, value view, charging 25 basis points. It has returned 23.3% over one year, per Avantis Investors data. AVSC looks across all small-cap types and has returned 15.7% in that time.

But its obscurity is a shame, considering it's been one of the best stock performers of the last decade."", 'Shares of Coca-Cola Consolidated are up more than 1,100% over the past 10 years, far outpacing the 184% return for the S&P 500.', ""Unfortunately for investors today, much of the gains for Coca-Cola Consolidated were driven by a special situation -- and it's unlikely to happen again."", ""Here's what happened: From early 2013 to late 2017, Coca-Cola Consolidated -- under the direction of The Coca-Cola Company -- acquired various distribution regions and manufacturing facilities. This drove top-line growth that's hard to come by in this business."", ""Profit margins took a backseat to Coca-Cola Consolidated's business while management restructured everything. But once the work was done, profit margins bounced back in a big way. The company's diluted earnings per share (EPS) are up more than 1,500% over the last 10 years."", ""This level of EPS growth isn't normal for Coca-Cola Consolidated because it's a low-growth, low-margin business. In 2023, for example, the company's net sales were only up 7% year over year and its diluted EPS dropped modestly -- investors should expect years like that in this business."", ""All of this said, Coca-Cola Consolidated's management has a head-turning plan to boost EPS in 2024 and beyond."", 'On May 6, management for Coca-Cola Consolidated announced a stock buyback plan worth $3.1 billion. The company actually plans to buy shares from The Coca-Cola Company and one of its subsidiaries, and the details are a little complicated. But suffice it to say that this plan is huge, considering that its market capitalization is slightly less than $9 billion as of this writing.', ""In other words, Coca-Cola Consolidated plans to repurchase roughly one-third of its shares. That's one of the biggest plans I've ever seen."", ""Here's how a stock buyback plan can benefit shareholders: When a company's earnings stay the same but the number of shares goes down, EPS goes up. And higher EPS warrants a higher stock price."", ""This is noteworthy given the context I already provided. Coca-Cola Consolidated's EPS is up big in recent years thanks to a special situation. But now that this is over, EPS growth will be hard to come by organically. That's why share repurchases can be one of the things that can move the needle."", 'Coca-Cola Consolidated doesn\'t have $3.1 billion just sitting under its mattress. CEO J. Frank Harrison III said the company will ""optimize our balance sheet by raising a prudent amount of debt in order to return cash to stockholders."" In other words, it\'s in good financial shape, and so it will borrow the money to reward shareholders.', ""I prefer no-debt companies whenever possible. But I'll readily admit that using debt to repurchase shares is a tactic that's worked for other companies. A good example of this is Apple. It was only a little more than 10 years ago when it had zero debt, compared with debt of over $100 billion today. But ever since it added debt to the balance sheet, the stock is up around 900%."", 'Therefore, as long as Coca-Cola Consolidated keeps its debt at ""prudent"" levels, as Harrison said, this could be a good move for shareholders. Indeed, I can see the stock rising over the near term as a result of this move.', ""That said, I do question the long-term goals for the balance sheet from Coca-Cola Consolidated's management. Just six months ago, management celebrated having more cash than debt for the first time in 40 years. Now, it will undo that by taking on a large amount of debt."", ""I like Coca-Cola Consolidated's business -- it has competitive advantages because it owns distribution rights for popular beverages. Consumer demand is fairly constant. And although profit margins aren't eye-popping, investors can expect consistency."", ""But it will be tough for Coca-Cola Consolidated to find growth, and that's the only thing that gives me pause with the stock today when thinking beyond the near-term catalyst of the share repurchase plan. If it traded at a bargain, it could be worth picking up shares of this reliable business. But trading at nearly 20 times earnings, the stock may be priced a little high for a low-growth opportunity."", 'Before you buy stock in Coca-Cola Consolidated, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Coca-Cola Consolidated wasn’t one of them.

In addition to its cancer policies, the company has broadened its product offerings to include accident, dental and vision, disability, and long-term-care insurance. It markets its products through independent distributors, selling the majority of its policies directly to consumers at their places of work and also reaches out to its customers out of their worksite through digital mediums. The company has two reportable business segments; Aflac Japan, which generates the majority of the revenue, and Aflac U.S.', 'Aflac Inc has maintained a consistent dividend payment record since 1983, distributing dividends on a quarterly basis. Aflac Inc has also increased its dividend each year since 1983, earning it the status of a dividend aristocrata title awarded to companies that have increased their dividend each year for at least the past 41 years.

As of 2024-03-31, Aflac Inc's dividend payout ratio is 0.27. Aflac Inc's profitability rank, offers an understanding of the company's earnings prowess relative to its peers.

But occasionally, the artisanal ice cream maker headquartered in New York slips in what it calls a “shock flavor,” like Hidden Valley Ranch or pizza.', 'Surprising flavor combinations – think gravy-flavored Jones Soda or Sour Patch Kids Oreos -- are showing up more frequently in grocery stores and restaurant chains.', 'Hershey recently introduced pink lemonade-flavored Kit Kats, while IHOP and Lay’s brought out Rooty Tooty Fresh n’ Fruity potato chips, designed to taste like strawberry-topped pancakes with a hint of bacon. In the United Kingdom, Little Moons made fish-and-chips mochi ice cream in 2021, while potato chip brand Walkers is known to celebrate Christmas with a Brussels sprout-flavored edition.', ""Usually, these are limited-time flavors, although occasionally they're so popular they wind up on store shelves permanently, as Lay's Flamin' Hot Dill Pickle chips did in 2019."", ""While it's tempting to pass them off as social media stunts, experts say there’s more to the story. Food companies are responding to the changing and expanding tastes of consumers while also trying to keep brands relevant and distinct to win space on crowded store shelves."", '“We’re in a really exciting time of flavor development where consumers are not just one thing. You’re not just a sour lover or a sweet lover. You want a little of this and a little of that,” said Kristen Braun, the senior brand manager for Oreo innovation at Chicago-based food and beverage company Mondelez International. “Companies are finding the freedom to explore a little bit more and get more creative.”', 'Sour Patch Kids Oreos – vanilla cream-filled cookies speckled with colorful bites of the sour candies – are one of about a dozen limited-edition Oreo flavors that Mondelez plans to release this year. Braun said it takes the company one or two years to develop such products, which stay on shelves for about nine weeks. She’s already thinking ahead to future flavors that blur the lines between sweet, salty and spicy.', 'Oddball pairings aren’t entirely new in the food and beverage industry. Hubba Bubba released a bubble gum-flavored soda in the late 1980s, for example. But manufacturers and their suppliers have gotten more sophisticated and efficient, making it easier to experiment and put out limited-editions more frequently, said Mark Lang, a food marketing expert and associate professor of marketing at the University of Tampa.', ""Kyle Shadix, who as the corporate executive research chef for PepsiCo, has worked on beverages like Pepsi Maple Syrup and a strawberry shortcake Pepsi sold in Japan, said the members of Generation Z are also fueling innovation. They're diverse, adventurous and pick up on food trends quickly through social media, he said."", ""“They're every chef's dream to design for,” said Shadix, who is currently experimenting a lot with Mexican, Korean and Japanese flavors. “Gen Z is going to drive us faster. We’re going to start to see even more exploration quicker than in the past because they’re just so open to it.”"", 'Toying with flavors can boost brands in several ways. Sometimes they bring new customers to a brand. They might also nudge buyers to pick up the original flavor, Russell Zwanka, director of the food marketing program at Western Michigan University, said.', '“Sour Patch Oreos sound interesting, but nobody wants to risk buying Oreos that don’t taste good, so people buy both,” Zwanka said.', ""When companies combine brands, they're trying to build an association in consumers' minds. Peeps-flavored Pepsi, which came out last year, sends the message that Pepsi is current and fun, Lang said. Mustard-flavored Skittles, which came out last summer, made the 104-year-old French's brand seem playful."", ""Enter Kraft Heinz, which approached Van Leeuwen Ice Cream a few years ago about macaroni and cheese-flavored ice cream. Ben Van Leeuwen, the company’s co-founder and CEO, was doubtful at first but found that Kraft’s powder blended well with the Brooklyn-based company's ice cream."", ""Van Leeuwen's Kraft Macaroni and Cheese ice cream came out to rave reviews in 2021 and was re-released for a short time last fall."", '“We will only do a shock flavor if we can make it good and distinct. We will not do a shock flavor where it’s just shock in name but taste like vanilla,” Van Leeuwen said.', 'But novel flavor combinations don’t always work. Van Leeuwen couldn’t eat more than a few bites of his company’s Hidden Valley Ranch ice cream, which contained onion and garlic powders. And shock flavors typically don’t end up on the permanent menu because of their lower “eat-ability,” he said.', '“I think you would taste our mac and cheese and you’d say, ‘Oh, that’s good,’ but do you want to take a pint of that mac and cheese from your freezer when you’re watching whatever show on Netflix and eat the entire thing? Probably not,” Van Leeuwen said.', ""Candy brand Brach’s ran into that issue with its Turkey Dinner Candy Corn, a 2021 limited-edition version of the fall staple that tasted like turkey, stuffing, green beans, cranberry sauce, apple pie and coffee. Katie Duffy, vice president and general manager of seasonal at Ferrara Candy Co., which owns Brach's, acknowledged there was a “gross-out” factor."", '“We have learned from consumers that we don’t want to have something where they eat a few pieces of candy and then they toss it because there’s some things that they don’t want to repeat,” Duffy said. “We want it to be a delicious flavor journey.”', 'Brach’s recently introduced Easter Brunch-flavored jelly beans, and they hit that mark, she said. The candy beans mimicked the flavors of blueberry maple pancakes, chocolate doughnuts, caramel cold brew, cinnamon rolls, berry smoothies and mimosa cocktails.', 'Shannon Weiner, senior director of insights and analytics at Ferrara, said the company closely tracks social media to see what flavors are trending. People are increasingly looking for dessert and dairy-flavored candies, she said. They’re also seeking more international flavors like Tajin, a brand of chile-lime spice from Mexico that recently did a collaboration with Pop Tarts.', 'Lang thinks the more time people spend in restaurants or trying out new foods, the more they seek out unusual flavors.', '“We are variety-seeking animals. We constantly are seeking something new and different; it’s in our wiring,” he said. “We like to experiment.”']"

In the document, design agency the Arnell Group thoroughly outlined the rationale behind Pepsi’s brand refresh: first establishing the desire to show innovation, then reviewing the evolution of art from Pythagorean “spatial harmonies” to Renaissance art, until deriving the perfect new design that reflects the path of the Sun's light in Earth’s gravitational pull. The final logo would illustrate the “Gravitational Pull of Pepsi.”"", '“The Pepsi ethos has evolved over time,” the document said. “The vocabulary of truth and simplicity is a reoccurring phenomena in the brand’s history. It communicates the brand in a timeless manner and with an expression of clarity.”', 'The result of the radical rebrand? Pepsi’s same red, white, and blue circular logo, but with its white center stripe undulating at a slightly different angle than its predecessor.', 'Even 15 years after that change—and a March 2024 global rebranding that returned the white center to its original squiggly shape—the 2008 design document circulates around social media, prompting viral TikToks, do-it-yourself recreations on graphing calculators, and eliciting genuine shock. Piling onto the absurdity of the rationale accompanying Pepsi’s 2008 logo is the redesign’s $1 million price tag.', '“Surely this is satire! Pepsi gravitational pull?!” one Reddit user wrote about the 2008 redesign.', 'According to Emily Zugay, a “self-proclaimed” (and university-trained) graphic designer who parodies company logos on her TikTok with 4.3 million followers, Pepsi’s seemingly absurd brand refresh is actually pretty common practice.', ""“When these companies are spending thousands of dollars on these redesigns—even if it's something that could take five minutes—they feel like they need to justify it, even to themselves, sometimes with a document like that: comparing it to the Mona Lisa to show this was worth the money,” she told Fortune."", 'But the enduring chatter around Pepsi’s old logo is at the nexus of the company’s modern marketing philosophy, according to Venky Shankar, professor of marketing at Southern Methodist University’s Cox School of Business who worked with Pepsi to design a global forecast system for the company. The discourse around Pepsi’s previous rebranding may be in jest, but the precipitating business factors and industry trends are very real.', '“All brands look for a refresh when their sales are not growing as fast as they expected to,” Shankar said. “In this case, carbonated beverages, particularly sodas, have been witnessing a downward trend for a very long time, not just the last few years alone.”', 'Pepsi’s 2008 rebrand was no exception: In October that year, two months after the Arnell Group submitted its redesign document to the company, Pepsi reported disappointing earnings due to poor drink sales, a result of a weakened economy, and announced plans to lay off 3,300 workers, about 1.8% of its workforce.', 'The impetus for Pepsi’s 2023 redesign is also clear. Despite better-than-expected revenue, sales have been hindered in the U.S. by consumers thrown off by the company’s price increases. Gen Z consumers in particular have also lost their taste for sugary soda, instead preferring healthier fizzy alternatives. Pepsi has tapped rappers like Ice Spice to push its lemon-lime soda and launched a new line of bubly sparkling water in a bid for young consumers. Pepsi’s new logo makes a similar appeal to Gen Z with its retro vibes.', '“Pepsi has constantly reimagined and reinvented our logo over the years—as a brand that is both timely and timeless we’ve evolved our look and feel just as our fans and consumers have evolved along with us,” the company told Fortune in a statement. “The visual identity introduced in 2008 has been very successful for us over the past 14 years of the brand. That said, in 2023 we introduced the next era of Pepsi.”', 'Arnell Group did not respond to Fortune’s request for comment.', 'PepsiCo’s marketing refreshes haven’t always reflected Da Vinci-caliber genius. In tandem with the rollout of its new Pepsi logo in the late aughts, the parent company also refreshed its Tropicana branding. The juice brand, a subsidiary of Pepsi from 1998 to 2021, removed its front-and-center logo in favor of a tall glass of orange juice. Social media, then in its early days, hated the design.', '“Do any of these package-design people actually shop for orange juice?” one angry customer wrote over email, the New York Times reported in 2009. “Because I do, and the new cartons stink.”', ""But it wasn't an online uproar that prompted the company to revert back to its original logo shortly after the redesign. It was the 20% sales plummet that followed the month after."", 'Pepsi’s misstep had shared flavors with Coca-Cola’s 1985 “New Coke,” when the beverage company announced it would change its drink formula for the first time in almost a century. Consumers revolted, leaving 31,600 calls on the company’s hotline, but the anger also cemented Coca-Cola’s stature, according to its blog, as “obviously more than just a soft drink.”', 'In fact, plenty of big marketing swings fail to pay off. One of Pepsi’s biggest online blunders came in 2017, when the company aired an ad with protesters laughing and cheering, that concludes with Kendall Jenner passing out a Pepsi can to a police officer. The ad borrowed imagery from the Black Lives Matter movement protesting police brutality and was largely considered tone deaf. The company later apologized, but not before memes of the ad spread widely online.', '“Pepsi was trying to project a global message of unity, peace and understanding. Clearly, we missed the mark and apologize,” Pepsi said at the time.', 'Shankar argued corporations walk a fine line with being made fun of online: “In a consumer product like Pepsi, if people are making too much fun of it and it starts hurting the existing consumers, that could be a problem,” he said.', 'While Pepsi’s 2017 ad generated enough uproar to have negative consequences, the continued fervent meme-ing of Pepsi’s old logo is not likely to be seen as a threat to the company, Shankar said.', 'Drawing on the old adage of “any publicity is good publicity,” Shankar believed that in the case of a buzzy rebranding, however mocked it is, means good news for Pepsi. Indeed, social media has changed the marketing game as brands lean into the absurdity of Gen Z humor to get more eyes on their products. Twitter memes have resulted in beverages like Josh Cellars wine and Cerveza Cristal beer essentially receiving free marketing. Zugay, the TikToker, has experienced this phenomenon firsthand. Her intentionally shoddy recreations of big-name logos have been reposted and used as social media profile pictures by brands like McDonald’s, Tinder, and the NFL.', ""“People really resonate with that and enjoy that,” she said. “Because it shows that brand isn't untouchable—at least on Tiktok.”"", 'But for Pepsi in particular—which has waged war with Coca-Cola for decades—brand loyalty may have ratcheted up the clamor around the logo.', ""“A lot of times people view logos and brands as precious to themselves or they almost feel a sense of ownership over the look of a logo or the brand itself, if they've been a loyal customer for however long,” Zugay said. “People, I feel like, are very sensitive when it comes to logos and rebrand specifically.”"", ""Pepsi loyalists have already shown that regardless of the reputation the company’s rebrands have, they’ll stay true to their cola of choice. As one Reddit user put it, “When I walk down the drink aisle I unfortunately always succumb to pepsi's gravitational pull.”"", 'This story was originally featured on Fortune.com']"
