(NASDAQ:VRSK) On Your Watch List?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-194-time-put-verisk-110028238.html,1682766028,STORY,['VRSK'],"[Today we're going to take a look at the well-established Verisk Analytics, Inc. (NASDAQ:VRSK). The company's stock saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the NASDAQGS. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let’s take a look at Verisk Analytics’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. Check out our latest analysis for Verisk Analytics What's The Opportunity In Verisk Analytics?Verisk Analytics appears to be overvalued by 35% at the moment, based on my discounted cash flow valuation. The stock is currently priced at US$194 on the market compared to my intrinsic value of $143.48. This means that the opportunity to buy Verisk Analytics at a good price has disappeared! Another thing to keep in mind is that Verisk Analytics’s share price is quite stable relative to the market, as indicated by its low beta. This means that if you believe the current share price should move towards its intrinsic value over time, a low beta could suggest it is not likely to reach that level anytime soon, and once it’s there, it may be hard to fall back down into an attractive buying range again.What kind of growth will Verisk Analytics generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. However, with a negative profit growth of -7.3% expected over the next couple of years, near-term growth certainly doesn’t appear to be a driver for a buy decision for Verisk Analytics. This certainty tips the risk-return scale towards higher risk.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? If you believe VRSK should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards its real value can be profitable. Given the risk from a negative growth outlook, this could be the right time to reduce your total portfolio risk. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on VRSK for some time, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. you may want to reconsider buying the stock at this time. The company’s price has climbed passed its true value, in addition to a risky future outlook. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management. Should the price fall in the future, will you be well-informed enough to buy?If you want to dive deeper into Verisk Analytics, you'd also look into what risks it is currently facing.

The average earnings surprise is 6.6%.Q1 ExpectationsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the top line is currently pegged at $631.9 million, down 18.5% from the year-ago actual figure.

This might have been the result of efforts to make the company insurance-focused.An increase in costs is likely to have weighed on the bottom line of the company.

3,70acef8d-8c3e-369d-9d1d-b591d6ddbc65,SCHW,2023-04-29,FedEx and Charles Schwab have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fedex-charles-schwab-highlighted-zacks-121612473.html,1682684172,STORY,"['FDX', 'SCHW', '^GSPC', 'KMB', 'PG', 'PEP']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – April 28, 2023 – Zacks Equity Research shares FedEx Corporation FDX as the Bull of the Day and Charles Schwab SCHW as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on PepsiCo PEP, Kimberly-Clark KMB and Procter &amp; Gamble PG.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks.Bull of the Day:Company OverviewMemphis-based Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) FedEx Corporation is the leader in global express delivery services. Since 1971, it has been providing transportation, e-commerce, and business services for its customers. Three main segments drive FedEx: FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, and FedEx Freight.FedEx Express: Offers time definite delivery to more than 220 countries and territories.FedEx Ground: A low-cost, day-certain service to any business address in the United States and Canada.FedEx Freight: Offers less-than-truckload (LTL) freight services in the United StatesA Straightforward Bull CaseThe meteoric rise of e-commerce in the United States and worldwide presents significant opportunities for freight companies to grow and expand their business. Beyond traditional delivery, e-commerce consumers demand more efficient and innovative delivery solutions, producing more potential revenue.Industry TailwindsZack’s in-house studies have shown that the top 50% of industry groups tend to outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of two to one. The Transportation – Air Freight and Cargo group meets the threshold by a long shot. The group is ranked in the top 9% of all industries tracked by Zacks and has drastically outperformed the S&amp;P 500 Index over the past three years.FundamentalsDespite a recent earnings slowdown, FDX has delivered positive surprises on earnings for two quarters running. Though earnings growth slowed last quarter, investors must look to the future. Analysts have earnings per share soaring to new highs within the next two years.The Total PackageBeyond strong industry tailwinds and a larger total addressable market, FedEx management is intent on rewarding shareholders through dividend payouts. In April, FDX raised its dividend by 10% to $1.26 per share or $5.05 annually. The company also raised its full-year outlook based on its cost savings plan, saying, “We are pleased with the company’s efforts to reward its shareholders even in these difficult times.”Story continuesTechnical ViewOne of the most impressive traits of FedEx is its stable yet robust technical performance. FDX has a beta of 1.01, meaning it’s a very tame stock, and its volatility is in line with that of the S&amp;P 500. Despite the low beta, year-to-date, the stock has returned 30% versus 6% in the S&amp;P. Furthermore, the share price is pulling back to the 50-day moving average – an area the stock has found support at for months.TakeawayOverall, the rise of e-commerce presents significant opportunities for freight companies like FDX to improve their profitability, increase their market share, and enhance their competitiveness. Furthermore, FDX’s drive to reward shareholders through dividends and cost savings should drive the stock higher in 2023.Bear of the Day:Company OverviewZacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stock Charles Schwab is a financial services company that offers a broad range of investment and wealth management services. The company was founded in 1971 and is headquartered in San Francisco, California.Schwab’s investment services include trading and investing in stocks, bonds, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), options, futures, and more.Toxic Combo: Rising Costs + A Regional Banking CrisisPrior to 2023, a rising interest rate environment was mostly viewed as a positive for the banking sector. However, the unusually rapid hikes from unprecedented, near-zero interest rates caused mayhem in the regional banking sector – leading to the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB).At the root of SVB’s collapse was a large amount of bank deposits in the long-term U.S. treasuries and mortgage-backed securities (assets that typically fall when interest rates rise). As word spread of SVB’s liquidity crisis and investment issues, depositors began to panic, leading to a classic bank run.Though Schwab is not a regional bank, rumors and fears are leading to real world issues for the bank. According to Bloomberg, Schwab is “facing dwindling deposits.” As if that wasn’t enough, Schwab’s costs are rising rapidly and have been doing so for years. In fact, between 2016-2022 expenses rose at a compound annual growth rate of more than 15%.Industry WoesOur studies show that stocks within the bottom half of the Zacks industry group list tend to underperform dramatically. By now, it is no secret that the banking sector is underperforming. The Zack’s Financial Investment Banking Industry is in the bottom 13% of all industries tracked by Zacks.Bearish Price and Volume ActionSchwab is dramatically underperforming the S&amp;P 500 Index. Year-to-date SCHW is down 37.9%, while the S&amp;P is up 6.1%. Furthermore, a few weeks ago, Schwab’s CEO tried to inject life into the stock by purchasing one million dollars’ worth of stock. Since then, the stock has barely budged and is setting up in a bearish chart pattern.TakeawayBetween rising costs and dwindling deposits, Charles Schwab is stuck between a rock and a hard place. Expect volatility on both sides of the tape and avoid the stock at this juncture.Additional content:3 Companies That Recently Raised GuidanceThere have been several pockets of strength during earnings season so far, particularly in the Consumer Staples sector. We’ve seen many companies in the realm come out and post better-than-expected results, with pricing power leading the way.In fact, several companies – PepsiCo, Kimberly-Clark and Procter &amp; Gamble – have raised guidance following better-than-expected quarterly results, causing buyers to swarm as of late.As we can see, all three have displayed relative strength over the period, outperforming the market handily. Let’s take a deeper dive into each company’s current standing.PepsiCoPepsiCo reported earnings of $1.50 per share, handily exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by nearly 10%. Quarterly revenue totaled $17.8 billion, above expectations and improving 10% from the year-ago quarter.Investors cheered on the results, with PEP shares closing 2.5% higher post-earnings. The company’s shares have regularly gotten a boost following quarterly releases.Regarding the strong results, CEO Ramon Laguarta said, “We are very pleased with our performance and business momentum as our categories and geographies remained resilient during the first quarter. Given our strong start to the year, we now expect our full-year 2023 organic revenue to increase 8 percent (previously 6 percent) and core constant currency EPS to increase 9 percent (previously 8 percent).”And consistent with its previous guidance for FY23, PepsiCo expects total cash returns to shareholders to total roughly $7.7 billion, consisting of $6.7 billion in dividends and share repurchases of $1 billion.Kimberly-ClarkKimberly-Clark also posted a double-beat, exceeding earnings expectations by nearly 25%. Top line results were also solid, with the company generating $5.2 billion in revenue and improving modestly from the year-ago quarter.In addition, KMB’s gross margin increased 340 basis points year-over-year, primarily driven by favorable net revenue realization amid increased prices. Cash generated from operations totaled $613 million, reflecting a sizable jump from the year-ago value of $204 million.KMB shares saw a nice reaction from the market post-earnings, closing 1.5% higher. The market has had somewhat-mixed reactions following quarterly releases from Kimberly-Clark.The company raised its FY23 EPS guidance, now expecting 6% - 10% growth compared to FY22 and up from prior views of 2% - 6%. In addition, KMB increased its operating profit outlook to low double digits, again up from the previous mid to high single digits expected.Procter &amp; GambleLike the companies above, Procter &amp; Gamble posted better-than-expected results, exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by 3.8% and delivering a positive 4% revenue surprise. Earnings improved 3% year-over-year, whereas revenue saw growth of 4%.Impressively, PG’s recently declared dividend increase reflects the 67th consecutive year that the company has increased its dividend. The company returned more than $2.2 billion in dividends to shareholders throughout the quarter.Procter &amp; Gamble raised its FY23 all-in revenue guidance, now expecting growth of 1% compared to FY22, up from a prior guidance range of down -1% to flat year-over-year.  In addition, PG raised its organic revenue growth guidance for FY23, expecting growth of 6% compared to prior expectations of 4% – 5%.Bottom LineStocks in the Zacks Consumer Staples sector carry a defensive nature, as these companies’ products have an advantageous ability to generate consistent demand in the face of many economic situations.And as seen by the quarterly results from all three companies above, consumers have had little issue forking up extra cash for their products.In addition to uplifting guidance, all three companies currently sport a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), indicating bullish sentiment among analysts.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

However, when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.Alexandria Real Estate Equities in FocusBased in Pasadena, Alexandria Real Estate Equities (ARE) is in the Finance sector, and so far this year, shares have seen a price change of -15.76%. The life science real estate company is paying out a dividend of $1.21 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 3.94% compared to the REIT and Equity Trust - Other industry's yield of 4.59% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.73%.Looking at dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $4.84 is up 2.5% from last year. Over the last 5 years, Alexandria Real Estate Equities has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 5.84%. Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company's payout ratio; a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Alexandria Real Estate Equities's current payout ratio is 57%. This means it paid out 57% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.ARE is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $8.95 per share, with earnings expected to increase 6.29% from the year ago period.Story continuesBottom LineFrom greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages, investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons. However, not all companies offer a quarterly payout.For instance, it's a rare occurrence when a tech start-up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend. It's more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends. Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, ARE is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This move can be attributable to notable volume with a higher number of shares being traded than in a typical session.

This pet insurer continues to invest in areas where it can achieve high internal rates of return. Improving pricing should add to the upside.This pet insurer has also been expanding globally, apart from strengthening its compelling portfolio. While TRUP is consolidating its presence in Japan, a couple of pending buyouts mark its foray into Europe.Trupanion remains focused on growing its addressable market by 40% by 2025 end by adding 10,000 international hospitals.

The program is based on traditional loans and lines of credit at U.S. Bank, allowing for modified credit guidelines that enable more business owners to access the funding they need to run their business.The U.S. Bank Business Diversity Lending Program is a type of special purpose credit program, or SPCP, permitted by the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA). These programs are specifically designed to improve access to capital for members of economically disadvantaged classes.U.S. Bank is launching the Business Diversity Lending Program following last year’s acquisition of MUFG Union Bank. Union Bank was a pioneer in implementing an SPCP for small business, launching their Business Diversity Lending Program around 30 years ago. U.S. Bank is continuing this legacy, with expanded impact across the U.S. Bank footprint.""The Business Diversity Lending Program is the latest commitment by U.S. Bank to power the potential of all of our customers and help close the wealth gap,"" said Sekou Kaalund, Head of Branch and Small Business Banking at U.S. Bank. ""Small businesses are the bedrock of the U.S. Economy, and by broadening access to capital we are helping to fuel more business owners’ dreams and drive economic growth. By building stronger women-, minority-, and veteran-owned businesses we are creating more vibrant communities for everyone.""The Business Diversity Lending Program aligns with U.S. Bank Access Commitment™, a long-term approach focused on helping communities of color build wealth. The commitment is comprised of multiple initiatives, including a $25 million microbusiness fund focused on businesses owned by women of color, a mortgage program focused on homeownership education and the creation of a Business Access Advisor role that works with minority-owned businesses with a focus on addressing the three most prominent gaps that limit business growth and employment opportunities: information, connections, and capital.Story continuesWith the Business Diversity Lending Program, U.S. Bank is expanding opportunity for a vital portion of the business community. About 1.24 million or 21.4% of businesses with paid employees in 2020 were women-owned, according to the latest U.S. Census data. In addition, 1.15 million or 19.9% were minority-owned, and 320,864 or 5.6% were veteran-owned.Under the U.S. Bank program, eligible businesses may qualify for reduced credit score and decreased cash flow coverage requirements on most conventional lending products up to $2.5 million. Businesses are eligible if they are at least 51% owned and operated by one or more individuals who self-identify as a woman, minority, and/or veteran.To learn more about the program, visit the U.S. Bank Business Diversity Lending program webpage.About U.S. BancorpU.S. Bancorp, with approximately 77,000 employees and $682 billion in assets as of March 31, 2023, is the parent company of U.S. Bank National Association.

Per management, this resulted from increased price and demand as a result of the execution of the multi-year Portable Medical exit announced in 2022. However, this was partially offset by a single-digit decline in Advanced Surgical and Orthopedics.Revenues at the Cardio &amp; Vascular business totaled $191.2 million, up 20.2% from the prior-year quarter on a reported basis and up 17.7% organically. The solid year-over-year performance was driven by strong demand across all markets and key products, such as guidewires, new product ramps in electrophysiology, and strong performance from the Oscor and Aran acquisitions.Story continuesRevenues at the Cardiac Rhythm Management &amp; Neuromodulation business were $145.1 million, up 17.7% year over year both on a reported and organic basis. The business was driven by strong demand, including double-digit growth from emerging customers with premarket approval products.This compares to our first-quarter projections of $25.3 million, $182 million and $138.6 million, respectively, for each of the product lines.Revenues in the Non-Medical segment totaled $14.5 million, up 63.4% year over year.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $1.49 billion.The company continues to expect full-year adjusted EPS to be in the band of $4.00-$4.30 (suggesting a rise of 3-11% from the 2022 reported figure). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $4.13.Our TakeInteger Holdings exited the first quarter of 2023 with better-than-expected results. The strong year-over-year top-line and bottom-line performances are impressive. Robust performances by both segments and strength in all three product lines of the Medical Sales segment are encouraging. Continued benefits from the Oscor and Aran acquisitions look promising. The expansion of the adjusted operating margin bodes well for the stock.Integer Holdings’ strong product development pipeline in high-growth markets, emerging customer product launches, successful tuck-in acquisitions and underlying strength of existing programs also look promising for the stock.However, the rising operating costs putting pressure on the gross margin, leading to its contraction, is discouraging.

QuoteWrapping UpDexCom exited first-quarter 2023 on a strong note, wherein both earnings and revenues beat  estimates. Impressive contributions from the Sensor segment, and domestic and international revenue growth were the key catalysts.Additionally, the glucose monitoring market presents significant commercial opportunities for the company. DexCom’s prospects in alternative markets such as non-intensive diabetes management, hospital, gestational, pre-diabetes and obesity are likely to provide it with a competitive edge in the MedTech space.Apart from making continued advancements in terms of its key strategic objectives, the company also recorded new patients in the quarter.DXCM launched an updated sensor algorithm in multiple countries in the second half of 2022, making the latest G7 sensor technology available to international markets. It received FDA clearance for the same technology in December 2022. These developments are likely to support the company’s future growth.Nevertheless, the contraction in gross margin is a woe, reflecting the rising cost of sales.

The figure beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8.7%.Revenue growth in the quarter was backed by the better availability of the company’s sleep products to meet the underlying demand and solid growth across its broader product portfolio.However, year-on-year movements in foreign exchange, particularly the weaker Euro, negatively impacted revenues by approximately $20 million in the fiscal third quarter.ResMed Inc.

This decrease can be mainly attributed to an unfavorable product mix and a higher component cost, partially offset by an increase in average selling prices.Story continuesSG&amp;A expenses rose 25.2% year over year to $228.5 million.

The company recorded a robust sales performance in the quarter on increased demand for sleep and respiratory care devices. RMD’s acquisition of MEDIFOX DAN positively contributed to the reported quarter’s SaaS business revenues, registering continued organic growth.The organic growth of ResMed’s mask and accessory business is supported by the new patient flow and new patient growth and enhanced resupply programs to existing patients, fuelled by continuous core patient demand.Meanwhile, RMD continues expanding the base of its AirSense 11 platform worldwide by ramping up its production and availability. Despite persistent supply-chain constraints, ResMed established a foothold in its largest market for its connected sleep apnea therapy devices CPAP and APAP through the combination of AirSense 10 and AirSense 11.Meanwhile, escalating costs pressurizing the company’s operating margin are worrisome.

The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. In other words, investors can purchase Walmart's shares before the 4th of May in order to be eligible for the dividend, which will be paid on the 30th of May.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.57 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$2.28 per share. Calculating the last year's worth of payments shows that Walmart has a trailing yield of 1.5% on the current share price of $150.97. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! As a result, readers should always check whether Walmart has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut. View our latest analysis for Walmart Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. Walmart is paying out an acceptable 52% of its profit, a common payout level among most companies. Yet cash flows are even more important than profits for assessing a dividend, so we need to see if the company generated enough cash to pay its distribution. Dividends consumed 51% of the company's free cash flow last year, which is within a normal range for most dividend-paying organisations.It's positive to see that Walmart's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. With that in mind, we're encouraged by the steady growth at Walmart, with earnings per share up 5.6% on average over the last five years. While earnings have been growing at a credible rate, the company is paying out a majority of its earnings to shareholders. If management lifts the payout ratio further, we'd take this as a tacit signal that the company's growth prospects are slowing.Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. Since the start of our data, 10 years ago, Walmart has lifted its dividend by approximately 1.9% a year on average.The Bottom LineIs Walmart an attractive dividend stock, or better left on the shelf? Earnings per share growth has been unremarkable, and while the company is paying out a majority of its earnings and cash flow in the form of dividends, the dividend payments don't appear excessive. Overall we're not hugely bearish on the stock, but there are likely better dividend investments out there.However if you're still interested in Walmart as a potential investment, you should definitely consider some of the risks involved with Walmart. For example - Walmart has 2 warning signs we think you should be aware of.If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article?

But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.Right now, Tesco PLC is sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Walmart has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that TSCDY has an improving earnings outlook. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics, including the tried-and-true P/E ratio, the P/S ratio, earnings yield, and cash flow per share, as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use.TSCDY currently has a forward P/E ratio of 13.73, while WMT has a forward P/E of 24.81. We also note that TSCDY has a PEG ratio of 2.93. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. WMT currently has a PEG ratio of 4.51.Another notable valuation metric for TSCDY is its P/B ratio of 1.57. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, WMT has a P/B of 4.87.Based on these metrics and many more, TSCDY holds a Value grade of A, while WMT has a Value grade of C.Story continuesTSCDY stands above WMT thanks to its solid earnings outlook, and based on these valuation figures, we also feel that TSCDY is the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

27,dce1b0fa-dd5c-3705-80af-200377671401,WMT,2023-04-29,Investors Heavily Search Walmart Inc. (WMT): Here is What You Need to Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-walmart-inc-130001723.html,1682686801,STORY,['WMT'],"[Walmart (WMT) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this world's largest retailer have returned +3.9%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4% change. During this period, the Zacks Retail - Supermarkets industry, which Walmart falls in, has gained 4.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Walmart is expected to post earnings of $1.31 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +0.8%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.2%.The consensus earnings estimate of $6.10 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -3%. This estimate has changed -0.4% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.74 indicates a change of +10.4% from what Walmart is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.3%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Walmart.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for WMT _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Walmart, the consensus sales estimate of $148.34 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +4.8%. The $630.47 billion and $652.73 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +3.1% and +3.5%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryWalmart reported revenues of $164.05 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +7.3%. EPS of $1.71 for the same period compares with $1.53 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $159.66 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.75%. The EPS surprise was +12.5%.Over the last four quarters, Walmart surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Walmart is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Walmart. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Better pricing, prudent underwriting, increased exposure, faster economic recovery on the receding impact of the pandemic and increased vaccinations should benefit MetLife Inc. MET, American International Group Inc. AIG, Prudential Financial Inc. PRU, CNO Financial Group CNO and Kemper Corporation KMPR. Accelerated digitalization will help in the smooth functioning of the industry.The solid capital level of the multiline insurers will fuel merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) activities. With one rate hike already this year and more to come in the future, investment income should improve further as insurers are beneficiaries of a rising rate environment.About the IndustryThe Zacks Multiline Insurance industry comprises companies that provide single insurance coverage, bundling automobile, homeowner, long-term care, life and health insurance to individuals and businesses. The insured pays a single premium and is covered for many things through a single contract. These companies cover commercial and personal properties, automobiles, marine, livestock, aviation, personal accident, life, including permanent and term insurance, supplemental accident and health insurance, workers’ compensation, annuity products, private mortgage insurance, et al. The industry participants also provide risk management services. Since the companies offer single insurance coverage for multiple products, customer retention improves. The insured stands to benefit from lower premium payment compared to paying individual premiums for insuring varied products.3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Multiline Insurance IndustryDiversified portfolio lowers concentration risk:  Given the nature of the business, multiline insurers’ product and service portfolios are diversified. This lowers concentration risk. Increased awareness, driving higher demand for protection products, should benefit sales and premiums for life insurance operations. Continued improvement in pricing and an increase in exposure should support premium growth. Also, per Deloitte Insights, the transition to green energy and related insurance products, as well as exposure to intangible assets, offers growth opportunities. Per Deloitte Insights, life insurance premium is estimated to increase 1.9% in 2023 while non-life premiums are expected to increase 2.2%. The report also stated that trends like commercial lines witnessing growth at a faster pace than personal lines and homeowners’ premiums improving at a better rate than personal auto are likely to continue in 2023.Merger and acquisitions:  Consolidation in the multi-line insurance industry is expected to continue as players look to diversify their operations into new business lines and geographies. Buying businesses along the same lines is driven by the players’ need to gain a fair market share and grow in their niche areas. However, with high inflation and a rise in interest rate (the Fed has already made one rate hike this year), momentum in the M&amp;A environment is likely to slow down. The first half of 2022 witnessed 427 deals per Deloitte.  Increased adoption of technology: Digitalization has increased by leaps and bounds, especially amid pandemic-induced restrictions. The industry is witnessing greater use of technology like blockchain, AI, advanced analytics, telematics, cloud computing and robotic process automation to expedite business operations and save costs.  Many life insurers have started selling policies online that appeal to the tech-savvy population. At the same time, the use of real-time data is making premium calculation easier and reducing risk. The P&amp;C industry, in particular, also witnessed the emergence of insurtech — technology-led insurers — sparking competition for incumbent players. Insurers remain focused on ramping up data and analytics capabilities as well as realizing the benefit of the technological infrastructure per Deloitte Insights. Moreover, the adoption of technology has helped in seamless underwriting and claims processing. However, the adoption of technology comes with the risk of cyber threats.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates solid prospects in the near term.

36,a0d63b17-bb61-3f84-b16a-adf130ad3e59,MET,2023-04-29,Will Lower Premiums Affect MetLife's (MET) Q1 Earnings?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lower-premiums-affect-metlifes-met-160704802.html,1682698024,STORY,"['MET', 'RNR']","[MetLife, Inc. MET is set to report its first-quarter 2023 results on May 3, after the closing bell.What Do the Estimates Say?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings per share of $1.90 has declined by a penny in the past week. The estimated figure suggests a decrease of 8.7% from the prior-year reported number. Our estimate of $1.85 per share indicates an 11.1% year-over-year decrease. Also, the consensus estimate for first-quarter revenues of $17 billion indicates a 4.4% fall from the year-ago reported figure, whereas our estimate suggests an 8% decline.MetLife’s earnings beat the consensus estimate in three of the prior four quarters and missed once, with the average surprise being 12.1%. This is depicted in the graph below:MetLife, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseMetLife, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseMetLife, Inc. price-eps-surprise | MetLife, Inc. QuoteBefore we get into what to expect for the to-be-reported quarter in detail, it’s worth taking a look at MET’s previous-quarter performance first.Q4 Earnings RewindIn the last reported quarter, the leading insurance-based global financial services company reported adjusted operating earnings per share of $1.55, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 10.9% due to reduced private equity returns. Lower investment income affected important metrics despite a rising interest rate environment.Reduced profit levels from Asia and MetLife Holdings businesses in the fourth quarter were concerning. The negatives were partially offset by lower expenses, volume growth across some segments and improved contributions from the U.S. and Latin America businesses.Now let’s see how things have shaped up prior to the first-quarter earnings announcement.Q1 Factors to NoteReduced premiums are likely to have affected MetLife’s first-quarter results. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for premiums for the quarter under review suggests a fall of 3.8% from the prior-year quarter, whereas our estimate indicates a 3.7% decline.Also, the consensus mark for Universal Life and Investment-Type Product Policy Fees for the first quarter indicates a 5.2% year-over-year decrease, whereas our estimate suggests a 9.6% fall. Rising costs and expenses are likely to have affected the company’s profit levels in the to-be-reported quarter.Story continuesThe company is expected to have witnessed lower profits from Retirement &amp; Income Solutions and MetLife Holdings businesses in the first quarter. Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for adjusted earnings in Asia indicates a 35.1% plunge from the prior-year period, whereas our estimate predicts a 32.3% decline. These are likely to have led to a year-over-year decline in profits, making an earnings beat uncertain.However, the consensus mark for net investment income indicates a 6.1% year-over-year increase from the year-ago period. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for MET’s U.S. business’ adjusted earnings suggests an increase of 20.2% from the prior-year quarter’s reading.The consensus mark for adjusted earnings in Latin America indicates a jump of 25.2% from the year-ago period’s actuals. These are expected to have partially offset the negatives in the quarter under review.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for MetLife this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Earnings ESP: The company has an Earnings ESP of -0.71%. The Most Accurate Estimate is currently pegged at $1.89 per share, lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.90. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: MetLife currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.Stocks to ConsiderWhile an earnings beat looks uncertain for MetLife, here are some companies in the broader Finance space that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this time around:Unum Group UNM has an Earnings ESP of +0.30% and a Zacks Rank of 1.

RNR has an Earnings ESP of +3.37% and a Zacks Rank of 3.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for RenaissanceRe’s bottom line for the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $7.34 per share, suggesting a 109.7% year-over-year increase.

42,0ffa0b60-ef66-36f2-9bf1-f48ee1f8d1ae,O,2023-04-29,"Oil jumps on last day of April, back in the black after 5 months in red",Investing.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oil-jumps-last-day-april-150806926.html,1682694486,STORY,['CL=F'],"[Investing.com -- Crude prices jumped on the last trading day of April to return to the black after spending the better part of the last 10 months in the red — an unexpectedly poor stretch that confounded oil bulls who had come to regard $100 a barrel as a given in a market long on OPEC hype and short on delivery.New York-traded West Texas Intermediate, or WTI, for June delivery settled up $2.02, or 2.7%, on the day at $76.78 per barrel. For the week, the U.S. crude benchmark remained in the red, with a loss of 1.4%.For all of April though, WTI showed a return of about 1%. It was the first positive monthly closing for WTI after five previous months of losses. Earlier to that, WTI was only in the green for one month — October — after spending another four months in the red.London-traded Brent settled up $1.17, or 1.5%, at $79.45 on its June delivery contract, according to exchange data from ICE (NYSE:ICE).On Investing.com, Brent for July delivery, which showed up as the front-month contract for the global crude benchmark, was at $80.29 per barrel by 15:05 ET (19:05 GMT), up $2.07, or 2.7%, on the day.“If you were to factor in the better U.S. demand lately, it’s a deservingly mixed performance for a market that’s basically ridden more on OPEC’s overly-hyped production cuts that have fallen short on delivery,” said John Kilduff, founding partner at New York energy hedge fund Again Capital.After rallying to 14-year highs of around $130 for WTI and nearly $140 for Brent at the height of the supply crunch fears generated by the Ukraine invasion, crude prices began a sure and steady decline, ending 2022 at a little over $70. The selloff worsened in the first quarter of this year, with both crude benchmarks hitting 15-month lows as WTI reached under $65 and Brent almost broke under $70.Global oil producers under the OPEC+ alliance then resorted to a production maneuver that added another $10 to the two benchmarks.OPEC+, which groups the 13-member Saudi-led Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries with 10 independent oil producers, including Russia, said it will cut a further 1.7 million barrels from its daily output, adding to an earlier pledge from November to take off 2.0M barrels per day.Story continuesOPEC+, however, has a history of over-promising and under-delivering on production cuts. While the group achieved over-compliance on promised cuts in the aftermath of the 2020 coronavirus breakout, experts say that was more a result of battered demand that led to minimal production, rather than a will to cut barrels as pledged.“The crude demand outlook is all over the place given the economy is hitting stall speed, while airliners still remain optimistic for a busy summer travel period,” Ed Moya, analyst at online trading platform OANDA, said.U.S. economic data of late has reinforced investor worries about a slowing economy. The Commerce Department reported on Thursday that real gross domestic product, or GDP, grew at an annual rate of 1.1% in the first quarter of 2023 versus the 2.6% expansion in the fourth quarter of 2022. Economists tracked by Investing.com had expected a GDP growth of 2% for the first quarter.U.S. jobless claims, meanwhile, fell unexpectedly by 16,000 last week to reach 230,000, the Labor Department reported in what would be another challenge to the Federal Reserve which needs unemployment numbers to rise to effectively fight inflation.An inflation indicator closely watched by the Fed, the PCE Index, however, had price numbers more comforting to the central bank.To fight inflation, the Fed has added 475 basis points to rates in nine increases since March 2022. Rates now stand at a peak of 5%, compared with just 0.25% at the start of the coronavirus pandemic in March 2020. Another quarter-point hike is expected on May 3, bumping up rates to a peak of 5.25%.On the production front, OPEC got into a war of words with the International Energy Agency, or IEA, this week after the group which looks after the interests of oil consumers said surprise oil output cuts from OPEC+ risked exacerbating a projected supply deficit and could scupper an economic recovery.In a Bloomberg TV interview on Wednesday, IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol warned that the Saudi-led OPEC should be “very careful” with its production policy, warning that the group’s short-term and medium-term interests appeared to be contradictory. He added that higher crude prices and upward inflationary pressures would result in a weaker global economy, with low-income nations likely to be disproportionately affected.OPEC countered that the world’s leading energy authority should be “very careful” about undermining industry investments. The oil producing group’s Secretary General Haitham al-Ghais said finger-pointing and misrepresenting the actions of OPEC and OPEC+ was “counterproductive.” He added that the influential group of 23 oil-exporting nations was not targeting oil prices, but instead focusing on market fundamentals.“The IEA knows very well that there are a confluence of factors that impact markets. The knock-on effects of COVID-19, monetary policies, stock movements, algorithm trading, commodity trading advisors and SPR releases (coordinated or uncoordinated), geopolitics, to name a few,” al-Ghais said.OPEC+ is also seething over an IEA call last year that oil markets were oversupplied, prompting the Biden administration to release a huge amount of crude from the U.S. reserve that pushed WTI to low $70 levels.Related ArticlesOil jumps on last day of April, back in the black after 5 months in redNatural gas remains at mid-$2 mark, finishing April up 9%Louisiana's carbon well permitting application heads to Federal Register]"

According to Reuters, this would be Exxon’s and Hess’s most expensive project.The Uaru field is estimated to hold more than 800 million barrels of crude oil.Exxon and its partner Hess Corp. have made some 30 discoveries offshore Guyana since they started exploring the Stabroek block. Production is climbing consistently, likely to hit 400,000 bpd by the end of this year. Guyana is a priority jurisdiction for Exxon, along with U.S. shale.Exxon and Hess are currently the only oil producers in Guyana, but the country’s government has big plans. Guyana is tendering 14 more blocks this year as it seeks to speed up its transformation into a major oil producer while reducing Exxon’s dominance of its emerging oil industry.Guyana’s government eyes oil production of some 1.64 million bpd by 2030 as it is eager to monetize its hydrocarbon resources before peak demand hits, as predicted by forecasters seeing a successful energy transition away from fossil fuels.Yet Exxon also has big plans for Guyana that would keep it in a dominant position. By the end of 2027, the company plans to have six floating production vessels there, bringing its total production capacity to 1.2 million barrels daily.Oil is not Guyana’s only bet. The South American nation also has plans to develop its untapped natural gas reserves.

First Quarter Earnings Call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Irene Prezelj, Vice President, Investor Relations and Communications for FirstEnergy Corp. Thank you. Ms. Prezelj, you may begin.Irene M. PrezeljThank you. Welcome to our first quarter 2023 earnings call. Today, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding revenues, earnings, performance, strategies, prospects and other matters. These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by these statements can be found on the Investors section of our website under the Earnings Information link and in our SEC filings.We will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures, the presentation that supports today's discussion and other detailed information about the quarter can be found in the Strategic and Financial Highlights document on the Investors section of our website.We'll begin today's call with presentations from John Somerhalder, our Board Chair, Interim President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jon Taylor, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Several other executives will be available for the Q&amp;A session.Now I'll turn the call over to John Somerhalder.Story continuesJohn William SomerhalderThanks, Irene. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. We've accomplished a lot since our last earnings call and continue to build on the positive momentum we have seen over the last couple of years. Our first quarter GAAP earnings are $0.51 per share. Despite the impact of extremely mild first quarter temperatures, operating earnings are $0.60 per share, which is within the guidance range and reflects the continued execution of our long-term regulated growth strategy.We continue to position FirstEnergy for greater resiliency and growth by strengthening our financial position, enhancing our operations, optimizing the customer experience and transforming our culture. When Brian Tierney joins us as President and CEO on June 1, he'll hit the ground running to build on these efforts. We're very excited to welcome him on board.Clearly, we recognize how important it was to find the right leader for our company. And in Brian, we have a CEO who understands our industry and business and is the right leader to drive our strategy and accelerate our momentum. I know many of you worked with Brian during his time at AEP, and we know him as a highly respected executive with a unique blend of operational, financial and strategic skills and achievements.His strong track record of driving results is very well aligned with our goals at FirstEnergy. He has expressed his support for the steps we've taken to position our company, and he intends to continue to advance our business strategy, building on the strong foundation we have in place today. We know we found the right person to lead our company.I know everyone is looking forward to hearing from him, and we will certainly give you that opportunity. He will have a busy calendar starting on June 1. In the meantime, I'm so proud of our employees and their excellent work to position our company for the future. I know they will double down in their efforts to support Brian to drive long-term sustainable value for all of our stakeholders. This work includes a very busy regulatory calendar that addresses the critical investments that support reliability and a smarter and cleaner electric grid. John will review our recent distribution filings in a few minutes, but first, I'll take a moment to provide an update on our transmission business.In early February, we announced an agreement to sell an additional 30% interest in FirstEnergy Transmission LLC to Brookfield's Super-Core Infrastructure Partners for $3.5 billion, and this transaction remains on track to close in early 2024.Brookfield's partnership in FET supports our substantial long-term investments to build a more resilient and modern electric grid. We have a $1.7 billion transmission investment program this year and that's increasing to $1.9 billion by 2025.The mild first quarter weather, coupled with strong planning and execution, helped us get off to a great start with our construction program. Our transmission capital investments of nearly $350 million are about 60% ahead of the first quarter of 2022 and about 50% ahead of our internal plan. Examples of this work include: upgrading an 8-mile 138 kV transmission line in Ottawa County, Ohio, near Toledo. This project, which is scheduled for completion in May includes streaming new, larger conductor that can handle additional demand, replacing older structures with monopoles and installing more than 40 new components and insulators. Upgrading the high-voltage transmission line in New Jersey that is expected to improve system reliability for more than 3,000 customers.This project includes the installation of 53 new wood pole structures to fortify and strengthen the line and help prevent outages. And our transmission program is also facilitating the energy transition by connecting clean energy resources to the grid. Earlier this year, JCP&amp;L completed a grid connection for a 19.8 megawatt solar project located at a former landfill property in Mount Olive in New Jersey that is now delivering clean energy through FirstEnergy's transmission lines.We are excited to continue making these types of investments across our service territory in support of the clean energy future. We are affirming our 2023 guidance of $2.44 to $2.64 per share. As we discussed last quarter, the midpoint of this range represents 6% growth over our original 2022 midpoint of $2.40 per share.We are also introducing second quarter 2023 guidance of $0.40 to $0.50 per share. In addition, we are affirming our targeted 6% to 8% annual operating earnings growth rate. This represents year-over-year growth based off of prior year guidance midpoint. I want to spend a moment discussing our regulated earnings and earnings quality, particularly in light of the current contribution from the Signal Peak mining operation. While this is a legacy investment, that we need or control or operate, it has taken on a higher profile over the last year. Based on our plan, the earnings contribution from Signal Peak in 2023 is expected to be less than 15% of our $2.54 guidance midpoint and the expectation longer term is that Signal Peak contribution will decline on an absolute and relative basis, representing less than 10% of 2024 and 2025 consolidated earnings, improving the company's earnings quality over time.We intend to continue providing transparency around Signal Peak's contribution going forward. Our focus is on our regulated operations, our state distribution companies and our transmission businesses and on improving the credit quality of the company. We expect significant growth from our regulated operations given current returns in our distribution companies and our customer-focused investment strategies across both distribution and transmission, which will more than offset the decline in Signal Peak and support our expectations of 6% to 8% consolidated average annual earnings growth. I believe we are on the right path to leverage our strengths and deliver value to all of our stakeholders.Now I'll turn the call over to Jon Taylor.K. Jon TaylorThanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Although we were significantly impacted by the record-breaking mild temperatures this winter, our underlying business fundamentals remain strong and on track. I'll begin my remarks with a regulatory update, then I'll review our first quarter financial results.Last month, we kicked off a period of significant regulatory activity. Since early March, this includes an application to consolidate our 4 Pennsylvania utilities, which is an important step to align with our state operating model, simplify our legal entity structure and increase the flexibility and efficiency of our financing strategy.We also filed rate cases in New Jersey and Maryland that support critical reliability investments, a modern electric grid and enhancements to the customer experience, while maintaining the lowest residential customer rates among regulated electric distribution companies in both states.Since our last JCP&amp;L rate case in 2020, we've made nearly $800 million in investments to modernize and strengthen the electric grid. The JCP&amp;L proposal represents a $185 million revenue increase and supports distribution equity returns of 10.4%. It features enhanced recovery of storm balance costs, expanded vegetation management programs, recovery of program costs related to AMI, in electric vehicles and a proposal to normalize pension OPEB costs. The proposal also confirms our plan to file an infrastructure investment program later this year.In Maryland, our proposal for a $44 million net revenue increase supports equity returns of 10.6%. It includes a proposal for the second phase of the electric distribution investment surcharge program, a pension OPEB normalization mechanism and a cost recovery proposal related to COVID and electric vehicle balances.And in Ohio, we filed our fifth electric security plan to support our generation procurement process for non-shopping customers, continued investments in the distribution system, storm and vegetation management writers and energy efficiency programs. The filing also includes proposals to support low-income customers and the electric vehicle customer experience.We requested approval for the new ESP to be effective on June 1, 2024, when the ESP 4 ends. We've included a summary of the key filings together with news releases and links to the dockets on the new regulatory corner section of our IR website. We received a lot of positive feedback about this resource, and we'll continue to update the site as we move through each of the proceedings.Later this quarter, we plan to file a rate case in West Virginia. And looking further ahead, we are considering the appropriate time to file for new base rates in our third long-term infrastructure investment program in Pennsylvania, and we will file a rate case in Ohio in May of 2024.While each utility in each case have unique circumstances, we have noted that recent base rate cases involving other investor-owned utilities in Ohio have been resolved with equity capital structures in the 50% to 54% range and support of ROEs in the 9.5% to 9.9% range.These outcomes align with our plan, which includes the financial impact of our 2021 approved settlement that provided for over $300 million in refunds and bill credits to customers as well as continued rate base growth and the accounting changes that we previously discussed, all of which significantly lowered the returns at our Ohio utilities.I want to spend a few extra minutes on the recent generation filing in West Virginia, where we're working with a broad group of stakeholders to ensure we find the best outcome for our customers. Last December, the Public Service Commission ordered Mon Power to provide an evaluation of purchasing and operating the Pleasants Power Station, a coal-fired plant that we understand is currently slated for closure on May 31.The concept of a potential acquisition of Pleasants was suggested by stakeholders in West Virginia as a replacement for our Fort Martin station, which has a proposed end-of-life date of 2035. We responded to the commission last month indicating that additional time and analysis are needed to properly complete the necessary and complex assessment. Mon Power proposed an option to enter into an interim arrangement with Pleasants' current owner that would keep the plant operational beyond its May 31 deactivation date. This would allow the needed time to do a thorough analysis and evaluation as requested by the West Virginia PSC.On Monday, the commission approved our proposal. We will begin negotiations with the plant's current owner. If we reach an interim agreement that we believe is in the interest of customers and FirstEnergy, we will submit it to the commission. And if approved, this would allow recovery of associated costs through a surcharge.If we can't reach an agreement that is in the interest of our customers, we will file an update with the commission. To be clear, we don't see it as a viable option for Mon Power to operate 3 coal-fired power plants in West Virginia. We will continue to work through the process with the PSC and strive for an outcome that best serves our customers, communities and employees in West Virginia.At the same time, we are moving forward with our efforts to support the energy transition across our footprint, and we remain committed to our climate strategy and our goal to achieve carbon neutrality from our Scope 1 emissions by 2050. Mon Power continues securing commitments from residential, commercial and industrial customers in the state to purchase solar RECs from our 5 planned utility-scale solar generation facilities totaling 50 megawatts.This week, we filed an update with the commission to begin moving forward with 3 of the 5 sites, totaling 30 megawatts of capacity and to obtain approval of a small surcharge.Turning to first quarter results and other financial matters. First quarter GAAP earnings were $0.51 per share and operating earnings were $0.60 per share, which is just below the midpoint of our guidance despite the impact of a very mild winter across our footprint. Absent the impact of weather, we were on plan for the quarter. In our distribution business, first quarter results benefited primarily from our capital investment programs, higher weather-adjusted load and lower operating expenses, including employee benefit costs and the maintenance work we accelerated into 2022.These were offset by a significant decrease in weather-related demand, lower pension credits and higher financing costs related to our financing activity in the second half of 2022. Record-setting mild temperatures this winter, with heating degree days 18% below last year, impacted total customer demand by 8% or $0.12 per share.On a weather-adjusted basis, distribution deliveries increased more than 2%, which was very nice to see. Residential sales decreased 8% from the first quarter of 2022, but increased 5% on a weather-adjusted basis. Compared to prepandemic levels, weather-adjusted sales to residential customers are trending about 4% higher. In the commercial sector, deliveries decreased 7% compared to the first quarter of 2022 due to lower weather-related demand, but increased almost 2% on a weather-adjusted basis. While sales to commercial customers continue to recover, they lack 2019 levels by more than 4%. Finally, first quarter 2023 sales to industrial customers decreased slightly compared to the first quarter of 2022, driven by the chemicals, metals and plastics sectors. Industrial sales remained just below prepandemic levels, but we continue to see fairly strong growth in some of our other industrial sectors, such as steel, services and other manufacturing.As for weather-adjusted load, we do expect a positive trend to continue relative to our plan, especially in the residential class, helping offset some of the lower weather-related sales we experienced in the first quarter. Additionally, operating expenses in our distribution business reflect the continued focus on our cost structure, and we are pursuing additional cost reductions to further offset the impact of mild first quarter temperatures.Turning to first quarter drivers in our transmission business. Results primarily benefited from rate base growth of 8% compared to the first quarter of 2022 associated with our Energizing the Future investment program, offset by dilution from the minority interest sale in FET that closed in May 2022. As Jon mentioned, we started the year off strong with our capital investment program in our transmission business, deploying nearly $350 million of capital, which is significantly above our internal plan.First quarter results in our Corporate segment benefited from higher investment earnings from Signal Peak and lower financing costs associated with holding company debt redemptions in 2022, which more than offset the lower pension credit.Signal Peak's contribution in Q1 of this year was $0.08 per share, but we expect a slight decrease to its projected earnings for the full year due to current forward market prices for coal. While weather had a significant impact for the first 3 months of the year, it's not taking us off our plan. We expect to offset the weather impact this quarter as well as projected lower earnings contribution from Signal Peak through stronger weather-adjusted load, additional cost reduction opportunities as well as opportunities to optimize our financing plans.Thank you for your time this morning. We recognize we have some work to do given the mild winter temperatures this quarter, but we see this as manageable. We remain focused on executing our plan and creating long-term value for our investors, customers, communities and employees. Now let's open the call to your questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question is from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.Shahriar PourrezaJust a couple of ones here. We're sort of thinking about the upcoming Ohio rate case. Just maybe from a high level, what sort of -- what are the asks there? Is it primary capital and rate base, deferred costs, O&amp;M true-ups? Do you sort of anticipate something to be more rate-neutral?And kind of related to that, how should we be thinking about historical precedents with sort of a newer commission as we think about some of the key regulatory items like goodwill and how that may be treated differently in this upcoming case?K. Jon TaylorYes. Well, Shar, so if you look at the returns for the Ohio utilities, they've been trending down over the last few years. If you go back to 2020, we were reporting returns in the 13% range versus 8.3% as of the end of March.Obviously, the seat settlement that we reached back in 2021 impacted the returns significantly with those annual rate credits to customers, the accounting changes that we made around veg management and corporate support cost had an impact on our returns as well as just continued investment in rate base with about $1.5 billion of incremental rate base, which is over 50% since the last rate case, which comes with the associated increases in depreciation and property taxes.And to your point, if you look at recently approved rate cases in Ohio, ROEs have averaged somewhere between 9.5% to 9.9% and capital structures with equity between 50% to 54%. And that's really in line with what's included in our DCR and AMI riders that recovers our distribution reliability and in Grid Mod capital investment program. So I feel like we've positioned the Ohio companies the best we can, and we're looking forward to the opportunity to file the case next year.Shahriar PourrezaGot it. And then lastly for me, just obviously, it's impacting the stock a little bit this morning. Just in your cue, there's some new language around potentially using hybrids. Can you just maybe expand on that, how it ties into your thinking around equity? Are you kind of looking at converts in the traditional sense or ones that have been utilized lately with some of your peers where the window to convert is shorter, it's less dilutive, you don't really get the equity credit? I guess, really, the question here is, are you looking for equity credit or not?K. Jon TaylorWell, I would say our first focus is filing the application for the Brookfield transaction and to get that closed. And if you think about that transaction, coupled with the other transactions that we've already closed on, we will have raised $7 billion of equity or equity-like capital.When it comes to other instruments that you're referring to, we look at all types of instruments all the time to see if we can maximize or optimize our financing plan and that's exactly what we do. If you're looking at our short-term borrowing rate at 6.5%, 7%, we feel like we need to look at opportunities to find cheap financing to offset those costs.Shahriar PourrezaGot it. So just to summarize your language around not needing equity has not changed to the plan?K. Jon TaylorCorrect. Correct.OperatorOur next question is from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.Jeremy Bryan TonetJust want to come back to Signal Peak a little bit, if you could. Just wondering, I guess, beyond 2024, what's the run rate EPS contribution? How should we think about that over time? And is there a strategic plan for the asset going forward?K. Jon TaylorSo Jeremy, we've talked about before. In our plan today, we see Signal Peak's earnings contribution declining on an absolute basis as well as a relative basis. So less than 10% of the earnings going forward. And right now, if you look at the price curve for Newcastle Coal, on average about $175 a ton, that supports that assumption. Strategically, we've looked at that asset before. It's a very difficult asset to monetize, but it is something that we look at from time to time, we'll continue to do so.Jeremy Bryan TonetGot it. That's helpful. And then just wanted to kind of dive into weather, a little bit more, if I could. And clearly outlined before, I guess, offset to $0.38 pension headwind, but then weather is probably a bit more of an impact on the plan than when the guidance was originally provided.And you talked about, I guess, Signal Peak weather just load additional cost reduction opportunities and optimizing the finance plan to offset weather. But just wondering if you could quantify a little bit more how you've seen the weather impact versus plan for year-to-date or expectations at this point? And which of those buckets present kind of the bigger opportunities to deliver offsets?K. Jon TaylorYes. So the weather for Q1 was about a $0.12 impact to the plan. Absent the abnormal conditions we saw in Q1, we would be slightly ahead of plan for the first quarter. Now we have seen positive, what I'll call, weather-adjusted load primarily in our residential sector. We've seen that trend over the last several months.In fact, if you look at the last few years, our residential load typically comes in anywhere from 1% to 2% better than our load forecast. And so we see a little bit of a tailwind associated with weather-adjusted load for the rest of the year. As you mentioned, we are looking at further cost reduction opportunities.You probably saw, we've terminated some sponsorship agreements. We announced a facility optimization plan that -- to consolidate real estate. And we're also being very selective in backfilling attrition, especially for our non-bargaining employees. And then we're also looking at our financing plan, as I mentioned earlier, in terms of how we can reduce short-term borrowings and we get better cost of capital associated with our debt financings.Jeremy Bryan TonetGot it. That's helpful. So even if 2Q guidance was below, I guess, where The Street was, things are still kind of progressing in line with your expectations and these offsets can keep you firmly towards the midpoint of your plan?K. Jon TaylorThat's right. In fact, if you look at just quarter by quarter and if you think about last year, really what's going to help us offset the pension is some of the actions we took last year to accelerate operating expenses from '23 into '22, and we really didn't make that decision until the third quarter. So you'll really see the uplift in earnings beginning in the third quarter.OperatorOur next question is from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.Steven Isaac FleishmanYes. John, maybe just -- John, 2 Johns, Somerhalder, just a little more color on kind of the Board's thoughts on hiring Brian and kind of what you think he brings to the company?John William SomerhalderYes. I mean as we've talked about, Steve, Brian was always someone that we thought would be very good in this role because of his deep experience in this industry. Also his time [at] Blackstone, that was very valuable experience. So we always viewed him as a really good candidate. We were very pleased that early this year.We saw him as available. We did not before that, but we saw that he saw the great fit as well. So there was mutual belief that he could be the right person. And truly his experience around regulatory environment in Ohio, other locations, all of his experience around the best way to run the operations and optimize operations over time, all fit with our plan. The heavy investments in our wires business, our T&amp;D business, and so the more we discussed earlier this year with Brian, the more we saw that is the right fit.And obviously, the Board really feels good about the fact that Brian will be joining us on June 1. We've been able to spend some time with Brian. He's been very busy, but we've spent some very good quality time, and I continue to be very confident that he's the right person and I'm very confident in his ability to execute and deliver on our plan.Steven Isaac FleishmanOkay. And just along those lines, there seems to be kind of -- I know it's kind of hard to speak for Brian, but just there's been some narrative that maybe Brian comes in and like rebases the plan. Just any thoughts on like is that unlikely, assuming people are thinking rebates lower when they say that?John William SomerhalderYes, Steve, I mean, we have spent a good amount of time with Brian and provided a lot of good information. Based upon my interactions with Brian, I'm confident that he's committed to execute on our plan.Steven Isaac FleishmanYes. And then just on the whole issue with the kind of thinking about -- I'm sorry, just on the hybrid comment, I just wanted to just clarify that one more time. The -- when you're thinking about optimizing the financing cost, this is more of like a hybrid that's focused on a debt-like instrument like TPL and Southern and (inaudible) and a bunch of people have just done and not something that's more equity focused?K. Jon TaylorThat's correct.OperatorOur next question is from David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley.David Keith ArcaroNoticed that another phase of the New Jersey offshore wind transmission need was issued recently, and you had success in the first one. So I was wondering if you had any early read, if you could speak to your prospects for this next round of transmission need?K. Jon TaylorYes, Dave, I mean, I think we'll take a look at all of those types of proposals as they come up. We -- I don't -- I think it's too early to handicap at this stage our prospects. But something that we're very interested in participating in. We think we're well positioned in the state to provide value and support those plans, and we'll keep the investor community up to speed as we progress.David Keith ArcaroGot it. And on coal-driven earnings this year and on Signal Peak, I guess we've seen domestic coal prices notch down quite a bit since the beginning of the year. I was wondering if there's any view of a declining earnings contribution for this year, specifically versus what you had been originally contemplating in the guidance or do you have visibility into contracted levels that would potentially insulate you there?K. Jon TaylorYes. I mean we have seen some decline in Newcastle power prices or coal prices, but you got to remember that about 60% of their volume was already locked in at a fixed price and about 40% of it was indexed to Newcastle coal prices. So we have seen with those index times a slight deterioration in the earnings contribution for Signal Peak, but it's not nearly as dramatic as the decline in Newcastle forward prices, and it's manageable in the context of what we're thinking about for this year.John William SomerhalderYes. I mean there are -- there is a fairly big disconnect between domestic coal prices in the U.S. compared to seaborne coal prices. And the good news is the first quarter came in very much in line with what our expectations were. And if you look at the forward curve, even though it's coming down, it's very much in line and supportive of what we have in our '24 and '25 plan. The real impact we see is this year, the prices because of the supply-demand fundamentals, milder conditions in Europe, fairly robust supply from some areas that supply Newcastle coal, Australia and others, the impact tends to be over the next several quarters where we see the impact. And as John said, that's what we're putting together plans to make sure we have other ways to address that and stay on track with our plan.David Keith ArcaroYes. Okay. That makes sense. One more quick question for me. I was curious just with the New Jersey management audit report that came out recently, wondering if you could just give your view, your perspective on that and initiatives you might be pursuing in the state around some of the recommendations there.K. Jon TaylorWell, it was a very comprehensive report. We're continuing to review the recommendations. I think we have an opportunity to provide feedback at some point down the road, and we'll do that at the right time. But we're going through the recommendations. I think there are many recommendations that we'll accept, but there are probably some recommendations that we'll need to have further discussion on.OperatorOur next question is from Angie Storozynski with Seaport Global.Agnieszka Anna StorozynskiSo maybe first with 2024 and how you plan to manage your pension's costs. So yes, I see the OPEB and pension cost trackers embedded in the New Jersey and Maryland applications. The Ohio issue and the Pennsylvania won't be addressed for a while, you'll have lower contributions from Signal Peak, as you just noted, and yes, I know that the market has recovered somewhat.But looking at your allocation, you have an issue on the credit side, right, with the investments at least based on the latest disclosures on how you allocated your pension accounts. So should we brace for another weakness -- another year of weakness in earnings in '24 associated with pension?K. Jon TaylorWell, I mean, Angie, I think through the first quarter, the pension has performed very well. I think the returns were 7%. The discount rate had come down about 20 basis points. And we're tracking to that level as we speak today. And so in the plan, we have pension, the pension kind of at the same level we have this year, and we're working to get trackers to protect the companies from volatility in the pension plan in New Jersey, in Maryland and we'll likely propose something like that in West Virginia.So we are doing what we can to protect customers as well as investors from the volatility in the pension plan. But based on everything we know today, everything is tracking a little bit better than we had anticipated.Agnieszka Anna StorozynskiOkay. Okay. And then changing topics on the other, John, maybe. Okay, so we have gone through a couple of catalysts that were supposed to benefit the stock. The discounts on a relative basis hasn't really changed. I understand that we're still waiting for upgrades to investment grade at the holdco level.But is there -- as the Board looks at what's been happening, is there any suggestions maybe to change the course? Or is it just sticking to the current plan and then over time, the execution against the plan will basically be reflected in the stock?John William SomerhalderYes. I think absolutely the latter. The Board strongly supports the plan. I mean, we view this as -- the most important thing is that we execute on the plan and continue to execute on the plan. I think our track record over the last year or 2 related to the Brookfield first transaction Jon talked about, the second transaction. What we've done related to even with supply chain issues, making sure that we are investing in our business and meeting our schedules on capital deployment.The Board really views that the steps we've taken to date, the good progress we've made and continued execution on that plan is what will deliver the value and close that discount gap that you referenced. So Board is firmly committed to that plan.OperatorOur next question is from Sophie Karp with KeyBanc.Sophie Ksenia KarpMaybe first about the Ohio rate case that you will be filing in the not-so-distant future. I was wondering if you guys considered or is it under consideration to combine the 3 utilities in Ohio and what kind of challenges would that present if you were to request something like that?K. Jon TaylorWell, I do think at some point down the road, we are going to look to consolidate our Ohio utilities just like we've proposed in Pennsylvania. The timing is a little bit to be determined. And so we're just working through that. But regardless of whether we propose to consolidate, you're still going to likely have 3 sets of rate books, right?And you'll kind of get to parity within the tariffs over time. I think we've had other utilities in the state that have consolidated their entities as well as their rate books, and that took some time. The legal entity consolidation is one step, but then to consolidate from a rate perspective, probably takes several rate cases a few years, that type of thing. So it is something that we're looking at and we'll likely execute on, but the timing is a little bit to be determined.Sophie Ksenia KarpGot it. And my follow-up is on West Virginia. So the acquisition, the potential acquisition of Pleasants that you're exploring there, I don't know how to phrase it, but is there a way that -- is it possible that if you could pay political price there if you decided to not go through with that? Like in other words, is it almost like an impossible situation for you where you have to acquire it?John William SomerhalderWhat we're committed to do is work very closely with the state of West Virginia with the commission. And they've instructed us to do this analysis. I mean we see this as -- we all have an interest to make sure this is in the best interest of the customers in West Virginia, the state of West Virginia. And that because of the fact that the plant is a newer plant has enhanced environmental controls, it's a good question that needs to be evaluated.So we see it as an appropriate thing to do. We do need to make sure it's in the best interest of our customers and all. And so we see this as an opportunity to truly evaluate whether this is the right path forward. We're committed to work with the group or with all the stakeholders in West Virginia.OperatorOur next question is from Mr. Gregg Orrill with UBS.Gregg Gillander OrrillYes. Just following up on sort of the Ohio audits and the ability to -- what is sort of the ability to maybe accelerate those? You've got the stay there. Obviously, it's not a process that you've set out. But is there any flexibility there to maybe get that resolved faster?K. Jon TaylorGregg, this is Jon Taylor. Those audits have been stayed for another 6-month period. I think that happened back in February. So you're looking at the August timeframe where they could potentially start back up. But in between (inaudible) and then there's really nothing that we can do to resolve those or to continue with that work. It's just really up to the commission who ordered the stay. And as soon as the stay is lifted, then we hope to get back to working to resolve those.OperatorOur next question is from Mr. Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America.Julien Patrick Dumoulin-SmithJust First off, coming back to some of the FE Forward conversation, you guys alluded to it at the start of the call, whether that's real estate optimization or otherwise? Can you elaborate on these today on what that total run rate is? How much of an opportunity and offset the pension that is over time, say, in the outer years? And then separately, Signal Peak, was that hedged out to 2025, how much if any, is (inaudible)K. Jon TaylorYes. I mean so the facility optimization effort is probably a $0.02 run rate type of impact if you look at the lease cost, if you look at the maintenance costs, those types of expenses that we incur associated with the facility. So it's not a significant driver in the terms of the level of O&amp;M that we spend, but it's important. Those types of things add up.And with respect to your second question on Signal peak. They'll probably start hedging '24, I would say, later either this summer or early fall, which is consistent with their past practices. But at this point in time, that's open.Julien Patrick Dumoulin-SmithYes. So that's what I thought. If I can, just pivoting the conversation back to where Steve was going earlier about kind of a longer-term view. At what point in time do you think you come back with a little bit more of a longer-term perspective? I also appreciate that you guys very carefully have focused on this targeted 6% to 8% sort of an annualized basis rather than having these multiyear CAGRs or what have you.But is there at some point where you give kind of a view that gives an extended perspective kind of beyond kind of the noise of what Signal Peak is providing, maybe that adjusts for the pace of rate base growth and reflect something that really is a buy-in from (inaudible)K. Jon TaylorYes. Julien, I don't want to commit to a timeframe. Obviously, we want to get Brian on board and get him ready to go with the plan and put his fingerprint on it. So I'm going to leave it as kind of a to-be-determined. But my sense is, we'll give you that outlook at some point in time. But I just want Brian to come in and really get into the details of the plan and really try to drive where he wants to take the company going forward.Julien Patrick Dumoulin-SmithGot it. And if I can grasp my 1 for other point. You feel good about the 6% to 8% perspective beyond kind of the Signal Peak '24/'25 period, if I hear you right?K. Jon TaylorYes. If you look at the level of capital investment that is needed across the system, yes, I feel really good about the 6% to 8% long term.OperatorOur next question is from Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho.Anthony Christopher CrowdellApologies for not yelling into the phone, but just quickly, just some more housekeeping questions. I guess, on Slide 11, you talk about sales data, really strong residential sales at over 5%, slight industrial decline. I guess if you could just talk about the drivers of what's really driving the residential growth? Is it people moving into the service territory or EVs or something like that?K. Jon TaylorYes. So the 5% when you have like extreme weather conditions like we saw in the first quarter, coming up with your -- the weather impact and the weather adjusted impact, it's a little bit more of an art than a science just because of the extreme circumstances. So -- but what I would say is that the trends over the last few quarters and quite frankly, if you look at our performance over the last few years, the trends have been favorable relative to our forecast in the residential sector, increasing 1% to 3% depending on the month, depending on the time of year. So that's what we're seeing and that's what we're kind of forecasting for the rest of this year.John William SomerhalderYes. I mean we've seen the right trend related to EVs and other factors, not really people moving into the service territory. But that's starting to drive, but that's a fairly small issue right now. Most of what we've seen is really just the trend over the last couple of years of usage residentially with people more working from home and other factors that have influenced it and we're now being able to take that into account with our weather-adjusted load moving forward.Anthony Christopher CrowdellIs the industrial -- and I guess I know that would be extreme weather in the, as John mentioned, are over science. Just a slight decline in industrial load. I think in your prepared remarks, was that more related to just one segment of the economy there?K. Jon TaylorNo. I mean we saw it a little bit like auto has taken a little bit of a downturn in terms of what we're seeing in the industrial sector. Metals was slightly down, plastic and rubber was a little bit down. But we're also seeing some bright points. Steel continues to perform very well. Food and manufacturing tends to perform very well. So it's a little bit of a mix.Anthony Christopher CrowdellAnd then if I could switch gears on Slide 8 where you give us a walk-through and maybe a little different path in Julien's question on the FE Forward to achieve. Just I think you removed $0.05 of earning -- of nonrecurring earnings from GAAP to operating. Just how do we think about those charges as we work through the year? Is it likely that we continue to see those charges or do you think that onetime in nature, we don't really see a repetition of that throughout '23?K. Jon TaylorWell, the $0.05 charge in Q1 was primarily the termination agreement for a sponsorship we had. You won't see that level of cost to achieve going forward.OperatorOur next question is from Mr. Andrew Weisel with Scotiabank.Andrew Marc WeiselAnthony, beat me to it. I was going to say we'll miss hearing your name bring the brown games, but I understand the decision there. Most of the questions were asked and answered. Just one quick on FFO to debt. I know you were at 11% last year. You're very clear on the 14% to 15% target over time. My question is kind of what's your latest thinking on when you might get there? Given the FET sale and some moving parts around coal, could we see that level in 2024 or is it going to take a couple more years of growth?K. Jon TaylorNo, we definitely have a solid plan to get there by 2025. I think a lot of it depends on the level of proceeds that comes in from the FET sale initially. We have -- we'll see 50% of the proceeds that's a minimum, but we could see more and put that money to work. And if we receive more of the money upfront, then there's a possibility we could be at that 14% level. If you net the receivable against the debt, we would absolutely be at 14%. But once we get the proceeds and put that to work, we'll be in that 14% to 15% range.OperatorThere are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Somerhalder for closing comments.John William SomerhalderThank you. Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We very much appreciate your continued support this year.OperatorThis concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.]"

The industry tends to come with higher-than-normal valuations, because investors expect exponential growth. It’s a rapidly changing landscape, and companies that ride the wave of the next big thing can deliver explosive growth.However, rising inflation also mean a dollar in 10 years isn’t worth as much today as it was just a year ago. That simple mathematical fact means tech valuations have come down, but in some cases, arguably a little too far.An excellent place to start your search for tech stocks to invest in for the long haul is hot industries. Artificial Intelligence is an obvious candidate, given all of the attention it’s been getting recently. It’s a market expected to grow at a compound annual rate of almost 40% through 2030. That kind of growth offers many possibilities, and investors would be silly to leave that sector out of the discussion. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAnother critical area to explore is essential services. We’re not talking about healthcare here (though there are plenty of options in this arena as well). Rather, we’re talking about the businesses that support businesses.Belt-tightening is a reality when times are lean, and it’s something we’re seeing across the board in the corporate world. But there are certain things a business can’t do without. Accordingly, the tech firms that provide those products and services will be well-positioned to thrive even in an uncertain environment.MSFTMicrosoft$281.77ASMLASML Holdings$627.38CRMSalesforce$194.92Microsoft (MSFT)Image of corporate building with Microsoft logo above the entrance.Source: NYCStock / Shutterstock.comMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) boasts an impressive portfolio of solid businesses that offer a layer of security in an otherwise unstable environment, making the firm one of the best long-term stocks to consider. Its offerings include some things businesses and consumers can’t live without. From LinkedIn to Office 365, there are plenty of must-haves that will never be struck off a company’s list of essentials. Story continuesThese products offer a bedrock to build on, and Microsoft’s doing just that with its cloud arm, Azure. The pay-as-you-go cloud computing service provides an alternative to coping with the high up-front costs that come with building out your arsenal of servers. This means businesses using Azure can do more with less. These customers can scale up their tech offerings without much friction.Microsoft’s also sitting on solid financials, allowing for strategic acquisitions and underpinning a modest dividend. This comes at a premium, with MSFT stock trading at a price-earnings ratio of 32-times. Although this suggests investors expect big things, it’s not as high as it has been in the past. Accordingly, now could be an excellent time to snap up shares before they take off. ASML Holdings (ASML)Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboardSource: Ralf Liebhold / ShutterstockIt’s often said that the miners weren’t the ones that made the big bucks during the gold rush. Instead, it was the sellers of shovels and pick-axes. ASML (NASDAQ:ASML) is the proverbial pick-axe seller in the semiconductor space, and Artificial Intelligence, self-driving cars, and cloud computing are all akin to the gold rush.ASML makes the lithography machines used to make the chips themselves. They’re an essential part of the process, making ASML one of the best long-term tech stocks. The company’s main obstacle is shoring up its operations to grow and meet the ballooning demand for semiconductors. This is no easy feat, and will cost hundreds of millions of euros over the next five years. However, thanks to rock-solid financials, this growth looks doable.Plus, the company’s valuation has decreased somewhat since its highs during the pandemic. That offers investors an attractive entry point as the boom in chipmaking continues to swell.Salesforce (CRM)lose up of Salesforce (CRM) logo displayed on one of their towers in downtown San Francisco. Salesforce layoffsSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comSalesforce (NYSE:CRM) offers customer relationship management software, a necessity for almost every business, making it one of the best long-term tech stocks to buy. The group’s been growing its portfolio to include a range of complimentary services allowing cross-selling. Their services give businesses the tools to enhance their customer relationships, offering meaningful value in a challenging environment. Acquiring new customers is much more complex and expensive than holding on to, and up-selling to, existing customers. Over the past two years, CRM’s share price has decreased somewhat, bringing its valuation to more reasonable levels. The company has been hit by the same challenges everyone else has, leading to staff cuts and efficiency programs to protect margins. While this isn’t ideal, it’s not the end of the world, and won’t last forever. For patient investors willing to wait through this period of instability, Salesforce is a strong pick among tech stocks to buy for the long haul. On the date of publication, Marie Brodbeck held shares in Microsoft.

50,bc494294-9282-3a67-8a2f-f0dcafb0b1b4,MCO,2023-04-29,Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Has Announced That It Will Be Increasing Its Dividend To $0.77,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/moodys-nyse-mco-announced-increasing-120639959.html,1682769999,STORY,['MCO'],"[Moody's Corporation's (NYSE:MCO) dividend will be increasing from last year's payment of the same period to $0.77 on 9th of June. Despite this raise, the dividend yield of 1.0% is only a modest boost to shareholder returns. Check out our latest analysis for Moody's Moody's' Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageIf it is predictable over a long period, even low dividend yields can be attractive. However, Moody's' earnings easily cover the dividend. This means that most of its earnings are being retained to grow the business.The next year is set to see EPS grow by 71.6%. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 25%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.historic-dividendMoody's Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has an extended history of paying stable dividends. Since 2013, the dividend has gone from $0.64 total annually to $3.08. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 17% a year over that time. We can see that payments have shown some very nice upward momentum without faltering, which provides some reassurance that future payments will also be reliable.Moody's Could Grow Its DividendSome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. It's encouraging to see that Moody's has been growing its earnings per share at 6.9% a year over the past five years. A low payout ratio and decent growth suggests that the company is reinvesting well, and it also has plenty of room to increase the dividend over time.We Really Like Moody's' DividendIn summary, it is always positive to see the dividend being increased, and we are particularly pleased with its overall sustainability. Distributions are quite easily covered by earnings, which are also being converted to cash flows. All in all, this checks a lot of the boxes we look for when choosing an income stock.Story continuesMarket movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance. For example, we've picked out 2 warning signs for Moody's that investors should know about before committing capital to this stock. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

52,32d17b4f-ae9a-3fdc-b09c-dc0a124a8d63,MSFT,2023-04-29,Brexit has ushered in a new nanny state,The Telegraph,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/brexit-ushered-nanny-state-120000446.html,1682769600,STORY,"['MSFT', 'ATVI']","[Brexit has ushered in a new nanny stateAnd there I was thinking that the Brexit rallying call of “take back control” did at least mean that the UK economy might finally free itself from the leviathan of oppressive, growth destructive, European regulation.But what's this?It is as though Britain is in competition with the EU over quite how punitively politically suspect – though entirely legitimate – business activity might be treated.Our now shackles-free British rulemakers have in short order prohibited Microsoft's $70bn (£56bn) takeover of the gaming company Activision Blizzard, and coincidentally proposed a plethora of nanny-state measures to crack down on a supposedly delinquent gambling industry.In both cases, this seems to be more a case of taking back control so as to exercise more of it than freeing business from the well-intentioned but enterprise-crushing burden of EU constraint.To have left the European Union only to become more like it seems an odd path to tread.It says a lot about the deficiencies at the heart of the UK economy that gaming and online gambling are in fact two of Britain's most successful industries.According to the Competition and Markets Authority, the gaming industry alone is the UK's largest revenue-generating form of entertainment, with around £5bn in annual revenue, or more than pay TV, video streaming, cinema, music and books.Only last week, the Prime Minister and the Chancellor hosted a celebratory event in Downing Street for Britain's gaming pioneers; the irony of the timing, just as Microsoft President Brad Smith was angrily accusing the UK of being “closed for business” and Activision warned it was reassessing its investment in Britain, was according to reports entirely lost on the Prime Minister, who gleefully immersed himself in an array of show cased made in Britain games, apparently oblivious to the blizzard of condemnation that had greeted the CMA's decision.Microsoft President Brad Smith - AP Photo/Virginia MayoSome of these strictures, which come overwhelmingly from the two parties with the most to lose, should no doubt be treated sceptically.Story continuesThe CMA's decision has effectively scuppered the entire deal, with limited chances of reversal on appeal. It is understandable that Microsoft, which has been working on the transaction for the best part of two years and sees it as key to the company's future, should be angry.But has confidence in the UK really been as “severely shaken” as Mr Smith claims?This seems a little far fetched. There are surely much bigger threats to Britain's “world beating” position in gaming content – tax and the wider regulatory framework for business prime among them – than this.Microsoft is substantially invested in the UK, and has spent decades building its presence here. It is not about to write this off in a petulant fit of pique, and nor is Activision, which is similarly a big employer in the UK.In order to get the deal through, they could conceivably quit the UK market for cloud gaming, but this would be difficult, if not impossible.The threat of such action none the less raises a serious point.The European authorities have, perhaps surprisingly, taken a much more relaxed view of the Activision takeover than the CMA, and indeed seemed minded to accept the very same behavioural remedies proposed by Microsoft that the CMA has rejected.Indeed, were it not for Brexit, the CMA would have had little or no traction on the merger in the first place, even if admittedly it could have fed into the European judgment.As it is, the CMA is fast establishing itself as the world's most hawkish global enforcer, and what is more, one with the powers to ensure that its actions actually have some effect.If the UK gets a reputation for constantly sticking its oar in, and unfairly prohibiting mergers that are regarded more favourably elsewhere, it will in time act as a deterrent to business investment in the UK.Think of it like this: if Norway was to put its foot down and banned Microsoft from acquiring Activision, nobody would bat an eyelid.Microsoft and Activision would simply close their businesses in Norway and move on, little or no harm done to their merger or ongoing business activity. Norway is too small to matter.Yet if the EU were to do the same, the two companies would have no option but to abandon the merger. The EU is the biggest consumer market in the world, and even the mighty Microsoft cannot afford to be out of it.The UK sits somewhere in between. It is too large a market for Microsoft to easily bypass, but not so large that it would be unthinkable.If you believe your plans are going to be constantly scuppered by UK enforcers, you will in time take steps to disengage from the jurisdiction.Nor is it just big multinational corporations where this way of thinking might apply.Smaller, entrepreneurial ventures, like, say, the very same gaming content providers the UK is so good at spawning, might think twice about investing here if they thought attempts to sell the business might be blocked.The CMA's actions also look disproportionate on the specifics of the deal.The CMA finds no reason to block the takeover when it comes to console gaming, which currently accounts for the overwhelming bulk of the $280bn a year global market.Rather it is Microsoft's potential for dominating cloud gaming – widely recognised as the future once current technical and capacity constraints are overcome – that the CMA worries about.Those concerns are instructed by the network effects of Microsoft's already market leading positions in operating systems and cloud computing, and rightly so in some respects.Similar disquiet has been raised about the potential for “big tech” to dominate the nascent technology of generative AI.Furthermore, tech giants such as Microsoft are notorious for gobbling up innovative players in order to snuff out potential future competition.Yet in effectively deciding that big tech should be banned from future takeovers, the CMA's Sarah Cardell has in essence substituted her own judgement for that of the markets, where for the moment there is no competition issue of significance.Truth be told, the CMA has as little idea as you and me how these markets might evolve.The only two significant complainants were Sony and Google, both of whom have skin in the game, and are not averse to using regulators to protect their own incumbent positions.I note that Ian Livingstone, who as co-founder of Games Workshop can reasonably claim to be the godfather of British gaming, seems relatively unconcerned about Microsoft's ambitions.Indeed, many UK content providers see Microsoft's assault on cloud gaming as more of an opportunity than a threat, opening up potentially vast new markets beyond the exclusivity and anti-competitive practices of consoles.Let's protect consumers from egregious big tech by all means, but not on the basis of imagined threats or at the expense of desperately needed investment in UK tech.]"

Shares have lost about 5% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Paychex due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Paychex's Q3 Earnings and Revenues Beat EstimatesPaychex, Inc. reported better-than-expected third-quarter fiscal 2023 results.Adjusted earnings of $1.29 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4% and increased 12.2% on a year-over-year basis.Total revenues of $1.4 billion also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.5% and increased 8.2% year over year. Service revenues of $1.3 billion were up 7% year over year.Quarter DetailsRevenues from the Management Solutions segment increased 7% year over year to $1 billion. The segment benefited from growth in the number of clients and client’s employees served for human capital management (“HCM”), and additional worksite employees for HR Solutions. Also, strong demand for HR Solutions, retirement and time and attendance solutions, price realization, higher product penetration, and expansion of HCM ancillary services acted as tailwinds to the segment.Professional employer organization (“PEO”) and Insurance Solutions’ revenues were $321.2 million, up 6% from the year-ago quarter’s level. The uptick was due to growth in the number of average worksite employees, a rise in average wages per worksite employee, and an increase in state unemployment insurance revenues. Interest on funds held for clients increased more than 100% year over year to $35.3 million.EBITDA of $655.8 million increased 7% year over year. Operating income increased 9% year over year to $611.9 million.Paychex exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $1.3 billion compared with $1.1 billion reported at the end of the prior quarter.

But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like Paychex (NASDAQ:PAYX). Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business. Check out our latest analysis for Paychex Paychex's Earnings Per Share Are GrowingThe market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so you'd expect share price to follow earnings per share (EPS) outcomes eventually. Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS. We can see that in the last three years Paychex grew its EPS by 11% per year. That's a pretty good rate, if the company can sustain it.One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. While we note Paychex achieved similar EBIT margins to last year, revenue grew by a solid 9.5% to US$4.9b. That's a real positive.You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. For finer detail, click on the image.earnings-and-revenue-historyYou don't drive with your eyes on the rear-view mirror, so you might be more interested in this free report showing analyst forecasts for Paychex's future profits.Are Paychex Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Since Paychex has a market capitalisation of US$39b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$4.1b. Holders should find this level of insider commitment quite encouraging, since it would ensure that the leaders of the company would also experience their success, or failure, with the stock.Story continuesIt means a lot to see insiders invested in the business, but shareholders may be wondering if remuneration policies are in their best interest. Our quick analysis into CEO remuneration would seem to indicate they are. Our analysis has discovered that the median total compensation for the CEOs of companies like Paychex, with market caps over US$8.0b, is about US$13m.The Paychex CEO received total compensation of just US$3.6m in the year to May 2022. First impressions seem to indicate a compensation policy that is favourable to shareholders. CEO remuneration levels are not the most important metric for investors, but when the pay is modest, that does support enhanced alignment between the CEO and the ordinary shareholders. Generally, arguments can be made that reasonable pay levels attest to good decision-making.Is Paychex Worth Keeping An Eye On?One important encouraging feature of Paychex is that it is growing profits. The fact that EPS is growing is a genuine positive for Paychex, but the pleasant picture gets better than that. With company insiders aligning themselves considerably with the company's success and modest CEO compensation, there's no arguments that this is a stock worth looking into. Of course, identifying quality businesses is only half the battle; investors need to know whether the stock is undervalued. So you might want to consider this free discounted cashflow valuation of Paychex.The beauty of investing is that you can invest in almost any company you want.

In the last reported quarter, the company delivered an earnings miss of 2.6%.Q2 EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 64 cents per share, indicating growth of 8.5% year over year. In the past seven days, earnings estimates for the current quarter have remained stable. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $8.4 billion, suggesting an increase of 9.9% from the year-ago quarter.Factors to NoteIn the quarter, the company’s earnings are likely to have benefited from robust North America comps, expansion efforts and digitalization. Menu innovation and exceptional loyalty program aids Starbucks. In the quarter to be reported, SBUX is likely to have witnessed an increase in international sales, which has remained a cause of concern for the past few quarters.For second-quarter fiscal 2023, our model predicts North America sales and Channel Development sales to be $6,047.6 million and $472.7 million, up 11.1% and 2.1% year over year, respectively. Starbucks is gaining from an increase in transactions and average ticket growth. We expect international sales to increase 1.7% year over year to $1,732.1 million.Inflationary pressures and increased investments in store partner wages and benefits are likely to have affected the bottom line in the quarter-to-be reported. Our model estimates adjusted operating margin to be 13%, flat year over year.

67,714570f0-300a-3dcd-867b-897b928d786b,PH,2023-04-29,4 Industrial Stocks Set to Deliver a Beat This Earnings Season,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-industrial-stocks-set-deliver-133701926.html,1682689021,STORY,"['JCI', 'IR', 'ZBRA', 'PH']","[The first-quarter 2023 earnings season is in the nascent stage for the Zacks Industrial Products sector. The handful of companies that have reported earnings so far have put up better-than-expected performances on strength across key end markets, improving supply chains and robust price realization. However, cost inflation has played a spoilsport for these companies.Amid a softer demand environment, the latest Earnings Trends report reflects muted earnings and revenue growth for the S&amp;P 500 companies within the Industrial Products sector. First-quarter 2023 earnings are expected to increase 1.6% year over year for the sector compared with a 15.9% rise recorded in the fourth quarter of 2022. Revenues for the sector are estimated to climb 5.9% year over year compared with a 9.7% increase reported in the fourth quarter of 2022.Out of the 20% of the S&amp;P 500 companies within the Industrial Products sector that have reported earnings numbers, 60% each beat on earnings and revenues, while 40% surpassed both earnings and revenue estimates.Below we have discussed industrial companies like Ingersoll Rand IR, Johnson Controls International JCI, Parker-Hannifin Corporation PH and Zebra Technologies ZBRA that are set to trump earnings estimates this reporting cycle.Key Factors for Q1A low-demand environment, thanks to weakness in the manufacturing sector, is likely to have weighed on the first-quarter performances of sector participants. Per the Institute for Supply Management’s latest report, the Manufacturing Purchasing Manager's Index touched 46.3% in March, reflecting a contraction in manufacturing activities for the fifth consecutive month. A figure below 50 indicates a contraction in manufacturing activity. The New Orders Index has remained in contraction territory for the past several months.Despite easing, cost inflation remains a major challenge for industrial companies. An anticipated increase in raw material costs is expected to have affected the bottom-line performance of these companies. A stronger U.S. dollar might also have impacted the overseas business performance of these companies.Despite a slowdown in the manufacturing sector, strength across prominent end markets, such as life science, water &amp; wastewater, chemical, agricultural, food and energy industries, is expected to have aided performance. Cost-control measures, effective pricing and operational execution are expected to have driven the top line of industrial companies.Improving supply chains and faster deliveries, and better availability of raw materials are expected to have benefited performance in the to-be-reported quarter.Story continuesHow to Pick Winners?Given the large number of players operating in the transportation space, picking the right stocks is not an easy task. But our proven model makes it fairly simple. One can shortlist with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold), which increases the odds of an earnings beat. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they report earnings with our Earnings ESP Filter.Earnings ESP — the percentage difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate — is our proprietary methodology for determining the stocks with maximum chances of delivering positive earnings surprises in their next announcements. Our research shows that for stocks with this perfect combination, the chances of a beat are as high as 70%.Our ChoicesBelow we list four industrial stocks that have the right mix of elements to pull off an earnings surprise this time around.Ingersoll Rand has an Earnings ESP of +2.32% and a Zacks Rank #1. The company is scheduled to release first-quarter 2023 results on May 3.Ingersoll Rand’s first-quarter performance is expected to have benefited from higher orders for compressors, vacuum and blowers, power tools and lifting.

That’s because we have this idea that doing good involves sacrificing capitalistic intent like achieving profitability. To some extent, it’s a reasonable assumption. After all, true charity doesn’t involve a cynical attempt to move up financially. However, some evidence indicates that ESG stocks to buy can also have a positive impact on the bottom line.Increasingly, the public monitors indices such as ESG ratings to make more informed purchasing decisions. As well, the relevant millennial generation and the emerging Generation Z care deeply about environmental issues and other sustainability initiatives. Put another way, you don’t want to be the company ticking off your consumer base. Below are viable ESG stocks to buy.MSFTMicrosoft$279.97INTUIntuit$426.57IDXXIDEXX Laboratories$495.09POOLPool Corporation$341.84NEENextEra Energy$78.06HSTHost Hotels and Resorts$16.00BGBunge$91.26InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsMicrosoft (MSFT)man's hand holding wads of cashSource: Vova Shevchuk / Shutterstock.comOne of the most well-recognized technology firms in the world, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is an indelible presence in the business ecosystem. However, it’s also one of the top ESG stocks to buy. Notably, Microsoft committed that by 2030, the enterprise will be carbon negative. By 2050, the company seeks to remove its historical emissions since its founding in 1975.Financially, Microsoft confirms that ESG investing doesn’t necessarily need to result in giving up all pretenses of profitability. First, the enterprise benefits from a strong balance sheet, as evidenced by its stout Altman Z-Score of 8.99. Also, the tech giant posts a three-year revenue growth rate of 17.4%, outpacing 71.17% of companies listed in the software industry. As well, Microsoft’s net margin pings at just over 33%. This stat ranks better than nearly 97% of the competition.Story continuesFinally, Wall Street analysts peg MSFT as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target comes out to $307.37, implying almost 8% upside potential.Intuit (INTU)An image of a street sign post with directions labeled ""Buy"", ""Hold"", and ""Sell""Source: PX Media / ShutterstockAnother example of ESG stocks trading in the software space, Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) focuses on the financial services realm. It’s best known for its tax-preparation software TurboTax and QuickBooks. However, the company also attempts to do good in the world. Primarily, Intuit ranks high on corporate responsibility, supporting diversity, equity, and inclusion programs.Financially, Intuit also delivers an attractive canvas. First, it enjoys a solid balance sheet, posting an Altman Z-Score of 8.17. This measurement indicates high fiscal stability and a low risk of imminent bankruptcy. In addition, Intuit features a three-year revenue growth rate of 20.4%, outpacing 75.55% of its software peers. Moreover, the company benefits from strong profit margins, particularly its net margin of 14.22%. This stat rises above 85.3% of the competition.Lastly, covering analysts peg INTU as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target lands at $488.88, implying almost 10% upside potential.IDEXX Laboratories (IDXX)Man holding stacks of money. Millionaire.Source: Epic Cure / ShutterstockBased in Westbrook, Maine, IDEXX Laboratories (NASDAQ:IDXX) engages in the development, manufacture, and distribution of products and services for the companion animal veterinary, livestock and poultry, water testing, and dairy markets. One of the top ESG stocks, Idexx supports various positive initiatives, ranging from environmental sustainability to community services. In addition, the company features strong scores among various ESG ratings.On the financial front, Idexx matches the prior ESG leaders with a stout Altman Z-Score. In this case, Idexx hit 15.62, indicating an extremely low risk of bankruptcy. Operationally, the company features a three-year book growth rate of 52.4%, outpacing 88.24% of firms listed in the medical diagnostics and research industry. Also, it’s consistently profitable year in, year out. In the trailing 12 months, Idexx’s net margin stands at 20.17%.To close out, analysts peg IDXX as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target hits $559.57, implying nearly 13% upside potential.Pool (POOL)A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.Source: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.comHailing from Louisiana, Pool (NASDAQ:POOL) bills itself as the world’s leading distributor of swimming pool supplies, equipment, and related outdoor products. Attempting a recovery from the consumer economy fallout of 2022, POOL stock gained over 14% of equity value since the January opener. In the trailing year, it’s still down about 20%.Nevertheless, fortunes might change as POOL ranks among the ESG stocks to consider. Featuring a commitment to governance protocols – including ethics and compliance – Pool also seeks to minimize its environmental footprint through energy efficiency solutions and waste reduction. As millennials and Gen Z continue to expand in purchasing power, these efforts should be appreciated.Regarding the financials, Pool makes a case for investments tied to ESG growth. Operationally, its three-year sales growth rate pings at 25.6%, above 91.72% of the competition. Also, it’s consistently profitable. Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg POOL as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $395, implying 15% upside potential.NextEra Energy (NEE)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar bills. Bank stocksSource: shutterstock.com/CC7An obvious idea among ESG stocks to buy, NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) easily represents one of the ESG leaders thanks to its core business. An energy company, NextEra represents the largest electric utility holding firm by market capitalization, per its public profile. Featuring a vast network of wind and solar facilities, the company also operates generating plants powered by multiple means.Naturally, NextEra represents a mainstay for ESG investing because of its commitment to clean energy generation. As well, its energy efficiency programs include bolstering transmission lines for both efficiency and resilience. Admittedly, NextEra could use some work in the financial department. For example, its balance sheet on paper doesn’t offer the most confident look.However, like other utility plays, NextEra benefits from a natural monopoly. As a result, it enjoys consistent profitability. Looking to the Street, analysts peg NEE as a consensus strong buy. Overall, their average price target comes out to $91.73, implying over 16% upside potential.Host Hotels &amp; Resorts (HST)tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comSitting within the broader lodging industry, Host Hotels &amp; Resorts (NASDAQ:HST) might not be the first idea that comes to mind when targeting enterprises with strong ESG ratings. Nevertheless, HST might be an intriguing opportunity for contrarian market participants. A real estate investment trust that focuses on hotels, Host Hotels may benefit from relevancies from Gen Z.According to a recent CNBC report, Gen Z consumers – who on average care about sustainability – tend to value experiences more so than prior generations. Therefore, they’re willing to spend on various excursions despite being short on cash. Sure enough, the company commits to various environmental initiatives, which might attract this age cohort.Financially, HST represents a higher-risk profile because of its negative long-term sales trend resulting from the Covid-19 impact. However, it might be undervalued based on operating cash flow. Lastly, analysts peg HST as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $20.09, implying nearly 24% upside potential. Thus, it’s an interesting example of ESG stocks if you can handle the risk.Bunge (BG)Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words ""buy"" and ""sell"" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image.Source: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.comAn extraordinarily relevant idea among ESG leaders, Bunge (NYSE:BG) is an agribusiness and food company. Specializing in the international soybean export industry, Bunge also targets food processing, grain trading, and fertilizer manufacturing. Despite its pertinence, BG slipped half a percent below parity for the year. In the past 365 days, it fell more than 18%.As one of the top ESG stocks, Bunge cares deeply about sustainability issues. According to its website, management makes decisions across its value chain built on the foundations of ethical leadership, accountability, and environmental stewardship.On the financial spectrum, Bunge delivers decent stability in the balance sheet with an Altman Z-Score of 4.58. Also, its three-year revenue growth rate pings at 14.7%, above 76.43% of its peers. Notably, the market prices BG at a forward multiple of 8.12. As a discount to projected earnings, Bunge ranks better than 87.78% of the competition. On a final note, analysts peg BG as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $119.60, implying nearly 26% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

The high-flying tribute is dedicated to Southwest® Employees and to communities across Hawaii that welcomed the carrier with warm aloha. Imua is a rallying cry in the Hawaiian language that translates to an urging forward, and it underscores a key value at Southwest—Teamwork. For more than five decades, the People of Southwest have moved together toward an ever-brighter future with their unmistakably unique strength of courage and spirit.Southwest Airlines Unveils Imua One, a High-Flying Tribute, with Gratitude to Southwest Employees and the People in Hawaii they Serve""When we dedicate an airplane, it's not only a symbol of gratitude, but also of a promise we've made,"" said Bob Jordan, President &amp; Chief Executive Officer at Southwest Airlines. ""Hawaii welcomed Southwest with warm aloha, and we approached serving the people of Hawaii with an earnest desire to connect them with important moments, places, and the people who matter most in their lives. We've grown since our first arrival on the Islands four years ago, to 90 departures a day, thanks to the support of Island communities. Each flight is filled with—and powered by—an essence of aloha, combined with the Heart of Southwest and our People, all working together and moving forward.""To access broadcast-quality footage, high-res images of Imua One, and photos from today's event, visit swamedia.com.Story continuesOahu-based Osaki Creative Group designed Imua One with the guidance of Herman Piikea Clark, Kanaka Maoli/indigenous Hawaiian artist, designer, and researcher. Its distinctive design features eight elements that represent concepts in Hawaiian culture that also align with Southwest values. The aircraft design features stars for each of the five airports in Hawaii Southwest serves (Honolulu, Lihue (Kauai), Kahului (Maui), Kona (Island of Hawaii), and Hilo (Island of Hawaii); six paddlers in an outrigger bring to life the concept of Imua; and six turtles in two groups of three to represent harmony and balance. Emblazoned near the nose of the aircraft, a lei honors unique Islands through their official flowers. Reflective of distinctive colors in the Southwest Heart livery, including bold blue, warm red, and sunrise yellow, a gradient transition from blue to yellow represents the evolution from night to day, and honors Hawaiian history of journeying the Pacific using wind, and following the guidance of the sun, stars, and moon to navigate.The eight central visual elements of the Imua One livery hold significance in Hawaii and at Southwest:Ohana (Family): Root in relationshipsHonu (Turtle): Move with perseveranceAina (Land): Find common groundAma (Support): Connect to strengthen and balanceHoku (Star): Guide with purposeKai (Ocean): Harness good energyLokahi (Unity): Succeed with TeamworkImua (Forward): Go forward with strength, courage, and strong spiritSouthwest unveiled Imua One at Long Beach Airport, one of eight mainland gateways where Southwest offers nonstop service to the Islands, facilitating seamless connections to airports across the western two-thirds of the U.S. mainland. Southwest Employees across the country watched through a livestream as Kahu Kordell C. L. Kekoa, a Hawaiian church Minister, led a blessing and dedication of the aircraft, witnessed by Southwest Employees and Customers, many with ties to the rich culture in Hawaii. Before its first touchdown, Imua One traveled from a painting facility in Spokane, Wash., where citizens of the Spokane Tribe of Indians joined Kahu Kekoa in a special ceremony that brought together Washington First Nations and Kanaka Maoli/indigenous Hawaiian people to share a blessing and pay tribute to the launch of Imua One.Southwest also donated $10,000 to eight organizations in the Islands to underscore a commitment to longtime community partners in Hawaii. These organizations support causes close to the Heart of Southwest and align with elements and themes featured on Imua One:AccesSurfBoys &amp; Girls Club HawaiiHoola Na PuaLiv.

The Southwest YouTube Channel now features these Employee profiles in the series.Imua One is the first Southwest aircraft with in-seat power available at every seat. It is the third Boeing 737 MAX 8 in the Southwest fleet of specialty liveries. The other 737 MAX 8 aircraft with special paint schemes include the Herbert D.

The tour allows Southwest Employees and community members to share in the special tribute. Imua One then will re-join the Southwest fleet and fly throughout the Southwest network on regularly scheduled service.Since its first service to Hawaii in 2019, Southwest is grateful to have grown to serve five airports in the Aloha State, and to link the Hawaiian Islands to the mainland with nonstop service through eight gateway airports: Long Beach, Calif.; Oakland, Calif.; Sacramento, San Jose, Calif.; Los Angeles (LAX); San Diego; Las Vegas; and Phoenix.

The company’s quarterly results are likely to exhibit year-over-year growth in revenues and funds from operations (FFO) per share.This Indianapolis, IN-based retail real estate investment trust (REIT) reported fourth-quarter 2022 comparable FFO per share of $3.15, exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a whisker. This performance was backed by a better-than-expected top line. Results reflected a healthy operating performance and growth in occupancy levels.In the last four quarters, the company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate on each occasion, the average surprise being 1.31%. This is depicted in the graph below:Simon Property Group, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseSimon Property Group, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Simon Property Group, Inc. QuoteFactors at PlayPer a report from CBRE Group CBRE, the United States retail real estate market remained resilient in first-quarter 2023, with the retail availability rate falling 50 basis points (bps) year over year to a new low of 4.8%.The core retail sales climbed 50 bps to 7.7% from the prior quarter. The non-store retail sales of 9.8%, although falling 120 bps from the previous period, remained above core retail sales for the third consecutive quarter.The EA asking rent for the first quarter was $22.97. Also, overall retail rent growth of 2% year over year remained above the 10-year average.Retail space absorption was at 8.6 million square feet for first-quarter 2023, marking the 10th consecutive quarter of positive retail absorption per the CBRE Group report.Simon Property’s portfolio of premium assets in the United States and abroad is anticipated to have benefited from the above-mentioned factors.Amid growing consumers’ preference for in-person shopping experiences following the pandemic downtime, demand for SPG’s properties is likely to have remained healthy, aiding occupancy levels and leasing activity in the quarter.  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter lease income is pegged at $1.24 billion, up from $1.21 billion reported in the year-ago quarter. The consensus mark for management fees and other revenues is $28.8 million, up 4.3% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure. In addition, the consensus estimate for quarterly revenues is presently pegged at $1.34 billion, indicating an increase of 3.1% year over year.Simon Property’s adoption of an omni-channel strategy and successful tie-ups with premium retailers are likely to have paid off well.Moreover, its efforts to explore the mixed-use development option, which has gained immense popularity in recent years, is anticipated to have enabled it to tap the growth opportunities in areas where people prefer to live, work and play.This March, Simon Property announced that it would collaborate with José Andrés Group to bring award-winning restaurants to several of the company’s premier properties. The move is likely to draw more shoppers to its shopping centers, making it a strategic fit.Further, in the same month, SPG’s majority-owned operating partnership subsidiary, Simon Property Group, L.P., closed a new $5 billion multi-currency unsecured revolving credit facility, replacing the existing $4 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility. This enhanced the company’s liquidity position and financial flexibility.We expect the company’s robust balance sheet position to have supported its strategic expansions during the quarter to be reported.However, the economic slowdown amid macroeconomic uncertainty and higher e-commerce adoption might have cast a pall on SPG’s performance in the to-be-reported quarter.Also, rising interest rates might have raised expenses in the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share has been revised marginally downward over the past month to $2.80. Nonetheless, the figure indicates a slight increase from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.

PPG recently overtook the 20-day moving average, and this suggests a short-term bullish trend.The 20-day simple moving average is a popular investing tool. Traders like this SMA because it offers a look back at a stock's price over a shorter period and helps smooth out price fluctuations. The 20-day can also show more trend reversal signals than longer-term moving averages.The 20-day moving average can show signals that are similar to other SMAs as well. If a stock's price is moving above the 20-day, the trend is considered positive. When the price falls below the moving average, it can signal a downward trend.Over the past four weeks, PPG has gained 7%. The company is currently ranked a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), another strong indication the stock could move even higher.The bullish case only gets stronger once investors take into account PPG's positive earnings estimate revisions. There have been 7 revisions higher for the current fiscal year compared to none lower, and the consensus estimate has moved up as well.Investors should think about putting PPG on their watchlist given the ultra-important technical indicator and positive move in earnings estimate revisions.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Sales decreased around 11.13% from $2,714 million reported in the prior-year quarter.The top line declined due to the challenging global economic environment owing to higher-than-normal customer inventory destocking, weak demand, particularly in consumer durables and buildings and construction end markets, and an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates.Eastman Chemical Company Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseEastman Chemical Company price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Eastman Chemical Company QuoteSegment HighlightsAdvanced Materials: Revenues from this segment increased 0.7% year over year to $742 million in the first quarter. This marginal increase is due to higher selling prices offset by lower sales volume and an unfavorable impact from foreign currency. In 2022, strong levels of inflation resulted in higher selling prices in this quarter, notably for advanced interlayers and specialty plastics. Lower speciality plastics sales volume/mix was caused by persistent weak demand and aggressive customer inventory destocking, notably in the consumer durables and consumables end markets.Additives &amp; Functional Products: Revenues from this segment were $777 million, reflecting a decline of 12.6% from the year-ago quarter. Higher selling prices partly mitigated the impact of lower sales volume in all product lines, mainly due to lower demand and consumer destocking, which led to the decline in sales for this segment.Chemical Intermediaries: Net sales from this segment were down 17.6% year over year to $589 million. Sales volume was lower in plasticizers and olefins due to continued weak end-market demand, including building and construction, consumer durables and industrial. Selling prices were lower due to reduced raw material prices.Fibers: This segment reported net sales amounting to $303 million, which reflected a rise of 42.3% year over year. The increase in revenues was mainly attributable to significantly higher selling prices for acetate tow due to an increase in industry capacity utilization and higher raw material, energy and distribution prices throughout 2022.Story continuesFinancialsEastman Chemical reported cash used in operating activities of $2 million in the reported quarter against cash provided of $17 million a year ago.

87,0bdb1f42-95ea-30e4-8ea6-9cf6a227c29e,AIG,2023-04-29,5 Stocks to Watch From the Thriving Multiline Insurance Industry,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-stocks-watch-thriving-multiline-164004251.html,1682700004,STORY,"['CNO', 'AIG', '^GSPC', 'MET', 'PRU', 'KMPR']","[Product diversification helps Zacks Multiline Insurance industry players to lower concentration risk, ensure uninterrupted revenue generation and improve retention ratio. Better pricing, prudent underwriting, increased exposure, faster economic recovery on the receding impact of the pandemic and increased vaccinations should benefit MetLife Inc. MET, American International Group Inc. AIG, Prudential Financial Inc. PRU, CNO Financial Group CNO and Kemper Corporation KMPR. Accelerated digitalization will help in the smooth functioning of the industry.The solid capital level of the multiline insurers will fuel merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) activities. With one rate hike already this year and more to come in the future, investment income should improve further as insurers are beneficiaries of a rising rate environment.About the IndustryThe Zacks Multiline Insurance industry comprises companies that provide single insurance coverage, bundling automobile, homeowner, long-term care, life and health insurance to individuals and businesses. The insured pays a single premium and is covered for many things through a single contract. These companies cover commercial and personal properties, automobiles, marine, livestock, aviation, personal accident, life, including permanent and term insurance, supplemental accident and health insurance, workers’ compensation, annuity products, private mortgage insurance, et al. The industry participants also provide risk management services. Since the companies offer single insurance coverage for multiple products, customer retention improves. The insured stands to benefit from lower premium payment compared to paying individual premiums for insuring varied products.3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Multiline Insurance IndustryDiversified portfolio lowers concentration risk:  Given the nature of the business, multiline insurers’ product and service portfolios are diversified. This lowers concentration risk. Increased awareness, driving higher demand for protection products, should benefit sales and premiums for life insurance operations. Continued improvement in pricing and an increase in exposure should support premium growth. Also, per Deloitte Insights, the transition to green energy and related insurance products, as well as exposure to intangible assets, offers growth opportunities. Per Deloitte Insights, life insurance premium is estimated to increase 1.9% in 2023 while non-life premiums are expected to increase 2.2%. The report also stated that trends like commercial lines witnessing growth at a faster pace than personal lines and homeowners’ premiums improving at a better rate than personal auto are likely to continue in 2023.Merger and acquisitions:  Consolidation in the multi-line insurance industry is expected to continue as players look to diversify their operations into new business lines and geographies. Buying businesses along the same lines is driven by the players’ need to gain a fair market share and grow in their niche areas. However, with high inflation and a rise in interest rate (the Fed has already made one rate hike this year), momentum in the M&amp;A environment is likely to slow down. The first half of 2022 witnessed 427 deals per Deloitte.  Increased adoption of technology: Digitalization has increased by leaps and bounds, especially amid pandemic-induced restrictions. The industry is witnessing greater use of technology like blockchain, AI, advanced analytics, telematics, cloud computing and robotic process automation to expedite business operations and save costs.  Many life insurers have started selling policies online that appeal to the tech-savvy population. At the same time, the use of real-time data is making premium calculation easier and reducing risk. The P&amp;C industry, in particular, also witnessed the emergence of insurtech — technology-led insurers — sparking competition for incumbent players. Insurers remain focused on ramping up data and analytics capabilities as well as realizing the benefit of the technological infrastructure per Deloitte Insights. Moreover, the adoption of technology has helped in seamless underwriting and claims processing. However, the adoption of technology comes with the risk of cyber threats.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates solid prospects in the near term. The Zacks Multiline Insurance industry, housed within the broader Zacks Finance sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #115, which places it in the top 46% of 255 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is the result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. The bright outlook reflects that the industry’s earnings estimates have been revised upward by analysts for the current year.    Before we present a few multiline insurance stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Industry Underperforms Sector and S&amp;P 500The Multiline Insurance industry has underperformed both the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite and its sector over the past six months.

88,6aa3955d-c6de-3332-967d-c93b0cb339b9,HOLX,2023-04-29,Here's Why You Should Retain Neogen (NEOG) Stock for Now,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-retain-neogen-neog-152503097.html,1682695503,STORY,"['NEOG', 'HOLX', 'AVNS']","[Neogen Corporation NEOG is well poised to gain in the coming quarters, led by strong performance across its Animal Safety and Food Safety segments. The strategic partnership deals are an added positive. However, escalating costs and stiff competition are a concern.In the past six months, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has gained 29.7% compared with a 10.5% rise of the industry and a 7% increase of the S&amp;P 500.The renowned food and animal safety products provider has a market capitalization of $3.70 billion. The company’s earnings for the fiscal third quarter surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by remarkable 200%.In the past five years, NEOG registered an earnings growth of 6.2% compared with the industry’s 9.6% rise.Let’s delve deeper.Factors At PlayAnimal Safety Business Grows Well: Animal Safety revenues in the fiscal third quarter were up 1.9% year over year, consisting of 2.2% core growth. The core growth was led by the portfolio of biosecurity products, driven by insect control share gains in the animal protein market.The company’s genomics business also performed well, with global core growth of 7.7%, led by volume increases in the global beef markets. The upside was partially offset by declines in testing in China caused by the continuation of COVID-related lab closures.Per management, the acquisitions of GVS and CAPInnoVet are part of Neogen’s strategy to expand companion animal offerings. Added to this, the company’s acquisition of Delf UK Limited is expected to bolster its performance dairy chemicals offerings. Delf’s industrial cleaning products complement Neogen’s Quat-Chem disinfectant and cleaner offerings, enhancing its biosecurity portfolio.Food Safety Sales Growth Continues: Neogen continues to see rising revenues from the Food Safety business. For third-quarter fiscal 2023, Food Safety revenues surged 141.5% year over year, consisting of 5.8% from core growth and 139.1% from acquisitions.The core growth was led by the Culture Media &amp; Other category, which benefited from a large order from a vaccine manufacturer. In the Bacterial &amp; General Sanitation product category, a solid increase in the sales of Soleris spoilage detection products contributed to growth.Story continuesStrategic Partnerships Deals: Of late, Neogen inked a series of partnership deals, which are expected to drive the company’s segmental growth and international expansion.In 2022, Neogen completed the merger with 3M to combine the latter’s Food Safety Business with its existing operations. In 2021, Neogen extended its strategic partnership with Gencove, Inc. Through this multi-year global agreement, Neogen can offer its SkimSeek low-pass sequencing technology to customers across the agricultural community.The company also collaborated with Center for Aquaculture Technologies (CAT) to provide high-quality genotyping services to aquaculture producers in 2021. With respect to the fourth leg of acquisitions and forming strategic alliances, the company is progressing well.DownsidesMounting Operating Expenses:  In the fiscal third quarter, Negen’s sales and marketing expenses rose 79.7%, whereas administrative expenses rose 85.7% from the prior year’s quarter. Research &amp; development expenses were up 59.1% year over year. Operating costs increased 80.8% from the last year’s quarter.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCompetitive Landscape Tough: Neogen faces intense competition from small businesses to divisions of large multinational companies. Some of these organizations have greater financial resources. Historically, NEOG faced intense competition from the development of new technologies by the company’s competitor, which could affect the marketability and profitability of Neogen’s products.Estimate TrendIn the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Neogen’s earnings for 2023 has remained constant at 53 cents.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 revenues is pegged at $808.3 million, suggesting a 53.3% rise from the 2022 reported number.Other Key PicksSome other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc. HOLX, Becton, Dickinson and Company BDX and Avanos Medical, Inc. AVNS.Hologic, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), has an estimated long-term growth rate of 15.2%.

Executive Chairman and Founder Ken Goldin discusses highlights from his new Netflix show 'The King of Collectibles: The Goldin Touch' and the wildest finds he's seen, ranging from Lee Harvey Oswald's glove to Mickey Mantle trading cards.Video Transcript- Wow.- Somebody in Japan, Australia, the United States, they can all be bidding against each other for a rare collectible.- This is beyond rare.- Hidden treasure exists out there that you couldn't possibly imagine.- That was a sneak peek at the ""King of Collectibles, Goldin Touch,"" which makes its debut today on Netflix. It follows Goldin Company founder and executive chairman Ken Goldin and his team as they find rare collectibles to sell at auction. And the business of collectibles is growing in value, now upwards of $10 billion.Ken Goldin joins us now. Along with Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer. So Ken, let's get into this show. Tell us a little bit about what we can see.KEN GOLDIN: Sure. You're going to see collectibles of every type. That's the most important thing. You're going to see sports. You're going to see non-sports. You're going to see Pokemon, comic books, rock and roll, entertainment, rare historical artifacts.I mean, like literally, you will-- in the first two minutes of the show, I have a $15 million item in my hand. And the show will be something. It's fast-paced. It's funny. But it's everything. There are young kids who find something or open up a pack of cards for $5. Now, I'm going to make them a millionaire?Then you've got things that are so crazy, like the handcuffs that actually were used to arrest Lee Harvey Oswald after he shot President Kennedy, to my favorite scene and item in the show, which is the Dream Team Collection, which I have one of those samples with me right here that I can show you at some point.But the show has gotten tremendous response. There are celebrities, from Drake to Logan Paul to Joe Montana, Peyton Manning, Mike Tyson. Gosh, did I say somebody besides Mike Tyson was my favorite scene? Now I've got to figure it out.Story continuesAnd then you've got people who have found stuff in their parents' attics, basements. I think for the collectibles world, it's going to bring a renaissance of all types of collectibles. And I also think there's going to be a lot of grandparents who may not have seen their grandkids in a little bit. And those grandkids are going to want to get to your house to see what you might have hidden away from the years.JOSH SCHAFER: Yeah, Ken, you sort of getting at what I was curious here, is are we going to see that Netflix effect for the collectibles industry? We've talked a lot about that with, say, F1, and what ""Drive to Survive"" did for that. Or you could even say what ""Pawn Stars"" and ""Storage Wars"" did for an industry moderately comparable to collectibles. Do you think you're going to see that for the collectibles industry, and this is going to stir up a lot more interest?KEN GOLDIN: I think it will. And I think that a lot of people are going to find things that they did know not had value. For example, one of the biggest crazes in my lifetime was Beanie Babies. I mean, the guy, what'd he sell, billions of Beanie Babies? Literally in episode one, we have somebody with a large Beanie Baby collection from 25 years ago, and we find an expert to figure out, are they worth anything?We've got comic books. We've got everything, sports cards. We have rare items from the world of historical. We even have a Declaration of Independence. I think-- look, to me, collectibles has been my whole life. It's been the only way I've ever made a living.I think that if people discover both the joy of collecting, what's out there, as well as the fact, hey, some of this stuff is worth a boatload of money, and some of these things that you may not have thought were worth money could be worth thousands, if not millions.- Oh, Ken, I love this. There are so many things I want to get into. We're going to probably have to take some of this offline. Love the Beanie Babies angle. I remember the Beanie Baby divorce, that iconic picture.But the thing that I want to just touch base with you before we lose you, the trading card market. You say that's actually outperformed the S&amp;P 500 over the last 10 years.My seven-year-old would actually love to hear this because he's been in a basketball camp where they get cards. And he's tried to trade some of them for money. So what kind of money can he get? Where can he find a market for these trading cards that he's looking for?KEN GOLDIN: Sure. I mean, trading cards have really become an alternative asset. It's a multibillion dollar business. I mean, you look at fanatics buying up all the licenses and buying Topps. I think their trading card division has a $10-billion-plus valuation.Companies like Goldin make a marketplace. We have 24/7 available fixed-price marketplace. We have daily and weekly and monthly auctions that run all the time. A company like PSA, PSA Card, they authenticate the items. They tell you it's authentic. They give you a grade. And that has really helped monetize it because you're not taking somebody's word if something's real anymore.For example, this 1952 Topps Mickey Mantle, raw, without being sealed in a case, could be $50,000, $100,000. In this particular grade, we're looking about $1.5 million for this card.So that's what they have done to the marketplace, and it's really made it easy, not only for collectors, but to commoditize it and to know exactly what you have. There are literally hundreds of resources.If you go online and use an app called Card Ladder, you can type in a card. They'll give you every single sale that ever took place. They'll give you what they think it's worth if you sold it today. And they'll give you pictures of every single different one of that particular card in different grades in their database.- All right, Ken Goldin. Lots to get into, and we have our Netflix plans for the weekend.]"

He is adopting a similar strategy to promote his consumer goods to rival Coca-Cola and Nestle.Viacom18, the broadcast division of Ambani's Reliance Industries, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Its shareholders also include Paramount Global as well as Bodhi Tree, a joint venture between James Murdoch and former top Disney executive, Uday Shankar.The Warner deal, industry executives and media analysts said, will boost Viacom18's already announced plans to ""innovate and disrupt"" the sector, and help to attract the premium English speaking audience in India.At stake is a slice of a video streaming market that is expected to grow annually by 22%-25% to reach $13-$15 billion by 2030, according to a 2021 report by Indian lobby group CII and the Boston Consulting Group.Story continuesThat compares with projected annual growth of 8.63% in the U.S. market, which is expected to hit $54.66 billion by 2027, according to Statista.While Netflix and other rivals boast of content specially created for the India audience, JioCinema's current free offerings largely include old Hindi and local language movies. In sports, it has IPL cricket streaming rights until 2027 and in March bagged exclusive rights for MotoGP in India.The big challenge is lack of fresh local and global content on JioCinema, something that will be become even more critical as the IPL season ends next month.JioCinema is in talks with various production studios and has plans to introduce dozens of TV shows and movies on the platform in the coming months, in Hindi and other languages, a second industry source told Reuters on Friday.""There are many Indias within India. While IPL is for the masses, partnership with Warner is a precursor to JioCinema's entry into the premium subscription segment,"" said Mihir Shah, vice president at Media Partners Asia.Nitesh Kripalani, former country head of Amazon's Prime Video in India, said he expects Reliance's venture to do more such deals, but pricing remains key.""India is a value conscious market. For any media business, anywhere in the world - you need to get consumers to pay. Advertising can only pay so much,"" he said.Netflix, Amazon and Disney Hotstar have become popular in India by launching exclusive movies and web series starring Bollywood actors. They have also diversified into regional local language content.At present Netflix - which has most the expensive subscription plans - has just 8 million subscribers, Amazon has 17 million, while Disney, which earlier had the digital rights for IPL, leads with 49 million, according to Media Partners, which doesn't have data for JioCinema's free service.Karan Taurani, a vice president of India's Elara Capital, sad JioCinema's success will hinge on quality of its content.""They may make so many films and series but (what if) more than 70-80% of them bomb? The only way to scale up is to really differentiate your content and make sure execution is right,"" he said. (Editing by Sharon Singleton)]"

The consensus estimate suggests a year-over-year rise of 172%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter’s revenues of $29.8 billion indicates a 19% decline from the year-ago reported figure.Factors to NoteIn the March-end quarter of 2023, the demand for refined petroleum products improved significantly due to continued growth in fuel consumption. Being one of the world’s largest refiners, Phillips 66 is likely to have benefitted from higher demand for its refined petroleum products in the to-be-reported quarter.The company is expected to have reaped the rewards of a better macro environment in its downstream business. As such, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for realized refining margin on a worldwide basis is pegged at $20.14 per barrel, indicating an increase from the year-ago reported level of $10.55 per barrel. This is likely to have positioned Phillips 66 for huge profits in the to-be-reported quarter.Although crude prices were high in the first quarter, the same retreated from their peaks in the year-ago quarter. Hence, sustained lower crude prices are likely to have had a relatively negative effect on Phillips 66’s refining margins. This is expected to have affected PSX’s performance in the to-be-reported quarter.Story continuesEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Phillips 66 this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat.

Earnings declined 6% year over year due to lower revenues and higher costs.Total revenues of $6.11 billion missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.15 billion as well as our estimate of $6.32 billion. Total revenues declined 2% year over year as higher product sales were offset by lower Other revenues.Total product revenues increased 2% from the year-ago quarter to $5.85 billion (U.S.: $3.98 billion; ex-U.S.: $1.87 billion). Higher volumes were offset by lower selling prices of several drugs and currency headwinds. Volumes rose 14% in the quarter, offset by a 5% lower net selling price. Foreign exchange movement hurt sales by 2% in the quarter.Other revenues were $259 million in the quarter, down 50% year over year due to lower revenues from its COVID-19 manufacturing collaboration with Eli Lilly.Performance of Key DrugsGeneral MedicineProlia revenues came in at $927 million, up 9% from the year-ago quarter, driven by volume growth. Prolia sales beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $911 million.Evenity recorded sales of $254 million in the quarter, up 49% year over year, driven by strong volume growth both in and outside the United States.Repatha generated revenues of $388 million, up 18% year over year, as higher volume was partially offset by lower prices. Repatha sales beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $342 million as well as our model estimate as $330.5 million.Aimovig recorded sales of $69 million in the quarter, down 32% year over year due to lower net selling price and unfavorable changes to estimated sales deductions.Hematology-OncologyXgeva delivered revenues of $536 million, up 7% from the year-ago quarter, driven by volume growth and higher pricing. Xgeva sales beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $497 million.Kyprolis recorded sales of $358 million, up 25% year over year, driven by volume growth and higher price.Story continuesVectibix revenues came in at $233 million, up 16% year over year, driven by volume growth. Nplate sales rose 36% to $362 million, driven by volume growth led by an order from the U.S. government. Blincyto sales increased 41% from the year-ago period to $194 million.Amgen’s newly approved drug, Lumakras/ Lumykras recorded sales of $74 million in the quarter compared with $71 million in the previous quarter. Lumakras/ Lumykras volumes rose 40% in the quarter. Lumakras/Lumykras sales missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $91.0 million.Sales of Amgen’s oncology biosimilars declined 27% year over year in the first quarter.In oncology biosimilars, sales of Kanjinti (Amgen’s biosimilar of Roche’s Herceptin) were $47 million, down 51% year over year due to lower pricing and volumes as a result of increased competition.Sales of Mvasi (biosimilar of Roche’s Avastin) were $202 million in the quarter, down 17% year over year due to declines in net selling price.InflammationSales of Otezla were $392 million in the quarter, down 13%, due to lower inventory levels and price declines resulting from unfavorable patient and payer mix. Otezla volumes rose 5% in the quarter. Otezla sales in the United States were hurt by free drug programs launched by new competitors, with the impact expected to continue throughout 2023. Otezla sales significantly missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $503.0 million.Enbrel revenues of $579 million declined 33% year over year due to lower prices, softer volumes, lower inventory levels and unfavorable impact of changes to estimated sales deductions. Enbrel sales significantly missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $874 million.Generally, sales of Otezla and Enbrel are lower in the first quarter per historical trends due to the impact of benefit plan changes, insurance re-verification and increased co-pay expenses as U.S. patients work through deductibles.Newly approved asthma drug, Tezspire (tezepelumab) recorded sales of $96 million in the quarter compared with $79 million in the previous quarter, driven by volume growth. Amgen has a partnership with AstraZeneca AZN for Tezspire. Amgen and AstraZeneca share costs and profits equally after payment by AstraZeneca of a mid-single-digit inventor royalty to Amgen. While AstraZeneca leads development, Amgen leads manufacturing. In the first quarter, the FDA approved a pre-filled, single-use pen formulation of Amgen/AstraZeneca’s Tezspire, which improves patient convenience and accessibility and also provides more flexibility in treatment options.Amjevita/Amgevita (a biosimilar of AbbVie’s [ABBV] Humira) sales were $164 million in the quarter, up 52% year over year, driven by volume growth and higher inventory levels.In February, Amgen launched Amjevita in the United States at a list price 55% below the current list price set by AbbVie for Humira. Amgen is the first company to have launched a biosimilar of AbbVie’s Humira in the United States. The majority of Amgen’s U.S. Amgevita sales in the first quarter stemmed from inventory build, which means that second-quarter sales will be lower than the first quarter. Also, several more biosimilar versions of Humira are expected to be launched this year as early as July, which can hurt Amjevita sales, going forward.The 2022 acquisition of ChemoCentryx added a newly launched innovative product, Tavneos to Amgen’s portfolio. Tavneos is approved for the treatment of patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis, a serious systemic autoimmune disease. Tavneos generated $23 million in sales in the first quarter compared with $21 million in the previous quarter. The drug’s sequential growth was driven by higher net selling price and inventory levels, partially offset by lower volumes in outside U.S. markets.Established ProductsTotal sales of established products, which include Epogen, Aranesp, Parsabiv and Neulasta decreased 17% year over year in the first quarter.Operating Margins DeclineAdjusted operating margin declined 6.5 percentage points to 48.3% in the quarter. Adjusted operating expenses increased 6% $3.28 billion due to higher R&amp;D costs.R&amp;D expenses rose 12% year over year to $1.04 billion due to higher investments behind late-stage pipeline candidates. SG&amp;A spending increased 1% to $1.22 billion.2023 Guidance RaisedAmgen raised its previously issued revenue and earnings guidance for 2023 that excluded any contribution from the pending acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics HZNP.In December, Amgen announced a definitive agreement to acquire Horizon Therapeutics for $116.5 per share in cash or $27.8 billion. The acquisition will add several first-in-class early-in-lifecycle biologic drugs like Tepezza, Krystexxa and Uplizna to Amgen’s broad and diversified portfolio. The acquisition is expected to close by the end of June. AMGN will provide updated guidance for 2023 after the transaction closes.Revenues are expected in the range of $26.2 billion to $27.3 billion, up from the previous expectation of 26.0 billion to $27.2 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $27.87 billion.Adjusted earnings are expected in the range of $17.60 to $18.70, up from the prior expectation of $17.40 to $18.60 per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at $17.76 per share.Adjusted R&amp;D costs are expected to increase 3% to 4% year over year from the 2022 level. S&amp;A spending is expected to decrease slightly year over year, driven by productivity improvements. Total operating expenses are expected to increase 1% versus prior expectations of remaining flat versus the 2022 level. Amgen expects the operating margin as a percentage of product sales to be roughly 50% in 2023.The adjusted tax rate is expected to be in the range of 18.0%-19.0%, while capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $925 million. The company expects to buy back shares worth not more than $500 million in 2023.Our TakeAmgen’s first-quarter results were mixed as it beat estimates for earnings but missed the same for sales. It raised its earnings and sales guidance for the year as prescription trends and demand for its medicines are expected to improve to pre-pandemic levels despite the current macroeconomic challenges. The stock was down slightly in after-hours trading.Amgen’s stock has risen 3.1% in the past year against a decline of 6.8% for the industry. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAmgen’s 10 brands delivered a record sales performance in the quarter, including Repatha, Blincyto, Kyprolis and Evenity. Two of its newest medicines, Tezspire and Tavneos, achieved sequential growth in the first quarter. However, pricing pressure and increased competition continued to hurt sales of some drugs as well as biosimilar products. Sales of Otezla and Enbrel as well as new drug Lumakras/ Lumykras significantly missed expectations.In 2023, Amgen expects strong sales growth of products like Tezspire, Evenity, Repatha, Prolia and Tavneos to be offset by lower revenues from Nplate, oncology biosimilars and legacy established products such as Enbrel and lower COVID-19 antibody revenues. It expects a mid-single-digit price decline in 2023. Amgen also has some key pipeline assets in obesity and inflammation — indications that can have a large market opportunity.Amgen Inc.

This compares to earnings of $0.67 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 1.27%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this electric utility would post earnings of $0.59 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.70, delivering a surprise of 18.64%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.Portland General Electric , which belongs to the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry, posted revenues of $748 million for the quarter ended March 2023, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 11.06%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $626 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Portland General Electric shares have added about 2.9% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 5.6%.What's Next for Portland General Electric?While Portland General Electric has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Portland General Electric: favorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.62 on $633.7 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $2.70 on $2.83 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Utility - Electric Power is currently in the top 45% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Another stock from the same industry, PSEG (PEG), has yet to report results for the quarter ended March 2023.

Crocs (CROX) is a stock that can certainly grab the attention of many investors, but do its recent returns compare favorably to the sector as a whole? A quick glance at the company's year-to-date performance in comparison to the rest of the Consumer Discretionary sector should help us answer this question.Crocs is a member of our Consumer Discretionary group, which includes 274 different companies and currently sits at #13 in the Zacks Sector Rank. The Zacks Sector Rank includes 16 different groups and is listed in order from best to worst in terms of the average Zacks Rank of the individual companies within each of these sectors.The Zacks Rank is a successful stock-picking model that emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions. The system highlights a number of different stocks that could be poised to outperform the broader market over the next one to three months. Crocs is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).Within the past quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for CROX's full-year earnings has moved 5.1% higher. This shows that analyst sentiment has improved and the company's earnings outlook is stronger.Based on the latest available data, CROX has gained about 14.7% so far this year. Meanwhile, the Consumer Discretionary sector has returned an average of 9.8% on a year-to-date basis. As we can see, Crocs is performing better than its sector in the calendar year.Another stock in the Consumer Discretionary sector, Wynn Resorts (WYNN), has outperformed the sector so far this year. The stock's year-to-date return is 33.7%.In Wynn Resorts' case, the consensus EPS estimate for the current year increased 231.7% over the past three months. The stock currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Looking more specifically, Crocs belongs to the Textile - Apparel industry, which includes 18 individual stocks and currently sits at #161 in the Zacks Industry Rank. On average, stocks in this group have gained 6.8% this year, meaning that CROX is performing better in terms of year-to-date returns.Story continuesIn contrast, Wynn Resorts falls under the Gaming industry. Currently, this industry has 38 stocks and is ranked #101. Since the beginning of the year, the industry has moved +26.1%.Investors interested in the Consumer Discretionary sector may want to keep a close eye on Crocs and Wynn Resorts as they attempt to continue their solid performance.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Investors can't control the latter, but they can focus on a company's earnings results every quarter.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. Deckers (DECK) holds a Zacks Rank #2 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $2.80 a share 20 days away from its upcoming earnings release on May 18, 2023.Deckers' Earnings ESP sits at 6.14%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $2.80 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.63.DECK is part of a big group of Consumer Discretionary stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Wynn Resorts (WYNN) as well.Wynn Resorts is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on May 9, 2023. WYNN's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $0.02 a share 11 days from its next earnings release.For Wynn Resorts, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of -$0.18 is 111.38%.Story continuesBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, DECK and WYNN could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

102,bc123d15-7b31-3ee7-b79e-f2ee472f6cc1,ZTS,2023-04-29,Analysts Estimate Amneal Pharmaceuticals (AMRX) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-estimate-amneal-pharmaceuticals-amrx-140002443.html,1682690402,STORY,"['AMRX', 'ZTS']","[The market expects Amneal Pharmaceuticals (AMRX) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on May 5. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis pharmaceutical company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.10 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -16.7%.Revenues are expected to be $554.8 million, up 11.5% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Amneal?For Amneal, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +5.26%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Amneal will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Amneal would post earnings of $0.21 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.23, delivering a surprise of +9.52%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Amneal doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerZoetis (ZTS), another stock in the Zacks Medical - Drugs industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $1.27 for the quarter ended March 2023. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of -3.8%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $2.01 billion, up 1.4% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Zoetis has been revised 0.4% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.82%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Zoetis will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Whether it's climbing mountains or cultivating an oasis in our backyards, a sense of well-being comes from stepping outside and enjoying a beautiful day.We are excited to share the inspiring ways some of our people ""invest in the planet.""Marty Sidor, Director, Regulatory ComplianceA member of our regulatory compliance team, Marty and his wife have been avid gardeners for 40 years. Beginning as a way to economically feed the family, the Sidors' Garden has continued to evolve and expand over the years - now encompassing three large, raised beds of organic vegetables - and has inspired a family tradition with each of Marty's children and grandchildren dedicated to growing and caring for their own family gardens.What inspired you to start gardening?I was inspired by my grandma who relied on her garden to survive back in Europe and brought her passion with her when she moved to the United States. As the oldest grandson, I was always the person to dig and plant her garden in the Chicago area. I learned from her early about the need to care for the limited land we have, and it is a value my wife and I wanted to pass on to our kids.Why do you feel growing your food is so important?With the produce we grow, we maintain a healthy and varied diet on a budget. We grow about 12-15 different veggies each year and store what we can by canning or freezing. It's satisfying to eat home-grown roasted green chiles or frozen okra in mid-winter meals. Late last summer, my wife made and froze 50 stuffed Italian peppers that make a quick dinner on busy days.Beyond that, we have also had the opportunity to share the fruits of our labor - with our neighbors and co-workers - as well as donate to the local food bank, which accepts garden-grown food in the summer. For us, gardening is more than a personal passion project; it's been a way to connect with those in our neighborhood and community, and we hope we have inspired others to give growing their own food a try.Story continuesWhat does ""invest in the planet"" mean to you?My grandma made sure I understood that we are short-term stewards of the land we work on and need to tend it so those who follow can find success on the same plot of land. We try to minimize our footprint on the planet by composting our kitchen scraps with leaves and yard waste to build up the soil for next year, allowing us to control what goes into the garden beds.We also take advantage of what some may call ""debris"" for positive use. We grow shiitake mushrooms by inoculating fresh-cut oak limbs that were trimmed in our neighborhood. Using this debris to grow food instead of grinding it into mulch or burning it as firewood is a better path to long-term sustainability. These efforts are how we invest in our personal health and the long-term health of the planet.Robbie Kerbak, Product Manager, Goal ZeroCarrying everything he needed on his back, Robbie has traveled around much of the United States - and a fair part of the world - to combine his passions for hiking and making a difference. Whether it's challenging himself to hike the Appalachian and Pacific Crest Trails or joining humanitarian trips to Bolivia and Nepal, Robbie has passion and appreciation for immersing himself in nature.What was your experience hiking the Appalachian and Pacific Crest trails like?For some background, the Appalachian Trail and the Pacific Crest Trail are long-distance hiking trails. The Appalachian Trail is on the East Coast of the United States and is close to 2,190 miles, running from northern Georgia into Maine. The Pacific Crest Trail is located on the West Coast of the United States and goes from the Mexican border in Southern California to the Canadian border in northern Washington and spans 2,650 miles.In the past 10 years, I have hiked both trails. To cover that distance took 4-5 months, hiking 20-30 miles a day every day. We carried everything on our backs including stove, clothes, and food, and just camped outside on the trail along the way as we walked through some of the most remote wilderness in the United States.It was a memorable experience and a time I remember with fondness.I know you have also been involved with several of Goal Zero's humanitarian trips. How was that experience?I have had the opportunity to take part in two of Goal Zero's humanitarian trips. First, in 2016, I was able to join a trip to Nepal, specifically to a remote region near Mount Everest. During the trip to Nepal, our group hiked from the lower foothill region up toward a Mount Everest base camp. Along the way, we installed solar panels, batteries, and lights for some clinics, a dentist, an office, and schools. In some areas, we installed some water filtration systems to help combat water pollution issues.Then just last year, I was able to go on another trip to Bolivia. Hiking to a remote area in the jungle, the communities we went to help had been unknown until about 15 to 20 years ago. Given their need to quickly adapt to a very different world, they were looking for resources that could help them learn and assimilate. To meet their needs, we provided computer labs and installed lights, solar panels, and batteries so that they could run a variety of equipment. These tools would allow the community to reach out to the wider world, tell their story, and regain some ownership and power over the jungle they live in.What are some of your most memorable moments from these experiences?One thing I took away from these hikes is how therapeutic the experience was. During a major hike, when all you are focusing on is the next step, it's crazy how fast all of the stresses of life melt away. For me, adding nature into the experience - whether it's hiking, fishing, or some other activity - seems to trigger a meditative state and truly helps me reset.From my humanitarian trips, the most memorable moments were when I was engaging with 13 to 16-year-old kids in Bolivia, who had never experienced a touch screen, a smartphone, or a laptop. Providing and setting up laptops in the village, we got to watch, in real-time, as these kids experienced modern technology for the first time and connected the dots about everything they now had access to. Learning about each kid's interests, we helped personalize these laptops to be the best tools for them, and getting to watch them learn and explore was such a powerful moment.What inspired your love for the outdoors?I've always enjoyed backpacking and hiking. I grew up in rural Wyoming spending tons of time outside in nature and exploring the remote areas around where I lived. My passion for the outdoors progressed as I grew up, and I started taking backpacking trips for a few nights then week-long trips until I was inspired by conversations with friends to challenge myself and tackle these long trails.These trips have become a passion and a bit of an obsession, and I can't help but continue to try new trails both in the U.S. and abroad.What does ""invest in the planet"" mean to you?The word investment speaks volumes. Investing in our planet, to me, means that whatever you take out also needs to be put back in. It is important to be conscious of the impact that we all have every day on the planet and those around us. Take the time to think about what you can do to reduce your footprint or help others around you. Invest by making a social or environmental impact.Pat Hammond, Senior Director, CommunicationsFrom bustling marine life to a perfect place for swimming and boating, Pat has always seen Galveston Bay as another home. Enjoyed by generations of her family, when given the opportunity to join the Galveston Bay Foundation as a Board member, she was ready to help conserve the place that was dear to her heart and the community.What inspired you to get involved with the Galveston Bay Foundation?My family has a home that's been in our family now for four generations - my grandparents, my parents, me, and now my children - on East Galveston Bay that holds a lot of memories for all of us.I learned to swim in Galveston Bay. I've been fishing on it since I was old enough to hold a cane pole. I have incredibly fond memories of being on my father's boat while he used a shrimp net to trawl for live bait. When he brought in the net, I watched as marine life spilled into a bucket at the back of the boat.Being at the Bay is kind of a family tradition. It's a really strong connection for me and taking part in conserving it seems only right. So, I was honored to join the foundation as a Board member.What is the Galveston Bay Foundation's mission? What is your role in the organization?The Galveston Bay Foundation is a conservation organization that is working hard to preserve and conserve the Bay for generations to come. Focused on education, water protection, and land conservation, among other things the nonprofit works to ensure that the Bay stays brimming with vitality and contributes to the community in every possible way. They plant marsh grass to try to preserve the coastline and Bay from erosion; their land conservation program helps folks get conservation easements; they work with school children to educate them about local marine life; and they do so much more.What does ""invest in the planet"" mean to you?I mean, the planet is a really big thing. I'm not sure that I can wrap my arms around the planet. What I can wrap my arms around is what's happening in my yard, in my space, in my city, in my sphere. For me, investing in the planet means putting time, effort, donations, or however, you choose to contribute, towards your home and Galveston Bay feels like home to me.Getting InvolvedFor those looking to get involved in their communities - or just in their backyards - we asked our avid nature lovers to give some advice on how to get started.For those interested in gardening or farming, Marty suggests:We started very small by growing veggies and herbs we liked in coffee cans (remember those?) on the balcony of our first apartment. Grow what you like to eat! Read up on organic gardening; take and save notes about what works, what didn't, and why; and most importantly, learn from your failures. When you get to taste the product you grew in your garden, you will be ready for the next year and the next adventure.For those with a passion or a budding interest in hiking, Robbie recommends:It doesn't have to be on a massive scale - a huge hike or huge humanitarian project - that takes you across the world. Start small and find something local that inspires you to get involved or get started. In terms of hiking, what has led me to these bigger more extensive trips was finding an activity that I loved, fostering that interest, and before I knew it, I wanted to go and hike thousands of miles. The best place to start is your backyard.And, lastly for those looking to get involved locally, Pat says:There are so many ways to get involved in your neighborhood. You can join your Neighborhood Association, get involved with your church group, or look to your workplace to see if they are promoting or advertising volunteer opportunities. Don't feel pressured to stick to a schedule or a particular cause, make sure what you do fits into your life and is something you enjoy being a part of. There is no right way to get involved or stay involved. Just take a step and see where it leads. You might be surprised about what comes from it.We hope these stories have inspired you to bring nature into your everyday life.

That is not among Tyson's biggest plants, but represents about 2% of daily U.S. hog slaughtering.Some pigs that would normally be slaughtered in Madison are instead being processed at a Tyson plant in Storm Lake, Iowa, farmers said. As a result, Tyson is also shifting some pigs to a plant in Waterloo, Iowa, that were initially destined for slaughter in Storm Lake, they said.The shuffle has slightly delayed when some farmers deliver pigs to processing plants, growers said.""Since the event and until the facility is back online, hogs have been diverted to other Tyson Foods pork facilities to mitigate disruption to our livestock producers and customers,"" Tyson spokesperson Liz Croston said.

And how do you exchange enough information about the other party?""Cross-border transactions have been a focus of blockchain tracker CipherTrace, the creator of a cryptocurrency system that helps companies comply with the travel rule. Under that rule, whenever crypto worth over $1,000 is transacted between two parties, the crypto service provider of the sender is expected to communicate the personally identifiable information of the sender to the crypto service provider of the recipient, and vice versa.To roll out the service, Dhamodharan said, Mastercard worked with wallet providers Bit2Me, Lirium, Mercado Bitcoin and Uphold. The firms are working on an initial project to enable transfers between U.S. and Latin America and the Caribbean corridors.More use cases for the service, such as non-fungible token (NFT) transactions, will follow, Dhamodharan added.

The Binance cards allow users to make payments in traditional currencies, funded by their cryptocurrency holdings on the exchange.""We have dozens of partners around the world who offer crypto card programmes and they continue to expand,"" Raj Dhamodharan, Mastercard's head of crypto and blockchain, told Reuters on Thursday.""Providing access to crypto in a safe way is also part of our value proposition and we're continuing to do that.""Banks have become wary of crypto clients after a number of big crypto firms collapsed last year, including the bankruptcy of major exchange FTX. Meanwhile, U.S. regulators are increasingly cracking down on what they say is a lack of compliance in the market.In March, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission sued Binance, accusing the world's largest crypto exchange of operating what the regulator called an ""illegal"" exchange and a ""sham"" compliance program.Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao said the complaint contained an ""incomplete recitation of facts"".Dhamodharan declined to comment on Binance specifically, but said any card programme ""goes through full due diligence"" and is continuously monitored.Some banks, including Santander and NatWest, limit the amount of money UK customers can transfer to cryptocurrency exchanges to protect consumers from scams and fraud.In November, rival Visa severed its global credit card agreements with FTX. American Express - which had said in 2021 it would consider using crypto as a possible option to redeem reward points - said in February that it did not see crypto replacing its main payment and lending services in the near term.Story continuesAsked if Mastercard is considering imposing restrictions on the amount of money that could be transferred to crypto exchanges using its payments network, Dhamodharan said, ""We're not here to pick winners. We're not here to pick which transaction should happen or shouldn't happen.""He added users of Mastercard's network go through a number of compliance checks, adding that the company has invested in crypto analytics technology.Mastercard is ""really quite enthusiastic"" about the underlying blockchain technology that powers cryptocurrencies, Dhamodharan said.""We think more and more regulated money will come to this,"" he said.(Reporting by Elizabeth Howcroft, Editing by Louise Heavens)]"

Elsewhere, the Dow gained 0.8%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 4.46%.Heading into today, shares of the online travel company had lost 3.87% over the past month, lagging the Retail-Wholesale sector's gain of 5.66% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 4.04% in that time.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Expedia as it approaches its next earnings report date. This is expected to be May 4, 2023. On that day, Expedia is projected to report earnings of -$0.04 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 91.67%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $2.68 billion, up 19.28% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $9.26 per share and revenue of $12.78 billion. These totals would mark changes of +36.38% and +9.55%, respectively, from last year.Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Expedia. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate remained stagnant within the past month. Expedia is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Investors should also note Expedia's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 9.98. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 21.59, so we one might conclude that Expedia is trading at a discount comparatively.Story continuesAlso, we should mention that EXPE has a PEG ratio of 0.71. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account.

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Best Small Cap Defense Stocks to Buy Now.Defense Stocks Are ""Creating Some Value Opportunities""On March 31 John Eade, president &amp; director of portfolio strategies at Argus Research, appeared in an interview on TD Ameritrade Network where he discussed the defense sector and the opportunities it is presenting. John Eade noted that though the defense sector has exhibited strong performance over the past couple of years, it has been underperforming in 2023 particularly due to concerns related to government spending and the impending debt ceiling issue. According to John Eade, defense contractors derive a significant portion of their revenue — roughly 50% to 80% — from contracts with the U.S. government. The uncertainty surrounding government spending and the risk associated with the debt ceiling have impacted defense stocks negatively and so they ""have pulled back, creating some value opportunities"". Here are some comments from John Eade:""You really did see them (defense stocks) take off about a year ago from now, when the Russian army invaded Ukraine. And at that point, we also started to see government spending on defense turn positive after several quarters of cutbacks. So I think the backdrop is there. These companies all generate a lot of cash flow, they pay decent dividends, they grow their dividends. And like I said earlier, when they pulled back from their 52-week highs, as they have here, that can be a good long-term buying opportunity.""John Eade likes companies that have exposure to both defense and commercial aerospace. Eade thinks these companies have ""extra fuel for growth"", since the commercial aerospace sector has still not recovered to pre-pandemic levels.John Eade talked about Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE:RTX) and said that ""it is one of the better growth stories"" in the space since it has exposure to both commercial aircraft and defense sectors. Argus has a Buy rating and a $115 price target on Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE:RTX). As of April 27, Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE:RTX) has gained 4.53% over the past 6 months and is offering a forward dividend yield of 2.37%.Story continuesJohn Eade also weighed in on Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT). He noted that Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) is offering one of the highest dividend yields among its peers and that the company has been ""growing its dividend at a high single digit rate"". John Eade expects Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) to grow its earnings over the next couple of years. Argus has a Buy rating and $500 price target on Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) and, as of April 27, the stock is offering a forward dividend yield of 2.58%.Finally, John Eade shared his thoughts on The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA). He noted that though The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) is struggling with profitability in its commercial aerospace business, the company's defense and airlines services business segments are doing well. Eade expects The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) to suffer losses in the first half of 2023, and then turn profitable in the second half of 2023. As of April 27, The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) has gained 43.24% over the past 6 months.While larger industry players like Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE:RTX), Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), and The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) garner attention, investors should also explore the potential of small-cap defense stocks. These often overlooked gems may present unique opportunities for investors seeking specialized exposure to the defense sector and also allow them to diversify within the sector. Some of the best small-cap defense stocks to buy now according to hedge funds include Astronics Corporation (NASDAQ:ATRO), AAR Corp. (NYSE:AIR), and Triumph Group, Inc. (NYSE:TGI). Let's now discuss these stocks, among others, in detail below.10 Best Small Cap Defense Stocks to Buy NowPhoto by Ruben Sukatendel on UnsplashOur MethodologyTo determine the best small-cap defense stocks to buy now, according to hedge funds, we used Yahoo Finance's stock screener to first identify small-cap companies operating in the defense industry.

120,2481cd42-4601-3fe7-8954-e05a8841e866,PHM,2023-04-29,PulteGroup (PHM) is a Great Momentum Stock: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pultegroup-phm-great-momentum-stock-160004526.html,1682697604,STORY,['PHM'],"[Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock's recent trend in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will be essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" With this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving that way. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, this can be very tough to define. There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance. The Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.Below, we take a look at PulteGroup (PHM), a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of A. We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions, two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score.It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. PulteGroup currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;Set to Beat the Market?In order to see if PHM is a promising momentum pick, let's examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this homebuilder holds up.Looking at a stock's short-term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum, since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area.Story continuesFor PHM, shares are up 4.47% over the past week while the Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry is up 3.54% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 16.71% compares favorably with the industry's 7.09% performance as well.While any stock can see a spike in price, it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market. Over the past quarter, shares of PulteGroup have risen 9.96%, and are up 52.28% in the last year. In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 has only moved 2.02% and 0.39%, respectively.Investors should also take note of PHM's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. Right now, PHM is averaging 2,852,463 shares for the last 20 days.Earnings OutlookThe Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things, including estimate revisions and a stock's price movement. Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank, and a nice path here can be promising. We have recently been noticing this with PHM.Over the past two months, 3 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost PHM's consensus estimate, increasing from $7.44 to $8.06 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 2 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.Bottom LineGiven these factors, it shouldn't be surprising that PHM is a #1 (Strong Buy) stock and boasts a Momentum Score of A. If you're looking for a fresh pick that's set to soar in the near-term, make sure to keep PulteGroup on your short list.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

However, the industry continues to be plagued by building material issues, including a lack of access to electrical transformer equipment, according to NAHB Chairman Alicia Huey.Investors are seeing opportunities in the housing market, with Wall Street betting big on homebuilders as the spring homebuying season approaches.Major players in the industry like KB Home (NYSE: KBH), PulteGroup, Inc (NYSE: PHM), and Tri Pointe Homes Inc (NYSE: TPH) have seen their stock prices soar by over 20% this year as buyers turn to new-home markets to avoid the limited inventory and sticky pricing of existing homes.With mortgage rates moderating, analysts predict that builders will continue capitalizing on the low supply of existing homes to drive demand for their properties.So is it the right time to invest in those stocks?

While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about PulteGroup (PHM) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.PulteGroup currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.77, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 13 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.77 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 13 recommendations that derive the current ABR, eight are Strong Buy, representing 61.5% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for PHMBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for PHMCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for PulteGroup here&gt;&gt;&gt;The ABR suggests buying PulteGroup, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABRIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Is PHM a Good Investment?Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for PulteGroup, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 8.3% over the past month to $8.06.Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for PulteGroup.

In other words, they avoid betting on cheap stocks and waiting long for them to recover. Instead, they believe that ""buying high and selling higher"" is the way to make far more money in lesser time.Who doesn't like betting on fast-moving trending stocks? But determining the right entry point isn't easy. Often, these stocks lose momentum once their valuation moves ahead of their future growth potential. In such a situation, investors find themselves loaded up on expensive shares with limited to no upside or even a downside. So, going all-in on momentum could be risky at times.A safer approach could be investing in bargain stocks with recent price momentum. While the Zacks Momentum Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system) helps identify great momentum stocks by paying close attention to trends in a stock's price or earnings, our 'Fast-Paced Momentum at a Bargain' screen comes handy in spotting fast-moving stocks that are still attractively priced.There are several stocks that currently pass through the screen and PulteGroup (PHM) is one of them. Here are the key reasons why this stock is a great candidate.Investors' growing interest in a stock is reflected in its recent price increase. A price change of 16.7% over the past four weeks positions the stock of this homebuilder well in this regard.While any stock can see a spike in price for a short period, it takes a real momentum player to deliver positive returns for a longer time frame. PHM meets this criterion too, as the stock gained 10% over the past 12 weeks.Moreover, the momentum for PHM is fast paced, as the stock currently has a beta of 1.33. This indicates that the stock moves 33% higher than the market in either direction.Given this price performance, it is no surprise that PHM has a Momentum Score of A, which indicates that this is the right time to enter the stock to take advantage of the momentum with the highest probability of success.Story continuesIn addition to a favorable Momentum Score, an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions has helped PHM earn a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Our research shows that the momentum-effect is quite strong among Zacks Rank #1 and #2 stocks. That's because as covering analysts raise their earnings estimates for a stock, more and more investors take an interest in it, helping its price race to keep up. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Most importantly, despite possessing fast-paced momentum features, PHM is trading at a reasonable valuation. In terms of Price-to-Sales ratio, which is considered as one of the best valuation metrics, the stock looks quite cheap now. PHM is currently trading at 0.89 times its sales. In other words, investors need to pay only 89 cents for each dollar of sales.So, PHM appears to have plenty of room to run, and that too at a fast pace.In addition to PHM, there are several other stocks that currently pass through our 'Fast-Paced Momentum at a Bargain' screen. You may consider investing in them and start looking for the newest stocks that fit these criteria.This is not the only screen that could help you find your next winning stock pick. Based on your personal investing style, you may choose from over 45 Zacks Premium Screens that are strategically created to beat the market.However, keep in mind that the key to a successful stock-picking strategy is to ensure that it produced profitable results in the past.

This means that a larger number of shares were sold by insiders in relation to shares purchased.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for Johnson &amp; Johnson The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Johnson &amp; JohnsonThe Executive VP &amp; Chief Information Officer, James Swanson, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$164k worth of shares at a price of US$155 each. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$164, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. It is worth noting that this sale was only 10% of James Swanson's holding. James Swanson was the only individual insider to sell over the last year.You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeI will like Johnson &amp; Johnson better if I see some big insider buys.

In total, Executive VP &amp; Chief Information Officer James Swanson dumped US$164k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Story continuesDoes Johnson &amp; Johnson Boast High Insider Ownership?Another way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. It's great to see that Johnson &amp; Johnson insiders own 0.09% of the company, worth about US$372m. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.So What Do The Johnson &amp; Johnson Insider Transactions Indicate?An insider sold Johnson &amp; Johnson shares recently, but they didn't buy any. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing.

Per management, this resulted from increased price and demand as a result of the execution of the multi-year Portable Medical exit announced in 2022.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $4.13.Our TakeInteger Holdings exited the first quarter of 2023 with better-than-expected results. The strong year-over-year top-line and bottom-line performances are impressive. Robust performances by both segments and strength in all three product lines of the Medical Sales segment are encouraging. Continued benefits from the Oscor and Aran acquisitions look promising. The expansion of the adjusted operating margin bodes well for the stock.Integer Holdings’ strong product development pipeline in high-growth markets, emerging customer product launches, successful tuck-in acquisitions and underlying strength of existing programs also look promising for the stock.However, the rising operating costs putting pressure on the gross margin, leading to its contraction, is discouraging.

The figure beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8.7%.Revenue growth in the quarter was backed by the better availability of the company’s sleep products to meet the underlying demand and solid growth across its broader product portfolio.However, year-on-year movements in foreign exchange, particularly the weaker Euro, negatively impacted revenues by approximately $20 million in the fiscal third quarter.ResMed Inc.

This decrease can be mainly attributed to an unfavorable product mix and a higher component cost, partially offset by an increase in average selling prices.Story continuesSG&amp;A expenses rose 25.2% year over year to $228.5 million.

The company recorded a robust sales performance in the quarter on increased demand for sleep and respiratory care devices. RMD’s acquisition of MEDIFOX DAN positively contributed to the reported quarter’s SaaS business revenues, registering continued organic growth.The organic growth of ResMed’s mask and accessory business is supported by the new patient flow and new patient growth and enhanced resupply programs to existing patients, fuelled by continuous core patient demand.Meanwhile, RMD continues expanding the base of its AirSense 11 platform worldwide by ramping up its production and availability. Despite persistent supply-chain constraints, ResMed established a foothold in its largest market for its connected sleep apnea therapy devices CPAP and APAP through the combination of AirSense 10 and AirSense 11.Meanwhile, escalating costs pressurizing the company’s operating margin are worrisome.

We started the year strong and are pleased with our first quarter results. Our performance reflects our ability to grow across our business while enhancing profitability. We remain well positioned to capitalize on additional growth opportunities in the marketplace by providing the most complete set of products and services to customers. During the quarter, we delivered revenue growth of 21%, including 11% from acquisitions, generated adjusted earnings per share of $1.24 and produced $496 million of adjusted free cash flow. We continue to believe that investing in acquisitions is the best use of free cash flow to create long-term value. We invested $224 million in acquisitions during the first quarter. All transactions were in the recycling and solid waste space. Our acquisition pipeline remains supportive of outsized levels of activity in both recycling and solid waste and environmental solutions businesses. We continue to see opportunity for well over $500 million of investment in value-creating acquisitions in 2023. We are making great progress on the integration of US Ecology and increasing the profitability of our Environmental Solutions business. We continue to adjust prices to earn an appropriate return on the valuable services we provide. The acceptance of our pricing actions remains high with very little customer defection. Cross-selling our complete set of products and services continues to run ahead of plan with more than $60 million in new sales to date. We have now achieved over $40 million of annualized cost synergies. As a result of the actions taken in the Environmental Solutions business, EBITDA margin improved to just over 20% during the first quarter. We continue to generate outsized growth by executing our strategy, supported by our differentiating capabilities, customer zeal, digital and sustainability. Regarding customers' yield, we remain laser-focused on providing a world-class customer experience to drive increased loyalty and organic growth. Our customer retention rate remained at 94%. We continue to see positive trends in our Net Promoter Score, supported by improved service delivery. Our frontline colleagues, including drivers, technicians and the customer experience team are determined to fulfill our daily commitments to our customers. We delivered robust organic revenue growth during the quarter and simultaneously increase in both price and volume. For price and related revenue increased to 9.3% and average yield on related revenue increased to 7.4%. Organic volume growth on related revenue was 1.8%. Volume growth was broad-based across our market verticals and geographies. Turning to digital. We continue to make progress on deploying RISE tablets in our collection business. Over 75% of our residential routes are operating with RISE tablets. The remaining routes are on track to be completed by midyear. This technology is the foundation that will allow us to further enhance our digital service offerings and improve our customers' experience. Moving on to sustainability. We are investing in differentiated capabilities to leverage sustainability as a platform for profitable growth. In February, we announced our plans to significantly scale our electric fleet through our long-term agreement with Oshkosh. We will begin operating 2 fully integrated electric recycling and solid waste collection prototypes later this year and expect to start buying at scale in 2025. This announcement supports our industry-leading commitment to fleet electrification through a multi-supplier strategy. Development of our polymer centers in Las Vegas and the Midwest remain on track with the centers becoming operational in late 2023 and late 2024, respectively. The 57 renewable natural gas projects being co-developed with our partners are advancing. We expect at least 6 of these projects to commence operations this year. Our approach to sustainability includes our aspiration to be the employer of choice in the markets that we serve, and we are seeing positive results. Turnover rates continue to improve, and we are now below 2019 levels. As a result, we are better staffed to capitalize on growth opportunities in the market. We continue to be widely recognized for our comprehensive sustainability performance. For example, we were recently named to Barron's 100 Most Sustainable Companies list, Ethisphere's World's Most Ethical Companies list and Fortune's list of the World's Most Admired Companies. A positive momentum in our business continues to build as we harness the power of our differentiated capabilities. We will continue to invest for the future profitable growth to deliver the results that create unmistakable value for our stakeholders. I will now turn the call over to Brian, who will provide financial details for the quarter.Brian M. DelGhiaccioThanks, Jon. Core price on total revenue was 8.2%. Core price on related revenue was 9.3%, which included open market pricing of 11.7% and restricted pricing of 5.4%. The components of core price on related revenue included small container of 12.6%, large container of 9.6% and residential of 8.4%. Average yield on total revenue was 6.5%. Average yield on related revenue was 7.4%, an increase of 70 basis points when compared to our fourth quarter performance. We continue to price new and existing business ahead of cost inflation to drive margin expansion in the underlying business. Volume on total revenue increased 1.6%, while volume on related revenue increased 1.8%. The components of volume on related revenue included an increase in small container of 1.6%, an increase in large container of 80 basis points and an increase in landfill of 8.6%. Landfill was primarily driven by a 21.7% increase in special waste revenue. Moving on to recycling. Commodity prices were $105 per ton in the quarter. This compared to $201 per ton in the prior year. Recycling processing and commodity sales decreased revenue by 90 basis points during the quarter. Current commodity prices are approximately $115 per ton. We believe that commodity prices will continue to recover in the second half of the year as the global supply/demand imbalance continues to correct. Next, turning to our Environmental Solutions business. First quarter Environmental Solutions revenue increased $309 million over the prior year, which primarily relates to the acquisition of US Ecology. On a same-store basis, Environmental Solutions contributed 50 basis points to internal growth during the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the Environmental Solutions business was 20.6%, a sequential increase of 350 basis points. Total company adjusted EBITDA margin for the first quarter was 29%. This compares to 30.4% in the prior year. Margin performance during the quarter included a 130 basis point decrease from acquisitions, which includes 90 basis points related to US Ecology, a 60 basis point decrease from recycled commodity prices and a 30 basis point decrease from an additional work day, partially offset by a 40 basis point increase from net fuel and margin expansion in the underlying business of 40 basis points. Adjusted free cash flow was $496 million in the first quarter or approximately 25% of the midpoint of our full year guidance. Free cash flow conversion was 47.6%. Total debt was $12.1 billion, and total liquidity was $2.5 billion. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was approximately 3.1x. With respect to taxes, our combined tax rate and effects from solar investments resulted in an equivalent tax impact of 26.3% during the first quarter, which was in line with our expectations. With that, operator, I'd like to open the call to questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) The first question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley.Toni Michele KaplanPricing seemed really strong this quarter. I know you talked about it sort of decelerating through the year, but just wanted to get your latest thoughts. Any additional color on pricing and how second quarter looks as well?Jon Vander ArkYes, certainly a very strong environment still. We expect to kind of maintain that momentum for the first half and for lots of reasons, we think that sequentially comes down into the second half, right, as some inflation starts to modulate in our restricted portion of our business, obviously, right, CPI comes down in terms of where the comps go, but we also expect cost inflation to modulate through the year. So we think we'll have pretty good price margin spread throughout the year, which will lead to a positive result for the year.Toni Michele KaplanTerrific. And I wanted to ask if you could just give us an update on how you're thinking about the specialty waste opportunity? Talk about any of the synergies and areas of potential future opportunity there.Jon Vander ArkYes, a really strong quarter for us, obviously, right, over 20% and broad-based, and a portion of that is certainly the cross-sell opportunities that I talked about in my prepared remarks, and that we're offering customers a comprehensive and integrated offering. And part of that is showing up in our recycling and solid waste business and going so specialty waste into our landfill. And that's the benefit of our offering, right? We can take things into liquid hazardous waste, we can take solid hazardous waste, we can take special waste, so we can provide a range of solutions to customers, and that's to put us in a pretty differentiated position in the marketplace and excited about the momentum that the team has.Brian M. DelGhiaccioYes. And also what I would add to that is that our pipeline for special waste opportunities remains very strong. And about 20% of that pipeline is a direct result of cross-sell opportunities.Toni Michele KaplanCongrats, again.OperatorThe next question comes from Tyler Brown with Raymond James.Patrick Tyler BrownSo sorry, I just want to be clear. So are you effectively just reiterating all the pieces of the guidance?Jon Vander ArkYes, we feel -- we're certainly -- feel good about the guidance at this point.Patrick Tyler BrownOkay. This wasn't totally 100% clear. But kind of going back and following on the previous question, I know pricing was strong out of the gate. But can you talk a little bit about unit cost inflation? So I think you guys guided to something like 5% to 5.5% unit cost inflation for '23, I think on the last quarter call, you kind of still see that? Are you still seeing maybe inflation starting high and then it kind of eases as the year goes on?Jon Vander ArkYes, start where you ended. It's certainly starting higher and modulating throughout the course of the year. I think it's going to be a little higher than the 5.5% probably closer to 6% would be our best look at this point right now. And a few different factors on that. Certainly, truck delivery would be one where we got about 90% of our trucks last year, and we think we're going to get probably that 10% from last year and about 90% of this year, and we're growing. So that means we're buying some older trucks -- operating some older trucks to service those growth opportunities, and they have a higher cost per engine hour. And so that's elevated maintenance costs. It's higher cost, not necessarily unit cost inflation on the part, for example, it's just operating more expensive vehicles. And hopefully, in 2024, the suppliers catch up, but we can kind of get back on track. So that would be one example why it's just a little bit higher than we predicted.Patrick Tyler BrownOkay. All right. That's perfect. Just one last one here. Going back to Environmental Services. So there's a lot of traction there. It seems like that franchise is maybe run rating $1.5 billion in total revenues, and I don't have the calculation on my fingertips here. But is that kind of like a low 20% margin today. I think you had talked about maybe getting that to 30% longer term. So do you still see that, Jon? And kind of what are the couple of the key drivers to get you there? Is it just we need to go through a couple more cycles of pricing? Or just any thoughts on timing and how we go from, call it, 20 to circa 30?Jon Vander ArkYes. Listen, I think pricing is certainly going to be a huge lever in terms of how we get there and the primary lever, I think a little bit of scale benefit, obviously, which allows us to leverage our overhead. We've built this thing for growth. So as we continue to grow, we get some leverage on our overhead spend in that space as well. And just additional integration opportunities across recycling and solid waste business, right? We haven't really taken advantage of all of those things yet. And then the last one will be just cost management, right? Cost discipline and making sure that we are pricing work appropriately in understanding the cost position of all that work so that all of our individual opportunities and projects are profitable. We've made great progress on that, but there's more room in front of us. And this was the investment thesis when we did the deal, obviously. So we did it based on intrinsic and $40 million of cost synergies. We've just gotten there quicker than we expected, right? We've gotten the 40% rate. I think we're going to end up closer to 50% when we're set and done. And then we thought there was upward pressure on pricing. We thought there was cross-sell opportunities. We said we'd get $75 billion to $100 billion over 3 years. We've already gotten $60 billion, which tells you we have a good pipeline, which tells you that we're going to get to that $75 billion to $100 billion quicker than we expected. And we know that when we price, we anticipate there will be some customer fallout churn, but the net dollars work over time. We've just seen very, very little churn, which speaks to the fact that this is a valuable offering. It's a very small portion of the vast majority of our customers' cost structure and that we're going to continue to price for the value we deliver.OperatorThe next question comes from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer.Noah Duke KayeThere's been maybe some mixed messages today in earnings -- previous earnings around the macro, the health of the macro. I have a feeling your answer may be not so mixed, maybe a little more unambiguous. But can you talk today about the health of the customer, the sustainability of your pricing? You mentioned that your retention rates are at 94%. So they're sticking. But looking at your -- both the pricing and some of the volume trends you reported, they're very robust. And so would just love your perspective on what you're seeing in the staying power of some of these trends.Jon Vander ArkYes. Let me put a caveat on first, which is we remain humble and dynamic, right? The last 3 years have bought a lot of people that there's fundamental uncertainty in the market and I read the same things you do, which is people have been talking about a recession, you announced for 12 to 18 months. So we have our eyes and ears open and that will be nimble should that occur. All that being said, we see a lot of positive signs, right? We're seeing strong growth and pricing. Let me give you a number or a perspective. In our open market, right, we're sending out more -- a higher gross price increase than we ever had before and our realization rate, which is the percentage of that pricing that sticks, right? Customers don't call back to negotiate, et cetera, is the highest it's ever been, which is somewhat of an astounding number to think about. They were putting a lot of price. That price is sticking in the marketplace for growing. We talked about special waste in that pipeline being strong. We're starting to see a commodity rebound, which we put a modest rebound in our plan, and I think we feel really good that the outlook there looks strong on that front. We've seen a little decline in temp units year-over-year. We anticipated that in our plan with where residential and commercial construction were going at the end of last year, but our yield number is very, very strong there. So we're doing some of that to ourselves in terms of yielding on those assets. So we're pretty confident in the very near term and cautiously optimistic around the demand environment for the remainder of the year.Noah Duke KayeYes. And then maybe just a little bit of a follow-on, but also housekeeping. Can you comment to what MSW tons did and then did the quarter have any benefit on the cleanup related to the train derailment in Ohio? I don't know if remediation work ended up being significant.Brian M. DelGhiaccioYes. Let me address the MSW. So MSW volume was up 1.2%. I think more importantly, though, MSW yield was up 5.6%. So very strong pricing in that portion of our business.Jon Vander ArkAnd then the specific to rem in Ohio, I think is the one you're referring to, a de minimis impact in the quarter.Noah Duke KayeOkay. So it was really all just strong demand in kind of the Environmental Services part of the business. And can you give us sort of a sense of how much of that was price?Jon Vander ArkVery strong, very broad-based. Listen, we've gone out with multiple double-digit price increases, which is sticking. Obviously, that business is more unique, and there's a lot of mix elements because you're doing a lot of individual project work and a lot of things like special waste on the hazard side that come in, right? So we haven't yet developed our yield metric, which we aspire to do over time in that portion of the business. And I'd say the industrial economy from our seat in the park is still very strong. Now it's not universally strong, automotive, for example, would be a spot that's a little bit down. So we're seeing some of that in the Midwest, which has a lot of manufacturing capacity there, but other parts are very, very strong on the industrial side.OperatorThe next question comes from Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets.Walter Noel SpracklinI wanted to go back to the recession question and really talk about it. I know your resiliency is quite admirable during the cycle. Just curious with -- you have a little bit of a different book of business now compared to '08, '09. And just wondering what your thoughts are on whether the resiliency of your earnings profile is as good as it was back then or if the addition of US Ecology has added any volatility there? And particularly on special waste, I don't know if you've answered many questions about your sensitivity to a recessionary environment on your special waste volumes, if you have any color on that?Brian M. DelGhiaccioYes. Walter, I would say the first thing to keep in perspective is that Environmental Solutions revenue in total is about 10% of our book, right? You got to keep that in mind. That being said, a good portion of this revenue stream is has a consistent and recurring nature to it, right? And increasingly more, we're trying to get closer to the customer to make that more of an annuity-type revenue stream. So, is it exactly the same? Maybe not, but is it pretty close? I would say, yes.Walter Noel SpracklinAnd sensitivity on special waste, any sense there?Jon Vander ArkAs far as -- yes, I think you got moving pieces there. Obviously, when the economy goes down, right, people will get cautious and things that have discretion to them, you're going to see some delays. But the vast majority of our special waste, those are jobs that need to get completed. They need to get done. So it's not a matter of the job getting canceled. It's a matter of the job getting pushed. And I'd say the counterbalance of that right now is just all of the infrastructure spending and government funding. We see a lot of those opportunities just starting to emerge, but we really haven't taken advantage of a lot of that spending hasn't flowed all the way through to jobs being commissioned yet.OperatorThe next question comes from Sean Eastman with KeyBanc Capital Markets.Sean D. EastmanA nice start to the year. I kind of hate to do this, but just pressing on the guidance. I mean, not much of a mention on kind of where we stand. To me, it kind of feels like we're running ahead of schedule. So I just wanted to run that by you. Is it fair to say that perhaps with the momentum in Environmental Solutions, clearly, price volume looking strong that we're kind of tracking a little ahead of that initial outlook for the year?Jon Vander ArkWe feel really good about the start to the business and shift in outlook remains quite positive. As you know, it's a seasonal business, so you got to ramp up here in Q2 and Q3. And we'll want to see that ramp up fully take hold. We're starting certainly to see some of that already, but that gets in the full swing here in May and into the summer months in the northern part of the country. And so we'll come back in July when we talk again and see our progress there, and we'll tell you if we have any update at that point.Sean D. EastmanOkay. Understood. And perhaps the moving parts on the year-on-year margin bridge in the first quarter would be helpful to assess. I mean, did those kind of commodity inputs come through as expected? That one would be good to jump into.Brian M. DelGhiaccioYes. From a commodity perspective, we're tracking almost exactly the way that we thought we would, right? So we thought we would start the year right around this, call it, $100 a ton, sequentially increasing with a full year average of about $125 per ton. And so right now, we would say with what we saw in the first quarter on average plus where current prices are at $115 per ton, it's playing out exactly the way we thought it would. And so when you think about the margin cadence of that, you look -- in this quarter, it was a 60 basis point headwind. We think it's a relatively consistent headwind in Q2. That drops to, call it, a 20 basis point headwind in Q3 and then flip positive in Q4 at those levels.Sean D. EastmanOkay. Perfect. And one last quick one for me. I just wanted to make sure I understand this big special waste print in the quarter. I mean, are you guys saying that as a reflection of the cross-sell opportunity really coming through on the Environmental Solutions strategy?Brian M. DelGhiaccioCertainly in part, right? That's why you're going to see it. When you actually sell into the recycling and solid waste business, what you're going to see is that's where a good portion of it is going to come in. That's a lot of the volume aspect of it. But at the same time, we're seeing that -- again, we're talking about total revenue being up about 22%. It's a pretty good split between both price and volume. So it's a combination of both, and that's going to be a reflection again of just healthy activity, which includes the benefits of that cross-sell.OperatorThe next question comes from Stephanie Moore with Jefferies.Stephanie Lynn Benjamin MooreI wanted to touch a little bit on the M&amp;A environment. I think you noted that you expected to execute on, I think, close to $500 million in M&amp;A this year, not included in the guidance. So maybe if you just wanted to touch on what you've seen for the first quarter of the year and kind of any changes or expectations there? And I know you noted that a lot of those acquisitions is in the recycling and solid waste business. But what about more so in the specialty waste? Is that an opportunity this year as well?Jon Vander ArkSo yes, we put out in our initial guidance. We anticipated spending $500 million. I think we'll exceed that number as we go throughout the year. We have a really attractive pipeline, both in recycling and solid waste and Environmental Solutions. And so I think you'll see some of those deals come across through the remainder of the year, and we get -- things are at different stages, right? We're all the way in the front end of conversations to the back end of letters of intent, and we report on things once we sign and close those deals. So you'll hear more in the second quarter. And the exact timing of where that flows between Q2, Q3 and Q4, obviously, we don't predict that because things can pull forward or they can move out a few months here or there. The pipeline remains strong. I think both for '23 and all the way into '24 at this point. We feel really good about the pipeline.Stephanie Lynn Benjamin MooreGot it. And then maybe touching back on the pricing and the cost environment as well. And you just noted on 2024. And obviously, a lot of things could happen between here and there. But how would you think about that just general structural spread cost -- between pricing cost as we move through 2024, given some of the maybe headwinds this year and what next year in theory could be a more normalized environment, if that exists anymore, but how would you view just how that spread has changed over time versus maybe historically?Jon Vander ArkYes. Look, we remain committed to pricing ahead of our cost inflation to allow us to expand margins across the business. So we've talked about 30 to 50 basis points of margin expansion. That's kind of the pace that we go after, and that would be our initial ingoing assumption in 2024. Now a lot can change between now and then in terms of could we get more than that, right? If we can do that and maintain and improve the health of our overall business, we'll certainly do that, but more to come down the road here on 2024 perspective.OperatorThe next question comes from Tony Bancroft with Gabelli Funds.George Anthony BancroftA very nice quarter. Just a question on PFAS. Could you just sort of review -- I know there's a lot of news articles coming out about that right now and some potential rulings and some regulation coming out. Just maybe review what that potentially means for you in landfill cost structure, potential opportunities, maybe that would be helpful.Jon Vander ArkYes. Very important, that regulation. And again, we're not opposed to regulation, we happen if it's well constructed. So we have a seat at that table. And we're involved in those conversations to make sure that we don't, as a company, or even an industry get penalized for something that we catch, right? We didn't create the problem. People should be happy that we've got the modern infrastructure and systems to protect the environment. Net-net, we see it as more of an opportunity over time, especially with our Environmental Solutions business and being able to serve customers. Could that have some elevated costs in our landfill, yes, we've got a really good history of passing those types of costs, regulatory costs on to customers. And so more to come on that as we move forward. But we're very much in the conversation and we'll be active in shaping the legislation in a way that it enhances the business versus penalizes the business.George Anthony BancroftAnd then I guess my second one, just on electrification. You touched on in your comments. Just maybe again, an update on that. You've talked about in the past, but how is that going? There's been some, I think people are talking about infrastructure issues and making it all sort of work. What's your view on it? Is it on track? Is it off track? Or just maybe you could give us some thoughts on that.Jon Vander ArkNo, very much on track. We've got more than 20 trucks right around the country right now that are electrified through multiple manufacturers. We talked about our Oshkosh partnership and that the first kind of bottoms up zero emission-designed vehicle and excited about that. And we'll be -- that number of 20 will go north of 50 next year. By 2025, we'll have several hundred vehicles. And it is important. It's not just the vehicle, it's the system. So you need to have the infrastructure, you need to have understanding of government regulations, you need to understand the incentives, and we've been working for years on those things and have multiple infrastructure projects already going on, anticipating where we're going to put vehicles in working closely with customers. So we feel we're on track. And listen, innovation is hard. There will be some bumps and twists and turns, but we're really, really confident that this is a product that the customers want to buy and that this is very viable for -- again, for us to operate in a way that enhances our business versus penalized.OperatorThe next question comes from Tobey Sommer with Truist Securities.Tobey O'Brien SommerWhen you look at your M&amp;A bogey for this year and you say you have pretty good visibility in the pipeline for next year as well. What does the pipeline look like in terms of distribution across your businesses? Is it -- and has that changed as you've engaged in conversations?Jon Vander ArkWell, if you go back from 5 years ago, it certainly has changed when we were predominantly vastly recycling and solid waste player, and we've obviously grown the Environmental Solutions business to Bill's point, right, that's still about 10% of the business broadly. The pipeline is probably an 80-20 mix of 80% recycling and solid waste and 20% Environmental Solutions. So that will grow faster just because there's more geographies to fill in. There's a few product lines to build out. So there's more kind of inherent growth in that in terms of our starting point. But the balance of the business will still be recycling and solid waste and I feel really confident about that. In any given time period, right, that could ship a single deal could flip it to 80-20 in any given quarter. But if you look across a longer-time horizon of 3 to 5 years, I think that 80-20 makes us a pretty good barometer.Tobey O'Brien SommerRight. And year-to-date, if you look at your employee base, what has the trend been like in not just employee turnover or perhaps improved turnover and attrition rates, but also the heavy lift that it is to recruit and hire new ads and train them? Are both of those sides of the equation getting easier?Jon Vander ArkYes. Turnover is down. Employee engagement is up from a very high watermark. So people are engaged, right? Turnover is down, and this is the recruiting situation in the last 4 to 5 months has substantially improved, right? Number of applicants per open rec has substantially improved. So there's still pockets of tightness around so it could be very geographically dependent. But from a broad-based macro level as the situation versus 6 months ago is substantially better.Tobey O'Brien SommerIs there room for continued improvement? Or are we already at healthy metrics if you make a longer-term comparison more than just sort of the Great Recession in 6 month ago period?Jon Vander ArkYes. We talked about turnover being below 2019 levels. We aspire to continue to grind that down kind of 30 to 50 basis points of product turnover long term would be great for us. Turnover is never going to be 0 people move and have changes in life circumstances, and there's always opportunity bringing new talent, but we'll look to bring that down. But we feel like right now, we're at a very healthy level and that we can continue to improve from here.OperatorThe next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.Jerry David RevichI'm wondering if you could talk about the performance in the quarter. So your margins were up about 2 points sequentially 1Q versus 4Q, which is a good bit better-than-normal seasonality? Is it possible to parse how much of that was price cost and the municipal solid waste part of the business? You mentioned the ESPs. I wonder if you could just flesh out the rest of that bridge in terms of that performance versus normal seasonality?Brian M. DelGhiaccioYes. Jerry, we mentioned sequentially the Environmental Solutions business improving 350 basis points. But also in the fourth quarter, remember, as we outperformed the year, we had heavier incentive compensation expense in the fourth quarter. So I would say there were some things that were more unique in Q4 as far as expenses are concerned off to a strong start this year. I think that's why you're seeing more of that sequential improvement. This year, we would expect just more normal seasonality and a Q4 that looks like what you've seen in the -- our 3 to 4 years as compared to what you saw last year from a margin perspective.Jerry David RevichSuper helpful. And then can I ask you, it feels like cost are stabilizing. Should we look for the price/cost gap sequentially to improve in the second quarter as a result of that dynamic?Brian M. DelGhiaccioYes. Some of -- when we think about some of the cost inflation, we see some of the anniversarying, which is just a little bit more of when we saw some of those cost increase going into play last year. So yes, we start to anniversary some of those things in the second quarter. We started seeing a lot of that more on the wage side. We also start to see some of that modulate from a comp perspective on transportation costs beginning in the third and fourth quarter. So we would expect the inflation levels to decrease as we move sequentially. Again, it's not that we're seeing a significant price decrease in the current period. It's just that we're anniversarying the cost increase that went in, in the prior year.Jerry David RevichGot it. And lastly, can I trouble you to share with us the incremental tailwinds to your business from the plastics and landfill gas investments that are scheduled to come online for '24 versus '23 and '25 versus '24? When do we get the most significant step up relative to the cadence?Brian M. DelGhiaccioYes. So if you think about -- let me start with the plastic side on the polymer center. So that's -- you start to see that in '24 start to layer in with, call it, $15 million or so of EBITDA, and then it really ramp up into '25 and into '26 until you get to a run rate of, call it, somewhere in that $75 million plus type EBITDA range. When you take a look at from a gas perspective, again, most of that, you're starting to see -- again, you start to see the first projects come online towards the end of '23. So most of the contribution coming in '24, you could see $25 million plus type of incremental EBITDA in '24 and then sequentially in a $15 million to $20 million per year until we get to that $100 million worth of total contribution by 2028.OperatorThe next question comes from Kevin Chiang with CIBC.Kevin ChiangMaybe just on Environmental Services, obviously, a good showing in Q1 here. You continue to make good progress. I get the sense earlier on when you acquired US Ecology, there was a fear that this business was more cyclical. Just wondering, as you cross-sell more and as you kind of pull this under the RSG umbrella, do you think it changes the cyclicality of that business? Like does the customer look at that service differently if they're also buying other RSG services? I know it's early days, but just wondering how that experience has been, just given the broader economy has been shaky here.Jon Vander ArkI think 2 things are true. When you're just a -- predominantly a post-collections player, everything you see can look variable and cyclical because it could be a recurring revenue stream, but that provider might farm that out or source that out to a few different places looking for price. When you get closer to the generator, right, then you own -- you have control of that product. Now could they take that somewhere else? Of course, they could over time. But when you provide excellent service and you have an integrated offering, you become stickier. And so, huge opportunity that we're seeing right now to take things that might have looked more cyclical or volatile or variable to become more consistent and recurring in the revenue stream. That doesn't mean that will be 100% of it like we have in our current business, right? We have some of that base work. On the landfill side, we'll certainly have some of that. But over time, the profile will migrate closer to the recycling and solid waste side.Kevin ChiangOkay. That's helpful. I apologize if this is somewhere in your release, but if I look at your organic growth composition, let's call it 80-20 split between yield and volume or price and volume. What would that look like today in your Environmental Services business, if I deconstruct the organic growth between volume and price? I apologize if I missed this earlier.Brian M. DelGhiaccioYes, I would probably say it's probably relatively similar just from the perspective of some of these are project-related jobs. We have seen -- that being said, we've seen really good pricing in that business, but we've also just seen an increase of activity at the same time, which is really a function of now offering the most complete set of products and services in the space, right? So again, we're seeing a combination of both, and that's what's really driving the outsized revenue growth in that portion of the business.Kevin ChiangCongrats on a great start to the year.OperatorThe next question comes from Mike Feniger with Bank of America.Michael J. FenigerBrian, the growth on the ES side and now layering in the incremental EBITDA from plastic recycling and the landfill DAS in '24 and beyond, does that change how we should be thinking about the free cash flow conversion and the improvement you guys are seeing there and potentially going forward?Brian M. DelGhiaccioWell, look, I mean, we said that rewinding the clock 2, 3 years ago, and we were up high 30% free cash flow conversion company. We've moved that into the mid-40s, and we said we have line of sight into the high 40% and beyond, right? And we're working on these things. And again, those are some of the things that we're going to do in order to achieve that level of performance even while we're overcoming some headwinds to getting into that high 40% interest expense is a headwind to free cash flow conversion, the expiration of bonus depreciation, which is phasing out over the next 5 years. Those are all headwinds. And even in the face of those things, we think we can achieve that level of performance. And everything you just mentioned is the way we're going to get there.Michael J. FenigerGreat. And I realize the regional banking crisis tightening lending standards is likely not an issue for you and your customers. Do you hear of any issues for some of your smaller regional competitors, ability to finance and buy you trucks, trying to expand? Just curious how that changed competitive dynamic or even some of the M&amp;A opportunity going forward?Jon Vander ArkI don't think we've seen that show up specifically. There's probably an example somewhere in our M&amp;A pipeline. Of that being the case, I do think it's becoming more challenging, right? Because given supply chain challenges, right, because we got 90% of our trucks. If you were a spot buyer of trucks, right, you're in a really tough spot, right? You're going to be driving that truck, not as a matter of months, but a matter of years before you can get allocation on that. So digital, we've talked about that a number of times. That being the second moat in the business and our investments in that space and the ability to service customers and connect it to our operations and core systems, I feel they are all things that make an attractive time for smaller players to sell.OperatorThe next question comes from Michael E. Hoffman with Stifel.Michael Edward HoffmanOn the ES business, there's a bunch of pieces here. One, can you help fill in the gaps on what contributed to the 350 basis points sequentially? And then the idea of margin improving, I just want to make sure I understand mix. I mean, if I -- if I'm wrong, I'm wrong, but I thought about 1/3 of this was fixed asset disposals, so high margin and 2/3 is sort of billable hour services that are good returns but lower margin. I'm trying to figure out where that mix goes in order to achieve the target that was suggested earlier in the call.Brian M. DelGhiaccioYes, Michael, first of all, I think that it's a little bit more, I would sit there and say in the 50-50 rather than the 30-70 between those 2 aspects of the business. I think you have a combination of things. First, let's talk about what happened sequentially, right? So we talked about price increases that we put in late in '22 as well as early '23. So a certain aspect of that was certainly timing. Also, as you just think about increasing utilization as we're actually achieving the cross-sell, some of that is that we're utilizing some excess capacity that's in that system. So it's -- the flow-through of that incremental revenue is at a very high margin. We're seeing the combination of the both. So Jon mentioned it when we were on the call, some of the way that we're going to get there is also just by scale. When you take a look at the size of our areas, when you take a look at our 4 areas, they're managing less revenue than their counterparts on the recycling and solid waste space, which gives us capacity to grow into that and leverage that SG&amp;A. So we built that area structure to look a lot like the recycling and solid waste side, even though they're managing less revenue, which gives them opportunity to grow without adding any additional SG&amp;A costs.Jon Vander ArkAnd Michael, on the field services side of the business, but some of that would be getting MSAs with large industrial customers who we know are going to have a set of projects throughout the year. They're going to be in different spots. But if you look over a 10-year period, right, you've got a relatively consistent demand profile of their level of project spend, cleanup, plant turnarounds, et cetera, that you can -- when you have the MSA and the relationship, right, that revenue stream then look -- starts to look very recurring versus it's just an event or a job.Michael Edward HoffmanOkay. And that's always been the secret challenge or challenge for the billable hours world as they struggle with utilization of their billable hour resource. So what I'm hearing you say is you're striking a balance on how to maximize that.Jon Vander ArkCorrect.Michael Edward HoffmanOkay. On the price cadence for the remainder of the year to get to the 5.5%, can you help us with the mix between open and restricted through the remainder of the year, so we sort of understand how to think about that, that gets us to the total of 5.5% for the year?Brian M. DelGhiaccioYes. So the -- if you think about -- we expect sequential increase into Q2 on the restricted portion of the book, and that kind of hit high watermark, and then it will decrease sequentially. Our expectation is it will decrease sequentially into Q3 and Q4. We think the high watermark on the open market is here in Q1, and it decreases sequentially but modestly. So again, I would sit there and as we talked about earlier, I guess, 60 days ago at this point, that the spread between the high and the low by quarter is not that significant. Call it, 50, 60 basis points, plus or minus, from the midpoint, and that's what we would expect for the full year.Michael Edward HoffmanOkay. And just to be clear, so I got these numbers, I mean, numbers coming at us, the high watermark for the beginning of the year -- sorry, I'm flipping pages. There's 11.7% in the open and 5.4% for restricted.Brian M. DelGhiaccioYes, that is correct. That's on core price, Michael.Michael Edward HoffmanThat's core. Not yield. What was the yields?Brian M. DelGhiaccioCorrect. Well, the yield in total, we don't break the yield up between the 2, yield in total with 7.4% on related revenue. On total revenue, it was 6.5%. And again, if you're building it into a model, go ahead.Michael Edward HoffmanNo, go ahead, please. That's what I was...Brian M. DelGhiaccioI was going to say the reason we do -- we break the 2 out that if you're building it on a model and you're using the base, the entire base period revenue probably have to use the total revenue number. Again, we disclosed the related revenue because we don't calculate price on all components of revenue. So again, do you want to get the true effectiveness of our pricing programs, that's why related revenue is applicable.Michael Edward HoffmanOkay. And then, Jon, you made a comment earlier to an answer to a question, said 6%, and I missed -- is that 6% inflation or you thought yield would maybe land at 6% by the end of the year?Jon Vander ArkNo. We said cost inflation, we think, throughout the year, right, we'll be -- end up around 6% where (inaudible) are going into the year, 5.5%, right? So we're seeing a little elevation there, primarily here in the first -- in the second quarter. But again, we're pricing ahead of our expectations as well. So we're getting the performance that we expected, just a little bit different path to get there.Michael Edward HoffmanRight. Which would suggest the guide of 5.5% probably works its way up to staying on top of that?Jon Vander ArkWe'll update you in July.OperatorAt this time, there appears to be no further questions. Mr. Vander Ark, I'll turn the call back over to you for closing remarks.Jon Vander ArkThank you, Vishavi. I would like to thank our 40,000 employees for their commitment to deliver and essential service in the markets we serve. Our results are a direct reflection of the team's ongoing efforts to deliver best-in-class service to all our customers. Have a good evening and be safe.OperatorThe conference has now concluded.

The story was previously corrected to fix a typo in the headline.)April 28 (Reuters) - A panel of U.S. Food and Drug Administration advisers on Friday voted for the restricted use of British drugmaker AstraZeneca Plc's experimental treatment, jointly developed with Merck &amp; Co, for a type of prostate cancer.The FDA panel voted 11-1 with one abstention, in favor of Lynparza, in combination with other medications – abiraterone and prednisone or prednisolone – as a first-line treatment for a type of treatment-resistant prostate cancer in adult patients.However, the panel recommended the approval to be limited only to patients whose tumors have a mutation in the BCRA genes, and advised against approval beyond this patient population.Its recommendation comes after Lynparza and similar class of therapies suffered a series of safety setbacks as clinical data suggested that patients do not live as long as those given chemotherapy when given as a second-line therapy.Lynparza belongs to a class of drugs called PARP inhibitors, which include Clovis Oncology's Rubraca and GSK Plc's Zejula.They were withdrawn last year as second line of treatment for ovarian cancer patients after the FDA limited the use of PARP inhibitors and requested companies to pull the drug.Friday's vote is based on a late-stage study, which showed Lynparza in combination significantly improved duration for which patients live without disease worsening when compared to the placebo in combination with abiraterone and prednisone/prednisolone.Lynparza is already approved by the FDA to treat a type of breast cancer, ovarian cancer, as well as a different form of prostate cancer.The FDA while making its final decision on the use of the drug usually follows the recommendations of its expert panel but is not obligated to do so.(Reporting by Mariam Sunny, Khushi Mandowara and Aditya Samal in Bengaluru; Editing by Shailesh Kuber and Arun Koyyur)]"

140,4bc51572-bd60-318d-97e8-2537664a2fa2,MRK,2023-04-29,Update on FDA Advisory Committee Vote on LYNPARZA® (olaparib) Plus Abiraterone and Prednisone or Prednisolone in First-Line Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer,Business Wire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fda-advisory-committee-vote-lynparza-213000796.html,1682717400,STORY,['MRK'],"[RAHWAY, N.J., April 28, 2023--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside of the United States and Canada, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee (ODAC), by a vote of 11 to 1 with one abstention, supported FDA approval of LYNPARZA plus abiraterone and prednisone or prednisolone (abi/pred) for the first-line treatment of adult patients with BRCA-mutated (BRCAm) metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). The committee voted that FDA should restrict use of LYNPARZA plus abi/pred to these BRCAm mCRPC patients, recommending against approval beyond this patient population.In August 2022, the FDA accepted the supplemental New Drug Application for LYNPARZA plus abi/pred for priority review based on positive results from the pivotal Phase 3 PROpel trial, which were also published in NEJM Evidence. The ODAC provides the FDA with independent, expert advice and recommendations on marketed and investigational medicines for use in the treatment of cancer. The FDA is not bound by the committee’s guidance but takes its advice into consideration. AstraZeneca and Merck will continue to work with the FDA as the agency completes its review of the application.Neal Shore, chief medical officer of urology and surgical oncology for GenesisCare, US and PROpel trial investigator, said, ""Today’s recommendation by the ODAC is disappointing news for clinicians and prostate cancer patients alike. Preventing or delaying radiographic progression is an important clinical endpoint in assessing oncologic treatment and is very relevant to patients, their caregivers and their families. It is essential that physicians and their patients have an opportunity to choose treatment with the goal of optimizing cancer care outcomes.""Susan Galbraith, executive vice president, oncology R&amp;D, AstraZeneca, said, ""Novel treatments are urgently needed for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. While we are pleased with the recognition of the benefit of LYNPARZA plus abiraterone for patients with BRCA-mutated metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, we are disappointed with the outcome of today’s ODAC meeting. We strongly believe in the results of the PROpel trial, which demonstrated a clinically meaningful benefit for this combination in a broad population of patients regardless of biomarker status.""Story continuesEliav Barr, senior vice president, head of global clinical development and chief medical officer, Merck Research Laboratories, said, ""With the incidence and mortality of prostate cancer set to double in the coming decades, it is critical that we bring new treatment options with the potential to reduce the risk of disease progression or death to patients at the earliest possible moment in their care. Though we are pleased that the ODAC recommended LYNPARZA for patients with mCRPC who have BRCA mutations, we believe in the potential of LYNPARZA plus abi/pred for a broad range of patients with mCRPC, based on the results of PROpel. We look forward to the outcome of the FDA’s review of the application.""Results from the PROpel trial showed a statistically significant and clinically meaningful 34% reduction in the risk of radiographic disease progression or death with LYNPARZA plus abi/pred (HR=0.66 [95% CI, 0.54-0.81]; p&lt;0.001) versus placebo plus abi/pred in patients with mCRPC. Median radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) was 24.8 months versus 16.6 months, respectively.Further results from the final pre-specified overall survival (OS) analysis were presented at the 2023 American Society of Clinical Oncology Genitourinary Cancers Symposium (maturity 47.9%, HR=0.81 [95% CI, 0.67-1.00]; p=0.0544). While the observed 7.4-month numerical increase in median OS did not achieve statistical significance, the totality of the efficacy results from PROpel build on the meaningful gains achieved for patients in this setting versus patients treated with abi/pred alone, a current standard of care.In exploratory analyses of the BRCAm subgroup, patients in the LYNPARZA plus abi/pred arm had fewer rPFS (HR=0.23 [95% CI, 0.12-0.43]) and OS (HR=0.29 [95% CI, 0.14-0.56]) events versus those receiving placebo plus abi/pred. In the subgroup of patients who tested negative for BRCAm by either a tumor tissue-based test or a circulating tumor DNA test, patients in the LYNPARZA plus abi/pred arm also had fewer rPFS events (HR=0.76 [95% CI, 0.61-0.94] versus those receiving placebo plus abi/pred, as well as modestly fewer OS events (HR=0.91 [95% CI, 0.73-1.13]).The safety and tolerability of LYNPARZA plus abi/pred in PROpel was in line with that observed in prior clinical trials and the known profiles of the individual medicines. The most common adverse events (AEs) (≥20%) were anemia (49.7%), fatigue (38.7%), nausea (30.7%), back pain (21.6%) and diarrhea (20.6%). Grade ≥3 AEs were anemia (16.1%), hypertension (3.8%), urinary tract infection (2.5%), fatigue (2.5%), vomiting (1.5%), diarrhea (1.3%), decreased appetite (1%), back pain (1%) and nausea (0.3%). Approximately 17% of patients who received LYNPARZA in combination with abi/pred discontinued treatment due to an AE.LYNPARZA in combination with abi/pred is approved in the European Union and several other countries for the treatment of adult patients with mCRPC based on the PROpel trial. In the U.S., LYNPARZA is currently approved for patients with homologous recombination repair gene-mutated mCRPC who have progressed following prior treatment with enzalutamide or abiraterone based on the Phase 3 PROfound trial. For that U.S. indication, patients are selected for therapy based on an FDA-approved companion diagnostic for LYNPARZA.About PROpelPROpel is a randomized, double-blind Phase 3 trial testing the efficacy, safety and tolerability of LYNPARZA versus placebo when given in addition to abi/pred in patients with mCRPC who had not received prior chemotherapy or new hormonal agents in the mCRPC setting. The major efficacy outcome was rPFS as assessed by investigator per RECIST v1.1 and Prostate Cancer Working Group (bone) criteria. OS was an additional efficacy outcome measure.IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONCONTRAINDICATIONSThere are no contraindications for LYNPARZA.WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONSMyelodysplastic Syndrome/Acute Myeloid Leukemia (MDS/AML): Occurred in approximately 1.5% of patients exposed to LYNPARZA monotherapy, and the majority of events had a fatal outcome. The median duration of therapy in patients who developed MDS/AML was 2 years (range: &lt;6 months to &gt;10 years). All of these patients had previous chemotherapy with platinum agents and/or other DNA-damaging agents, including radiotherapy.Do not start LYNPARZA until patients have recovered from hematological toxicity caused by previous chemotherapy (≤Grade 1). Monitor complete blood count for cytopenia at baseline and monthly thereafter for clinically significant changes during treatment. For prolonged hematological toxicities, interrupt LYNPARZA and monitor blood count weekly until recovery.If the levels have not recovered to Grade 1 or less after 4 weeks, refer the patient to a hematologist for further investigations, including bone marrow analysis and blood sample for cytogenetics. Discontinue LYNPARZA if MDS/AML is confirmed.Pneumonitis: Occurred in 0.8% of patients exposed to LYNPARZA monotherapy, and some cases were fatal. If patients present with new or worsening respiratory symptoms such as dyspnea, cough, and fever, or a radiological abnormality occurs, interrupt LYNPARZA treatment and initiate prompt investigation. Discontinue LYNPARZA if pneumonitis is confirmed and treat patient appropriately.Venous Thromboembolic Events (VTE): Including severe or fatal pulmonary embolism (PE) occurred in patients treated with LYNPARZA. VTE occurred in 7% of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who received LYNPARZA plus androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) compared to 3.1% of patients receiving enzalutamide or abiraterone plus ADT in the PROfound study. Patients receiving LYNPARZA and ADT had a 6% incidence of pulmonary embolism compared to 0.8% of patients treated with ADT plus either enzalutamide or abiraterone. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, and treat as medically appropriate, which may include long-term anticoagulation as clinically indicated.Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals, LYNPARZA can cause fetal harm. A pregnancy test is recommended for females of reproductive potential prior to initiating treatment.FemalesAdvise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception during treatment and for 6 months following the last dose.MalesAdvise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential or who are pregnant to use effective contraception during treatment and for 3 months following the last dose of LYNPARZA and to not donate sperm during this time.ADVERSE REACTIONS—First-Line Maintenance BRCAm Advanced Ovarian CancerMost common adverse reactions (Grades 1-4) in ≥10% of patients who received LYNPARZA in the first-line maintenance setting for SOLO-1 were: nausea (77%), fatigue (67%), abdominal pain (45%), vomiting (40%), anemia (38%), diarrhea (37%), constipation (28%), upper respiratory tract infection/influenza/nasopharyngitis/bronchitis (28%), dysgeusia (26%), decreased appetite (20%), dizziness (20%), neutropenia (17%), dyspepsia (17%), dyspnea (15%), leukopenia (13%), urinary tract infection (13%), thrombocytopenia (11%), and stomatitis (11%).Most common laboratory abnormalities (Grades 1-4) in ≥25% of patients who received LYNPARZA in the first-line maintenance setting for SOLO-1 were: decrease in hemoglobin (87%), increase in mean corpuscular volume (87%), decrease in leukocytes (70%), decrease in lymphocytes (67%), decrease in absolute neutrophil count (51%), decrease in platelets (35%), and increase in serum creatinine (34%).ADVERSE REACTIONS—First-Line Maintenance Advanced Ovarian Cancer in Combination with BevacizumabMost common adverse reactions (Grades 1-4) in ≥10% of patients treated with LYNPARZA/bevacizumab and at a ≥5% frequency compared to placebo/bevacizumab in the first-line maintenance setting for PAOLA-1 were: nausea (53%), fatigue (including asthenia) (53%), anemia (41%), lymphopenia (24%), vomiting (22%), and leukopenia (18%).

Select patients for therapy based on an FDA-approved companion diagnostic for LYNPARZA.Please see complete Prescribing Information, including Medication Guide.About LYNPARZA® (olaparib)LYNPARZA is a first-in-class PARP inhibitor and the first targeted treatment to potentially exploit DNA damage response (DDR) pathway deficiencies, such as BRCA mutations, to preferentially kill cancer cells. Inhibition of PARP with LYNPARZA leads to the trapping of PARP bound to DNA single-strand breaks, stalling of replication forks, their collapse and the generation of DNA double-strand breaks and cancer cell death. LYNPARZA is being tested in a range of tumor types with defects and dependencies in the DDR.LYNPARZA, which is being jointly developed and commercialized by AstraZeneca and Merck, has a broad clinical trial development program, and AstraZeneca and Merck are working together to understand how it may affect multiple PARP-dependent tumors as a monotherapy and in combination across multiple cancer types.About metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancerProstate cancer is the second most common cancer in male patients globally and is associated with a significant mortality rate. Development of prostate cancer is often driven by male sex hormones called androgens, including testosterone. In patients with mCRPC, their prostate cancer grows and spreads to other parts of the body, despite the use of androgen-deprivation therapy to block the action of male sex hormones. Approximately 10-20% of patients with prostate cancer are estimated to develop castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) within five years, with at least 84% of these patients presenting with metastases at the time of CRPC diagnosis. Of patients with no metastases at CRPC diagnosis, 33% are likely to develop metastases within two years.About the AstraZeneca and Merck strategic oncology collaborationIn July 2017, AstraZeneca and Merck, known as MSD outside of the United States and Canada, announced a global strategic oncology collaboration to co-develop and co-commercialize certain oncology products including LYNPARZA, the world’s first PARP inhibitor, for multiple cancer types. Working together, the companies will develop these products in combination with other potential new medicines and as monotherapies. Independently, the companies will develop these oncology products in combination with their respective PD-L1 and PD-1 medicines.Merck’s focus on cancerOur goal is to translate breakthrough science into innovative oncology medicines to help people with cancer worldwide.

Lilly also announced exceedingly positive late-stage data from a study in obesity as it fast approaches potential approval for its diabetes drug Mounjaro for the obesity indication. J&amp;J JNJ is looking to raise as much as $3.5 billion in the initial public offer (IPO) of its Consumer Health segment, Kenvue.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesEarnings Update: Merck’s first-quarter results were better than expected as it beat estimates for earnings as well as sales. Strong sales of key products, Keytruda and Gardasil vaccine drove the top line in the quarter. While sales of blockbuster cancer drug, Keytruda sales rose 24%, excluding Fx impact, sales of HPV vaccine, Gardasil rose 43%. Merck also raised its full-year sales and profit outlook, citing strong global underlying demand for its key products.Lilly reported mixed results for the first quarter of 2023, missing earnings per share estimates while beating the same for revenues. Excluding revenues from COVID-19 antibodies, its sales rose 10% on the back of volume growth from Mounjaro, Trulicity, Verzenio and Jardiance. Lilly raised its previously issued revenue and earnings guidance for 2023.AbbVie’s first-quarter 2023 earnings and sales beat estimates. AbbVie’s sales declined 9.7% year over year. This is because sales of the flagship drug Humira declined almost 25% due to the recent loss of exclusivity in the United States. Key new drugs Skyrizi and Rinvoq underperformed in the quarter. AbbVie raised its earnings guidance for 2023. The company now expects adjusted EPS in the range of $10.72-$11.12, compared with the previously provided range of $10.62-$11.02AstraZeneca’s first-quarter results were mixed as it beat estimates for earnings but missed the same for sales. Higher sales of key medicines like Tagrisso, Imfinzi, Lynpaza and Farxiga were offset by a steep decline in sales of AstraZeneca’s COVID products. Excluding, COVID products, total revenues increased 15% and product sales increased 16%. AstraZeneca maintained its financial guidance for 2023. It expects total revenues to increase in the low-to-mid single-digit percentage in 2023 at CER, including its COVID products. Excluding COVID products, total revenues are expected to increase in the low double-digit percentage.Story continuesSanofi’s quarterly results were mixed as it beat estimates for earnings but missed the same for sales. Dupixent continued its strong performance in the quarter with sales rising 39.7% at a constant exchange rate. Sanofi maintained its adjusted earnings growth guidance of a low single-digit range at CER in 2023.Novartis beat estimates for both earnings and sales. Sales in the Innovative Medicines unit rose 7% at constant currency, driven by the continued strong performance of Entresto, Pluvicto, Kesimpta and Kisqali, partly offset by generic competition mainly for Gilenya. Sales in the Sandoz division rose 8%, driven by a strong performance in Europe. The planned spin-off of the Sandoz unit remains on track for the second half of 2023. The company raised its financial guidance for 2023. Sales are now expected to grow in the mid-single digits, up from the previous guidance of low-to-mid-single digits. Core operating income is expected to grow in a high-single-digit range, up from the previous guidance of growth in the mid-single-digit range in 2023.Lilly’s Second Obesity Study on Tirzepatide Shows Positive Outcome: Lilly’s tirzepatide, its dual GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist, showed “superior weight loss” in the 72-week phase III SURMOUNT-2 study. In the study, for the efficacy primary endpoint, treatment with a higher dose of tirzepatide, 15 mg, led to up to 15.7% (34.4 lb. or 15.6 kg) weight reduction in obese or overweight adults with type II diabetes. Moreover, 86.4% of the participants given tirzepatide 15 mg experienced at least 5% body weight reduction, which was the study’s other co-primary endpoint, compared to 30.5% in the placebo arm.Tirzepatide also met all key secondary objectives in the study. SURMOUNT-2 is the second phase III study on tirzepatide to show superior weight loss reduction in obese or overweight patients. In the first study, SURMOUNT-1, treatment with tirzepatide led to up to 22.5% (52 lb or 24 kg) weight loss in obese or overweight adults with at least one comorbidity, who did not have diabetes. Results of the SURMOUNT-1 study were announced last yearEli Lilly intends to complete its rolling submission of a new drug application (NDA) for tirzepatide in obesity in the coming weeks, following positive data from the SURMOUNT-2 study. Lilly presently markets tirzepatide by the name of Mounjaro for type II diabetes.Lilly announced a definitive agreement to divest Baqsimi, its nasally administered glucagon for treating severe hypoglycemia in diabetes patients, to Amphastar Pharmaceuticals. Global sales of Baqsimi were $139.3 million in 2022.J&amp;J Kicks Off Kenvue IPO Roadshow: J&amp;J kicked off a roadshow for the IPO of its consumer health business. J&amp;J plans to separate its Consumer Health segment into a new publicly-traded company to be called Kenvue. J&amp;J is offering 151.2 million of its common stock at a price between $20.00 and $23.00 per share. J&amp;J expects to raise as much as $3.5 billion in the IPO. Kenvue has applied to list its common stock on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “KVUE.” Kenvue’s valuation is expected to be approximately $43 billion.The European Commission granted marketing authorization to J&amp;J’s Akeega, which is a combination of Zejula (niraparib) and abiraterone acetate, plus prednisone in the form of a dual action tablet, for the first-line treatment of adult patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer with BRCA1/2 mutations. The approval of Akeega is based on results from the phase III MAGNITUDE study.The NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index declined 1.65% in the last five trading sessions.Large Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % ReturnLarge Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % ReturnLarge Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % ReturnHere’s how the eight major stocks performed in the last five trading sessions.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn the last five trading sessions, Lilly rose the most (up 4.1%), while AbbVie declined the most (8%).In the past six months, Novartis has risen the most (26.5%), while Pfizer has declined the most (16.8%).(See the last pharma stock roundup here: JNJ Beats on Q1 Earnings, MRK to Buy RXDX &amp; Other Updates)What's Next in the Pharma World?Watch out for the Q1 results of Pfizer and Novo Nordisk and regular pipeline and regulatory updates next week.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

""Joe"" Williams, who died April 27, 2023, at age 89 in South Carolina.This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230428005534/en/Former Williams CEO Joseph H. Williams (Photo: Business Wire)Mr. Williams spent 35 years at Williams, the last 15 as chairman and chief executive officer. The son of David Williams, one of the original co-founders of Williams, he followed his cousin John Williams as CEO and served in that role from 1979 to 1994, when he retired. He was the last member of the Williams family to head Williams.""Joe was a great leader and set Williams up for long term success with his ability to focus on the horizon. He had the right mix of optimism for the future and hard nose questioning of the status quo to keep the organization both inspired and on its toes. His intellectual curiosity kept the company truly embracing change for the opportunities it offered,"" said Alan Armstrong, Williams president and CEO. ""The Williams culture of doing things right and taking care of the environment is alive and well today thanks to Joe’s strong leadership and foresight.""Before taking the helm at Williams, Mr. Williams was executive vice president from 1968 to 1971 and president and chief operating officer from 1971 to 1978. When he became CEO, he was able to anticipate the challenges of the late 1980s and early '90s. By resetting goals and through restructuring, the company weathered a chaotic period in the pipeline and energy industries. Under Joe Williams’ leadership. Williams refined its investment strategy. It acquired Northwest Pipeline and embraced technology as Williams became the first to use satellite communications for field operations.In the late 1980s, Mr. Williams marshaled efforts to purchase the 29,000-acre Barnard Ranch, allowing Oklahoma’s fledgling Nature Conservancy to create its flagship sanctuary, the Tallgrass Prairie Preserve. It now encompasses 40,000 acres and is home to 2,500 bison which roam 23,500 acres of open range. It is also home to research of native grass species and wildlife.Story continues""Joe was the last family member to lead the company and felt a real stewardship responsibility with regard to that,"" said Keith Bailey, who succeeded Joe Williams and was chairman and CEO from 1994 to 2002. ""His personal passion revolved around his leadership of the Nature Conservancy, both locally and nationally. Perhaps his proudest moment I saw over the years was when he was awarded a ceremonial blanket by Chief Standing Bear to celebrate his role in the creation of the Tallgrass Prairie. That is a timeless legacy that only exists because of his commitment to making it happen.""Mr. Williams, who also served as chair of the state and then the national Nature Conservancy, was honored in 2015 for his work when the Conservancy renamed the Osage County treasure as the Joseph H. Williams Tallgrass Prairie Preserve.His legacy also is recognized at Tulsa’s Gathering Place. The main hall of the Williams Lodge, where community events and social functions take place, is named the Joseph H. Williams Community Room.He is survived by his wife, Terry, three sons and two stepdaughters; Joseph H. Williams, Jr.; Peter B. Williams; James C. Williams; Margot T. Rose; Jennifer B.

The investigation “revealed that individual engineers at the Seattle (office) recommended grounding the airplane while the accident was being investigated based on what they perceived as similarities between the accidents.”One engineer made a preliminary estimate that the chance of another Max crash was more than 13 times greater than FAA risk guidelines allow. An FAA official said the analysis ""suggested that there was a 25% chance of an accident in 60 days"" if no changes were made to the planes.“However, this document was not completed and did not go through managerial review due to lack of detailed flight data,” the report said.FAA officials at headquarters in Washington, D.C., and the agency's Seattle office opted not to ground the plane. “Instead, they waited for more detailed data to arrive,” the watchdog said in the report, which was made public Friday.The first Max crash occurred in October 2018 in Indonesia and was followed by the second in March 2019 in Ethiopia. In all, 346 people died.The FAA was the last major aviation regulator to ground the Max — three days after the second crash.The FAA did not let the planes fly again until late 2020, after Boeing altered a flight-control system that autonomously pointed the plane's nose down before both crashes.The inspector general’s office said the FAA’s caution on grounding the Max fit with its tendency of waiting for detailed data – an explanation that agency officials offered at the time.Story continuesStill, the watchdog recommended that FAA document how key and urgent safety decisions are made and make several other changes in how it analyzes crashes.The FAA said in a response attached to the inspector general’s report that it is committed to measures that will improve safety and has started to update procedures based on the Max tragedies.In a statement to The Associated Press, the FAA said it concurs with the inspector general’s recommendations and had already identified the issues outlined in the report.Safety advocates and lawmakers have harshly criticized the FAA for its decision to certify the Max — FAA officials did not fully understand the flight-control system implicated in both crashes. Congress passed legislation to reform the process of reviewing new aircraft.]"

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Best Small Cap Defense Stocks to Buy Now.Defense Stocks Are ""Creating Some Value Opportunities""On March 31 John Eade, president &amp; director of portfolio strategies at Argus Research, appeared in an interview on TD Ameritrade Network where he discussed the defense sector and the opportunities it is presenting. John Eade noted that though the defense sector has exhibited strong performance over the past couple of years, it has been underperforming in 2023 particularly due to concerns related to government spending and the impending debt ceiling issue. According to John Eade, defense contractors derive a significant portion of their revenue — roughly 50% to 80% — from contracts with the U.S. government. The uncertainty surrounding government spending and the risk associated with the debt ceiling have impacted defense stocks negatively and so they ""have pulled back, creating some value opportunities"". Here are some comments from John Eade:""You really did see them (defense stocks) take off about a year ago from now, when the Russian army invaded Ukraine. And at that point, we also started to see government spending on defense turn positive after several quarters of cutbacks. So I think the backdrop is there. These companies all generate a lot of cash flow, they pay decent dividends, they grow their dividends. And like I said earlier, when they pulled back from their 52-week highs, as they have here, that can be a good long-term buying opportunity.""John Eade likes companies that have exposure to both defense and commercial aerospace. Eade thinks these companies have ""extra fuel for growth"", since the commercial aerospace sector has still not recovered to pre-pandemic levels.John Eade talked about Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE:RTX) and said that ""it is one of the better growth stories"" in the space since it has exposure to both commercial aircraft and defense sectors. Argus has a Buy rating and a $115 price target on Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE:RTX). As of April 27, Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE:RTX) has gained 4.53% over the past 6 months and is offering a forward dividend yield of 2.37%.Story continuesJohn Eade also weighed in on Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT). He noted that Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) is offering one of the highest dividend yields among its peers and that the company has been ""growing its dividend at a high single digit rate"". John Eade expects Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) to grow its earnings over the next couple of years. Argus has a Buy rating and $500 price target on Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) and, as of April 27, the stock is offering a forward dividend yield of 2.58%.Finally, John Eade shared his thoughts on The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA). He noted that though The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) is struggling with profitability in its commercial aerospace business, the company's defense and airlines services business segments are doing well. Eade expects The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) to suffer losses in the first half of 2023, and then turn profitable in the second half of 2023. As of April 27, The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) has gained 43.24% over the past 6 months.While larger industry players like Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE:RTX), Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), and The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) garner attention, investors should also explore the potential of small-cap defense stocks. These often overlooked gems may present unique opportunities for investors seeking specialized exposure to the defense sector and also allow them to diversify within the sector.

Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Boeing (BA) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.Boeing currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.71, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 14 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.71 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 14 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 10 are Strong Buy, representing 71.4% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for BABroker Rating Breakdown Chart for BACheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Boeing here&gt;&gt;&gt;The ABR suggests buying Boeing, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABRAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Is BA a Good Investment?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Boeing, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has declined 201.6% over the past month to -$0.28.Analysts' growing pessimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates lower, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to plunge in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for Boeing. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, it could be wise to take the Buy-equivalent ABR for Boeing with a grain of salt.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on May 5. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis engineering, construction and operations company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.38 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +137.5%.Revenues are expected to be $3.53 billion, up 13.1% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 4.65% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Fluor?For Fluor, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -4.43%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Fluor will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Fluor would post earnings of $0.54 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.43, delivering a surprise of -20.37%.The company has not been able to beat consensus EPS estimates in any of the last four quarters.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Fluor doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAnother stock from the Zacks Engineering - R and D Services industry, Quanta Services (PWR), is soon expected to post earnings of $1.10 per share for the quarter ended March 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -19.7%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $4.08 billion, up 3% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Quanta Services has been revised 1.7% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of -2.28%, reflecting a lower Most Accurate Estimate.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Quanta Services will beat the consensus EPS estimate.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read  5 Best Dividend Stocks of 2023. Just when the stock market began recovering after suffering huge losses in 2022, the recent bank crisis drew the market into the vortex of uncertainty all over again. According to Federal Reserve’s March policy meeting, the Silicon Valley Bank fallout is likely to push the US economy into a mild recession later this year, as reported by CNBC. This is the first time in the high-interest rate cycle that staff economists have forecast such a recession. While this recent development sent global markets into a minor panic, investors are loading up on income-generating stocks to stay afloat during this period.High-interest rate periods generally fare well for dividend stocks as these securities tend to be more resilient due to their strong cash flows and solid balance sheets. Historically, dividend stocks have significantly represented the market’s overall return, especially during high inflationary periods. Since 1930, dividends accounted for 54% of the stock market’s total return whenever inflation has averaged 5% or more.Companies with consistent dividend hikes become top choices for investors because of their long-term growth potential and lower volatility. In fact, dividend growers have produced better returns than the broader market in the past. In 12 Dividend Kings To Buy For Safe Dividend Growth, we reported that dividend growers delivered an annual return of 9.62% on average from 1972 to 2018, compared with a 7.30% return of the S&amp;P 500. During this period, non-dividend payers underperformed dividend growers and delivered an annual average return of 2.40%.Dividend stocks are also less volatile than other asset classes because of their solid financials and proven track record of success. Investors who look for stable sources of income may be more likely to hold onto their dividend-paying stocks during market volatility, which can help stabilize the stock price and reduce volatility. Historical analysis has shown that dividend stocks have generated high returns with lower volatility over the years. From 1990 to 2022, dividend growers delivered a 9.3% return to shareholders with a 14.5% volatility. In comparison, non-dividend payers represented a 19.7% volatility during this period, while returning 4%, as reported by Capital Group.Story continuesAs dividend stocks are still gaining traction among investors, we have shortlisted some of the best dividend stocks of 2023 in this article. Overall, McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.

With every step-up in product complexity, over the past two decades, the competitive landscape has shrunk while gross margins have increased significantly. 5G represents another such step-up, which is likely to increase how much Skyworks can make per smartphone.

(NASDAQ:AMAT), compared with 67 in the previous quarter. These stakes have a collective value of over $3.78 billion.Davis Advisers mentioned Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) in its annual 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“If Berkshire represents “growing value” then Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) might be said to represent “undervalued growth.” Founded more than a half century ago, Applied Materials has grown to be the largest supplier of manufacturing tools, services and software to the semiconductor industry. Holding more than 15,000 patents, Applied has become the irreplaceable supplier to the critical global growth industry, semiconductors. Because this company’s earnings can be uneven, short-sighted investors often label this company as “cyclical” and assign it a relatively low valuation.We disagree and, having perused more than 50 years of data, conclude that Applied is unquestionably a growth company trading at a value price. Figure 8 shows the two sustainable drivers of this growth. The green bars indicate that semiconductor manufacturers have grown industry revenue at 7.5% over the last decade, more than three times the growth of the U.S. economy over this same decade. The orange line indicates that the percentage of this revenue that the industry commits to capital spending has gradually risen from roughly 20% to 30%. Putting these two trends together, it should come as no surprise that Applied has grown revenue at a rate of 11%, and operating income at more than 19% over this same time period.In the near term, the impact of the chip industry’s post-pandemic inventory correction, which could reduce equipment demand, may more than offset the benefit of recent supply chain issues that limited Applied Materials’ ability to meet customer demand. Longer term, geopolitical tensions between China and the U.S. are driving investment in potentially redundant chip production globally, while at the same time the U.S. and her allies are restricting export of leading edge production tools into China. Even though the near term is frustratingly veiled in uncertainty, the recent shortages and trade restrictions have firmly established that access to chip-production technology is essential to every major industrial economy. Given this, we see more opportunity than risk and estimate that Applied Materials could sell at about 10 times what the company could be earning three-to-five years from now.”9. A. O. Smith Corporation (NYSE:AOS)Year-to-date Returns as of April 28: 16.8%A. O. Smith Corporation (NYSE:AOS) is an American company that manufactures commercial and residential water heaters and boilers.

This is providing the company with new opportunities in weapon systems, space, avionics processing, and mission computing and embedded rugged services.Robust revenue contributions from the newly acquired businesses are expected to have aided MRCY’s top line in the to-be-reported quarter. Mercury Systems’ acquired businesses (5% of the total revenues) — Avalex Technologies and Atlanta Micro — cumulatively contributed $13.3 million to second-quarter fiscal 2023 revenues.Moreover, Mercury Systems' performance is expected to have benefited from its large pipeline of defense projects in the to-be-reported quarter. The company’s domain expertise in analog and digital integration helped it build a solid business relationship with defense prime contractors, thereby aiding it in winning new contracts.Story continuesIn the second quarter of fiscal 2023, Mercury Systems’ total bookings were $270.3 million, resulting in a 1.18 book-to-bill ratio. The company ended the quarter with a backlog of $1.12 billion, up $164 million on a year-over-year basis.

Price and EPS SurpriseAvnet, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Avnet, Inc. QuoteFactors to NoteAvnet's fiscal third-quarter results are likely to reflect high-margin expansion for its electronic components. Specifically, America and the EMEA are anticipated to have registered higher revenues, which typically generate high margins. This might have boosted AVT’s profitability in the to-be-reported quarter.With Farnell becoming the exclusive licensed distributor of the Raspberry Pi single-board computer, Avnet might have witnessed the continued engagement of existing customers and new customer acquisitions in the quarter to be reported. However, currency fluctuations are likely to have impacted the Farnell business in the third quarter.The company expects to witness solid demand across its Automotive, Transportation and Industrial segments. However, a slowdown in Asia is likely to have more than offset the benefits of the aforementioned factors. Moreover, Avnet’s overall third-quarter performance is expected to have been negatively impacted by constraints in product availability and pricing pressure.Story continuesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Electronic Component segment's revenues is pegged at $5.86 billion, suggesting a decrease of 2.7% year over year. The consensus mark for the Premier Farnell division's sales stands at $409 million, indicating a year-over-year decline of 12.8%.Headwinds related to the persistent inflation and persistent disruptions from supply-chain constraints might have weighed on the company's top-and-bottom-line performance in the quarter to be reported.What Our Model SaysOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Avnet this season.

170,10d07a18-c12e-3025-85be-4013330abf58,NKE,2023-04-29,Why Mary Dillon accepted the CEO role at Foot Locker after leaving Ulta Beauty’s corner office: ‘I didn’t realize how much I would miss having one big thing to focus on’,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-mary-dillon-accepted-ceo-103000613.html,1682677800,STORY,"['FL', 'ULTA', 'NKE']","[In her eight years as CEO of Ulta Beauty, Mary Dillon nearly tripled the cosmetics, hair care, and skin care chain’s sales and store footprint in one of the most successful runs in modern retail history. When she stepped down in 2021, Ulta’s revenue was at an all-time high of $8.6 billion. So Dillon, 61, could have chosen to relax and spend more time perfecting her tennis stroke, playing pickleball (her new passion), and sitting on corporate boards.More from Fortune:  5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from home Looking to make extra cash? This CD has a 5.15% APY right now Buying a house? Here's how much to save This is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home Instead, Dillon, unable to resist the challenge of restoring an illustrious company’s luster and still feeling too energetic for a slower-paced life, accepted the CEO job at Foot Locker last year, a retailer that, while not broken, has been underperforming for years. “I didn’t realize how much I would miss having one big thing to focus on and how much I would miss leading a retail company,” Dillon told Fortune in a March interview at the Shoptalk conference in Las Vegas. In taking another CEO role, Dillon became the third woman to ever run two Fortune 500 companies, after Patricia K. Poppe (CMS Energy and PG&amp;E) and Meg Whitman (Hewlett Packard and eBay).Much as she did at Ulta, which was weak in e-commerce and had too much product overlap with competitors when she took the reins in 2013, Dillon has set about differentiating Foot Locker from sports footwear rivals and improving its digital business. She was hired in large part to repair Foot Locker’s crucial relationship with Nike, which generated 65% of Foot Locker sales last year but which in 2022 said it would reduce its presence at the shoe store over time. (Foot Locker’s namesake corporate parent also owns and operates the Kids Foot Locker, Champs Sports, WSS, and Atmos chains.)Story continuesDillon, a brand-building guru and marketing data expert whose successes at Ulta include getting Estée Lauder to sell its luxury products at a strip-mall retailer, has called 2023 a “reset year.” She told investors in March that Foot Locker has “reestablished joint planning, as well as data and insight sharing” with Nike.This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.Fortune: Not even a year into retirement, you land the top job at Foot Locker. Was retirement not for you?I was so proud of creating an amazing group of leaders at Ulta to succeed me, and I felt it was time to hand over the reins to a team that was ready to rock and roll. But during the year I was executive chair of Ulta [mid-2021 to mid-2022], I didn’t realize how much I would miss having one big thing to focus on and how much I would miss leading a retail company.What did you imagine retirement would look like before leaving Ulta? I thought it would be a mosaic of things—a couple of board seats [including private equity firm KKR]. I wanted to get involved in some smaller startups, and the food industry is something I’ve always loved. I thought I would do that and maybe play pickleball, tennis, and travel. But I realized how much I miss running a company, and don’t laugh when I say this, but I’m not getting any younger. So I thought, “If I want to take another run at a company, now’s the time to do it.”But why Foot Locker? You’re going from beauty products to sneakers.Foot Locker might not be the most obvious place for me to show up, but there are many parallels between the sneaker and beauty categories. And there are parallels with Ulta. In 2013, the business was performing well, but we needed to go through an overhaul process to help Ulta hit its potential. Another similarity is that sneakers, like beauty, are a great growth category. They’re an $80 billion industry just in North America. There are tailwinds for sneakers, like mass casualization, fashion, and fitness. Foot Locker is also a more complex business than Ulta; there are multiple banners, and it’s global. It is time to really modernize and reinvigorate the brand and be an even better partner for our brand partners.Still, running shoes are very different from hair products and lip balm. How did you learn about this new-to-you industry and how to be that better partner?I’m still learning, and I will be a student forever because there’s so much innovation and newness in sneakers. Since I already understood retail companies with multiple brands, my approach has focused more on getting to know our brand partners. It doesn’t hurt that I’ve been a runner all my adult life. We just need to unlock this idea for people that Foot Locker is a place to meet all their needs. I love that a segment of our customers is sneakerheads.So what was Foot Locker not doing adequately before your arrival? One is all things digital. So we are about to start investing in a multiyear road map to modernize our tech infrastructure. We also need to develop our loyalty program, which has 500,000 members. (Ulta’s currently has about 32 million members.) Our e-commerce needs to be better and have less friction, whether you’re shopping on the app or the website, and we need better inventory visibility.Nike caused a stir in early 2022 when it said it would reduce business with Foot Locker, among other partners. What’s your approach there?This is a unique dynamic in the industry. I’ve spent a tremendous amount of time with everybody at Nike, who welcomed me into the industry. We’ve discussed the areas where we can focus on capabilities and building a road map. With Nike, it’s been about reestablishing and revitalizing our partnership with them. So we will differentiate our store brands more from one another and give all our brands a great platform, whether online or in stores. Our message is that we have a unique role to play for Nike and all brand partners. We can help drive category growth.What does that look like more precisely?We expect to be back on a growth trajectory with Nike soon and are focusing on a few key areas to collaborate. One is basketball, another is sneaker culture, and there will be more exclusives with Nike and other brands. We will go from having exclusives for Foot Locker be 15% of sales to 25%. But we also want to increase the mix of other brands, so we will grow with Nike but also brands like Adidas, New Balance, Puma, and Hoka.Could all this include selling sneakers as fashion items?All sorts of sneakers we sell are really fun to wear on the street and for different things, but we are not at that luxury price point. Down the road, who knows what we could experiment with, but that’s a different pricing tier.Since you departed from Ulta Beauty, the retailer has continued to thrive under Dave Kimbell. Why do you think that is?I am so proud of the leadership team. We worked hard to create a great succession. One of my biggest strengths is identifying great talent and giving them runway to grow. Dave is doing a great job, and Kecia Steelman started as head of stores and is now chief operating officer because she had so much runway. It’s amazing how they continue to slay it every day. I’m excited to be able to create a new chapter, hopefully, for Foot Locker as well. I think the aperture is wide to unlock the sneakerhead culture there.Get to know Dillon:While she runs shorter distances nowadays, Dillon qualified for the prestigious Boston Marathon in her first attempt at a marathon in Chicago in 2000.Before joining Ulta, Dillon was CEO of U.S. Cellular and McDonald’s marketing chief.Dillon cut her teeth in marketing at PepsiCo for 21 years, culminating in her appointment as president of its Quaker Foods division by the time she left in 2005.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. This means that investors who purchase Wells Fargo's shares on or after the 4th of May will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 1st of June.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.30 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed US$1.20 to shareholders. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, Wells Fargo has a trailing yield of approximately 3.0% on its current stock price of $39.75. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. So we need to investigate whether Wells Fargo can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow. View our latest analysis for Wells Fargo Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. Fortunately Wells Fargo's payout ratio is modest, at just 33% of profit.When a company paid out less in dividends than it earned in profit, this generally suggests its dividend is affordable. The lower the % of its profit that it pays out, the greater the margin of safety for the dividend if the business enters a downturn.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?When earnings decline, dividend companies become much harder to analyse and own safely. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. That's why it's not ideal to see Wells Fargo's earnings per share have been shrinking at 3.2% a year over the previous five years.Story continuesAnother key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. In the last 10 years, Wells Fargo has lifted its dividend by approximately 2.0% a year on average.Final TakeawayShould investors buy Wells Fargo for the upcoming dividend? Wells Fargo's earnings per share are down over the past five years, although it has the cushion of a low payout ratio, which would suggest a cut to the dividend is relatively unlikely. At best we would put it on a watch-list to see if business conditions improve, as it doesn't look like a clear opportunity right now.If you want to look further into Wells Fargo, it's worth knowing the risks this business faces.

Sentenced for a felony in 1988, he spent 32 years in the Louisiana State Penitentiary (commonly known as Angola). After a vacated conviction and amended charge, he was released in April 2021 on time already served.Embracing his second chance, Mr. Hingle found employment at VOTE (Voice of the Experienced), an organization dedicated to advocating and organizing for criminal justice reform. A short commute from his home in New Orleans, the job offered him the promise of reacclimating to society while earning a living wage for his family.Mr. Hingle and his wife owned two vehicles, but when a minor accident left them without the means to repair his car, they had to make do the best they could with only one. Commuting to his job became much more difficult, a situation that impacted his entire family.Thinking back on that time, ""it was a real strain on the family, being forced to share one car,"" Mr. Hingle recalled.​Mr. Hingle heard from a friend about the Fountain Fund which provides low-interest loans and financial coaching to formerly incarcerated people, helping them build credit and stabilize their finances.""It almost sounded too good to be true and I had a lot of questions,"" said Mr. Hingle.The Fountain Fund: Enabling Life-Changing OpportunitiesPaul Yates, Director of Economic Empowerment at the Fountain Fund is used to that type of skepticism. ""Our clients are used to hearing ‘no' every time they try to better their situation through things like loans,"" he explained. ""We don't tell them ‘no', we advise them on the specific steps they need to take. Many people tell us that it's the first time someone has believed in them, the first time someone trusted them. You can see the change in their confidence. They're so used to people saying no. We try to figure out how to get them to yes.""Story continuesAfter meeting with the Fountain Fund, Mr. Hingle was told he would be able to get a loan to repair his car. They offered him 24-month repayment terms with 3% interest, much lower than the typical 17-18% interest a bank would offer, if he could even qualify for a loan.""After a 32-year sentence, most places say you need at least two years of credit building and I couldn't qualify,"" said Mr. Hingle.In addition to loans, the Fountain Fund helps loan recipients by reporting their loan payments to the major credit bureaus to help people build credit. They also offer one-on-one financial coaching services and, when clients are ready, assistance with setting up saving accounts and opening credit cards. To date, the Fountain Fund has dispersed more than $1.5 million in small dollar amount loans, with more than $750,000 paid back and supporting additional recipients.For Mr. Hingle, the Fountain Fund helped set up his loan, ensured he had the ability to repay it, and made it seamless to make payments. With the loan secured, he was able to repair his car, easing his family's daily stress over their commute and giving precious time back for them to be together.Expanding access to credit and affordable small dollar loansThanks to recent grant funding from the Wells Fargo Foundation and CBA Fund, a CDFI intermediary, the Fountain Fund has been able to expand its credit building loans to New Orleans and other communities.As part of Wells Fargo's commitment to opening pathways to financial inclusion, Wells Fargo provided $1.65 million in grant funding to CBA Fund in 2021 to expand access to small dollar consumer loans which can help families reduce debt, build credit and savings, and start building wealth. CBA Fund was able to provide loan capital, capacity building grants and technical assistance to 14 nonprofit leaders, including Foundation Fund, ultimately helping hundreds of consumers like Mr. Hingle access safe and affordable credit to meet their short-term cash needs while helping establish or improve their credit scores.""[The loan] meant a lot,"" he explained. ""It took away unnecessary strain and worry around whose turn it would be to be late or how we would get our granddaughter to school. Today, I'm able to start off my day well, knowing I can get to work on time. The Fountain Fund put me back in a situation where I can live my life more freely without having to worry about transportation.""​For more information about CBA Fund and how it empowers life-changing organizations like the Fountain Fund, visit: https://www.creditbuildersalliance.org/cba-services/cba-fund/Wells Fargo, Friday, April 28, 2023, Press release picture""The Fountain Fund put me back in a situation where I can live my life more freely without having to worry about transportation."" - Anthony HingleView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Wells Fargo on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Wells FargoWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/wells-fargoEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Wells FargoView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/751860/Increasing-Economic-Opportunities-for-Formerly-Incarcerated-People]"

The company reported a loss of 74 cents per share in the year-ago quarter.Total revenues in the first quarter of 2023 were $520 million, increasing 21.89% year over year. The top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $523 million. Net product revenues in the year-ago quarter were $469 million, up 22.33% year over year, driven by the strong uptake of Seagen’s portfolio of marketed cancer drugs.In the past year, shares of Seagen have rallied 53.3% against the industry’s 6.8% decline.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchQuarter in DetailSeagen’s top line mainly comprises product revenues, collaboration and license agreement revenues and royalties. The company currently markets four drugs, Adcetris, Padcev, Tukysa and the newly approved Tivdak.Adcetris generated net sales of $243 million in the United States and Canada, up 34% year over year. The drug, which is the major contributor to SGEN’s revenues, is being evaluated in several label expansion studies.Padcev sales in the reported quarter totaled $119 million. Sales of the drug rose 18% on a year-over-year basis.Tukysa’s first-quarter net sales were $87 million, down 3% on a year-over-year basis.The newly launched Tivdak generated sales worth $19 million in the first quarter of 2023, reflecting a sequential increase of 5.6%. Seagen commercializes Tivdak in collaboration with Zai Lab Limited ZLAB.In September 2022, Seagen entered into an exclusive collaboration and license agreement with Zai Lab for the development and commercialization of Tivdak in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. ZLAB obtained exclusive rights to develop and commercialize Tivdak in the given territory.Collaboration and license agreement revenues were $21 million in the first quarter, marking a significant increase over the year-ago quarter. The uptick was primarily driven by higher royalties from Seagen’s partner, Astellas, for the sales of Padcev in the latter’s territory.Story continuesRoyalty revenues of $30 million rose by 7% from the year-ago quarter’s $28 million. Seagen records royalty revenues on the sales of Adcetris from Takeda Pharmaceutical in the ex-U.S. markets as well as from Polivy’s sales under its collaboration with Roche RHHBY.Polivy is an antibody-drug conjugate that uses Seagen’s technology and commercialized by Roche.Research and development expenses of $356 million increased 19.6% year over year, primarily driven by continued investment in the development of approved drugs and pipeline programs.Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 35.7% year over year to $236 million, mainly on account of higher costs related to the recent commercialization activities as well as costs incurred on other corporate activities, including $30 million in expenses associated with the pending acquisition by pharma goliath, Pfizer PFE.Seagen entered into a definitive agreement in March 2023 to be acquired by Pfizer for $229 per share, bringing the valuation of the company to a whopping $43 billion. The acquisition, if followed through, will add Seagen’s portfolio of antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) and technology to Pfizer’s already robust portfolio of oncology drugs. Seagen will gain access to Pfizer’s resources to continue the development of its ADC technology. Pfizer should be able to bring new innovative cancer treatment options to patients by combining Seagen’s prowess in ADCs with Pfizer’s existing portfolio across both solid tumors and hematologic malignancies, bolstering its position in the market and driving growth.Cash, cash equivalents and investments amounted to $1.5 billion for Seagen at the end of the first quarter of 2023.Seagen Inc.

But corporate directors might also want to pay attention.More from Fortune:  5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from home Looking to make extra cash? This CD has a 5.15% APY right now Buying a house? Here's how much to save This is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home Here’s a refresher: Dominion Voting Systems charged that Fox News anchors defamed the company when they repeatedly aired lies about Dominion’s voting machines, blaming the technology for Donald Trump’s defeat in 2020. Through sworn testimonies with Fox executives, it became clear that the news empire’s top brass did not believe the machines were rigged to steer the election. Rather than go to trial, Fox paid Dominion a stunning $787 million.But it isn’t only Fox News that might be held liable for spreading falsehoods. A Fox Corporation shareholder filed a lawsuit against four board members, including Rupert Murdoch and his son Lachlan, alleging the directors failed to provide proper oversight when they didn’t stop anchors from uttering the bizarre accusations.Normally, such lawsuits are a long shot, and many do not survive motions to dismiss. But the Dominion outcome may bolster this case and any looming challenges against Fox board members. After all, Murdoch himself later wished he’d put a stop to the conspiracy theories. That Fox’s calculations at the time appeared to be part of its business strategy, not just a failure of oversight, may open up new legal questions about such “Caremark” cases writ large.That last point could become a discussion that boards should follow. In the meantime, directors might be watching events like the Fox News case or SVB’s collapse, and the rise of ESG claims, and thinking about how well protected they are from legal woes. Even if you're not planning to spread crackpot theories designed to undermine U.S. democracy, you may want to revisit the terms of your Directors &amp; Officers (D&amp;O) insurance.Story continuesPeter Gleason, CEO of the National Association of Corporate Directors, says the success rate of shareholder lawsuits has remained “remarkably stable” over time, while the underlying issues have changed. Looking ahead, he says, board members could face legal challenges for failing to disclose or provide adequate oversight of matters like climate responsibility, cybersecurity, and human capital.Public company board members are obligated to have D&amp;O insurance. Private company board members, however, may want to rethink joining a board if D&amp;O isn’t offered, says Gleason. “Insist on D&amp;O insurance. The more, the better.”Finding the right policy for your company takes research, but Gleason shares some broad tips:- Find a broker who knows all the D&amp;O insurers and relevant trends. “In choosing an insurer, select one that can do specialized underwriting so that it focuses on your risks,” Gleason says.- If you have a claims-based policy, give timely notice of a lawsuit or potential lawsuit, and consider purchasing a ""tail"" to extend the time of notice.- Read and understand your policy, and see if any exclusions leave you vulnerable. If they do, “push back.”Lila MacLellanlila.maclellan@fortune.com@lilamaclellanThis story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

Users can also transfer crypto to their wallets at PayPal, which released a similar ability in 2022.Crypto transfers on Venmo will be irreversible, just like crypto transactions more broadly—a function of cryptocurrency’s use of blockchains, or immutable public ledgers. To roll out the transfer system, PayPal is partnering with Paxos, a crypto firm that specializes in stablecoins.“We’re excited to connect Venmo’s customers to the community, other wallets and exchanges, and we intend to continue to roll out additional crypto products and services in the year ahead,” PayPal said in its statement.The announcement from PayPal is one of the first drips of crypto updates from the payments giant since February, when it was reported that the publicly traded company was pausing work on its own stablecoin after reports that Paxos, its partner in the effort, was under investigation by the New York Department of Financial Services, a key player among U.S. cryptocurrency regulators.At the time, a spokesperson for PayPal told Fortune that the company was “exploring a stablecoin” and that if and when the payments giant moves forward, it will “work closely with relevant regulators.”Before the onset of Crypto Winter and the recent regulatory crackdown on the industry, PayPal was one of the more public crypto boosters among legacy fintech firms.In October 2020, the company announced that U.S. users of PayPal would be able to buy, hold, and sell Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin. One year later, the payments giant expanded the feature to Venmo customers.Story continuesAmid the crypto bull market of 2021, PayPal continued to build out crypto offerings. It let users pay merchants with cryptocurrency, partnered with Coinbase to allow those with PayPal-linked debit cards and bank accounts to buy tokens on the exchange, and expanded its crypto service beyond the U.S. to other countries, including the U.K.After the collapse of several prominent crypto firms in 2022, PayPal noticeably rolled back its public rhetoric on cryptocurrencies.

Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for International Business Machines The MethodWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$10.9bUS$10.2bUS$9.87bUS$9.69bUS$9.63bUS$9.64bUS$9.72bUS$9.83bUS$9.97bUS$10.1bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x2Analyst x1Est @ -3.46%Est @ -1.80%Est @ -0.64%Est @ 0.17%Est @ 0.74%Est @ 1.14%Est @ 1.42%Est @ 1.61% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 10% US$9.9kUS$8.4kUS$7.4kUS$6.6kUS$5.9kUS$5.4kUS$4.9kUS$4.5kUS$4.2kUS$3.8k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$61bThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 10%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$10b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (10%– 2.1%) = US$128bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$128b÷ ( 1 + 10%)10= US$49bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$110b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$127, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at International Business Machines as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 10%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.363. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for International Business MachinesStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings.Dividend is in the top 25% of dividend payers in the market.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Expensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Dividends are not covered by earnings.Annual revenue is forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. For International Business Machines, there are three additional factors you should assess:Risks: Be aware that  International Business Machines is showing  5 warning signs in our investment analysis , and 1 of those makes us a bit uncomfortable...Future Earnings: How does IBM's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

The bottom line also improved from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure of 8 cents. This can be attributed to higher-than-expected revenues from Reservoir Description.Core Labs’ adjusted revenues of $128.4 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $126 million by 1.9%. The top line also rose from the year-ago quarter’s recorded figure of $115.3 million. This can be attributed to the Reservoir Description segment’s impressive performance.Core Laboratories N.V.

QuoteSegmental PerformanceReservoir Description: Revenues increased about 7.2% to $80.2 million from $74.8 million in the first quarter of 2022. The top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $75 million. Operating income increased from $361,000 in the year-ago period to $2.4 million but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.2 million. This was due to the heavy impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict.Production Enhancement:  Revenues increased 19% year over year to $48.2 million from $40.6 million in the prior-year quarter. The same lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $52 million.Operating income of $3.3 million missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.04 million. The figure improved from the year-ago quarter’s reported loss of $918,000. The weak numbers could be attributed to lower-than-expected U.S. land completion activity.Financials and DividendAs of Mar 31, 2023, Core Labs had cash and cash equivalents of $16.3 million and long-term debt of $180.4 million. The company’s debt-to-capitalization was 47.4%.Operating cash stood at $3.2 million while capital expenditure totaled $2.2 million. This led to a negative free cash flow of $5.4 million.CLB’s board of directors approved a regular quarterly dividend of a cent per share on the company's common stock, payable on May 30, 2023, to all shareholders of record as of May 8, 2023.Story continuesGuidanceFor the second quarter of 2023, revenues are anticipated in the range of $130-$135 million.

Despite recession concerns, the supply-demand balance is expected to tighten throughout 2023.Zacks Rank and Key PicksCurrently, Core Labs carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

194,197bdcb3-4120-464f-b796-ba5b2f169123,TAP,2023-04-29,Why the market loves food stocks right now: Morning Brief,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-the-market-loves-food-stocks-right-now-morning-brief-130009538.html,1682686809,STORY,"['CMG', 'MCD', 'TAP', 'TAP-A', 'PEP', 'KO', 'HSY']","[This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can receive in your inbox every Monday to Friday by 6:30 a.m. ET along with:The chart of the dayWhat we're watchingWhat we're readingEconomic data releases and earningsThere is one trade being devoured by investors right now — and no, it's not shorting First Republic (FRC).It's the food trade.From restaurant stocks such as Chipotle (CMG) to servers of soda in PepsiCo (PEP) to hawkers of chocolate like Hershey (HSY), the market has fallen in love with food stocks. These have been some of the best-performing stocks this week.And investors are correct in bidding these names up, judging by how the first half of the year is shaping up for the sector.Consider some of the tailwinds for the food space:Inflation is slowing for input costs, which is great for margins.Resistance to rounds of price increases has been generally limited, which is also great for margins.Recovery stories are playing out in China for multinational names such as PepsiCo.""You may not be able to go out and get a new car,"" PepsiCo vice chairman and CFO Hugh Johnston said on Yahoo Finance Live (video above). ""You may not be able to go out and get a really fancy piece of technology. But you can afford a bag of Doritos, or you can afford a Gatorade Zero after you workout, or you can afford an energy drink in the morning.""Good point by Hugh.Do you ever look at how much you just spent on a bag of chips at a 7-11 or WaWa? Maybe, maybe not. But I would bet that bag of chips today is more than 10% higher in price than at this point last year. Maybe 20%, depending on the flavor.You may not have even realized it, but the CFOs of consumer food companies did, and their shareholders are loving it. Expect more price increases from these giants this year in part because consumers don't appear to care.A person dressed in a Hershey chocolate bar costume celebrates Halloween on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange shortly after the market's opening bell in New York October 31, 2014. REUTERS/Lucas Jackson (Lucas Jackson / reuters)Then there is another aspect of the food trade that is getting overlooked. While I will get ridiculed by my colleague Julie Hyman for this statement, I believe we are in the golden age of food innovation.Story continuesThe aforementioned Hershey is selling Reese's snack cakes. Where was that 20 years ago?Meanwhile, PepsiCo and Coca-Cola (KO) are in active rollouts of ready-made alcoholic drinks after years of avoiding the space. Beer company Molson Coors (TAP) has started to sell whiskey with success. And Conagra Brands (CAG) has made frozen food taste great for maybe the first time ever.Then there's McDonald's rethinking how they cook a burger (thank goodness), Starbucks selling drinks with one inch of thick ""salted caramel cold foam,"" and Papa John's launching a giant hot-pocket-like product this week that has a Doritos Cool Ranch coating.Even my local pizza joint just started selling ""hot honey"" chicken pizza. I went to a whiskey distillery last week and they are serving up whiskey infused with roasted coconuts.You may be laughing at all this as it's not similar to innovations at Tesla or Apple.But it is in fact innovation that helps drive higher price points on food and, over time, fatter profits and stock prices. Combine that with cooling inflation, and you have one heck of an earnings power story in the food sector.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 12 major stocks, including American Express Co. (AXP), Enbridge Inc. (ENB) and Micron Technology, Inc. (MU). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Shares of American Express have outperformed the Zacks Financial - Miscellaneous Services industry over the past six months (+7.6% vs. -2.5%). The company has adopted several growth initiatives, such as launching new products, reaching new agreements and forging alliances, are boosting its revenues. We expect the top line at $60.8 billion in 2023.Consumer spending on T&amp;E, which carry higher margins for AmEx, is advancing well. Its balance sheet looks strong with manageable debt. Solid cash-generation abilities enable the pursuit of business investments and capital deployment.However, with higher utilization of the company’s cards, expenses in the form of card member services and card member rewards are likely to strain the margins. Also, marketing and business development expense is expected to rise. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.(You can read the full research report on American Express here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Enbridge’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Production and Pipelines industry over the past six months (+4.3% vs. +4.1%). The company has the longest and most sophisticated oil and liquids pipeline system in the world, which spreads across 17,809 miles. Hence, a significant portion of the midstream operator’s earnings is generated from transportation operations, driven by a string of long-term contracts.ENB sanctioned C$8 billion of organic growth projects in 2022, bringing its total backlog to C$17 billion. The firm expects to put more than C$10 billion growth projects into service in 2024 and beyond. This is expected to generate significant EBITDA growth in the coming years.However, ENB’s significant debt exposure is concerning. ENB reported weak fourth-quarter results due to lower contributions from the Renewable Power Generation segment. Also, it has mostly been yielding lower dividends than the industry.  As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.(You can read the full research report on Enbridge here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Micron Technology have outperformed the Zacks Semiconductor Memory industry over the past six months (+17.0% vs. +14.9%). The company is witnessing growing demand for memory chips from cloud-computing providers and acceleration in 5G (fifth-generation) cellular network adoptions.Rising mix of high-value solutions, 5G adoption in Internet of Things devices and wireless infrastructure, enhancement in customer engagement and improvement in cost structure are growth drivers.Nonetheless, Micron near-term prospect looks gloomy as weakening consumer spending is negatively impacting demand for memory chips used in personal computers (PCs) and smartphones. Bit shipments for the DRAM and NAND memory chips may decline in the near-term as PC makers are adjusting their inventory due to weakened demand.(You can read the full research report on Micron Technology here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.

However, rising operating expenses are concerning as they are likely to keep the bottom line under pressure.Investments Aid AES Corp (AES) Amid the Rising InflationPer the Zacks Analyst, increased investments in renewables bolsters AES Corporation earnings growth prospects. Yet, the rising inflation resulting in increased expenses remains a bottleneck.Strength in End Market Aids Nordson (NDSN) Amid Forex WoesPer the Zacks analyst, Nordson will benefit from strength across its packaging and product assembly end markets in the Americas and Europe. However, forex woes are concerning for the company.New Products to Aid Wix.com (WIX) Amid Stiff Competitioner the Zacks analyst, Wix's performance is gaining from robust uptake of Wix Payments and other new e-commerce applications. However, stiff competition is a headwind.CRISPR's (CRSP) Dependence on Collaboration Revenues A WoeWhile CRISPR Therapeutics' pipeline progress is impressive, the Zacks Analyst is concerned about a lack of stable stream of income as the company has no marketed drugs in its portfolio.New UpgradesSports Betting Expansion to Boost Boyd Gaming (BYD) ProspectsPer the Zacks analyst, Boyd Gaming is likely to benefit from its interactive gaming platform, FanDuel partnership and expansion initiatives. Also, strength in Las Vegas business bode well.NuVasive (NUVA) Rides on Robust International BusinessThe Zacks analyst is impressed with NuVasive's robust growth in international business in Q4 led by the continued return of MAGEC and PRECICE titanium products.New DowngradesZumiez (ZUMZ) Witnesses Inflationary and Other HeadwindsPer the Zacks analyst, Zumiez's performance has been hurt by a tough operating environment, including inflationary pressures, a promotional landscape, increased costs and foreign currency headwinds.Rising Material Cost Hurts IPG Photonics' (IPGP) ProspectsPer the Zacks analyst, IPG Photonics is suffering from inflationary pressure on input costs.

197,4b458d04-1ed1-3cd1-a07d-0e4205676cfb,MKC,2023-04-29,4 Grocery Stocks to Buy Amid Ongoing Price Challenges,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-grocery-stocks-buy-amid-121112592.html,1682683872,STORY,"['CAG', 'GIS', 'MKC', 'LW', 'MKC-V', '^GSPC']","[U.S. GDP fell more than expected in the first quarter of 2023 as high inflation continues to slow down the economy. One of the biggest sufferers has been the retail sector, as sky-high prices have dampened consumer spending. This comes as the Fed gears up to increase interest rates next week.Amid these doldrums, people are spending cautiously on necessities and aggressively cutting down on luxuries. However, spending on basic necessities is almost unavoidable. Hence, grocery is one such section that is still showing growth although at a slower pace.Given this situation, stocks like Conagra Brands, Inc. CAG, McCormick &amp; Company, Incorporated MKC, General Mills, Inc. GIS and Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc. LW are likely to benefit in the near term.Grocery Sales Still GrowingRetail sales have been slowing at an alarming pace as people are aggressively cutting down on spending owing to sky-high prices. However, grocery sales are still up. According to the Mastercard SpendingPulse, U.S. retail sales advanced 4.7% in March on a year-over-year basis.This was down from February’s growth of 6.7%. Grocery has been one of the key drivers of retail sales lately. According to the report, grocery sales jumped 5.6% year over year in March.A separate report from Brick Meets Click/Mercatus Grocery Shopping Survey also showed a rise in online grocery sales. According to the report, online grocery sales totaled $8 billion in March.Since there is little room to reduce spending on necessities like food items, groceries have been the bright spot in the retail sector. Groceries fall under the consumer staples’ sector, given that they are basic necessities. Their demand is generally resilient to changes in the economic cycle. Companies in this fundamentally strong and mature category are thus defensive.Wholesale prices have declined lately, which is a sign of easing inflation. The Labor Department said earlier this month that Producer Price Index (PPI) fell 0.5% in March. This comes after it remained unchanged in the first two months of the year.Story continuesYear over year, PPI increased 2.7% in March, significantly less than February’s jump of 4.7%. However, signs of slowing inflation came a bit too late, and the economy had already taken a hit by that time, with U.S. GDP slowing more than expected in the first quarter.Preliminary data released by the Commerce Department showed that GDP grew a meager 1.1% in the first quarter of 2023, slower than expectations of a rise of 2%. Understandably, this is a tough year as GDP grew 2.6% in the final quarter of 2022. Moreover, the Fed is gearing up to increase borrowing rates by another 25 basis points, which would take the federal funds target to a range of 5% to 5.25%.This will further escalate borrowing rates. However, the groceries segment is unlikely to be affected much during these trying times, given its defensive nature. The Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR (XLP) has gained 5.7% over the past six months compared to the S&amp;P 500 Index’s growth of 1.6%.Our ChoicesGiven this situation, it would be wise to invest in these four food and grocery stocks. Each of the stocks carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Conagra Brands, Inc. is one of the leading branded food companies of North America. CAG offers premium edible products with a refined focus on innovation. Conagra Brands maintains a highly dynamic product portfolio and incorporates alterations within it, per the preference pattern of end-users.Conagra Brands’ expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 16.5%.

JPMorgan and Bank of America did not immediately respond to a voicemail and email seeking comment.The FDIC is preparing to place First Republic under receivership imminently, after the regulator decided the regional lender's position had deteriorated and there was not time to pursue a rescue through the private sector.If the San Francisco-based lender falls into receivership, it would be the third U.S. bank to collapse since March, following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank.

We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 82% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Target. Check out our latest analysis for Target ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Target?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.Target already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Target's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Target. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 9.3% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 7.4% and 7.2%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Story continuesA closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 22 shareholders have a combined ownership of 51% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of TargetThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our information suggests that Target Corporation insiders own under 1% of the company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$206m of stock. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 18% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Target. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Target better, we need to consider many other factors. Like risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   5 warning signs for Target   (of which 1 is a bit unpleasant!) you should know about.If you would prefer discover what analysts are predicting in terms of future growth, do not miss this free report on analyst forecasts.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

The metric beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 7%.The adjustments include certain non-recurring expenses/benefits like the amortization of acquired intangibles and acquisition-related expenses, among others.GAAP EPS in the reported quarter was $1.58, up 29.5% from the year-ago quarter’s EPS.RevenuesFiscal third-quarter revenues on a reported basis increased 29.2% year over year (up 31% at the constant exchange rate or CER) to $1.12 billion. The figure beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8.7%.Revenue growth in the quarter was backed by the better availability of the company’s sleep products to meet the underlying demand and solid growth across its broader product portfolio.However, year-on-year movements in foreign exchange, particularly the weaker Euro, negatively impacted revenues by approximately $20 million in the fiscal third quarter.ResMed Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseResMed Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | ResMed Inc. QuoteA Closer View of the Q3 Top LineTotal Sleep and Respiratory Care revenues improved 28.4% (up 31% at CER) from the prior-year period to $980.1 million.Total Sleep and Respiratory Care revenues in Europe, Asia and other markets rose 21.9% on a reported basis and 28% at CER to $351 million. Global Revenues comprised Total Devices revenues of $607.9 million, up 40.4% (up 43% at CER) and Total Masks and other revenues of $372.2 billion, up 12.7% (up 15% at CER), all on a year-over-year basis.Meanwhile, Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) revenues grew 35.3% to $136.8 million (up 9% at CER).MarginsThe adjusted gross profit in the quarter under review rose 24.7% to $626.1 million, despite a 35.5% uptick in the cost of sales (excluding the amortization of acquired intangibles).However, the adjusted gross margin for the fiscal third quarter was 56.1%, reflecting a contraction of 203 basis points (bps). This decrease can be mainly attributed to an unfavorable product mix and a higher component cost, partially offset by an increase in average selling prices.Story continuesSG&amp;A expenses rose 25.2% year over year to $228.5 million. Research and development expenses increased 14.4% to $76.4 million.The adjusted operating income was $321.2 million in the quarter under discussion, up 27% from the year-ago quarter. However, the adjusted operating margin contracted 51 bps year over year to 28.7%.Financial UpdatesResMed exited the third quarter of fiscal 2023 with cash and cash equivalents of $227.9 million, compared with $273.7 million at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Total debt (short and long-term) at the end of the fiscal third quarter was $1.59 billion compared with $775.2 million at the end of the fiscal second quarter.The cumulative net cash provided by operating activities at the end of the fiscal third quarter was $282.6 million compared with $117.4 million in the year-ago period.The company paid out $64.6 million in dividends in the fiscal third quarter.Our TakeResMed exited the third quarter of fiscal 2023 with better-than-expected earnings and revenues. The company recorded a robust sales performance in the quarter on increased demand for sleep and respiratory care devices. RMD’s acquisition of MEDIFOX DAN positively contributed to the reported quarter’s SaaS business revenues, registering continued organic growth.The organic growth of ResMed’s mask and accessory business is supported by the new patient flow and new patient growth and enhanced resupply programs to existing patients, fuelled by continuous core patient demand.Meanwhile, RMD continues expanding the base of its AirSense 11 platform worldwide by ramping up its production and availability. Despite persistent supply-chain constraints, ResMed established a foothold in its largest market for its connected sleep apnea therapy devices CPAP and APAP through the combination of AirSense 10 and AirSense 11.Meanwhile, escalating costs pressurizing the company’s operating margin are worrisome. A year-over-year increase in the fiscal third quarter’s SG&amp;A expenses was driven by a rise in employee-related expenses and travel expenditures.Zacks Rank &amp; Other Key PicksResMed currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Some other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are Edwards Lifesciences Corporation EW, Intuitive Surgical, Inc.

(ISRG) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this company have returned +17.8%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4% change. During this period, the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry, which Intuitive Surgical, Inc. falls in, has gained 2.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Intuitive Surgical, Inc. is expected to post earnings of $1.32 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15.8%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +1.3%.The consensus earnings estimate of $5.45 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +16.5%. This estimate has changed +3.9% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.32 indicates a change of +16% from what Intuitive Surgical, Inc. is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +4.3%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Intuitive Surgical, Inc.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for ISRG _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Intuitive Surgical, Inc. the consensus sales estimate of $1.73 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +13.7%. The $7.1 billion and $8.05 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +14.1% and +13.4%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryIntuitive Surgical, Inc. reported revenues of $1.7 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +14%. EPS of $1.23 for the same period compares with $1.13 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.59 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +6.88%. The EPS surprise was +3.36%.Over the last four quarters, Intuitive Surgical, Inc. surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Intuitive Surgical, Inc. is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Intuitive Surgical, Inc.

(NASDAQ:ISRG)?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buy-intuitive-surgical-inc-nasdaq-120042101.html,1682683242.0,STORY,['ISRG'],"[Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG) led the NASDAQGS gainers with a relatively large price hike in the past couple of weeks. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let’s examine Intuitive Surgical’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity. View our latest analysis for Intuitive Surgical Is Intuitive Surgical Still Cheap?According to my price multiple model, where I compare the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average, the stock currently looks expensive. In this instance, I’ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock’s cash flows. I find that Intuitive Surgical’s ratio of 79.03x is above its peer average of 37.69x, which suggests the stock is trading at a higher price compared to the Medical Equipment industry. If you like the stock, you may want to keep an eye out for a potential price decline in the future. Since Intuitive Surgical’s share price is quite volatile, this could mean it can sink lower (or rise even further) in the future, giving us another chance to invest. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.What kind of growth will Intuitive Surgical generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Intuitive Surgical's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 75%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has well and truly priced in ISRG’s positive outlook, with shares trading above industry price multiples. However, this brings up another question – is now the right time to sell? If you believe ISRG should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards the industry PE ratio can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on ISRG for some time, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its industry peers, which means it is likely that there is no more upside from mispricing. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for ISRG, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.Diving deeper into the forecasts for Intuitive Surgical mentioned earlier will help you understand how analysts view the stock going forward.

In this procedure, the surgeon removes the part of an enlarged prostate that is blocking the flow of urine.In the same action, the FDA cleared the da Vinci SP surgical system for transvesical approach to simple and radical prostatectomy using the da Vinci SP.In radical prostatectomy, the surgeon removes the entire prostate gland, most often for patients who have been diagnosed with prostate cancer.“The addition of simple prostatectomy and the transvesical approach to prostatectomy to the da Vinci SP clearances expands the existing urology indication for SP,” said Intuitive’s Chief Medical Officer Myriam Curet, M.D.“There is a growing body of clinical evidence on the use of the SP system, and we look forward to continuing our efforts to safely advance minimally invasive surgery,” said Curet.The da Vinci SP system provides surgeons with robotic-assisted technology designed for deep and narrow access to tissue in the body. The ability to enter the body through a single, small incision or through a natural orifice can provide a minimally invasive experience for complex procedures.The da Vinci SP system includes three, multi-jointed, wristed instruments and a fully wristed three-dimensional (3D), high-definition (HD) camera. The instruments and the camera all emerge through a single cannula and are properly triangulated around the target anatomy at the distal tip to avoid external instrument collisions that can occur in narrow surgical workspaces.Story continuesThe system enables flexible port placement and excellent internal and external range of motion (e.g., 360-degrees of anatomical access) through the single SP arm. Surgeons control the fully articulating instruments and the camera on the da Vinci SP system, which uses the same surgeon console as the da Vinci X and Xi systems.Da Vinci SP can be used in Japan and Korea for a number of procedures across several disciplines.The FDA has cleared SP in the U.S. for urology and transoral otolaryngology procedures, but it is not indicated for use in general laparoscopic surgery procedures.SP is part of Intuitive’s portfolio of surgical systems, now on its fourth generation of innovative technology. The da Vinci X and Xi are Intuitive’s multi-port surgical systems.About IntuitiveIntuitive (Nasdaq: ISRG), headquartered in Sunnyvale, California, is a global leader in minimally invasive care and the pioneer of robotic surgery.

Another government agency, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, weighs in with another statistic:Food waste is the single most common material found in landfills in the country.Decaying organic waste in landfills produces methane emissions, which rise into the atmosphere and contribute to the greenhouse gas effect. Reducing food waste would have a significant impact in reducing overall greenhouse gas emissions and the negative effects of climate change.Local food banks across Regions' footprint are helping to reduce food waste in our landfills while putting nutritious meals on family tables throughout our communities.For example, in 2022 alone, the Community Food Bank of Central Alabama (CFBCA) saved more than 7.7 million pounds of food from being discarded. In fact, reducing waste was a founding tenet of the organization.""When the Community Food Bank of Central Alabama was formed 40 years ago, it was at the request of leaders of local grocery, food distribution and produce companies,"" said Clyde Tisdale, Commercial Banking leader at Regions and member of the board of directors of the CFBCA. ""Those businesses recognized they were throwing away food, while people in the community were going hungry.""The CFBCA has maintained those close relationships with grocery companies. Of the 20 million pounds of food a year the organization receives today, half is donated by retail partners. This in-kind giving serves two purposes: helping to solve the hunger problem and reducing the environmental impact of food waste in landfills.Nicole Williams, chief executive officer at the CFBCA, emphasizes that sustainability is key.Story continues""Our fleet of refrigerated trucks is on the road five days each week picking up donated food from our retail partners to distribute throughout our 12-county service area in central Alabama,"" Williams said. ""The fresh produce, meats, dairy products and more are distributed to our neighbors experiencing food insecurity rather than wasted in landfills.""Reducing food waste is a priority for another Regions Foundation and Regions Bank-supported hunger-relief agency, Second Helpings. For 25 years that organization has put donated food to work by preparing nutritious meals for thousands of children and adults every day. The meals are distributed free of charge through local social service agencies in Greater Indianapolis.""At Second Helpings, we believe waste is wrong,"" said CEO Linda Broadfoot. ""In fact, that is one of our organizational principles. Whether it is food, money or people, we strive to put all resources to their best use and potential.""That commitment was evident during the 2022 College Football Playoffs, when Second Helpings rescued 18 tons of food that would have otherwise gone to waste. But that's just one example. Each year, Second Helpings rescues more than 3.6 million pounds of food.And this organization takes it one step further. Using that same rescued food, Second Helpings' Culinary Job Training program prepares adults with barriers to employment for careers in the food service industry. More than 980 adults have graduated from this program, which recently received a $20,000 grant from the Regions Foundation, a nonprofit primarily funded by Regions Bank.""Inflation has been hard for many families, with rising grocery costs and other expenses,"" said Broadfoot. ""It's more important now than ever that we eliminate as much food waste as possible, and instead use this food to create nutritious meals and stable jobs. This work is good for our neighbors and it's good for our planet.""Get Involved!Regions Bank and Regions Foundation support food banks across all our markets. Those community partners always need more volunteers to help rescue food and provide healthy meals for families.

(NYSE:SNA) makes and markets tools, diagnostics, equipment, software and service solutions for professional technicians. It is the top player in the U.S. tools industry thanks to an unmatched reputation among repair technicians, with customers valuing the companys high-quality products, as well as its exceptional customer service.The stock looks just as high-quality with a solid history of capitail gains, a good dividend and a fair valuation.SNA 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of SNAPeter Lynch Chart of SNABusiness model differentiationSnap-on's products and services are used by a wide range of professionals, including automotive technicians, mechanics, electricians, plumbers and HVAC technicians, but theyre not sold in retail stores. This allows Snap-on to provide personalized service and support to end-users. It also helps Snap-on avoid the retail challenges companies like Stanley Black &amp; Decker (NYSE:SWK) have had.Snap-on tools and diagnostic products are designed to improve productivity by helping customers complete repairs faster, a key advantage in the competitive repair industry, where speed and efficiency can make all the difference. Customers are willing to pay a premium for Snap-on's tools due to their durability, convenience and flexible financing options.Incredible brand traditionThe company was founded in 1920 by Joseph Johnson and William Seidemann, who began manufacturing and selling interchangeable sockets and wrenches. The business manufactured and marketed 10 sockets that would ""snap on"" to five interchangeable handles. The company's slogan was ""five do the work of 50."" They initially sold 500 sets. In the early years, Snap-on primarily sold its products through catalogs and direct mail, and later through industrial supply houses and automotive parts stores.In the 1930s, Snap-on began selling its products through its own network of company-owned stores, primarily in major metropolitan areas, reaching $1 million in annual sales in 1935. By the 1950s, Snap-on had expanded its network of company-owned stores to over 80 locations, and had begun to experiment with franchising as a way to expand its sales network further. By the 1960's, the company had launched the franchise program, offering them to entrepreneurs who wanted to operate their own mobile tool stores.Story continuesThe franchise program proved to be highly successful, and quickly became the primary way that Snap-on sold its products. Today, the company has over 4,600 franchisees operating mobile stores across the United States, Canada, Europe and other parts of the world. The initial fee for a Snap-on Tools franchise is between $8,000 to $16,000 with a total investment required ranging from $201,433 to $465,436 and on average, the franchisees earn north of $200,000 a year. It's a win-win-win for everyone.Stellar financial performanceFrom 2013 to 2022, Snap-on grew revenue from $3.2 billion to over $4.9 billion while nearly tripling its net income, which increased from $350 million to $943 million over the same period. More importantly, the company seems to have done everything right from a financial management standpoint. Its increased its dividend payment every year in the last decade, while at the same time buying back around 9% of shares outstanding, and growing retained earnings by $4.15 billion. That translated into $8.42 billion in market value, or $2 in growth for ever $1 retained.Snap-on had a strong finish to 2022, exceeding both expectations and the previous year's figures by posting earnings of $4.42 per share and a 4.2% increase in sales, and that finish continued with strong first quarter 2023 results. First quarter earnings per share was up again, beating estimates by $0.49 at $4.60 on revenue of $1.18 billion, which was up 7.8% year over year. The revenue beat by $50 million thanks to a 10% bump in organic sales.Barring some Artificial Intelligence breakthrough from competitors, these results have a strong likelihood of continuing as noted by Chairman and CEO Nicholas Pinchuk:""The results for the fourth quarter serve as more testimony to that fact, and they are an unmistakable demonstration of our continuing momentum. [...] Going forward, we believe we'll keep moving down our runways for growth, our wide runways for growth. [...] Our resilient markets do represent a significant opportunity, and we are there to take advantage up close and personal, like no one else, right where the jobs are done.""One of those runways is in the highly resilient automotive market:""The average age of vehicles continue to increase. The complexity of repairs is rising steeply as new platforms enter the vehicle park, and enter they have, starting in dealerships. And we have seen a resurgence in dealership projects despite a still recovering supply chain. Changes in internal combustion, the rise of electric vehicles and the expansion of vehicle autonomy have made dealerships eager for new equipment to support complex repair test of the evolving vehicle park.""Based on this optimism coupled with Snap-on's historical trend of meeting and exceeding expectations, I find it easy to anticipate continued growth as the company expands its professional customer base beyond automotive repair into adjacent markets and geographies.Priced near fair valueWith its forward price-earnings ratio of 15 trading just shy of its five-year average price-earnings ratio, the share price doesnt scream bargain basement. However, based on its current level of profitability, the company is likely to create at least $10 billion in net income over the next decade. That should translate into a minimum of $6.8 billion in retained earnings, which based on the last decade could easily mean adding another $13.6 billion in market value. I'd be shocked if earnings weren't much higher in 2033.It is also important to note that Snap-on's current quarterly dividend is greater than what was paid out just a decade ago. The dividend yield is now 2.32%. Given another 10 years with a similar growth outcome, today's investors could someday be earning roughly 10% a year just in dividends. With a solid financial position, including more than $800 million in cash and just over $1 billion in total debt, Snap-on looks poised for continued success.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

Witnessing increasing demand for wireless high-speed networks, the optimistic forecast of the sector is further fueled by growing trends of digitalization. However, the sector’s revenue growth potential still appears to be bleak at the current level.Despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic and other macroeconomic factors, the industry has grown over the past few years, driven by increasing demand for data and connectivity. However, the sector faces potential headwinds in the form of recessionary fears and evolving regulations, which may impact its growth trajectory in the future.Companies in the telecommunications sector are working to redefine their business plans to improve operational efficiencies, reduce costs, and support their employees and customers through various financial packages.Let’s look at some big telecom earnings releases and see if these can impact ETFs exposed to the space.AT&amp;T Beats Q1 Earnings Estimates, Falters on RevenuesOn Apr 20, AT&amp;T T reported first-quarter earnings for 2023, with adjusted earnings outperforming the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a couple of cents. Excluding non-recurring items, adjusted earnings were 60 cents per share compared with 63 cents in the year-earlier quarter.AT&amp;T's reported net income fell significantly year over year, despite top-line growth, due to lower other income. On a GAAP basis, net income was $4.18 billion or 57 cents per share compared with $4.76 billion or 65 cents per share in the same period last year.The company's Q1 GAAP operating revenues increased 1.4% year on year to $30.1 billion, with strong performances in Mobility, Mexico, and Consumer Wireline, although this was partly offset by a decline in Business Wireline revenues. However, the top line missed the consensus estimate of $30.3 billion.Story continuesThe solid Q1 results of the company were fueled by healthy wireless traction and customer additions. The company recorded solid subscriber growth backed by a resilient business model and robust cash flow position driven by diligent execution of operational plans. Focusing on 5G and fiber-based connectivity the telecom company aims to increase efficiency to lower operating costs.Verizon Beats on Q1 Earnings Despite Lower RevenuesThe bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny, but the top line of Verizon VZ failed to meet the consensus estimate. Excluding non-recurring items, quarterly adjusted earnings per share were $1.20 compared with $1.35 in the prior-year quarter.In the quarter, net income on a GAAP basis was $5.02 billion or $1.17 per share, up from $4.71 billion or $1.09 per share in the prior year. However, total operating revenues decreased to $32.91 billion from $33.55 billion due to lower wireless equipment revenues caused by a challenging macroeconomic environment and the shutdown of the company's 3G network. The top line missed the consensus estimate of $33.71 billion.For 2023, Verizon has confirmed its guidance, anticipating wireless service revenue growth of 2.5-4.5%, adjusted EBITDA of $47-$48.5 billion, and adjusted earnings per share of $4.55 to $4.85. Capital expenditure is expected in the range of $18.25 billion to $19.25 billion.ETF AngleIn the current scenario, let’s discuss the ETFs with a relatively high exposure to the companies discussed.iShares U.S. Telecommunications ETF (IYZ)This ETF provides exposure to U.S. companies that provide telephone and Internet products, services, and technologies.

The chip giant’s success can largely be attributed to this year’s hottest trend: Generative AI. The company is widely recognized as a leader in the field and seen as one set to benefit from increased adoption of the tech.In fact, with a view to next month’s F1Q earnings (May 24), Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore thinks all the hoopla around AI should result in a strong report.“We see a positive setup for NVIDIA in this quarter’s earnings, with checks indicating that the significant enthusiasm we’ve seen from AI adopters has translated into reacceleration for data center (DC) product,” the 5-star analyst said.Moore also sees the flagship AI chip H100 and the return of its predecessor, the A100, driving the quarter’s growth.Moreover, looking ahead, with Nvidia’s state-of-the-art AI/ML hardware solutions given a proper boost from all the enthusiasm around generative AI, over the next 5 years, the DC business should be responsible for much of the anticipated growth.But not only the DC segment. Moore also gives a shout out to Nvidia’s once main breadwinner – Gaming. After several quarters of declining growth, the segment showed signs it was coming back to life in FQ4 (January quarter) and with anticipated tailwinds from 40-series product over the course of the year, Moore sees an “opportunity for the company to reaccelerate growth in the gaming business.”Down to the nitty-gritty, what does it all mean for investors? Moore currently rates the shares as Overweight (i.e., Buy) while his $304 price target suggests they will be changing hands for a 10% premium a year from now. (To watch Moore’s track record, click here)Let’s turn our attention now to the rest of the Street, where based on 30 Buys 7 Holds, and just a single Sell, NVDA currently carries a Strong Buy consensus rating. Although with an average price target of $286.94, the analysts project a modest 4% upside over the coming months.

XRAY is scheduled to release first-quarter 2023 results on May 3, before the opening bell.In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings beat estimates by 43.75%. It delivered an average negative earnings surprise of 5.75% in the past four quarters. Q1 EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $930.6 million, indicating a 3.6% decline from the year-ago quarter’s number. The same for earnings stands at 33 cents per share, indicating a 36.5% decline from the prior-year period.Factors to NoteDENTSPLY SIRONA’s Technologies &amp; Equipment segment is likely to have witnessed organic growth in the quarter under review. Higher demand for clear aligners and imaging equipment is expected to have driven the segment’s sales growth, partially offset by weakness in CAD/CAM.Soft demand in China and the United States might have hurt the Consumable segment’s sales. However, recovering demand for preventive consumables is likely to have provided some support.Foreign currency movement had a negative impact on total revenues during the fourth quarter. The trend is likely to have continued in the first quarter as well.On its fourth-quarter earnings call, XRAY’s management stated that it is encouraged by double-digit growth in clear aligners, solid performance in Europe and continued strong demand for Imaging equipment.However, continued macroeconomic headwinds, including foreign currency impacts, global supply chain challenges, and regional softness in China and the United States may have offset the abovementioned growth. The company is expected to provide updated view on macro headwinds and business performance on its first-quarter earnings call.Gross margin and adjusted earnings per share are likely to have been adversely impacted by inflationary pressures.DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc.

This CD has a 5.15% APY right now Buying a house? Here's how much to save This is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home Here’s a refresher: Dominion Voting Systems charged that Fox News anchors defamed the company when they repeatedly aired lies about Dominion’s voting machines, blaming the technology for Donald Trump’s defeat in 2020. Through sworn testimonies with Fox executives, it became clear that the news empire’s top brass did not believe the machines were rigged to steer the election. Rather than go to trial, Fox paid Dominion a stunning $787 million.But it isn’t only Fox News that might be held liable for spreading falsehoods. A Fox Corporation shareholder filed a lawsuit against four board members, including Rupert Murdoch and his son Lachlan, alleging the directors failed to provide proper oversight when they didn’t stop anchors from uttering the bizarre accusations.Normally, such lawsuits are a long shot, and many do not survive motions to dismiss. But the Dominion outcome may bolster this case and any looming challenges against Fox board members. After all, Murdoch himself later wished he’d put a stop to the conspiracy theories. That Fox’s calculations at the time appeared to be part of its business strategy, not just a failure of oversight, may open up new legal questions about such “Caremark” cases writ large.That last point could become a discussion that boards should follow. In the meantime, directors might be watching events like the Fox News case or SVB’s collapse, and the rise of ESG claims, and thinking about how well protected they are from legal woes. Even if you're not planning to spread crackpot theories designed to undermine U.S. democracy, you may want to revisit the terms of your Directors &amp; Officers (D&amp;O) insurance.Story continuesPeter Gleason, CEO of the National Association of Corporate Directors, says the success rate of shareholder lawsuits has remained “remarkably stable” over time, while the underlying issues have changed. Looking ahead, he says, board members could face legal challenges for failing to disclose or provide adequate oversight of matters like climate responsibility, cybersecurity, and human capital.Public company board members are obligated to have D&amp;O insurance. Private company board members, however, may want to rethink joining a board if D&amp;O isn’t offered, says Gleason. “Insist on D&amp;O insurance. The more, the better.”Finding the right policy for your company takes research, but Gleason shares some broad tips:- Find a broker who knows all the D&amp;O insurers and relevant trends. “In choosing an insurer, select one that can do specialized underwriting so that it focuses on your risks,” Gleason says.- If you have a claims-based policy, give timely notice of a lawsuit or potential lawsuit, and consider purchasing a ""tail"" to extend the time of notice.- Read and understand your policy, and see if any exclusions leave you vulnerable. If they do, “push back.”Lila MacLellanlila.maclellan@fortune.com@lilamaclellanThis story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

President and CEO Jennifer Rumsey recently visited Spain to tour the new Accelera by Cummins electrolyzer manufacturing facility under construction there, meeting with employees as well as government and university leaders during her visit.Electrolyzers are critical technology for producing no-carbon, green hydrogen. Green hydrogen could play a crucial role in global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.The action-packed day commenced in Madrid with two meetings with the Vice President of the Spanish Government and Minister for Ecological Transition, Teresa Ribera, and the Secretary General for Industry, Francisco Blanco, who spoke about the future of the hydrogen market, the public funding landscape, and the timeline and regulatory factors required to make that future a reality, as well as proposed future legislation to reduce on-highway emissions.The day continued with a tour of the plant site in Guadalajara to see the progress that has been made in a relatively short amount of time. Just five months after breaking ground, the building is starting to take shape. Rumsey also met with the team working at the facility, where she said she found their energy and enthusiasm inspiring.When making such a significant investment, it is important to work in partnership with communities, public authorities and academia. One of the main purposes for Rumsey's visit was to sign a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the University of Alcalá de Henares at City Hall in Guadalajara. The University of Alcalá is close to the Accelera by Cummins manufacturing site and shares the business segment's goal of making a positive impact on communities, people and the environment.The MoU establishes a general framework of cooperation and coordinated action between the parties with the objective of promoting cultural, educational and training activities of common interest. How Accelera by Cummins trains the employees working at the plant is vital to the new facility's future success.Story continuesThe clean-tech jobs and related skills at the new plant will help Europe do its part to address climate change and achieve the aims of the Paris climate agreement. They also align with Cummins' Destination Zero product decarbonization strategy. The power of partnerships is critical to achieving Cummins' decarbonization efforts, and that theme was very present throughout Rumsey's trip.Cummins Inc., Friday, April 28, 2023, Press release pictureCummins President Jennifer Rumsey (second from right) meets with university officials during her recent visit to Spain.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Cummins Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Cummins Inc.Website: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/cummins-incEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Cummins Inc.View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/751910/Cummins-CEO-Visits-Electrolyzer-Plant-Under-Construction-in-Spain]"

(AP) — Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis hoped his first international trade mission would generate lucrative business deals and boost his foreign policy resume ahead of an expected presidential run. Instead, he faced questions about losing ground to former President Donald Trump and being taken to court by Walt Disney World.The trip reflected the intensifying pressure confronting DeSantis as some of his allies grow increasingly anxious about his White House prospects. Within a few short years, he rose from relatively a relatively obscure congressman to Trump's leading Republican rival by embracing the former president's cultural grievances without the constant tumult.But it turns out DeSantis isn't immune from drama. Facing questions this week about his standing within the GOP and his fight with Disney, he's sometimes appeared agitated, reinforcing concerns within corners of his own party about his readiness for the rigor of presidential politics. Some in the GOP said that rather than burnish his image as a fighter, the confrontation with Disney over an anti-LGBTQ law and the theme part's right to self-govern is becoming a distraction.“My goal would be for this spat to end. They’ve been our longtime partner,” said Republican state Sen. Joe Gruters, the immediate past chair of the state GOP and a Trump supporter. “We should be focused in a positive way on helping our job creators.”Speaking in Israel, DeSantis expressed confidence in his actions and showed no sign of letting the Disney issue go.“I don’t think the suit has merit, I think it’s political,” said DeSantis, whose political team has used the Disney fight to raise money. “The days of putting one company on a pedestal with no accountability are over in the state of Florida.”The fight has been going on for more than a year. It began when Disney spoke out against legislation that would prevent discussion of sexual preference and gender identity in grades K-3. DeSantis responded by accusing Disney of being “woke” and calling lawmakers to Tallahassee to punish Disney by stripping it of a decades-old right to make development and expansion decisions on its own.Story continues“There's a new sheriff in town,” DeSantis said last year when he announced plans to get back at Disney. And in his new book, he boasted about outsmarting the company.But some are questioning who is outsmarting whom as Disney waited until the governor was out of the country before suing him, claiming that he's retaliating against the state's largest private employer for simply speaking an opinion.Democratic state Sen. Linda Stewart, whose district is near Disney, said she understands that DeSantis made big headlines when he first stood up to Disney, and that it rallied his core supporters. But the longer the feud drags on, the more it could backfire.“I’m betting on Disney. They probably have more money and lawyers than the state of Florida,” Stewart said. “As he progresses on, people are getting mad at him. The citizens of Florida do not like him going after family-friendly economic development for the community. People don’t want government involved in business.”Stewart says DeSantis' anti-Disney comments are getting more petty. The governor this month pointed out that the Disney district the state took over controls a lot of undeveloped land. He told reporters the land could go to a prison, a competing theme park or some other project.“Really? A prison? A nuclear plant? A new theme park? I mean, what kind of rationale is he putting out there?” Stewart said. “It doesn’t even make any sense.”DeSantis is eyeing a presidential campaign launch once the state legislature wraps up its session next month. As that moment nears, public familiarity with the governor is improving. Just 24% of U.S. adults say they don’t know enough to rate him in the April AP-NORC poll, compared with 30% in October and 42% in July 2021.Still, that increased familiarity has translated almost entirely to increased negative views toward DeSantis: 45% have an unfavorable view of him, up slightly from 40% in October and 30% in July 2021.Overall favorable ratings for DeSantis have largely remained the same: 31% say they have a favorable opinion of him in the new poll. Unfavorable ratings, however, are concentrated among Democrats.Among Republicans, 63% now say they have a favorable view of DeSantis, a tick up from 57% in October. The shift is concentrated among moderate and liberal Republicans, who have grown more familiar with him.With that shift, favorable ratings of DeSantis (63%) and Trump (68%) are largely similar among Republicans. Trump's unfavorable ratings are slightly higher than DeSantis' (30% vs 20%), while more say they are unfamiliar with DeSantis than Trump. Overall, about half of Republicans say they have a favorable view of both men.There's an open question of whether the continuation of the Disney fight will dent DeSantis' political standing. Now that it's in court, the lawsuit will keep popping up in headlines if DeSantis eventually enters the presidential race.DeSantis' own U.S. senator and predecessor as governor, Republican Rick Scott, told Fox Business he agrees with DeSantis on the law Disney spoke out against, but he said he hopes the feud will die down.“What I hope is that cooler heads are going to prevail here,"" Scott said Wednesday. “We’ve got to figure out how to solve this problem, how to make sure Disney continues to grow in our state, how Disney continues to invest and add more jobs.”___This story has been updated to correct that 31% of respondents in the April AP-NORC poll have a favorable opinion of DeSantis.]"

In 2016, he offered mobile data for free, making his Jio telecom service India's top player.

Its shareholders also include Paramount Global as well as Bodhi Tree, a joint venture between James Murdoch and former top Disney executive, Uday Shankar.The Warner deal, industry executives and media analysts said, will boost Viacom18's already announced plans to ""innovate and disrupt"" the sector, and help to attract the premium English speaking audience in India.At stake is a slice of a video streaming market that is expected to grow annually by 22%-25% to reach $13-$15 billion by 2030, according to a 2021 report by Indian lobby group CII and the Boston Consulting Group.Story continuesThat compares with projected annual growth of 8.63% in the U.S. market, which is expected to hit $54.66 billion by 2027, according to Statista.While Netflix and other rivals boast of content specially created for the India audience, JioCinema's current free offerings largely include old Hindi and local language movies. In sports, it has IPL cricket streaming rights until 2027 and in March bagged exclusive rights for MotoGP in India.The big challenge is lack of fresh local and global content on JioCinema, something that will be become even more critical as the IPL season ends next month.JioCinema is in talks with various production studios and has plans to introduce dozens of TV shows and movies on the platform in the coming months, in Hindi and other languages, a second industry source told Reuters on Friday.""There are many Indias within India. While IPL is for the masses, partnership with Warner is a precursor to JioCinema's entry into the premium subscription segment,"" said Mihir Shah, vice president at Media Partners Asia.Nitesh Kripalani, former country head of Amazon's Prime Video in India, said he expects Reliance's venture to do more such deals, but pricing remains key.""India is a value conscious market. For any media business, anywhere in the world - you need to get consumers to pay. Advertising can only pay so much,"" he said.Netflix, Amazon and Disney Hotstar have become popular in India by launching exclusive movies and web series starring Bollywood actors. They have also diversified into regional local language content.At present Netflix - which has most the expensive subscription plans - has just 8 million subscribers, Amazon has 17 million, while Disney, which earlier had the digital rights for IPL, leads with 49 million, according to Media Partners, which doesn't have data for JioCinema's free service.Karan Taurani, a vice president of India's Elara Capital, sad JioCinema's success will hinge on quality of its content.""They may make so many films and series but (what if) more than 70-80% of them bomb? The only way to scale up is to really differentiate your content and make sure execution is right,"" he said. (Editing by Sharon Singleton)]"

Welcome to today's Colgate-Palmolive 2023 First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded and is being simulcast live at www.colgatepalmolive.com. Now for opening remarks, I'd like to turn this call over to Chief Investor Relations Officer and Senior Vice President, M&amp;A, John Faucher.John FaucherThanks, Allison. Good morning, and welcome to our 2023 first quarter earnings release conference call. This is John Faucher. Today's conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from these statements. Please refer to the earnings press release and related prepared materials and our most recent filings with the SEC, including our 2022 annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings, all available on Colgate's website, for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. This conference call will also include a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, including those identified in Table 6 of the earnings press release. A full reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings press release and is available on Colgate's website. Joining me on the call this morning are Noel Wallace, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Stan Sutula, Chief Financial Officer. Noel will provide you with some thoughts on our Q1 results in our 2023 outlook. We will then open it up for Q&amp;A. Noel?Story continuesNoel R. WallaceThanks, John, and good morning, everyone. As you can tell from our press release and the earnings materials, we had a strong start to 2023, and the momentum on our business gives us confidence to raise our net and organic sales growth guidance and to raise the lower end of our base business earnings per share growth guidance for the year. We did this because with the quarter of the year gone, we see less risk from some of the macroeconomic and geopolitical issues that we were concerned about earlier in the year. That said, there is still notable uncertainty surrounding the balance of the year, particularly in the second half. Since the commentary focuses on the results, I want to focus my remarks on 3 of our priorities that Colgate people are focused on. Priority 1 is driving organic sales growth as we face tougher comparisons. We will utilize our enterprise-wide capabilities in innovation and revenue growth management, along with a firm commitment to marketing spending to return to a balanced algorithm of pricing and volume growth. The pricing we have taken over the past 2 years helps provide us with the flexibility to fund increased brand investment to support our pricing, build brand health, and drive volume and household penetration. We know that the competitive environment is going to be difficult, but we have a brand portfolio that is built for times like these, and we look forward to driving growth and market share performance moving now. Priority 2 is delivering our productivity to fund the brand investment, while we're also delivering on our earnings targets. We had a strong start to the year for both funding-the-growth and our 2022 global productivity initiative and we are laser-focused on delivering against or exceeding our goals for the year. We still foresee year-over-year headwinds to earnings per share growth from raw and packaging materials, foreign exchange and below-the-line items, so driving productivity in the middle of our P&amp;L is vital. And finally, we are focused on improving our cash flow performance. Again, we had a strong start to the year with both operating cash flow and free cash flow up and we know there is still opportunity for further improvement. We will utilize this cash flow to fund the growth in capital expenditures to return cash to shareholders through dividends and to drive earnings leverage through paying down debt and repurchasing shares. So I'm pleased with how we started the year, but I'm also well aware of the challenges and uncertainty ahead of -- for us. Colgate-Palmolive, however, has the brands, the capabilities and the people to deliver in this environment. So with that, I'll take your questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question today will come from Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley.Dara Warren MohsenianSo clearly, strong top line results in Q1, but we're also obviously in a period of outsized pricing. And the question is sort of where do we land as the pricing trails off. So just a -- just can you discuss your confidence that volume will recover going forward as pricing drops off? I know, it's a bit of an unanswerable question at this point, but how do you think about that dynamic ahead of time and manage your business to drive sustained volume growth as you look out longer term? And be -- maybe as a bit of a window into that performance when category pricing drops off, can you just talk about your market share performance in Q1 in some of your key regions and product categories and if the strategies are working in terms of driving improved market share trends?Noel R. WallaceYes. Thanks, Dara. Let me come back again to the strategy that we've been deploying over obviously the last couple of years and continues to execute against the initiatives that we've talked about, particularly at CAGNY, and that's driving the core and adjacencies and channels. And you see the progress we're making against all 3 of those, obviously delivering sequential volume growth in the quarter. So we had 5 of the 6 divisions sequentially up in the first quarter. North America was down, but if you pull the Fabuloso recall out of the North America business, North America would have been up sequentially as well. And all of this plays back to our belief that the strategy clearly is working to deliver improved volume despite the fact that we continue to take significant pricing across all of our geographies and our categories. So quite frankly, we're very pleased with the progress we're seeing, and we expect sequential volume improvement as we move through the year to go far. Now that is contemplated on a consumer environment that remains where it is. We shall see where the consumer goes relative to the level of inflation being absorbed in the marketplace, but we feel strongly that we've got the right portfolio of brands across price points, the right innovation, the right channel strategies, particularly where consumers are shopping today to continue to drive growth. Importantly, as we saw in the quarter, our Oral Care business was up double digit, and that's both positive pricing and positive volume in toothpaste, and we saw good share growth in the first quarter on toothpaste in North America. Good -- very strong share growth across Europe. Flat shares in Europe -- excuse me, in Latin America, and good share growth in Asia. So overall, we feel good about where we are from a consumption standpoint and the strategies that we're executing and expect sequential volume improvement as we move through the back half of the year. And as you said, pricing will get more challenging as we lap the back half. And certainly, in the second quarter, which was a strong quarter for us, where we had strong pricing and volume in that quarter, we'll expect a little bit of pullback from there. But overall, we feel good about the momentum we're behind the business right now.Operato.OperatorROur next question today will come from Filippo Falorni of Citi.Filippo FalorniCan you talk about the consumer health in your key emerging markets? What are you seeing in terms of response to recent price increases? And then as you mentioned, like the second half, obviously, a lot of uncertainty. Maybe can you compare and contrast how do you see the consumer environment evolving in emerging markets compared to your more developed markets like the U.S. and Europe?Noel R. WallaceYes. Emerging was strong. You saw obviously double-digit organic in the quarter. Sequentially, again, volumes performing better than they did in the first quarter. And if you look at the pricing that we've taken in emerging markets, over the last 3 quarters, quite frankly, we're pretty pleased with the fact that the volume sequentially continues to improve. Now that being said, we've got strong innovation in emerging markets and you've seen the level of advertising that we're putting back into the business. That gives us, again, confidence that we're able to sustain that advertising as we move into the back half of the year, and we intend to continue to do everything we can to increase that advertising support in the back half, particularly in emerging markets in order to: one, support the innovation we have; second, drive the pricing into the market and continue to accelerate volume growth in the category. So overall, emerging pretty good. We were really pleased with the progress in both Latin America, Africa and Asia, particularly in China, strong growth in all 3 of those regions, particularly in the key markets of Mexico, Brazil and China and South Africa. So good progress across emerging markets and shares holding up a little more elasticity as you would expect, even the level of pricing that we've taken in emerging markets. But overall, we feel pretty good about where we stand in that regard. As it relates to the second half, time will tell. As I mentioned upfront, we'll see the compounding impact of pricing across many categories as we move into the back half. And I expect a better balance between pricing and volume as we move through the back half, but we shall see. The good news is we've got strong innovation. We've got the pricing in the P&amp;L, which is really important in order to get the flexibility that we need to drive the business in the back half of the year. And we feel we've got a good channel strategy to ensure, as I mentioned upfront, that we're capturing the omnichannel impact of how consumers are shopping today.OperatorNext question will come from Peter Grom of UBS.Peter K. GromSo, I appreciate all the commentary on inflation in the prepared remarks. But maybe as a point of reference, Stan, is the $300 million to $400 million headwind that we discussed on the last call, is that still a reasonable range? And I guess what I'm trying to get at is the dollar impact from the 770 basis point headwind in the bridge, this morning would put you pretty close to that range from a dollar perspective. So -- and I realize there's more than just inflation in that line. But is there just any way to frame either what inflation was within that number? Or how to think about that component of the bridge more broadly as we move through the balance of the year?Stanley J. SutulaYes. Thanks, Peter. So first, as we look at that inflation level, that $300 million to $400 million range is still the range that we're seeing on commodities. But there's really a tail underneath this. And in particular, around ag that affects predominantly Hill's, those prices still remain elevated. We don't see a lot of relief coming on those, and we see that kind of continuing as we go through the year. That's the main driver of our range, which is why we haven't seen it come down more. If you look at the other categories, like we do for toothpaste, Home Care, Oral Care and Personal Care, those have moderated more, and that was reflected in our guidance for the year, and they stayed reasonably balanced. So as we look out, remember, we're essentially locked in here for Q2. We have locking already in place for Q3 and a little bit less for Q4. I still see that as the viable range going into the back end of the year. Now what happens is on a year-on-year impact, we wrap around on the very significant increases last year. The pricing that we've taken helps to moderate this and then as you saw, we had an exceptionally good start to funding the growth this year, and that has also helped to mitigate that. That gives us the confidence to say that we will increase margins as we go through the year despite the fact that we expect that the commodities are still going to be in this range due to inflation.OperatorThe next question will come from Kevin Grundy of Jefferies.Kevin Michael GrundyGreat. And congrats on a strong result year. No, question for you on reinvestment. So obviously, strong results here. You guys are getting the top line payback that you'd hope for. You're seeing gross profit come through. You've made it a point since you come in -- since you came in this increased advertising levels, and see that the advertising and marketing as a percent of sales was high even by historical standards. That's a good thing, of course. How are you thinking about reinvestment levels should you exceed on gross profit? Number one. And then number two, realizing that it's top line payback and profit growth that's sort of driving the decisions and not necessarily as a percent of sales, but are you comfortable with where you are? I mean, it's high, 12% of sales is high relative to historical standards, which dipped to 9% at -- if we go back here year to '15, '16. How are you thinking about that? How should we think about that as gross margin begins to improve?Noel R. WallaceSure. Thanks, Kevin. Yes, we're really pleased with the level of advertising we're getting in the P&amp;L, and that is obviously driven by the circular nature of how we're driving the business, obviously, more advertising is driving the top line, and we're able to get more leverage to the P&amp;L to continue to support that. And we feel as we move out getting the pricing in the P&amp;L was critically important to sustaining and increasing our levels of advertising. We've obviously moved more money into digital. We're seeing great ROIs on digital and our programmatic and the personalized content that we're delivering in the market. We're seeing growth in market shares relative to where we're spending the money, particularly around the Hill's business, and our Oral Care and Skin Health businesses. So we're really pleased with the fact that the advertising levels continue to deliver against the expectations that we have. And we balance that off with obviously a broad portfolio of offerings that we think are attracting and building the brands that we speak. We have high household penetration, with many of the brands around the world, our ability to drive reach and continue to sustain that reach is very, very important to the growth that we're seeing in the business. As we look forward, we would anticipate to continue to spend behind those businesses. We still have some businesses, in my view, need more support, particularly businesses in parts of Europe and some of the categories in the U.S., and we would expect to continue to fund those as we get more gross margin accretion through the back half of the year because we're seeing the results. And ultimately, the brand equity, which is obviously the big testament to the brand support and how are we getting what we want out of it continues to show a strengthening of our brands, and that bodes well for continuity and sustainability of the growth moving forward, and that's how we're kind of running that flywheel right now, continue to invest, drive leverage in the middle of the P&amp;L, accelerate the top line and ultimately deliver better margins, better earnings per share for our shareholders.OperatorOur next question will come from Olivia Tong of Raymond James.OOlivia Tong CheangI wanted to talk a little bit about gross margin. Clearly, funding the growth start of the year materially better than expected. I imagine it's a function of supply chains improving a bit. If you could expand on that a bit. And then usually, your savings contribution build as the year progresses. So did we assume sort of a regular quarterly cadence from here? Or is there something one time-ish that happened this quarter-ish to result in the strong funding of growths contribution.Noel R. WallaceYes. Thanks, Olivia. This was very intentional. As we went through the back half of last year, we were deliberately looking to make sure that we have projects in place for the first half of this year in order to accelerate gross margin accretion given the inflationary pressures that we were seeing. In addition, I would say that we've done a lot of work on getting our facilities to run far more efficiently, whether that's the Hill's facilities where capacity utilization has come down, which has allowed us to put more funding to growth projects onto the line to determine their feasibility. We've had the teams, obviously, very much focused on the opportunities that we see in the first half in order to ensure that we get that gross margin back in quickly to once again sustain the advertising and the increases we want to see in the back half of the year. So it was deliberate and strategic to make sure that we got more of that funding to growth up front. And the teams have really done a wonderful job in that regard as you saw through in the numbers and we would certainly expect that focus to continue as we move through the balance of the year. Let me throw it over to Stan. He'll give you a little bit more color on what we're seeing again around commodities and some of the other projects that we have underway, particularly around our global productivity initiative.Stanley J. SutulaYes. Thanks, Noel. And just a quick comment on the FTG. Noel highlighted that we had a very strong start here. That SKU, I think, is going to be a little bit different than prior years. In prior years, you saw build through the year. This was very deliberate. Supply chain has moderated in terms of the volatility around that. In particular, the Hill's team has actually had time to work on some of these as we've had a little bit better improvement in capacity utilization. So the strong start we have to the year, I think you should think that this will be more equal as you go through the year versus growing through the year, so from a SKU point of view. And this is important because as we look at the material cost, there's still going to be a headwind as we go through the year. So we need that to help offset that impact. And then we have our GPI program, we continue to get benefit from that. You saw a small charge in the quarter, but the team is driving productivity throughout the P&amp;L, not just in the GP line, but also in the MBO line as we look for things to offset that material headwind.OperatorOur next question today will come from Chris Carey of Wells Fargo Securities.Christopher Michael CareySo Stan, I just wanted to confirm 1 comment about commodities. I think it was somewhat clear. But to Peter's question, just around the $300 million to $400 million range, is that what you're expecting for the full year from an inflation standpoint? And then just a little bit related on the North American operating margin, that has been stepping up kind of sequentially and then slowed a little bit this quarter, obviously. I would have thought maybe with the transportation and logistics relief and building productivity, a little bit of easing inflation, maybe that can keep going, but I know there was obviously some noise with the North America business this quarter with recall, and otherwise. So is there any way you can maybe just unpack that North America margin performance and where you see things going? So thanks for that clarification on commodities and the comment on North America.Stanley J. SutulaSo why don't I start here? On North -- first, let's start with the commodities. So as we said, still $300 million to $400 million range on that impact. I don't see that moving a lot in the short term. And keep in mind, are locking, right? So we're already into -- almost May, so 2Q is largely locked. And as we go into the back half of the year, hopefully, we'll see a little bit of relief come through. But keep in mind, the closer we get, the more we lock in order to ensure we have supply. If we think about the North America margin and go through, so North America margins here still improved on a year-on-year basis. They also improved on a sequential basis. So as you look at the progress on what we're doing from a GP point of view, that's important. We do see some logistics benefits here. Logistics have come down versus the start of the year. But again, we start to lock in some of that activity. We've seen it mostly in the ocean side of logistics, which will certainly help the overall margin. And if you think about North America in total, clearly, Fabuloso recall had an impact in the quarter. That's getting largely behind us, so we expect that we'll see improvement as we go through the year.Noel R. WallaceYes. Maybe a couple of things. So as Stan said, obviously, operating profit was up nicely, which has been the big focus for our North America business. We were up roughly 300 basis points on operating profit in the first quarter. So we feel we're making the right step -- taking the right decisions and making the right progress against the middle of the P&amp;L, particularly around gross profit and controlling our overheads and managing logistics. So that was an important element, and we're making sure that, that progress has been reinvested in the business. So a couple of other highlights on North America. Obviously, ex-Fabuloso volume would have been up on the quarter, great quarter for toothpaste. Toothpaste was up double digit in the quarter for North America with growth, including volume growth on that business. Toothbrush is a little softer. You remember, we were lapping a resupply of our product last year and some out of stock from some of our competitors. So volumes were a bit down there. Personal Care, up high single digits. Home Care was soft, as we mentioned, due to the Fabuloso recall. But overall, really good progress. The other aspect to North America that I would call out is the significant progress we're making in nonmeasured channels. And again, this is part of our strategy of growing in faster-growth channels, where we saw significant growth in non-Nielsen channels, which was terrific for North America and has obviously helped to drive some of that top line growth. So overall, a good quarter for North America, very focused on the middle of the P&amp;L moving forward, and we see opportunities, but the good news is we're seeing good progress on the top line, and that's translating to the P&amp;L.John FaucherJust 1 point of clarification on that. North America volume would have been up sequentially from Q4 to Q1 performance from Q4 to Q1, not up year-over-year ex Fabuloso. And then, Stan, on the that...Stanley J. SutulaYes, the operating margin, it's up year-to-year versus fourth quarter, you see it's down about 100 basis points or so. And that's really driven by the Fabuloso impact, combined with the increased investment in advertising as we're bringing both innovation to market and supporting the pricing that we've taken in the market.OperatorOur next question today will come from Nik Modi of RBC Capital Markets.Sunil Harshad ModiIf I could just ask a quick clarification on the raw material, the ag stuff. Stan, can you just give us any more detail on exactly what Ag's are causing the pressure and what's driving that? And then my broader question is now on the whitening innovation and just the whitening strategy. I'm just curious if you've done any halo work on the impact it has on the core or Oral Care franchise toothpaste, tootbrush. Any perspective around that would be helpful.Noel R. WallaceSure. Let me -- Nik, let me take that, and then we'll have Stan get to some more specifics around the Hill's commodities and particularly the ag prices. Yes, the strategy that we have on whitening is very much about building the brand, particularly here if you take North America, the Optic White brand. And as we expanded into at-home whitening at very significant premium prices and the significant efficacy that those products deliver in the market and to the consumer, we've seen very nice halo impacts across the entire Optic White range as well as the Colgate brand. So the short answer to your question is, clearly, the halo effect is transferring to the entire Optic franchise as well as improving the Colgate brand.Stanley J. SutulaYes. And Nik, on the commodities, it's kind of across the board with most of the ag. So corn, wheat, soybean, the risk of the drought in the U.S. and the effect on crops, even though some other areas of the world are a little bit better, the risk of Ukraine, all has been pushing pressure on that. Don't forget as well that the protein side of this, things like chicken livers, et cetera, with some of the impacts that have been out there has all put pressure on Hill's. That remains the real driver of that $300 million to $400 million range.OperatorThe next question will come from Jason English of Goldman Sachs.Jason M. EnglishThat's a great segue because I wanted to talk about Hill's and (inaudible) on it. Good quarter, obviously, not for Hill's with the profitability of the margins. We've lost over 1,000 basis points in margin in the last few years. I was hoping you could unpack the components of it, and the cadence at which you can recover if you to recover them. So how much are we looking at from the mix effects of recent acquisitions? And what's the cadence of bringing your capacity on there and improving that? How much is related to like the slack capacity, the underutilization of the assets that you're standing up and maybe some of the stress in the supply chain as a result of past utilization, and then I think the third bucket and tell me if there's other buckets. I think the third bucket is the pricing at the cost. How large is that bucket of the roughly 1,000, and is it reasonable to think that could come back? And if so, when? Sorry for the multipart long.Noel R. WallaceNo. Thank you, Jason. So let me top line Hill's a bit, and then Stan can provide a little more of the specificity that you were looking for. But structurally and strategically, this business continues to perform very well, continued sequential improvement in volume and strong organic growth despite the difficult comps that we continue to come up again. So overall, pleased with the 14%. And again, that's 14% on 13% last year and pricing of 11.4% on 9% last year and obviously sequentially improvements in volumes. So a couple of things there. Stan will get into, obviously, the key drivers of the operating margin dilution, which would be the following. Obviously, ag cost, the manufacturing integration of the 3 Red collar facilities plus the Italian facility that we have as we move through the variances associated with that. Red collar in the current quarter is a significant portion of that, the private label business. We've continued to obviously significantly increased our advertising support. We said we would do that as we built up more capacity. That is very strategic and deliberate and we're seeing the results of that in the marketplace, particularly as we drive new innovation into the market, and we drive pricing in the market, the ability to sustain and elevate that moving forward is going to be largely driven by our ability to sustain the strong levels or even increase our advertising levels. As we look forward, strategically, margins will improve sequentially as we move through the back half of the year. Plant efficiencies will continue to deliver progress in that regard. We'll get the constraints out of our existing plants, which we're running at full throttle that will allow us to be far more efficient in those plants, put more funding the growth into those plants as we look forward. So overall, strategically, the business is doing very, very well, and we feel all the steps we've taken to improve capacity ultimately delivering good, strong line growth. We need to focus on the middle of the P&amp;L, as you rightfully say, and the progress is there to do that.Stanley J. SutulaYes. Let me pick up here. So first, if you take a look, these investments in the business and if you look at the net sales, keep in mind, you go back just a couple of years ago, we're up well over $200 million quarter versus first quarter of 2021. So the investment in the brand is paying off. If we look at margin, the private label has -- what we said as a 90 basis point impact to the total company has slightly over 400 basis points impact to Hill's. So as you take a look at that margin impact, that is a material impact to Hill's on a GP basis. Now through time, that private label will wind down, and that will be over the next couple of years as we slowly wind down that contract and then backfill it with Hill's volume at Hill's margin. Now as we've already talked about, all of the raw material impact inflation has predominantly been against Hill's, also impacting their margins. But keep in mind, they've taken significant pricing here over the last several quarters, and that is helping to mitigate this. And the fact that we're now, as the Red Collar facilities have come on, that's helping us manage utilization, not just a Red Collar but of the entire manufacturing footprint. That's enabled Hill's to contribute materially to the funding of the growth savings. So I think where Hill's is right now is well positioned. I think we'll see sequential improvement in margin as we go through the year. We're going to manage that carefully so we can continue to supply our clients and we saw material improvement in case fill rates coming out of first quarter.OperatorOur next question will come from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America.Bryan Douglass SpillaneI just -- I've got a quick clarification first for Stan. I think in the guidance, we talk about net interest expense maybe going higher than your original plan. So could you put some -- if you can just put some color, put a number on that. And I'm assuming -- is this related to the refinancing? I think you refinanced some debt in March. So is it just related to the refinancing of the debt? Or is it exposure to like short-term financing variable rates? And then I have a follow-up.Stanley J. SutulaSure, Bryan. Thanks for the question. So first, on interest here as we look, this is -- well, we want to call it out because we saw rates going up, this is not a large number. So you should think around $20 million for the year. It's not really related to the first quarter debt issuance. We are very happy with that. We had very good demand on that bond. It's really the assumptions on the number of rate increases and predominantly in Europe. So as we look at the ECB and the changes there, the slight difference to what we had anticipated coming into the year. As we all know, that's a moving target, and it's going to depend on inflation moves to central banks, but that's our best guess right now. So that's a modest impact for the year.Bryan Douglass SpillaneOkay. Great. And then a question for Noel. Just you talked about, I guess, risks in the second half. And maybe if we just kind of think about that at a higher level, it sounded to me from listening to the Q&amp;A and reading the prepared remarks that a lot of that risk is what the consumer may or not do, less so than concerns about volatility in input costs or supply chains? And risk has got a lot of definitions, right? So if you could just maybe talk a little bit about like what the specific risks are and maybe how Colgate is in a position to manage that risk maybe a little bit more -- with a little bit more agility than maybe was the case, 2 years ago.Noel R. WallaceYes. Good Morning, Bryan, thank you. I saw it clearly, the consumer environment is the 1 that's the big unknown, I think, to everyone. And that's been a consistent theme through the first quarter print by most in terms of what's really going to happen in the back half and the compounding impact of pricing. I'll address the fact that historically, when we've seen significant inflation in our categories, we weathered those periods really, really well, a combination of great value-oriented innovation and the fact that our -- the breadth of our portfolio at various price points affords us the opportunity to really push different segments at the appropriate time anywhere around the world. So we're pleased with that. We're also pleased with the fact that you tend to see in times like this, a squeeze in the middle of the category with premium growing and the value growing, and that's been our focus, quite frankly. Premium has been the key focus for us, and we're seeing great progress, particularly across our Toothpaste business in new channels and at the premium end of the market, and we obviously have a very strong base business that is well positioned based on some of the relaunches we have. Raw and packing materials, we shall see, we've seen a stabilization across at least the Colgate side, you've heard a lot about the ag prices that continue to elevate, but we've seen a stabilization on those as we move. So we've got more predictability on that. Hence, the reason why we felt more confident with the raise in guidance across multiple dimensions there because we see a little bit more transparency to that. As Stan mentioned, we've got some contracts that will obviously come off. Now the unknown there is what our suppliers would do. They're facing rising wage inflation, and we'll have to deal with that as it comes, particularly in the second half of the year relative to how they decide to adjust pricing on some of the key commodities that we will ultimately be purchasing. The other aspect is China. We will see where China impacts not only the Asia business, but the world's, quite frankly. We expect obviously a slow progress in that market. I don't expect it to be vertical. I expect it to be a progress from quarter-to-quarter. We have not seen the travel retail business come back yet, and that is an expectation that we will probably see in the second half of 2023, not in the first half, but we shall see. Now we'll get into Asia and China, I'm sure as the Q&amp;A progresses, but we had obviously a very strong quarter there, and we think we're well positioned as that economy comes back to deliver on it. The last is foreign exchange. That clearly is always a risk. We -- as you saw in the prepared remarks with low single-digit and -- foreign exchange impact through the P&amp;L, we'll see where that moves. The Latin American currencies have come back a little bit here as has the euro, but it's been very volatile, and we'll adjust to that going forward. But that has been a big driver in the past as you want, but we think we're well positioned right now from the fact again, of getting strong pricing into the P&amp;L, both in the fourth quarter and the first quarter.OperatorOur next question will come from Lauren Lieberman of Barclays.Lauren Rae LiebermanTwo questions sort of like everybody else. But the first was is just pretty basic. And I was curious if you could offer any perspective on volume performance by category that you've seen? I know that's not typically something you discuss. But as we kind of think about that path forward and that shift in the -- towards a more balanced revenue algorithm, I was just curious where you stand on kind of volume growth by segment. And then, the other question was, Noel, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned something about knowing the competitive environment would be difficult. And I just -- we haven't heard that from a lot of other companies, and I didn't know if it was sort of a particularly pointed comments or just a general commentary on your ability to compete and confidence in the innovation pipeline and advertising support. So just curious on a little bit more color behind that commentary on the competitive environment.Noel R. WallaceSure. Thanks, Lauren. Let me take the second question first. The competitive environment will likely intensify particularly as you see costs come down, and that will be a function of both local brands and private label getting more aggressive. The good news is our categories. If you take North America and private label, we're benign, no progress in private label shares. So to speak, with the exception of a little bit in liquid hand soap and a little bit in cleaner, a little bit more acute of private label growth in Europe. As you saw price discrepancies or the gap between private label and global brands increase, we'll see how that translates in the back half as we expect them to have to take pricing in the first quarter as we did as well. So we think local brands in private label likely to elevate in terms of their competitive nature in the back half. And as cost to stay flat in the back half, which is what I think we're hearing from most, we expect the competitive environment to increase in that regard. Obviously, you'll see more promotional volumes probably come into the category, but it's been quite constructive so far. I will say that, but we need to anticipate that things could worsen based on where the costs are, and we're well prepared for that. On your first question, volumes. So category volumes, if I take just the market volumes in general, flat to slightly negative across most of the world on the volume side, obviously, driven by the fact that there's so much pricing that's gone into both Oral Care, Personal Care and Home Care. If you look at us specifically, really strong growth on the Oral Care side, as I talked about, double-digit growth across most markets in Toothpaste, good volume progress in most markets on Toothpaste. So we're really pleased with what we're seeing there. Personal Care up mid- to high single digits depending on the marketplace. Both from a pricing standpoint, a little bit more challenged on the volume side given the strong pricing we've taken there, particularly in categories like liquid hand soap and bar soap. And on Home Care, mid-single digits to low single digits in terms of growth, depending on the marketplace. And that 1 has experienced a little more elasticity, particularly around the cleaner side of the business where we've seen more price competitiveness in that side of the business and a little bit more trade down. But overall, again, sequentially up and really pleased with sequentially up, given the fact that we had a lot more pricing in this quarter than we had in the fourth quarter. So good progress overall. We'll have to watch the volumes carefully, and we're all over that.OperatorOur next question will come from Mark Astrachan of Stifel.Mark Stiefel AstrachanI wanted to ask about EBIT margin in North America and Europe. If you take a look at where you are today versus where you were a few years ago, it seems like it's outside of Hill's, one of the biggest drop-off relative to historical levels. I appreciate inflation, FX, et cetera, but it also seems like maybe those markets are a little bit more competitive than some of the others. Is it levels of spend that is potentially impacted that? And kind of how do you think about progression of margins? Is it realistic to think that you could eventually, no sort of time line around that to get back to those levels? Why or why not would be helpful.Noel R. WallaceYes. Thanks, Mark. Yes, your answer is clearly around the spending, that's the answer. The spending is up quite notably in North America, that's very strategic. We see that as a growth market for us moving forward, not only on the top line but on the bottom line. We really wanted to reinvest behind the business in some of our brands, and we're clearly demonstrating that as we've gone through the last couple of quarters. Getting gross profit in the middle of the P&amp;L sorted out in North America. It's clearly been a key focus, and we've had good gross profit progress in North America. We're getting better overhead leverage through the P&amp;L. We're getting a lot better efficiency in our plants, and so we'll see that translating moving forward. But we will continue to invest behind that business moving forward to drive the top line. Europe, a little bit driven, obviously, by the foreign exchange environment to a certain extent and obviously, it more increased inflation in Europe than we've seen in other markets around the world, particularly around the high gas prices and the fall-off effects of higher gas prices in some of the raw materials that we purchased into our European plants. So overall, there's been a little bit more pressure there. But again, we've taken strong pricing in the back half of 2022, and pleased that we were able to execute our pricing in the first quarter of 2023 towards the latter end of the quarter, and we'll see that benefit us as we move forward. So overall, your observation is correct. We feel -- we've got a good handle of getting the gross margins and the operating profits up sequentially as we move through the back half of the year and importantly, sustaining or increasing our advertising levels to continue to drive the top line.OperatorOur next question will come from Stephen Powers of Deutsche Bank.Stephen Robert R. PowersJust a couple of cleanups, I guess. Just the first 1 on -- just on the Fabuloso recall just because I've received some confusion in my inbox during the call. Just is there a way to quantify what the impact was in the quarter? And does that reverse out as a benefit in the second quarter? That's question number one. Question number 2, on the logistics topic. I don't know if there's a way to quantify what the benefit was or how you're thinking about the -- the expected benefit over the course of the year, but that would be helpful as well. And then the last piece is I guess it kind of builds on Jason's question on Hill's margins. But I was specifically on the Tonganoxie plant, just where that is and what the time line is to get that up to scale? And just is that a material driver of the margin bridge as well? Or is it more on the margin?Noel R. WallaceGreat. Thanks, Stephen. Let me take the Fabuloso in the Hill's question, and I'll have Stan come back to you on logistics. So the Fabuloso impact was Q1. It was a material impact to the North America volume line. We're not going to quantify that, but it was quite significant to the volume performance in North America. That is behind us as we move through into the second quarter. So we'll see the benefits of the Fabuloso business coming back into the P&amp;L as we move forward. Again, if you take the Fabuloso business out of the North America number, they were up sequentially versus the fourth quarter of 2022 in volume. So it was a very time-driven event in the first quarter. And the good news is, that's behind us. Tonganoxie progressing, as you know, strategically, that's a very important plant for us given the strong demand we have on the wet side of the business at Hill's and our inability to supply the current demand for web products all around the world. So getting that plant up and running will be strategic for the continued growth of that business. That will happen towards the tail end of the third quarter. And we anticipate, obviously, we'll have some start-up costs associated with that as we move through the transition of that facility. But overall, we should see that benefit us moving into 2024, particularly at the margin line as our web business is margin accretive to us and will certainly benefit the Hill's business longer term.Stanley J. SutulaYes. So let me pick up on logistics here. So you told logistics was 9.5% of sales. And if we look -- it's been incremental headwind to our overheads. Remember, it's in our overheads and SG&amp;A for several years. And in Q4, we saw the first year-on-year decline as a percent of sales in 12 quarters, and it was down again this quarter, and we expect it to be down for the year. I expect as we kind of look out through the remainder of the year, it's going to come down slightly. I don't see it coming down materially. So we're at 9.5% now. I still think it will probably start with the 9% as we go through the remainder of the year. So certainly a help year-on-year, but as we kind of look out through the rest of the year, I think that's how you should think about as a percent of sales, it will moderate and stay just above 9%.OperatorOur next question will come from Robert Ottenstein of Evercore ISI.Robert Edward OttensteinGreat. Two follow-ups. First one, a quick one. You mentioned that the -- you were very strong in nonmeasured channels in North America. Was that more e-commerce or Clubs Stores? And can you give us some metrics around that? That would be helpful. And then my core question is really on the advertising spend pickup, 14%, it's a big number. You mentioned for the full year that you would be up absolutely and as a percent of sales, so can you give us a little bit more sense of where that money is going? Is it more innovation and longer-term focused or maybe more short term? And then following into that, do you expect to see this elevated level going forward, either because you have very high return projects or you need to catch up, just trying to get a sense of what the income statement may look like longer term.Noel R. WallaceRob, let me take both those questions. First, on the nonmeasured channels. Again, this plays back to the strategy that we've been talking about for quite a few years now. And certainly, I highlighted again at CAGNY that we are very focused on growing channels that particularly are not measured by Nielsen, which are the faster growth channels, as you mentioned, e-commerce, club stores, discount stores, value discount stores. Some of the big box stores that we're seeing emerging in Latin America. So overall, in some of the new obviously platforms that we're seeing coming out of China, so this has been strategic and deliberate for us. And if you take the North America number, we've seen significant growth in nonmeasured channels to the tune of 4 to 5x what we're getting in measured channels. So obviously, good growth there. The key is to sustain that growth. Our e-commerce business was up double digit in the quarter, now roughly 14% of our total sales. So overall, and we're seeing good share growth in those businesses. In fact, if you take some of the progress we're seeing in China, very much driven by the strong e-commerce shares that we had. I demonstrated that at CAGNY. And in fact, since CAGNY, we've continued to increase our e-commerce shares in China, and likewise, in the brick-and-mortar business. So overall, we feel the strategy is working for us. Again, largely driven by the fact that we're supporting our businesses. We're using a wide spread of different mediums to grow brand awareness and brand penetration. Obviously, TV for a lot of reach and frequency given the scale and scope of our brands in many markets, but really fine-tuning behind our digital transformation, our ability to drive higher ROI spending in the digital space. And clearly, as we see more ROI coming, we see continued growth in terms of penetration, in terms of consumption, and in terms of ultimately delivering share growth and category growth for our retailers, we'll continue to elevate our spending. We're measuring it very quickly. This is not just for the sake of increasing spending. We want to be sure and absolutely deliberate and making sure that the spending is returning back to the brands, driving category growth. So there's not a specific number we're aimed at, Rob. We're looking to obviously continue to accelerate and sustain the top line and grow the health of our brands and we're seeing good results from the strategy we've put in the marketplace.OperatorOur next question today will come from Fulvio Cazzol of Berenberg.Fulvio CazzolMine is on the medium-term outlook for the pet nutrition category. How should we think about the medium-term growth prospects as the tailwinds ease from increased pet ownership during COVID, et cetera. And I was also interested in your view on the competitive standpoint, like if you're making some investments on capacity. And I think some of your peers are making significant investments. I think Nestle is doing quite a bit on manufacturing. Is there a risk that the supply-demand balance turns less favorable in the coming years and result in softening industry pricing power? So that's my question.Noel R. WallaceYes. Thank you very much. Let me take -- let me answer a couple of ways on the first part. First, obviously, coming through COVID, pet adoptions increased quite significantly. Those pets will continue to obviously age, and we will have, obviously, therapeutic and wellness products delivered for an aging pet population. So we feel good about that. You will recall, we've talked about the low brand penetration and brand awareness of the Hill's franchise. So we feel even if the market softens a bit, which we have not necessarily seen a little softness in volume, but not necessarily in value, as you see premiumization continuing to grow the market today. We feel we have the right portfolio of brands to continue to grow in the right investment strategy, hence, the aggressiveness of the advertising to ensure we're building brand awareness and penetration off the lower levels that we have today. And we also feel we've got opportunities internationally that we have yet to exploit given some of the capacity constraints that we have. And so we'll continue to obviously go after those moving forward. We feel -- I can't address the capacity issues or where the capacity is in the market. We're obviously putting capacity for our business. And we see that, obviously, as a real plus for us as we move forward, not only to drive better efficiencies in the plants that we currently produce in. But as we bring Tonganoxie up to line as we bring the Italian facility up to speed relative to our recipes, we feel we have real growth opportunities to continue to expand those segments where we weren't competing nearly as aggressively in the past. And so overall, that will not only drive our business but will drive the category as well, given the levels of support that we'll continue to bring to our retailers.OperatorOur last question today will come from Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan.Andrea Faria TeixeiraNoel, Stan, I appreciate the sequential improvement in volumes that you called out worldwide. Are you still seeing a premiumization playing out, starting to see consumer down trade into the entry level points in some parts of the world. I know mix is part of your volume numbers. So I was wondering if you can speak apples-to-apples into the volume increase that you're seeing sequentially. And then a clarification on the Latin America and in European, including EMEA. I understood the share stabilized, especially in Lat Am, but assuming it was mostly value share, given that, obviously, you're the leader and you're leading in pricing. So how about the volume share in those regions? And how are you seeing that play out as you progress, especially as you [overskew] in Personal Care, in particular, hand soap and the other categories within that sort of category.Noel R. WallaceYes. Thanks for the question. Clearly, as we've seen in prior challenging the markets with a lot of inflation, you kind of have the tale of 2 cities, which is the premium segment continues to grow and that's the area where we're under-indexed in. So clearly, that's fueling a lot of our advertising investment and our channel strategies, particularly in Oral Care and in the Skin Health business. So we see that segment continuing to grow. The middle getting squeezed a bit and the lower end with the point you made, a little bit more trade down into the lower end. Now remember that some of our lower end businesses, while the absolute margin dollars might be lower, the margin percent might be as good or better than some of our premium segments. So overall, we feel pretty good about the mix of our business, and that continues to be, in our view, a real advantage for our portfolio relative to the breadth of our portfolio. Relative to volume shares, particularly in the emerging markets, we have taken significant pricing in emerging markets. And we clearly done that to ensure we get the flexibility in the P&amp;L as quickly as we possibly can, that we sustain the advertising numbers or increase them to drive the innovation and deliver the pricing, particularly for the premium side of the market. We've seen a little trade down, particularly more in the Home Care businesses. The cleaner's segment, I would point out in the dish segment, a little bit of trade down, particularly in Latin America. Personal Care, holding up okay. Bar soap tends to be more price elastic than many of our categories. But we've seen a lot of constructive pricing from our competition. So there hasn't been a significant amount of trade down to private label as of yet, but we'll watch that very carefully. So Home Care a little bit more challenged, particularly around the Cleaner segment worldwide and Personal Care in the Bar Soap segment. Oral Care looks okay, as I mentioned, were up by double digit in Toothpaste with both positive pricing and positive volume.OperatorThis concludes the Q&amp;A portion of our call. I will now return the call to Noel Wallace, Colgate's Chairman, President and CEO, for any closing remarks.Noel R. WallaceYes. Thanks, everyone, for your interest in our company. And let me just extend a personal thanks to the 34,000 Colgate people who have worked tirelessly to deliver a stronger momentum in the first quarter, getting us off to a strong start for the year. We greatly appreciate their steadfast resolve and the innovation that they're bringing to the market and the strong execution. So I look forward to talking to everyone in the second quarter. Thank you.OperatorThe conference has now concluded. We thank you for attending today's call. You may now disconnect.]"

This compares to earnings of $0.74 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 4.29%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this consumer products maker would post earnings of $0.77 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.77, delivering no surprise.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Colgate-Palmolive , which belongs to the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry, posted revenues of $4.77 billion for the quarter ended March 2023, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.30%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $4.4 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Colgate-Palmolive shares have lost about 1.1% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 7.7%.What's Next for Colgate-Palmolive?While Colgate-Palmolive has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Colgate-Palmolive: favorable.

250,2fe0f495-118c-31d5-a247-f37a8913c0c6,JNPR,2023-04-29,Juniper Networks (NYSE:JNPR) Is Increasing Its Dividend To $0.22,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/juniper-networks-nyse-jnpr-increasing-120520333.html,1682769920,STORY,['JNPR'],"[The board of Juniper Networks, Inc. (NYSE:JNPR) has announced that it will be paying its dividend of $0.22 on the 22nd of June, an increased payment from last year's comparable dividend. The payment will take the dividend yield to 2.9%, which is in line with the average for the industry. View our latest analysis for Juniper Networks Juniper Networks' Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageSolid dividend yields are great, but they only really help us if the payment is sustainable. Prior to this announcement, Juniper Networks' earnings easily covered the dividend, but free cash flows were negative. In general, we consider cash flow to be more important than earnings, so we would be cautious about relying on the sustainability of this dividend.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 26.7% over the next year. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 49% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.historic-dividendJuniper Networks Doesn't Have A Long Payment HistoryThe dividend's track record has been pretty solid, but with only 9 years of history we want to see a few more years of history before making any solid conclusions. Since 2014, the dividend has gone from $0.40 total annually to $0.88. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 9.2% per annum over that time. The dividend has been growing as a reasonable rate, which we like. However, investors will probably want to see a longer track record before they consider Juniper Networks to be a consistent dividend paying stock.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowInvestors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. Juniper Networks has impressed us by growing EPS at 20% per year over the past five years. The company's earnings per share has grown rapidly in recent years, and it has a good balance between reinvesting and paying dividends to shareholders, so we think that Juniper Networks could prove to be a strong dividend payer.Story continuesIn SummaryIn summary, while it's always good to see the dividend being raised, we don't think Juniper Networks' payments are rock solid. With cash flows lacking, it is difficult to see how the company can sustain a dividend payment. We don't think Juniper Networks is a great stock to add to your portfolio if income is your focus.Investors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company. For example, we've picked out 2 warning signs for Juniper Networks that investors should know about before committing capital to this stock.

The company actively invested in improving the overall Pinterest experience through better and personalized video contents, increasing user engagement, improving privacy and safety measures in the platform and introducing new tools to support advertisers.

This was due to OEM inventory reductions and competitive pressures. Intel witnessed TAM contraction across all CPU market segments. The company has a singular focus on regaining performance and TCO leadership across all workloads and use cases from enterprise to cloud, as demand is expected to remain soft in the second quarter.Network and Edge Group (NEX, 12.7%) revenues declined 30.4% to $1,489 million as elevated inventory levels and soft demand trends affected segment sales.Mobileye (3.9%) revenues were up 16.2% to $458 million, primarily driven by higher demand for EyeQ products.

It delivered an average negative earnings surprise of 5.75% in the past four quarters. Q1 EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $930.6 million, indicating a 3.6% decline from the year-ago quarter’s number. The same for earnings stands at 33 cents per share, indicating a 36.5% decline from the prior-year period.Factors to NoteDENTSPLY SIRONA’s Technologies &amp; Equipment segment is likely to have witnessed organic growth in the quarter under review. Higher demand for clear aligners and imaging equipment is expected to have driven the segment’s sales growth, partially offset by weakness in CAD/CAM.Soft demand in China and the United States might have hurt the Consumable segment’s sales. However, recovering demand for preventive consumables is likely to have provided some support.Foreign currency movement had a negative impact on total revenues during the fourth quarter. The trend is likely to have continued in the first quarter as well.On its fourth-quarter earnings call, XRAY’s management stated that it is encouraged by double-digit growth in clear aligners, solid performance in Europe and continued strong demand for Imaging equipment.However, continued macroeconomic headwinds, including foreign currency impacts, global supply chain challenges, and regional softness in China and the United States may have offset the abovementioned growth. The company is expected to provide updated view on macro headwinds and business performance on its first-quarter earnings call.Gross margin and adjusted earnings per share are likely to have been adversely impacted by inflationary pressures.DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc.

Welcome to the Accolade Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Results Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) Please be advised today's conference is being recorded.I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Todd Friedman, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.Todd FriedmanThanks, operator. Welcome everyone to our fiscal fourth quarter earnings call. With me on the call today are our Chief Executive Officer, Rajeev Singh; and our Chief Financial Officer, Steve Barnes. Shantanu Nundy, our Chief Health Officer, will join the question-and-answer portion of the call later.Before turning the call over to Rajeev, please note that we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe are important when evaluating Accolade's performance. Details and the relationship between these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures and reconciliations thereof can be found in the press release posted on our website.Also, please note that certain statements made during this call will be forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause the actual results of Accolade to differ materially from those expressed or implied on this call. For additional information, please refer to our cautionary statement in our press release and our filings with the SEC, all of which are available on our website.With that, I'll turn the call over to our CEO, Rajeev Singh.Story continuesRajeev SinghThanks, Todd, and thank you, everyone, for joining us as we kick-off fiscal 2024 at Accolade. It's an appropriate moment to acknowledge that today's Accolade has transformed from an advocacy and navigation company to a personalized health care company that delivers exceptional, high-quality health care to our 12 million members across the country.We're unique in that we offer exceptional service powered by our frontline care teams and technology, clinical outcomes driven by our primary care physicians, therapists, nurses, and pharmacists, and an open platform that makes our partners and the brick-and-mortar health care system far more effective. We're building a customer-focused, nationwide health care company from those unique assets, and we're excited about the future.Today's call marks the end of a transformational year for Accolade and the start of the next phase in Accolade's evolution. In fiscal 2023, we delivered over 30% growth in ARR booking, over 30% revenue growth in our virtual primary care offering, achieved our revenue and adjusted EBITDA targets, and ended the year serving more than 800 customers and 12 million lives. We diversified our business across customer size and verticals, across solutions, and across distribution channels. And given the strategic actions we made at the end of February, we enter fiscal 2024 with a more streamlined organization operating as one Accolade that is materially closer to achieving positive cash flow.At a high level, here's what we learned in fiscal 2023. The market for personalized health care solutions remains strong and the demand environment shows no signs of weakening in spite of the broader macroeconomic environment. Core to the differentiation of our personalized health care suite is the diversity of our offerings as a substantial portion of our new customers opted to buy more than 1 of our solutions. Our solutions are differentiated and drive high win rates as demonstrated by adding a significant number of new customers, including a large public university, a major hospitality company, and one of the world's largest consumer brands.Our customers trust us and value our solutions as evidenced by the expansion of our relationships with many of them this year. And innovators and disruptors in health care view us as a differentiated platform as demonstrated by the growth of our trusted partner ecosystem. At the outset of the year, we believed that these data points would emerge. Today, we can state them as facts.Now, let's focus on our outlook for the next fiscal year and also give you a preview of what we plan to cover at our Capital Markets Day on May 8. We've spent the last 18 months working hard to integrate the 3 solutions that we acquired. Those efforts have produced great results with a more unified customer experience and a strong customer reception to our vision for an integrated personalized health care offering. While we've been focused on integration, we've also spent that time allowing the businesses to run independently in many respects. The rationale was very simple. We wanted to study and understand the businesses, retain critical talent, and map out the logical integration points and synergies thoughtfully.Having accomplished those objectives, on February 28, we announced that we're bringing the various teams together under a single unified structure, 1 product organization, 1 clinical organization, 1 care delivery organization, 1 Accolade.This is already having the effect of stream lining decision-making in Accolade and improving our operating structure as we scale to serve hundreds more customers and millions more members. The common thread through every stage of our growth continues to apply today, a single-minded obsession with the member and the customer. Steve will provide more detail later, but today we quantified our earlier statements about the improvement in adjusted EBITDA. Our updated guidance today shows that we have cut our expected loss in half this year, thoughtfully with a strategy that allows us to execute well and serve our members and customers with extraordinary quality.Strong new bookings in fiscal year '23 give us excellent visibility into fiscal year 2024 and beyond. For those of you who are new to Accolade, our initial contracts are typically 3 years. So our 33% growth in ARR bookings gives us good visibility into our current year revenue, as well as a solid preview for fiscal year 2025. Our confidence regarding achieving positive adjusted EBITDA as a business is extremely high.Looking ahead, the momentum we saw last year appears to be continuing in the current year, both in terms of the size of the pipeline and RFP flow, as well as general market interest from both prospective and existing customers. The pipeline is larger now than it was at this time last year.Another notable item is a ramping interest in our trusted partner ecosystem from our current customers, as well as prospect. We'll spend more time on this at Capital Markets Day, but new and existing customers and partners are recognizing the value of Accolade as a distribution channel and enabling partner for important health care innovation. Perhaps more importantly, this is further evidence of the incremental value we drive via integration of best-in-class clinical solutions with our open platform, combined with our frontline care team's ability to deliver a high level of what we call good utilization.In short, the demand for our services remains strong. The value we provide to companies in terms of ROI and cost savings, and to their employees and their families via improved health care outcomes and lower costs continues to drive our value proposition and our pipeline. Additionally, we're especially excited about the growth we're seeing in virtual primary care. It's worth noting that while we may deliver primary care to both commercial customers and directly to consumers, we view our primary care business as a single offering. It is the same physician base, same customer platform, and same member experience across the board, whether a patient comes to us directly as a consumer, through an employer, or via a health plan partnership.Finally, it's become a hallmark of our business that our rapid diversification has provided numerous factors for growth. We're seeing opportunities to drive growth across all our distribution channels, commercial, health plan, government, and consumer.Now let me give you a preview of our May 8th Capital Markets Day. When Accolade went public nearly 3 years ago, I wrote these words in our IPO prospectus. Strategic executives have long appreciated that the health and well-being of their employees is something they must care about and invest in. Today, employee health and well-being is a business continuity issue. Employers can't afford to overlook it. Employers must give employees and their families trusted clinical guidance and personalized support to help them live their healthiest lives, physically, emotionally, and financially.In 2020, when we published that prospectus, Accolade was a navigation and advocacy company with $132 million in revenue and serving roughly 50 customers. We would become the first publicly traded navigation company. Today, we're forecasting FY '24 revenue at approximately 3x that level. We have more than 800 customers representing 12 million lives, and we are a fully integrated personalized health care business. Over that 3 years, the market has sought to identify the categories that will thrive in a difficult economic environment and beyond, and the companies that will lead those categories. On May 8th in Las Vegas, you'll hear why personalized health care is the future of health care, and why Accolade is well-positioned to lead a massive new category as the first nationwide health care delivery company obsessed with the member experience.Healthcare is a $4 trillion market, and yet you would be hard-pressed to name many health care companies that are defined by their obsession with delivering extraordinary customer experiences. In other categories, companies like Chick-fil-A, USAA, T-Mobile, and Zappos lead based on their single-minded focus on customer value. We're building that type of customer-focused company in health care. On May 8, we'll explain what it means to be obsessed with the member experience in health care, and how our unique blend of technology and humanity, what we call engineered to care, is the right approach. We'll share new product demos and data points that demonstrate the ROI we deliver, both from a health and cost outcome perspective. And we'll talk about the growing contribution and strategic importance of our primary care offering, as well as the increasing collaboration in health care and how we're building our ecosystem.Steve will dive deeper into our business model to help you understand the path not just to break even, but also how we think about Accolade on the way to being a $1 billion revenue business and beyond. And as a real highlight, we'll be featuring a number of our customers and partners to help tell the story of the future of health care. We hope you can join us in Las Vegas or on the webcast. Reach out to Todd Friedman, if you have any questions.Now I'm going to turn the call over to Steve to review the financials and share our year-end metrics. Steve?Stephen H. BarnesThanks, Raj. First, I'll recap the results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, and then provide some details on forward guidance for the first quarter and full year for fiscal 2024.We generated $99 million in revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. Revenue highlights in the fourth quarter included the impact of new customer launches on January 1. Whereas a year ago, we served more than 600 customers and 10 million members. Today we have more than 800 customers, representing more than 12 million members. Of that growth, many of our new customers launched on January 1, 2023, and the number of customers with more than one of our core services, advocacy, expert medical opinion, and virtual primary care has more than doubled since this time last year. We also saw in the fourth fiscal quarter continued strength in our virtual primary care offering.Fiscal Q4 adjusted gross margin was 50.5%, compared to 54.4% in the prior year period. The primary factor impacting the year-over-year comparison was the timing of performance guarantee revenues, which typically yield higher gross margins. In fiscal 2023, we recognized a larger portion of PG revenue in the first 3 quarters of FY '23 in comparison to the prior year.Adjusted gross margin for the full fiscal year of 2023 was up slightly year-over-year. An adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 was $2.8 million, representing 3% of revenues, and an improvement compared to $1.8 million and 2% of revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022.For the full year, this translates to revenue of $363.1 million and an adjusted EBITDA loss of $36.5 million, both in line with our guidance. And as a reminder, the Comcast contract ended at the end of calendar 2022, so when you adjust for that customer, our revenue growth in fiscal 2023 was north of 20% on a pro forma basis.And turning to the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents totaled $321 million at the end of fiscal 2023, and accounts receivable DSOs were in line with prior quarters at about 24 days revenue outstanding. Finally, we had approximately 73.1 million shares of common stock outstanding at the end of fiscal 2023.Now before we hit on forward guidance, allow me to reiterate that we had a very strong selling season in fiscal 2023, as Raj noted earlier, and in our January call. We signed $72 million of ARR bookings in fiscal 2023, representing approximately 33% growth over fiscal '22. That success is the foundation of our revenue growth forecast for fiscal 2024, and it's already forming the basis for additional growth in fiscal '25.In addition, let me touch on the 2 annual metrics that we've shared historically. First, ACV, or annual contract value, was $309 million at the end of fiscal 2023, which compares to $286 million at the end of fiscal 2022. If you exclude the impact of Comcast, $309 million of ACV represents about 20% growth over fiscal 2022. And gross dollar retention was 87% for the year. But again, if you exclude the impact of Comcast, pro forma GDR was 96% for the year, consistent with our historical trends in the mid to high 90s.Now turning to guidance. We're updating our guidance today for fiscal year 2024 as follows. We start by reiterating that fiscal 2024 revenue will be approximately $410 million, representing year-over-year growth of approximately 13%, or 20% excluding the loss of Comcast.For some color on the $410 million of revenue, we expect that growth in our advocacy offering revenues will approach 20% excluding the impact of Comcast. Growth in our virtual primary care offering is expected to be more like in the mid-20s,and EMO in the 20% growth range.We have strong visibility to these growth rates based on our ARR bookings in fiscal 2023, along with retention and expansions with existing customers, both of which are reflected in the ACV number, as well as continuing momentum in new bookings for fiscal 2024 and with PlushCare, our consumer channel for virtual primary care.Regarding the T-5 contract, the TRICARE pilot and our autism cares demonstrations, we view these arrangements in aggregate as our government sector opportunity, and expect those government revenues to collectively grow on a year-over-year basis in fiscal 2024.With respect to profitability and cost structure, as we noted in an 8-K on February 28, we recently took some strategic actions to realize cost synergies via workforce reductions associated with integrating our offerings. With those changes, we are meaningfully improving our forecast for adjusted EBITDA loss for fiscal 2024 to a range between 2% and 4% of revenues, or $8 million to $12 million, representing an improvement of about 50% from our prior guidance.With respect to the first fiscal quarter of 2024, we're providing guidance today of revenue in the range of $89 million to $91 million, and adjusted EBITDA loss in the range of $15 to $18 million. As this is the first time we're providing quarterly guidance for fiscal 2024, I'd like to call out a couple of notes to help you with your models for the rest of the year.First, I'll comment about Q1 revenue and adjusted EBITDA. You'll recall that last year in Q1 of fiscal 2023, we noted some expected PG timing that benefited revenue, gross margin, and adjusted EBITDA. When you normalize for that impact of PGs and Comcast, our Q1 revenue forecast represents about 20% growth year-over-year.Additionally, the cost actions that we announced on February 28, will have much less of an impact in Q1, as they aren't fully realized in our model until the second half of the year. As such, the Q1 adjusted EBITDA guide includes a higher level of OpEx than we expect future quarters of the fiscal year to average for the remainder of 2024.Looking at the quarterly revenue trend for this year, we have consistently noted that it's important to look at the full year. Timing of PGs on a quarterly basis is more difficult to predict, which is why we take a conservative view on timing of PG revenue achievement at the start of the year.Our level of annual PG attainment has been relatively consistent historically, and we expect the current fiscal year to be in line with our historical PG performance. As such, we generally model for higher PG recognition in Q4, and are making a similar assumption this year. If you were to normalize PG revenue recognition for historical periods, you would see a consistent growth rate in Q1 to Q3, and then a bump in Q4 if new customers come on board, typically on January 1, and this year is no different.Now with respect to our balance sheet, as I noted last quarter, our convertible notes are not due for 3 years. So with $321 million cash on hand, we have more than adequate liquidity to achieve our financial plans without going back to the capital market, placing us in a strong position to execute against our objectives.In conclusion, we very much look forward to our Capital Markets Day on May 8 in Las Vegas. In addition to the points Raj noted earlier, at the event we'll provide a more in-depth view of key items driving our financial profile, including our growth opportunity, plans for continued gross margin expansion and profitability, and overall scaling the business. And we'll go deep on the business and financial drivers behind why we continue to believe passionately in the strength, depth, and breadth of the platform, the diversification of our offerings, revenue streams, and customer base, and that we have an engine built for growth and sustainability, which will ultimately drive significant cash flow.With that, we'll open the call to questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Ryan Daniels with William Blair.Ryan Scott DanielsRaj, one for you, I thought it was interesting that you talked about how you took some time to study the acquired assets and ensure appropriate integration, and that's what led to the restructuring and integration at the start of this year. So I think we appreciate the cost reduction and the improved, or markedly improved, EBITDA. I'm curious, though, if you can go a little bit more into the operational excellence and go-to-market strategy and value proposition for clients that that greater integration should also allow.Rajeev SinghYes. First of all, great to chat with you again, Ryan, and thanks for the question. If you were to think about the way we talk to our personalized health care suite, we're really looking at an integrated health care delivery vehicle. The idea that every element of our suite builds off of and adds complementary value to the other. And so let me put that in the context of an advocacy interaction with a member, where the member's seeking to find a physician to address a condition that they're wrestling with. Our capacity in that moment to move from identification of an issue, triage, to a scheduled appointment with a physician in the next 15 minutes, to a resolution and a prescription of downstream care using our primary care service to lead to a physician search post that to find a specialist, all happening in one transaction that occurs within 15, 20 minutes of the first outreach to Accolade, is a representation of how advocacy can be built off of into primary care and into our specialty care service.Capacity to deliver that integrated service is really what we're most excited about and what we think our clients are most excited about. One of the things I referenced in the prepared remarks, Brian, was the idea that our clients last year who purchased our advocacy solution also purchased one other solution or more from us in the last year. That's a reflection of both the differentiation of our value proposition and the differentiation of the integration of the services.OperatorOur next question comes from Michael Cherny with Bank of America.Michael Aaron ChernyI apologize, I'm going to have kind of 1.5 questions. Maybe the full question is, as you think about the cross-sellers you've had and a pretty impressive number on the amount of customers that has more than one solution, what does that mean in terms of how pricing has evolved for your business and what the PMPM looks like for customers? And again, just one quick technical question for Steve. I don't believe you're guiding to cash flow positive in this year, I just want to make sure nothing's changed about when you expect to get cash flow positive?Rajeev SinghMike, we'll give you the 1.5 questions and I'll start with the beginning of the answer and then Steve will chime in and hit the free cash flow question -- answer as well as anything you want to add incrementally on pricing, Steve.One of the things that we're most excited about the business, this idea of this integrated offering is the capacity to offer pricing models that our customers find the most valuable and meet the customer where they'd like to be. And so as an example to that, Mike, we're seeing very consistent pricing in the advocacy or advocacy and navigation offering space. Those price points have remained relatively consistent and the makeup of those transactions in terms of the percentage of fees that are fixed versus variable or performance guarantee oriented have stayed relatively constant as well. Customers understand the value of the category, understand the return on investment and smart customers are willing to pay for that value.Now as we add on incremental services like virtual primary care and mental health or expert medical opinion, there's multiple ways that the customer can take advantage of that service from us. They can buy on a PEPM basis where they have an all-you-can-eat opportunity to take advantage of those services or if they prefer, they have an opportunity to buy on an as-use basis in the case of our virtual primary care, a claims-based bill or in the case of EMO case rate billing model. In either of those situations, Accolade is quite comfortable. We understand that we're going to drive enormous value for the customer either way. And because we are fundamentally an engagement engine for health care, we're very confident in the engagement rates we can drive for our own primary care and expert medical opinion services if the client chooses that variable model. Steve, anything you'd add?Stephen H. BarnesOne thing I would, before I jump to Mike's question on free cash flow Raj is the trusted partner ecosystem, which is becoming more and more of a center point for us strategically with customers. We'll hit on this a fair amount during the Capital Markets Day on May 8. But we often are paid a share, call it an administrative fee for making those services available to customers. And that also drives incremental revenue, essentially utilization-based kind of revenue. Again, we refer to it as good utilization, because we're helping members get to these point solutions that are often underutilized by customers. So that would be an addon to the pricing dynamic that Mike asked.And then with respect to free cash flow, Mike, no major changes from what we've talked about in the past, meaning for us adjusted EBITDA is a pretty good proxy for free cash flow, plus or minus a couple of things, working cash flow, timing of customer payments and that kind of thing, of course. And then in a year like this year where we did make some cost structuring changes, we do have severances that'll get paid out. That'll be some, that along with some other one-time type of items will occur this year. But other than that, roughly in line with what we've talked about before.OperatorOur next question comes from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley.Craig Matthew HettenbachI have a question that touches on both PlushCare, the virtual care, as well as the expert medical opinion business. As the market normalizes here, can you talk about, I mean, we've seen some signs of increased utilization and some strength in med tech companies. Can you talk about what you're seeing there as well as the market normalizes and COVID recedes, how that influences, kind of puts and takes around the kind of PlushCare business over the course of this year?Rajeev SinghCraig, Shantanu is our Chief Health Officer and Head of our Care Delivery Group is on the line as well. Shantanu, I'll open it up to you to add to anything that I might say here. Craig, when you look at the virtual primary care business, virtual primary care and mental health business, you look at it, of course, as you know, in 2 vectors. You look at our consumer business as well as the enterprise business. Consumer business titled PlushCare, the enterprise business Accolade Care. The Accolade Care business being the fundamental increment in fiscal '24. We sold Accolade Care for the first time in fiscal '23. Those clients are deploying in fiscal '24 and we'll see their utilization add to our virtual primary care and mental health business in the year ahead. And we're really excited about the traction we saw in that customer base or in our customer base in terms of taking advantage of Accolade Care.In terms of expert medical opinion, I think the real question you're asking there is, are we going to see increased utilization as the rest of the industry begins to see the first green shoots of increased utilization from a procedural and specialty care perspective? I think the answer to that is, if in fact that trend persists and we see that increased utilization across the rest of the ecosystem, you would expect it to have a positive impact on our business as well. Shantanu, anything you'd like to add to what I just chipped in there?Shantanu NundyYes, I think the main thing I'd say, Craig, is that like we're a national medical practice. And so I think we follow some of the trends of national primary care practices, which especially over the past year or 2, you have seen increases and decreases. I think the primary difference between us and sort of most of the virtual telemedicine space is the fact that we're doing comprehensive primary care. And so I think that longitudinal nature of the service that we're providing and then the experience that we're being able to provide, I think that's really what's driving the numbers that Steve talked about earlier is really the fact that we're delivering that kind of service and those kinds of outcomes. And that's a real differentiator for us.OperatorOur next question comes from Jessica Tassan with Piper Sandler.Jessica Elizabeth TassanSo I was hoping you could just describe how Accolade is responding to Humana's decision to exit the commercial market. When do you guys anticipate the majority of that activity is going to happen? And I know that Accolade kind of tends to maintain relationships despite payer changes. So can you just help us understand early conversations and what you think the potential impact of that decision might be?Rajeev SinghA couple of thoughts there, and I appreciate you calling it out. First and foremost, our relationship, we had a great relationship with Humana when they were in the commercial space. Their decision to exit the space actually had very little impact in terms of either revenues or customer relationships inside the business and the rationale for that is twofold. First, our customer relationships with customers who previously were on Humana's commercial platform and leveraging Accolade services persist. And we're actually in either renewal conversations or in the midst of 2, 3-year relationships with those customers that won't change at all. That's #1. And #2, in fact, we're continuing to service Humana internally for their own employees. And so we'd expect there to be no impact on an ongoing basis to the business, #1. And #2, while Humana -- while our relationship with Humana was a productive one in the commercial space, it was relatively modest in terms of its impact on new bookings in any given year. And we'd expect to be able to pick that up on our own.OperatorOur next question comes from Jailendra Singh with Truist.Jailendra P. SinghFirst, one quick clarification, and I have my main question. For clarification, why is your fiscal '25 margin outlook on Slide 26 unchanged, despite you pulling forward the profitability given recent changes? I would have thought some improvement there for fiscal '25.And my main question is around performance guarantees. I understand it can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, but curious if you can share what your expectations for full year performance guarantees in fiscal '24 compared to fiscal '23. And conceptually, in terms of how these guarantees work, is it like you guys have to perform better than a baseline to be valuable to employers? Does the baseline reset every year based on your performance from the prior year? Just trying to understand whether your performance last year does it extend the bar higher for you to hit those guarantees? Maybe just help us understand that part.Rajeev SinghYes, I'll be glad to. Thank you for the question, Jailendra. First, on fiscal '25, we haven't changed anything in the presentation today. We'll speak to that more in Capital Markets Day on May 8. Our purpose today was to speak to our formal guidance for fiscal '24, but take your point, we've made some cost structure changes that should certainly take us through as part of the profitability profile going forward. We'll just, we'll hit that more specifically in our Capital Markets Day in a couple of weeks.With respect to the fiscal '24 assumption, so when you look at that $410 million revenue stream, which is about a 20% slightly ahead of 20% growth, excluding Comcast. What we assume in there for performance guarantee is very consistent with what we've seen historically. And as a reminder to your point of how that works, for our enterprise customers who have advocacy in particular, we're particularly putting 10% to 15% of those fees at risk on a performance basis, and then earning those cost savings as we either beat a health care index of inflation, essentially cost trend for a particular customer, or essentially guaranteeing a trend line off of a baseline when we enter into a contract with that customer over a multi-year period.What you typically see for Accolade is we're earning about 95% of the total PEPM opportunity across our advocacy base, which pencils out to 75% to 80% of those savings PGs coming in consistently. And that happened in fiscal '23, and it happened in years prior, fairly consistently within that range. And so we're going to keep those assumptions consistent with historical experience for fiscal '24.OperatorOur next question comes from Jeff Garro with Stephens.Jeffrey Robert GarroMaybe stay on the performance guarantee topic. And Steve could ask you to describe how the seasonality of performance guarantees has changed over time. I think historically it's been fourth quarter loaded and hence the conservative approach to the guidance, but curious to see how some of that has changed over time with the diversification of the customer base? And then for Raj and Shantanu, if they could talk about engagement level too, I think that'd be helpful because just think of that going kind of hand in hand with that strong 95% or so performance guarantee achievement.Stephen H. BarnesJeff, yes, thank you for that, and I'll take the opportunity as well to clarify a bit about the Q1 guidance, which actually has something to do with the seasonality of the performance guarantees that I'll lay out and then hand off to Raj and Shantanu on the engagement question.The way those cost savings PGs typically happen is if they're claims-based and they're measured off of a year-end calendar year look back on a run-out basis, we are going to measure those at the end of the year and we are going to forecast that those PGs come in at the end of the year. That's a conservative way of looking at it. So when you look at this year's Q1 guide, we're essentially assuming that most of those are going to come out later in the year. However, what we've historically been experiencing is that we've been earning those earlier during the year. So take fiscal '23, for example, we earned a lot of those PGs sooner than Q4 and booked them earlier. That's a little bit of the downward growth rate this fiscal '23, Q4 compared to the prior year.It's why, Jeff, if you cut through all that, we always like to walk you through the idea of look at the overall annualized growth rate because sometimes the timing of earning those PGs can happen one quarter or another and it doesn't really change the impact for the full year. So with that, when you look at the fiscal '24 guide and you're looking at that Q1 number, keep in mind that we're assuming the PGs are going to be pushed out towards the end of the year. Let me hand it to Raj first to talk about engagement rates with customers and perhaps Shantanu, chime in as well.Rajeev SinghYes, perfect. Jeff, I think the way to think about this, and I appreciate the question very much, if you're to look at what customers contract with us for, they want to drive engagement, they want their employees to be more engaged in their own health care, they want to see trend line reduction, but oftentimes that trend line reduction is driven by engagement levels, the capacity to turn those engagement levels into engagement with their own third-party programs, things like our trusted partner ecosystem, and they want to ensure that their employees are really satisfied, so high NPS levels associated with the service that they're receiving. Those things tend to manifest themselves into the varied performance guarantees that Steve talked about. That's what customers want, therefore they bake those into their agreements.Our capacity to drive extraordinary engagement is really unprecedented in the market, and so we're driving 50%, 60%, 70% engagement rates for most of the employers we serve, and when we achieve those engagement rates faster, we drive more value for the customer faster, which often manifests in savings early, engagement levels faster than expected, as well as Net Promoter Scores that are extraordinarily high.And so to tie the 2 points together, when we drive engagement at the levels we're capable of, oftentimes we achieve performance guarantees in advance of the end of the year, and that's what drives the advanced booking of them.OperatorOur next question comes from Stephanie Davis with SVB Securities.Stephanie July DavisI was hoping you could walk through some of the puts and takes from the restructuring. Is there any lingering costs, how it's playing on the P&amp;L early in the year, and how you're viewing the mix of cost savings flow-through instead of just investing for forward growth in some of the faster ARR growth areas in the business?Stephen H. BarnesStephanie, it's Steve here. Thank you very much for the question. So February 28, we announced the cost structuring, restructuring actions that you're speaking to, and the impact that you'll see is, if you look at the OpEx line of our P&amp;L, and you'll see fiscal '24 be roughly flat with fiscal '23. So we took a fair amount of costs out starting at the highest level of the organization. When you think about putting 3 companies together, Accolade, 2nd.MD, and PlushCare, over the last 18 to 24 months, we were able to identify duplication, both in people and some opportunities within systems, and also integrate the backend of the company, as Raj was explaining earlier, and how we brought the offerings together.The net of that is, if you think about the OpEx for fiscal '23, and I'm speaking about adjusted operating expenses now, so take out the effect of stock compensation and depreciation and amortization, which can make the numbers a little noisy. We're looking at taking adjusted OpEx from about 57% of revenue in fiscal '23 down to about 50% of revenue in fiscal '24, and then having a cost structure that's fairly constant year-over-year.With respect to quarterly bump, you'll see the fuller effects of this happen on the second half of fiscal '24, that's because we took those actions right around February 28. We do have some transition happening in the first quarter and into the second quarter, where there's some duplication of costs there as we get the effect of that in the second half.One other thing I'd like to reiterate, this is really about the OpEx side and the infrastructure side of the business. With respect to member serving, we're always focused on obsessing with member experience being great. So we're very much investing in those frontline care teams and that experience, obviously doing everything that's great for that experience on the integration side, but also continuing to invest there. So this is much more about an OpEx and overhead kind of cost reduction.OperatorOur next question comes from Jonathan Yong with Credit Suisse.Jonathan YongI guess just going back to some of your comments about EMO and PlushCare kind of in the 20% to 20% plus range, kind of how are you thinking about that progressing throughout the year? And I guess it's somewhat similar to what you experienced in FY '23. So I guess, should we take it that, the consistent growth trends are solid, positive in terms of how you're thinking about utilization throughout the year and any updated thoughts on if we could see a possible acceleration if you're taking a bit of a conservative stance there?Rajeev SinghGreat question, Jonathan. There's really 2 vectors that drive expert medical opinion. So what we call Accolade Expert MD, a drive growth for Accolade Expert MD. The first is obviously new bookings. And so we've continued to see traction. It's a market that continues to grow. It's a market that continues to drive value for customers. Meaning it's an offering that continues to drive value for customers. It's a new customer acquisition, continues to grow at scale and at pace.The second part of the story is clearly the next thing you mentioned, which is utilization. In fiscal, in 2020 and 2021, and even into 2022, the entire industry saw compressed utilization in specialty care, surgical procedures, et cetera. There are early signals that calendar '23 is beginning to see some uptick in that utilization. If in fact that utilization does uptick consistently on a nationwide basis, as Shantanu mentioned earlier, we do provide our services, expert medical opinion, or primary care across the country. If that persists, then there is potentially upside to what we've modeled, but what we've modeled is consistent with what we've seen over the last several years.OperatorOur next question comes from Stan Berenshteyn with Wells Fargo.Stanislav BerenshteynRaj, do you see any opportunities to leverage large language models like ChatGPT to enhance your care navigation advocacy services? Would love to get your thoughts on this.Rajeev SinghThanks for the question, Stan. Absolutely. I think when transformative technologies like large language models become mainstream and prevalent as they are today, it would be silly to imply that they're not going to have an impact on health care and therefore not going to have an impact on our business. They will. Now, where we expect them to have impact is potentially in areas like intent understanding -- understanding the intent of the members as they're coming in, turning that intent into possible intelligence as it relates to how we're routing them to the right level of clinician or the right level of expertise inside of our business. And we're actually already doing some experimentation in those areas that we're actually delivering in pilots to customers today.And so we'd expect that these types of capabilities will still, ultimately we are still talking about health care. And so our capacity to leverage technologies like this to be smarter about how we guide people's care or how we drive value to people's care is still going to lead to a clinician, a physician, or a nurse, or a therapist who can drive value for that person and do so with the human touch that's been so essential to the incredible NPS levels of our service and the clinical value of our service. Shantanu, anything you'd add there?Shantanu NundyI think the only thing I'd add is, one of the areas that we've been really effective in is really building workflows that work for our clinicians and our physicians. I think when you look at the national problem of burnout, which has affected capacity across sort of traditional health systems we see a major role, as Raj said, for technology to help enable that. That's already been the case for us. We have our own proprietary electronic health record as an example that's built and sort of purpose-built for physician workflow. And so those kinds of tools, the fact that we've invested in building them our own, I think puts us in a really strong position to be able to invest in those new technologies, like those AI models, and then continue to improve that physician experience, which ultimately we see drives a better member experience and better outcomes.OperatorOur next question comes from Richard Close with Canaccord Genuity.Richard Collamer CloseThanks, and congratulations on all the progress. Steve, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the fourth quarter revenue. You guys hit the midpoint, and I'm just curious, was there something that you didn't necessarily get? Since your IPO, you guys have been exceeding the top end of the range, so being pretty conservative with your guidance and just trying to think about, you know, looking at the next year, how we should read, what you have for the first quarter in the year?Stephen H. BarnesSure. Richard, thanks for the question. And completely appreciate your point and your recent research on this exact topic. You know, for Accolade, we have very good visibility to our revenue stream when you think about the model. It's PEPM-based. We have a view of membership. So coming into any particular year or quarter, we have strong visibility. Where there is variability is usually along 2 fronts. One is the claims-based performance guarantees that I was speaking about earlier, and the other would be around case-rate revenues or utilization-based revenues. So at the margin, you're not quite getting to the top end of the range by $1 million or $2 million in any quarter could have to do with something along those lines where, you know, you might have a whole set of PGs you could go after, and in our case, in a high inflationary year like calendar '22, there's a PG or 2 that you don't get. I think the big picture point for us as we look at this is the PG performance was very consistent in calendar '22 with years past meaning we achieved about 95% of the total PEPM opportunity last year as well as in prior years. But I would attribute it to that. You're not getting every PG opportunity quite achieved in calendar '22. But nonetheless, I feel very confident going forward in the forward guide.OperatorOur next question comes from Sandy Draper with Guggenheim. Your line is open.Alexander Yearley DraperMy question is probably for Steve on the cost efficiencies. I don't think you've addressed this way. It sounds like, one, it's not going to be at the cost of goods line, but it's going to be below an operating. Any direction you can give us in terms of the savings, whether they're coming out of product technology, sales and marketing, G&amp;A, where we should be thinking about rough percentages of where the savings are going to come out. That would be really helpful to just sort of think about how it flows through and where the leverage is going to be going forward as we look out future years?Stephen H. BarnesSandy, thanks for the question. Yes, so the cost structure benefits really were realized across all lines of the OpEx, the P&amp;L. You'll see it. If you look in where the cost charges are, it'll be laid out in the earnings release or certainly the 10-K. You see a good chunk of it come out of products and technology, as well as some duplication in sales and marketing, and certainly in G&amp;A from having brought 3 companies together. So it's relatively spread evenly.I think the other takeaway for us is we're growing the business 20% top line. We continue to invest in each of those areas as needed, but we're able to take out some duplication there. So it is primarily an OpEx story. There's a little bit of fixed costs that may have impacted the cost to serve line, which you'll see when you dig into that breakdown on the P&amp;L, but primarily an OpEx story and spread fairly equally across the line.Rajeev SinghSandy, Steve mentioned this earlier, but you're essentially seeing flat OpEx from fiscal '23 heading to fiscal '24. And that's the -- ultimately, that represents a reduction in OpEx from about 57% of revenues in fiscal '23 to somewhere closer to 50% of revenues in fiscal '24.OperatorOur next question comes from David Larsen with BTIG.David Michael LarsenI'm assuming that Comcast would have been worth around $7 million in revenue in fiscal 1Q of '24. And then just doing some math, it looks like there was about $5 million of performance guarantees in fiscal 1Q of '23. Is that correct?And then also with the cost reduction efforts here, I think the WARN Act calls for like 60 days notice. Is that why we're not going to see the cost benefit until 2H of fiscal '24? And why wouldn't we start seeing that in fiscal 1Q of '24 if it's only 60 days and by the latest fiscal 2Q of '24?Rajeev SinghDave, thanks for the question. I'll take the first part of it and Steve can take the second, or I'll take the second part of it. Steve will take the first. Yes, this has nothing to do with the WARN Act. It is fundamentally about just being prudent about the way we run the business in terms of transition time frames, ensuring that we not only have appropriate transition time frames to ensure that the business is running smoothly, and also imperatively that we do the right thing by people exiting the business and ensure that we're doing that in a way that we and all of our employees can be proud of. Steve?Stephen H. BarnesSure. And back to your first part of your question, I think the tactical question around the puts and takes, you're right that there was about $7 million of Comcast revenue in Q1 of the prior year, and then the remainder of north of $3 million of PG that were high gross margin PG that effectively were the timing item that I referred to in my remarks is just about right.OperatorOur next question comes from Ryan MacDonald with Needham.Matt SheaThis is Matt Shea on for Ryan. Wanted to touch on the T-5 contract now that the TriWest award has been confirmed in the West. Do you guys have any greater sense of what your role will be with TriWest? And what kind of investments you anticipate in conjunction with scaling for that August 2024 start? And then if you have any updates around the Humana relationship in the East as well, we'd love to hear those?Rajeev SinghThanks for the question, Matt. We're clearly one step closer to T-5 being a reality. So we got through the first appeal. That first appeal was rejected, then there was essentially a rebid that led to the award that was just announced to both TriWest and the Humana. Unfortunately, Matt, there is also an appeals, potentially an appeals process to this new award. And so we're waiting until we get to the other side of the appeals window as are all the vendors who have been awarded at this point. And so not much new to report, we continue to be bullish on the opportunity to participate in T-5. We continue to see real opportunities where our technology and our services can be valuable to both of the awarded parties, whoever they may be, post any incremental protests. And we think we're really well positioned to take advantage of them when they come.OperatorI'm not showing any further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to Rajeev Singh for any closing remarks.Rajeev SinghWe really appreciate everyone making the time today. We're excited to see many of you on May 8 in Las Vegas. We hope you can join us for our Capital Markets Day then. Thank you all.OperatorAnd ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's presentation. You may now disconnect, and have a wonderful day.]"

Comcast's grant will also support NWL's broader network of over 20,000 Indigenous women across Turtle Island, or North America, grow their businesses, communities, and environment with values-aligned integrated capital.""It's important for us to design capital, tools, and products that meet the needs of Native communities,"" said Jaime Gloshay, Co-Founder of Native Women Lead. ""As our first corporate partner, Comcast's grant is truly significant and will help us amplify our work, support our entrepreneurs in reclaiming our narrative, and give us the opportunity to center and uplift the people who are making meaningful change in our communities.""As business owners, Indigenous women face institutional racism and predatory lending when it comes to accessing capital and federal funding. In 2017, the Native Nations Institute found that the number of Small Business Administration (SBA) guaranteed loans awarded to Native-owned businesses constituted less than 1%.Native women also experience some of the highest poverty and wealth gaps in the country. According to the Center for American Progress, they are paid 60 cents for every $1 paid to White, non-Hispanic men, yet 66% are their family's primary breadwinners and economic drivers in their communities.""Access to capital remains a significant barrier for women entrepreneurs, but is particularly challenging for Indigenous communities,"" says Dalila Wilson-Scott, EVP and Chief Diversity Officer of Comcast Corporation and President of the Comcast NBCUniversal Foundation.Story continuesWe are proud to partner with Native Women Lead to help empower these talented, innovative business owners realize overdue economic opportunities for themselves and their community. DALILA WILSON-SCOTT EVP and Chief Diversity Officer of Comcast Corporation and President of the Comcast NBCUniversal FoundationIn addition to the Matriarch Revolutionary Fund, Comcast's grant will help NWL scale and fund the newly launched Rematriating Economies Apprenticeship (REA) program that will support 10 Indigenous women on a five-month paid apprenticeship toward becoming an emerging fund manager. Following the apprenticeship, participants will also be presented with job placement opportunities at several investment fund companies or firms throughout the United States. The apprenticeship is currently accepting applications for its first cohort through April 10, 2023.""We want to see our women writing the checks themselves,"" said Vanessa Roanhorse, Co-Founder of Native Women Lead.""I want to see our entrepreneurs thrive - that has been the magic of Native Women Lead. Being able to see someone succeed closes that belief gap in oneself and empowers one another to continue to push and take this journey of entrepreneurship with that curiosity, with that awe, with that wonder, and to be open to the challenges of business ownership,"" Jaime Gloshay added.NWL was founded in 2017 to inspire innovation by investing in Indigenous women entrepreneurs.

257,decb691d-43e0-36b3-bc17-ecdedd11f1e0,CMCSA,2023-04-29,Should You Be Worried About Comcast Corporation's (NASDAQ:CMCSA) 6.0% Return On Equity?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/worried-comcast-corporations-nasdaq-cmcsa-140114790.html,1682690474,STORY,['CMCSA'],"[While some investors are already well versed in financial metrics (hat tip), this article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE) and why it is important. By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA).Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. See our latest analysis for Comcast How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Comcast is:6.0% = US$4.9b ÷ US$82b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.06.Does Comcast Have A Good ROE?Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, Comcast has a lower ROE than the average (13%) in the Media industry.roeThat certainly isn't ideal. That being said, a low ROE is not always a bad thing, especially if the company has low leverage as this still leaves room for improvement if the company were to take on more debt. When a company has low ROE but high debt levels, we would be cautious as the risk involved is too high. You can see the 3 risks we have identified for Comcast by visiting our risks dashboard for free  on our platform here.Why You Should Consider Debt When Looking At ROEMost companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.Story continuesCombining Comcast's Debt And Its 6.0% Return On EquityIt's worth noting the high use of debt by Comcast, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 1.20. The combination of a rather low ROE and significant use of debt is not particularly appealing. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it.SummaryReturn on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider.

258,0bdb1f42-95ea-30e4-8ea6-9cf6a227c29e,PRU,2023-04-29,5 Stocks to Watch From the Thriving Multiline Insurance Industry,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-stocks-watch-thriving-multiline-164004251.html,1682700004,STORY,"['CNO', 'AIG', '^GSPC', 'MET', 'PRU', 'KMPR']","[Product diversification helps Zacks Multiline Insurance industry players to lower concentration risk, ensure uninterrupted revenue generation and improve retention ratio. Better pricing, prudent underwriting, increased exposure, faster economic recovery on the receding impact of the pandemic and increased vaccinations should benefit MetLife Inc. MET, American International Group Inc. AIG, Prudential Financial Inc. PRU, CNO Financial Group CNO and Kemper Corporation KMPR. Accelerated digitalization will help in the smooth functioning of the industry.The solid capital level of the multiline insurers will fuel merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) activities. With one rate hike already this year and more to come in the future, investment income should improve further as insurers are beneficiaries of a rising rate environment.About the IndustryThe Zacks Multiline Insurance industry comprises companies that provide single insurance coverage, bundling automobile, homeowner, long-term care, life and health insurance to individuals and businesses. The insured pays a single premium and is covered for many things through a single contract. These companies cover commercial and personal properties, automobiles, marine, livestock, aviation, personal accident, life, including permanent and term insurance, supplemental accident and health insurance, workers’ compensation, annuity products, private mortgage insurance, et al. The industry participants also provide risk management services. Since the companies offer single insurance coverage for multiple products, customer retention improves. The insured stands to benefit from lower premium payment compared to paying individual premiums for insuring varied products.3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Multiline Insurance IndustryDiversified portfolio lowers concentration risk:  Given the nature of the business, multiline insurers’ product and service portfolios are diversified. This lowers concentration risk. Increased awareness, driving higher demand for protection products, should benefit sales and premiums for life insurance operations. Continued improvement in pricing and an increase in exposure should support premium growth. Also, per Deloitte Insights, the transition to green energy and related insurance products, as well as exposure to intangible assets, offers growth opportunities. Per Deloitte Insights, life insurance premium is estimated to increase 1.9% in 2023 while non-life premiums are expected to increase 2.2%. The report also stated that trends like commercial lines witnessing growth at a faster pace than personal lines and homeowners’ premiums improving at a better rate than personal auto are likely to continue in 2023.Merger and acquisitions:  Consolidation in the multi-line insurance industry is expected to continue as players look to diversify their operations into new business lines and geographies. Buying businesses along the same lines is driven by the players’ need to gain a fair market share and grow in their niche areas. However, with high inflation and a rise in interest rate (the Fed has already made one rate hike this year), momentum in the M&amp;A environment is likely to slow down. The first half of 2022 witnessed 427 deals per Deloitte.  Increased adoption of technology: Digitalization has increased by leaps and bounds, especially amid pandemic-induced restrictions. The industry is witnessing greater use of technology like blockchain, AI, advanced analytics, telematics, cloud computing and robotic process automation to expedite business operations and save costs.  Many life insurers have started selling policies online that appeal to the tech-savvy population. At the same time, the use of real-time data is making premium calculation easier and reducing risk. The P&amp;C industry, in particular, also witnessed the emergence of insurtech — technology-led insurers — sparking competition for incumbent players. Insurers remain focused on ramping up data and analytics capabilities as well as realizing the benefit of the technological infrastructure per Deloitte Insights. Moreover, the adoption of technology has helped in seamless underwriting and claims processing. However, the adoption of technology comes with the risk of cyber threats.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates solid prospects in the near term.

The quarter’s performance reflects strong execution across the businesses, offset by macroeconomic headwinds, supply chain disruptions and dynamic market conditions.WY’s shares inched up 0.2% in the after-hours trading session on Apr 27, after the earnings release. Notably, the world's leading private owner of timberlands increased its base dividend by 5.6% to 19 cents per share (76 cents annually) from 18 cents (72 cents).Devin W. Stockfish, president and chief executive officer of Weyerhaeuser, said, “Looking forward, we remain constructive on the longer-term demand fundamentals that will drive growth for our businesses, notwithstanding the current macroeconomic headwinds.

In the West, it anticipates moderately lower sales realizations, partially offset by significantly low per-unit log and haul costs as well as slightly high fee harvest volumes. In the South, sales realizations and per-unit log and haul costs are likely to be slightly low, while fee harvest volumes are projected to be comparable. Forestry and road costs in the South and North are expected to be seasonally higher.In the Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources segment, Weyerhaeuser expects earnings to be sequentially comparable. Adjusted EBITDA is likely to be $20 million lower than first-quarter, thanks to the timing and mix of sales.Within the Wood Products segment, the company predicts earnings and adjusted EBITDA to be moderately higher, sequentially (excluding the effect of changes in average sales realizations for lumber and oriented strand board or OSB). WY anticipates comparable sales volumes, slightly lower fiber costs and moderately higher unit manufacturing costs for OSB.

With these Fresh Product Management, Ingredients Management, and Zero Waste capabilities, retailers can more efficiently allocate and account for inventory to create unique food offerings – from pre-made sandwiches to salads or baked goods – that minimize waste, while enhancing margin and customer loyalty.(PRNewsfoto/Oracle)""Grocers continue to expand their offerings to compete for shoppers' hearts and minds with convenience and choice,"" said Mike Webster, senior vice president, and general manager, Oracle Retail. ""Enabling customers to grab a sandwich, sushi, or even a pre-made dinner gives them incentive to come into a store and spend more – but it comes with complexity for the grocer. Today, we are eliminating that hassle by enabling food retailers to better trace all fresh foods and bring together recipe management and ingredient management. This will help grocers handle production planning and execution more precisely, as well as account for the cost of labor and packaging, all within their familiar Oracle platform for modern retail.""Request a demo to see these technologies in action here.A fresh perspectiveIn grocery, ""fresh"" describes products carried in a store that require special handling and labor for preparation. Baking bread, slicing deli meat, or offering pre-cooked options such as rotisserie chicken, or managing short shelf-life products including those in the produce department, have special requirements to efficiently manage the planning, ordering, manufacturing, and inventory management to reduce waste.Story continuesWith the Fresh Items Ingredients Management API and Zero Waste cloud service extension available for Oracle Retail Merchandising Cloud Service, grocers can manage the sourcing and procurement of the ingredients from within the store to factor in the material cost of those ingredients, inventory implications, and restocking all from easy-to-use mobile applications. For example, strawberries and blueberries from the produce section nearing the end of life, granola, and yogurt could all be flagged as items leaving a store shelf to be used in the deli section to make a parfait. Merchandising can account for the average cost of the produced items based on the current prices of the ingredient items and make all the appropriate stock ledger entries.With these fresh management APIs and extensions, grocers can manage in-store production with complete visibility into inventory, waste, production costs, and finished goods demand, all while offering compelling new products to customers. Other benefits include:End-to-end inventory visibility of inventory of both the orderable ingredient and the produced sellable itemsSupporting more accurate forecasting and ordering for perishable goods and ingredient items for the store and warehouseThe ability to improve margins by optimizing sourcing, procurement, inventory, and salesBetter insight into additional conversion costs involved in transformation beyond the ingredients like labor and packagingReadily available data and intelligence to better plan assortments based on consumer, environmental, ethical, and economic factorsCapabilities to help recognize price volatility and the need to pass the rising cost of ingredients to manufacture finished products to maintain marginsThe ability to manage shelf inventory and monitor products about to expire with freshness-ready sensorsOracle Retail polled more than 5,000 global consumers on their grocery shopping habits last Fall and another 1,000 US consumers this winter.

262,fa26753b-bbaf-33d6-83a7-22d1d5c965ef,PSA,2023-04-29,7 Stocks That Can Thrive Even in an Uncertain Economy,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-stocks-thrive-even-uncertain-144349153.html,1682433829,STORY,"['PSA', 'WMT', 'KMB', 'CSV', 'BF-B', 'DUK', 'CL']","[It’s time to be looking for stocks for an uncertain economy. Because, as investors, we face a highly complicated macroeconomic outlook. For one, the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates at the fastest pace in decades. Yet, inflation remains elevated. Two, the war continues to drag on in Eastern Europe. Three, tensions are mounting with China amid a seeming period of deglobalization. In short, there are a lot of things that could potentially go wrong for investors over the next 12 months.Yet, over time, the stock market has a way of rising even in the face of adversity. And it generally pays to stay invested even in uncertain times. As such, a smart move could be to buy resilient stocks — the sorts of defensive stocks that can thrive even if the economy tips into a recession. Here are seven safe stocks to put on your watchlist today.WMTWalmart$152.81DUKDuke Energy$99.41BF-A BF-BBrown-Forman$64.49CLColgate-Palmolive$78.33KMBKimberly Clark$146.23PSAPublic Storage$287.44CSVCarriage Services$28.36Walmart (WMT)Man holding stacks of money. Millionaire.Source: Epic Cure / ShutterstockThe Dow Jones Index is made up of 30 of the largest, most conservative, most stable blue-chip companies in America. Despite that, if you invested in all 30 Dow stocks in 2007, at that market peak, you were in for a rough ride as the index lost nearly half its value between then and March 2009.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsHowever, just one of the 30 Dow stocks increased in value over that span. That would be Walmart (NYSE:WMT). If a company could make it through the 2008 financial crisis while delivering a positive shareholder return, it is probably going to be fine in whatever economic shocks come in the future.Walmart’s strength is that it is known for its everyday low prices. Over the years, Walmart has built a tremendous brand around providing unbeatable value to consumers. Even in unsettling times, such as the current inflationary conditions we face today, Walmart’s commitment to delivering extraordinary value speaks to consumers. Times are hard right now. People are going to be trading down, prioritizing budget over style. Walmart is perfectly positioned to pick up market share as people revisit their shopping patterns.Story continuesDuke Energy (DUK)An image of a street sign post with directions labeled ""Buy"", ""Hold"", and ""Sell""Source: PX Media / ShutterstockDuke Energy (NYSE:DUK) is a leading power utility. The recession-resistant appeal should be clear; people will keep paying their power bills even as they have to cut other expenses. The company has also enjoyed strong growth in recent years as it operates in markets with rapid population growth, such as Florida. The pandemic-era housing market saw a ton of folks move into Florida, North Carolina, and other key Duke operating regions.Plus, it has a huge position in renewable power and green energy. The firm is building 3,100 MW of new solar by 2028, along with 1,600 MW of battery storage by 2029. It has efforts in onshore wind and other promising fields as well. And, with the way regulated utility works, Duke often receives guaranteed returns on these green investments.DUK stock has sold off 15% over the past year. This has set up an intriguing entry point today, with the stock at 17 times forward earnings while offering a 4.1% dividend yield.Brown-Forman (BF-A) (BF-B)A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.Source: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.comThere’s perhaps no industry more recession-proof than the spirits industry. Brown-Forman (NYSE:BF-A) (NYSE:BF-B) has been manufacturing its Jack Daniels whisky at a stiff 80-proof for decades, and it has plenty of other strong spirits as well.Jack Daniels is such a remarkable brand that its company was able to stay in business even during America’s long Prohibition period. If a whiskey company can survive that, it can survive just about anything. And the Brown-Forman of nowadays has enjoyed tremendous growth. It has made Jack Daniels a global brand, known from Southeast Asia to Latin America and everywhere in between. Shrewd acquisitions, such as the purchase of Herradura tequila many years ago, have broadened the company’s brand profile.In addition, a smart move into ready-to-drink beverages has proven profitable. A recent deal to launch Jack &amp; Coke in a can with Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) should boost sales even further. Whether times are good or people are drinking through the down days, alcohol demand tends to be stable. Brown-Forman shares have produced tremendous returns over the decades, and that should continue for many years to come.Colgate-Palmolive (CL)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar bills. Bank stocksSource: shutterstock.com/CC7Another resilient category in any recession is consumer essentials. Regardless of what the economy is doing, people are going to brush their teeth and use soap. Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) is a leading producer of goods for these sorts of basic needs. Colgate has a tremendous market share for toothpaste, particularly so in developing countries. And Colgate-Palmolive’s other hygiene products are a staple in people’s pantries.CL stock has been an underperformer recently as sales dipped following a pandemic-induced stocking-up period. In addition, higher commodity prices have pressured profit margins. But the long-term demand picture for hygiene and cleaning products is unlikely to change much. Colgate isn’t glamorous, but it produces stable cash flows and reliable dividends in all economic climates.Kimberly-Clark (KMB)tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comSticking with the consumer essential themes, Kimberly-Clark (NYSE:KMB) is another great defensive stock holding. The firm is known for making toilet paper and other bathroom essentials. It is also involved in hand soap, cleaning supplies, and other such necessities. In addition, it is a major player in both diapers and incontinence products, giving it a cradle-to-grave presence in peoples’ lives.Like Colgate, KMB stock hasn’t been much to write home about over the past year or two. Shares enjoyed an initial surge in 2020 as people bought extra toilet paper, but the stock hasn’t moved since then.Things could be set to heat up for Kimberly-Clark, however. Inflationary pressures are receding as the price of lumber (and thus wood pulp) along with other important input goods has plunged. As the economy normalizes, Kimberly-Clark’s profit margins should stabilize, leading the company to rising profitability. In the meantime, shares offer a sturdy 3.3% dividend yield.Public Storage (PSA)Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words ""buy"" and ""sell"" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image.Source: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.comIt’s been a rough ride for real estate investment trusts (REITs) over the past year. As interest rates have soared, people are demanding higher dividend yields from their income stocks. In addition, rising interest rates will cause REITs to have to pay higher amounts of interest on their debts. However, not all REITs deserve to be sold off so sharply. Public Storage (NYSE:PSA), for example, is in a good place since it is the leader in the storage arena.Storage is one of the few areas within real estate that is recession-proof. That’s because people still need to store their stuff even during hard times. Indeed, storage stocks surged in 2008 as foreclosures spiked. Recessions can sometimes stimulate additional demand. People that move to different apartments or are foreclosed upon may need to take advantage of Public Storage services in the interim.PSA stock has dropped more than 25% over the past year, making it a relative bargain today. The dividend yield has crept up above the 4% mark. And with its industry-leading size and more planned acquisitions on the way, Public Storage has the brand and scale to keep dominating the industry for many years to come.Carriage Services (CSV)a green button on a keyboard has an arrow pointing upward with the word ""Buy"". representing safe stocks to buySource: AdityaB. Photography/ShutterStock.comCarriage Services (NYSE:CSV) is perhaps the ultimate recession-proof stock. It is, after all, a company that provides funeral services. Even an economic shock can’t disrupt father time. Carriage Services is present in all parts of its industry; it offers funerals, cemetery services, and related products such as caskets and urns.Shares were quiet for many years. However, management has gotten more aggressive in recent years. It has engaged in a massive share buyback program, which has boosted earnings considerably. CSV stock became overvalued amid the euphoric market conditions of 2021. However, shares have now fallen by more than half since their peak, which puts shares at just 13 times forward earnings. That’s a great entry point for this defensive stock.On the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in BF-A stock.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 12 major stocks, including American Express Co. (AXP), Enbridge Inc. (ENB) and Micron Technology, Inc. (MU). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Shares of American Express have outperformed the Zacks Financial - Miscellaneous Services industry over the past six months (+7.6% vs. -2.5%). The company has adopted several growth initiatives, such as launching new products, reaching new agreements and forging alliances, are boosting its revenues. We expect the top line at $60.8 billion in 2023.Consumer spending on T&amp;E, which carry higher margins for AmEx, is advancing well. Its balance sheet looks strong with manageable debt. Solid cash-generation abilities enable the pursuit of business investments and capital deployment.However, with higher utilization of the company’s cards, expenses in the form of card member services and card member rewards are likely to strain the margins. Also, marketing and business development expense is expected to rise. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.(You can read the full research report on American Express here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Enbridge’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Production and Pipelines industry over the past six months (+4.3% vs. +4.1%). The company has the longest and most sophisticated oil and liquids pipeline system in the world, which spreads across 17,809 miles. Hence, a significant portion of the midstream operator’s earnings is generated from transportation operations, driven by a string of long-term contracts.ENB sanctioned C$8 billion of organic growth projects in 2022, bringing its total backlog to C$17 billion. The firm expects to put more than C$10 billion growth projects into service in 2024 and beyond. This is expected to generate significant EBITDA growth in the coming years.However, ENB’s significant debt exposure is concerning. ENB reported weak fourth-quarter results due to lower contributions from the Renewable Power Generation segment. Also, it has mostly been yielding lower dividends than the industry.  As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.(You can read the full research report on Enbridge here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Micron Technology have outperformed the Zacks Semiconductor Memory industry over the past six months (+17.0% vs. +14.9%). The company is witnessing growing demand for memory chips from cloud-computing providers and acceleration in 5G (fifth-generation) cellular network adoptions.Rising mix of high-value solutions, 5G adoption in Internet of Things devices and wireless infrastructure, enhancement in customer engagement and improvement in cost structure are growth drivers.Nonetheless, Micron near-term prospect looks gloomy as weakening consumer spending is negatively impacting demand for memory chips used in personal computers (PCs) and smartphones. Bit shipments for the DRAM and NAND memory chips may decline in the near-term as PC makers are adjusting their inventory due to weakened demand.(You can read the full research report on Micron Technology here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.

264,b02cef12-6b54-3036-b247-55e1a6d892d4,MU,2023-04-29,Governor Hochul and Micron Announce Members of Community Engagement Committee to Advise on Nation-Leading Semiconductor Project,GlobeNewswire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/governor-hochul-micron-announce-members-171400987.html,1682702040,STORY,['MU'],"[Micron Technology, Inc.Proven Regional Leaders Melanie Littlejohn and Tim Penix to Helm the Micron Community Engagement Committee as Co-ChairsCommittee will Develop a Community Priorities Document to Guide Strategies in Areas such as Supporting Underrepresented Populations, Workforce Development, Childcare and HousingSYRACUSE, N.Y., April 28, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Governor Kathy Hochul and Micron Technology, Inc. today announced the members of the Micron Community Engagement Committee, including representatives from Central New York and Micron that will support the company’s community investment strategy. The Committee is made up of local stakeholders to ensure meaningful, ground-up participation and discussion of Micron’s implementation and impacts to the larger region and will also include five ex-officio members. The formation of this group is a critical component of the Community Investment Framework agreement made between New York State and Micron in October 2022.Micron’s historic planned investment of up to $100 billion over the next 20-plus years to construct a new megafab in Clay, New York, which is expected to create nearly 50,000 New York jobs, was made possible by the Governor’s Green CHIPS program and the anticipated federal grants and tax credits from the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act. The Committee will work with Micron, Empire State Development (ESD), local governments and regional stakeholders to develop a Community Priorities Document – a guiding strategy for investing the funding allotted in the Micron Community Investment Framework into existing and new opportunities that benefit residents. This includes programs and initiatives that support specific priorities for underrepresented communities.“The $100 billion investment by Micron, by far the largest investment in New York State history, and the tens of thousands of jobs that follow also unearths challenges such as housing, workforce needs, land use and other complex issues. The Committee, in concert with Micron, ESD and local partners, will tackle these issues head-on to ensure New Yorkers get the greatest benefit from these extraordinary opportunities,” said Governor Hochul. “I am also thrilled that Melanie Littlejohn and Tim Penix will lead the Green CHIPS Community Engagement Committee. These two individuals have years of public service in Central New York and their dedication to the region is second to none.”Story continues""We are delighted to be in Central New York to celebrate with Governor Hochul, the newly appointed members of the Micron Community Engagement Committee and other local partners the remarkable progress that has taken place since we announced the site of our leading-edge memory megafab here six months ago,” said Micron President and CEO Sanjay Mehrotra. “The $500 million Green CHIPS Community Investment Fund will help build and transform a workforce for the future, and the Micron Community Engagement Committee will ensure that the wide-ranging benefits and opportunities our investments will bring to Central New York are available for all.”Melanie Littlejohn, Vice President for New York Customer and Community Management at National Grid, and Tim Penix, Vice President of the Syracuse Educational Opportunity Center, have been selected as the committee co-chairs due to their proven public service track records and expertise and will assist in the management of this fund to better the lives of Central New Yorkers. In addition to the co-chairs, the members of the Committee are:April Arnzen – Senior Vice President and Chief People Officer, MicronKaren Belcher – Executive Director, Food Bank of Central New YorkDonna DeSiato – Superintendent, East Syracuse Minoa School DistrictBishop Ronald Dewberry – Senior Pastor, New Life Temple of PraiseKristi Eck – Chief of Staff, SUNY OswegoCourtney Geduldig – Corporate Vice President, Global Public and Government Affairs, MicronMark Hall – President and CEO, Syracuse Community HealthJasenko Mondom – Employment Specialist, Refugee Assistance Program at Syracuse City School DistrictMeg O'Connell – Executive Director, Allyn Family FoundationHazel Powless – Haudenosaunne Environmental Task Force, Onondaga NationKerry Quaglia – Founder and CEO, Home HeadQuartersSheena Solomon – Executive Director, The Gifford FoundationEx Officio MembersRob Beard – SVP and General Counsel, MicronKevin Younis – COO and Executive Deputy Commissioner, Empire State DevelopmentIsabelle Harris – Director of Strategic Initiatives, Onondaga CountySharon Owens – Deputy Mayor, City of SyracuseDamian Ulatowski – Supervisor, Town of ClayThe Committee will focus on workforce development and diversity in the labor force; education and training in STEM fields to create opportunities for good paying jobs at Micron and supply-chain partners; expansion of safe and affordable housing; breaking down barriers to the workforce such as childcare and transportation and improvements to community assets and institutions that contribute to civic identity and well-being. This will ultimately inform a document that will be used as a road map that allows for participation and/or enhancement beyond the initial objectives of this effort.The Committee’s work will also complement the newly announced Governor’s Office of Semiconductor Expansion, Management and Integration (GO SEMI), which will be led by ESD and supported by experts from numerous state agencies. The office will work in coordination with federal and local partners and coordinate investments in the semiconductor industry, shaping and implementing a broader, national model for maximizing industry and community returns on such public/private partnerships.Micron Community Engagement Committee Co-Chair Melanie Littlejohn said, “It’s an honor to have been selected by Governor Hochul to represent Central New Yorkers on the Micron Community Engagement Committee. I’ve been impressed by the commitment of Micron, State and federal stakeholders to invest in the local community from the very first meetings. The benefits of these efforts will go beyond its initial hires – this rising tide will lift our students, our small business owners, our diverse bankers, our childcare providers and so many more people here in my hometown of Syracuse.”Micron Community Engagement Committee Co-Chair Tim Penix said, “Building a fab and its workforce of thousands doesn’t happen overnight. Micron is doing the work today to bring this community along for a generational opportunity to join the technology industry and be a part of America’s legendary innovation. Central New York’s educational institutions are second to none. I’m thrilled to represent the thousands of students, from apprentices to doctoral candidates, who will find opportunities at Micron.”Micron Senior Vice President and Chief People Officer April Arnzen said, “Every Central New Yorker should be able to benefit from the transformation that will be spurred by the once-in-a-lifetime opportunities occurring in their backyard. We are excited to work with Tim, Melanie and the diverse members of the Committee to ensure the impact of Micron’s local investment is positive, far-reaching and brings benefits for all. We thank Governor Hochul and our federal, state and local partners for their dedication in positioning New York as a leader in domestic semiconductor manufacturing and their recognition that community-centered economic development is the key to long-term success.”Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer said, “There is no doubt that Micron's $100 billion investment in Central New York will fundamentally transform the region and all of Upstate New York, making it a global hub for manufacturing and innovation and bringing tens of thousands of good-paying jobs to the state. A critical component of securing the future success of this project is building and developing a workforce for the future. The Micron Community Engagement Committee will play a vital role in ensuring all Central New Yorkers, regardless of background, are equipped with the skills and provided the support to secure these new manufacturing and innovation jobs making the most leading-edge memory chips in the world. I’m so excited to see the incredible impact that the newest members of the Committee will have in developing a guiding strategy to ensure the success of Micron’s game changing investment for the entire CNY community.”U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand said, “Micron’s tremendous investment will bring as many as 50,000 jobs to Central New York. The Community Engagement Committee will give New Yorkers a seat at the table, and ensure New York’s workforce receives training for good-paying STEM jobs that will boost our advanced economy and pave the way for U.S. leadership in semiconductor technology. Importantly, it will help New Yorkers - especially in underrepresented and rural areas - with support for things like high-quality child care, investments in education, philanthropy, community building, and more.”ESD President, CEO and Commissioner Hope Knight said, “New York has made many strategic investments to attract the semiconductor industry and these investments, coupled with the Green CHIPS program and the federal CHIPS and Science Act New York are poised to see unparalleled growth across the state as we build the semiconductor industry ecosystem. I applaud Governor Hochul’s commitment to growing this vital industry in New York State while insuring that it happens with the support from our residents, our local governments and especially in the communities it impacts the most.”State Senator John W. Mannion said, “The Micron investment has always been about more than just computer chips and jobs – it is a once in a generation opportunity to transform our communities and we need local voices at the table to make sure we get it right. The formation of the Micron Community Engagement Committee is a powerful step towards ensuring that the community's needs are heard and met. Together, with Micron and our local, state, and federal partners, we can build a brighter future for Central New York and create opportunities for all of our residents and communities across the 50th Senate District.”Onondaga County Executive Ryan McMahon said, “From day one, Onondaga County knew the greatest advantage we had in recruiting Micron was our community and the story we had to share and it was that very story that ultimately led Micron to believe in us. Micron has always made it clear they wanted to become a part of our community and with the creation of the Micron Community Engagement Committee they are following through on their commitment. By engaging local leaders and stakeholders, we will continue our unprecedented collaboration to ensure that every member of community is able to experience and feel the historic investment being made by Micron.""Syracuse Mayor Ben Walsh said, “The Micron Community Engagement Committee is another example of New York State and Syracuse leading the way. It signifies the essential role of community input in making sure economic growth creates opportunity for all. The City of Syracuse will be well represented on the committee by Deputy Mayor Sharon Owens who is deeply connected to the unique needs of people who live and work in the city. I applaud Governor Hochul, Sanjay Mehrotra and all of the project partners for their vision in creating the investment fund and in ensuring there is a structure for meaningful input from the community.CenterState CEO Rob Simpson said, “The historic Community Investment Framework, negotiated as a part of this deal, represents one of the largest corporate commitments ever to inclusive and sustainable growth and broadly shared community benefits. We applaud Micron's values and stewardship and we are confident that each of these leaders will work with Micron and New York State to ensure that this progress and prosperity is felt by all in our community. We look forward to being active partners and supporting these efforts.”About the Co-ChairsMelanie Littlejohn serves as the Vice President for New York Customer and Community Management at National Grid, where she is responsible for leading stakeholder management statewide to ensure processes, planning and best practices are delivered consistently to National Grid’s New York customers.

266,6e565f65-cfc6-3232-93e3-7d5b2bbd0c02,FIS,2023-04-29,Wall Street Analysts Believe Fidelity National (FIS) Could Rally 53.53%: Here's is How to Trade,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-analysts-believe-fidelity-135501847.html,1682690101,STORY,"['TGT', 'FIS']","[Fidelity National Information Services (FIS) closed the last trading session at $56.31, gaining 7.9% over the past four weeks, but there could be plenty of upside left in the stock if short-term price targets set by Wall Street analysts are any guide. The mean price target of $86.45 indicates a 53.5% upside potential.The mean estimate comprises 22 short-term price targets with a standard deviation of $24.98. While the lowest estimate of $63 indicates an 11.9% increase from the current price level, the most optimistic analyst expects the stock to surge 184.1% to reach $160. It's very important to note the standard deviation here, as it helps understand the variability of the estimates. The smaller the standard deviation, the greater the agreement among analysts.While the consensus price target is a much-coveted metric for investors, solely banking on this metric to make an investment decision may not be wise at all. That's because the ability and unbiasedness of analysts in setting price targets have long been questionable.However, an impressive consensus price target is not the only factor that indicates a potential upside in FIS. This view is strengthened by the agreement among analysts that the company will report better earnings than what they estimated earlier. Though a positive trend in earnings estimate revisions doesn't give any idea as to how much the stock could surge, it has proven effective in predicting an upside.Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseZacks Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Chart for FISHere's What You Should Know About Analysts' Price TargetsAccording to researchers at several universities across the globe, a price target is one of many pieces of information about a stock that misleads investors far more often than it guides. In fact, empirical research shows that price targets set by several analysts, irrespective of the extent of agreement, rarely indicate where the price of a stock could actually be heading.While Wall Street analysts have deep knowledge of a company's fundamentals and the sensitivity of its business to economic and industry issues, many of them tend to set overly optimistic price targets. Are you wondering why?Story continuesThey usually do that to drum up interest in shares of companies that their firms either have existing business relationships with or are looking to be associated with. In other words, business incentives of firms covering a stock often result in inflated price targets set by analysts.However, a tight clustering of price targets, which is represented by a low standard deviation, indicates that analysts have a high degree of agreement about the direction and magnitude of a stock's price movement. While that doesn't necessarily mean the stock will hit the average price target, it could be a good starting point for further research aimed at identifying the potential fundamental driving forces.That said, while investors should not entirely ignore price targets, making an investment decision solely based on them could lead to disappointing ROI. So, price targets should always be treated with a high degree of skepticism.Why FIS Could Witness a Solid UpsideAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason to expect an upside in the stock. That's because empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current year, three estimates have moved higher over the last 30 days compared to no negative revision. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased 0.1%.Moreover, FIS currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on four factors related to earnings estimates. Given an impressive externally-audited track record, this is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential upside in the near term. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, while the consensus price target may not be a reliable indicator of how much FIS could gain, the direction of price movement it implies does appear to be a good guide.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated. Information concerning risk factors that could cause such differences are described in the press release covering our first quarter 2023 results as well as having been posted on our website.Now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg Case, CEO of Aon plc.Gregory Clarence CaseThanks very much, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter conference call. I'm joined by Christa Davies, our CFO; and Eric Andersen, our President. As in previous quarters, for your reference, we posted a detailed financial presentation on our website.Before we begin, as always, we want to thank our colleagues for the great work they are doing every day around the world to help our clients and each other. We continue to live in a world where volatility, complexity and uncertainty are increasing. And in this environment, our clients are being asked to make decisions faster than ever. And as a result, we see strong and ongoing demand for our advice and solutions. As many of our clients realize that remaining in defensive or reactive mode is not sufficient. And in fact, a pivot to offense is ultimately necessary to win and achieve their objectives.Clients are telling us there are 2 primary areas where they're urgently looking for a competitive advantage: Risk and People. Addressing these challenges requires that we bring the best from across our firm to enable our clients to make better decisions, which is the core of Aon United.Given these ongoing demand, our strategy positions Aon as uniquely capable of helping clients go on offsets and make better decisions that mitigate risk to their business and maximize the impact and engagement of their people.Take ESG or Environmental, Social and Governance as an example. These are major interconnected categories that cut across traditional silos. Our clients need a broad strategic view to understand and assess all the risks around ESG and any targeted solutions and capabilities to solve for these risks.Our recently published ESG impact report describes our work helping clients address these issues as well as the impact across our firm. And we're delighted to report on our own progress against long-standing commitments in these essential areas.First, on environmental. We're making progress toward our goal of net zero emissions by 2030 and have reduced our overall Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions footprint by 16% from our 2019 baseline and by 4% in 2022, enabled by efforts like smart working and supplier centralization through Aon Business Services.On social, and specifically around our colleagues, Aon United is not just a strategy. It's our culture, and it reflects our commitment to inclusion, diversity and the well-being of our colleagues. This year, we're continuing to embed IND principles and practices and to hold ourselves accountable with increased transparency and oversight at all levels of the organization, starting at the top with our Board of Directors.On diversity, for example, we reported progress in 2022 and the percentage of female people managers and U.S. ethnically and racially diverse managers. In 2022, we also enhanced focus on learning, development, engagement and wellbeing. Because we know that supporting our colleagues is not only the right thing to do for them, but it also ensures we retain, grow and develop the best talent to continue to support our clients.And finally, on governance. We've highlighted Board review of top ESG and climate-related risks and actions from our ESG Steering Committee as well as steps on cybersecurity and privacy, all aligned with our long-standing overall enterprise risk management strategy.While we're proud to report on these steps in our report, there is still work to do. And at the same time, we're even more excited about the work we're doing to help clients as many risks connected to progress on ESG aligned with our core businesses.On the people side, for example, we continue to develop new solutions while bringing together existing capabilities across different markets and geographies to address specific needs. One recent client, facing significant organizational change, realize many of our employees were unsure and unclear about titles, career ladders, compensation mechanics. And at the same time, this client needed to reduce cost, increase efficiency and simplicity, which they knew would drive engagement. To address, we brought expertise from around the firm. Our commercial risk team brought deep understanding of this client strategy and desired culture. Our Aon Business Services platform served as a powerful example of how we could help them simplify their operations and reduce costs.Finally, our health and human capital teams brought a series of solutions, including optimization of global benefits and a skills taxonomy strategy to increase employee alignment and engagement. And while the solution leverages many existing offerings, the real innovation is bringing these pieces together along with our Aon Business Services team, who provided insight and change management expertise around moving to a Business Services model, an essential piece of the puzzle for our client.The result, our client is driving increased engagement with a clear, more effective benefit structure and talent strategy and outsourcing capabilities that will help drive simplicity and efficiency, all enabled by our teams coming together as Aon United. And we see examples like this across the firm every day as we help our clients manage risk and support their people. They demonstrate the opportunity we have to continue delivering innovative solutions at scale to address our clients' unmet needs at a time when doing so has never been more important.Turning to financial performance. In the first quarter, we delivered very strong organic revenue growth across our solution lines, with 9% growth in Reinsurance, 8% growth in Health Solutions and 6% growth in both Wealth Solutions and Commercial Risk Solutions.In Reinsurance, our teams were exceptional in guiding our clients to the 1/1 renewal environment demonstrating the strength of our team's advice, data-driven analytics, modeling and execution capabilities.In Health Solutions, we saw strength in core H&amp;B and ensuing capital in a seasonally larger quarter for European health renewal, as our teams help clients navigate the ongoing challenging environment for their people, encompassing employee health, rewards, engagement and well-being.In Wealth Solutions, our team delivered another very strong performance with 6% growth, driven by ongoing trends around regulatory changes like GMP equalization, pension risk transfer and the levering impacts of the fixed income market volatility as our teams help clients reassess and potentially adjust their strategies.We would note that after 2 very strong quarters, Q2 '23 will be impacted by performance fees in the prior year period.And finally, Commercial Risk Solutions grew 6% in the quarter with strength in Europe and U.K., in their seasonally largest quarter. Overall, we observed the property market remains an area of increasing challenge and volatility. Market dynamics are causing reinsurers to shift risk appetites, requiring primary areas to accept more risk, which in turn means property placements are even more challenging for our clients. In this environment, our strength in analytics and the ability to respond to clients' need for cover in a capital-agnostic way, bringing capability across reinsurance and commercial risk is essential. Our capabilities enable us to assess an [ally's] integrated broking options, including traditional risk placements, wholesale, MGAs, facultative, captives and insurance-like securities. By helping clients assess options across capital sources, we ensure they were able to optimize their own total cost of risk and risk appetite.For example, one client came to us looking to consolidate to a single property and [terrorism] program across 11 asset classes with over $80 billion in property values. Our team came together seamlessly across geographies and specialties to develop a program that leverage traditional carriers around the world and a captive, successfully completing the program and driving significant cost savings for our clients, all enabled by the work we've done to break down barriers within our firm through Aon United.Overall, in the quarter, we're pleased with performance of the strength of our Aon United Strategy and Aon Business Services platform translated 7% organic revenue growth into 70 basis points of operating margin expansion, net of ongoing investment in the business for long-term growth.In this period of ongoing external volatility and increasingly interconnected risk, the opportunity for us to help clients is greater than ever, position us very well to continue driving results in 2023 and over the long term.Now I'd like to turn the call over to Christa for her thoughts on our financial performance and long-term outlook for continued shareholder value creation. Christa?Story continuesChrista DaviesThanks so much, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As Greg highlighted, we delivered strong operational performance in the first quarter, highlighted by 7% organic revenue growth that translated into 70 basis points of adjusted margin expansion. This is a strong start to the year, and we're very well positioned to continue driving results in 2023 and over the long term.As I reflect on the quarter, as Greg noted, organic revenue growth was 7%, driven by ongoing strong retention and net new business generation. We continue to expect mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth for the full year 2023 and over the long term.I would also note that reported revenue growth of 5% includes an unfavorable impact from changes in FX of 3%, driven primarily by a weaker euro versus the U.S. dollar, as Q1 is our seasonally largest quarter for euro-denominated revenues. I'd also highlight fiduciary investment income, which is not included in our organic revenue growth, was $52 million or 1.4%.Moving to operating performance. We delivered strong operational improvement with adjusted operating margins of 38.7%, an increase of 70 basis points, driven by organic revenue growth and efficiencies of Aon Business services, overcoming expense growth, including some investments in colleagues and technology to drive long-term growth and some ongoing resumption of T&amp;E, especially compared to the prior year period when business travel was still suppressed by COVID-19.Looking forward, we expect to deliver margin expansion in 2023 and over the long term as we continue our track record of cost discipline and managing investments in long-term growth on an ROIC basis.As we've previously communicated, we think about margins over the course of a full year, driven by 3 areas. The first is top line revenue growth. The second is portfolio mix shift to higher-margin businesses as we invest disproportionately in areas of increasingly client demand, supported by data-driven solutions. And the third area is increased operating leverage from ongoing productivity improvements from our Aon Business Services platform.I'd highlight, Aon Business Services continues to be a key contributor to margin expansion and represents a competitive advantage, especially in an inflationary market. Our Aon Business Services platform continues to drive efficiency gains, improved quality and service, and increased innovation at scale. And related to Aon Business Services, I'd like to highlight the essential role of Aon Business Services in enabling our climate net zero goals.As a professional services firm, the biggest part of our own emissions is from our supply chain. Through the Aon Business Services organization, 90% of the spend is managed through preferred channels, which enables us to drive efficiency and also deploy decarbonization strategies. As Greg said, this resulted in a 4% reduction in emissions last year, while also allowing us to increase supply diversity utilization to 6% of our addressable U.S. spend in support of our goals around inclusion and diversity, both meaningful accomplishments that are enabled by our Aon United strategy.Organic growth and margin expansion translated into adjusted EPS growth of 7%. As noted in our earnings material, FX translation was an unfavorable impact of approximately $0.14 per share. If [currency] remain stable at today's rates, we would expect an unfavorable impact of approximately $0.04 per share in the second quarter and $0.14 per share for the full year 2023.I'd also note other expense had a $0.19 per share unfavorable impact in the quarter, including a $0.05 per share unfavorable impact from an increase in noncash net periodic pension costs, in line with what we communicated previously, as well as an unfavorable impact from a gain on sale of business in the prior year period and balance sheet FX remeasurement in the current period. We expect the $0.05 per share unfavorable impact from increased net periodic pension costs to continue for each quarter this year, and we currently expect gains on divestitures to be immaterial for the full year.Turning to free cash flow and capital allocation. I'd note Q1 has historically been our seasonally smallest quarter from a cash flow standpoint, due primarily to incentive compensation payments. And as we've communicated before, free cash flow can be lumpy from quarter-to-quarter. Free cash flow decreased 17% to $367 million, primarily driven by higher cash tax payments and a $53 million increase in CapEx.CapEx was elevated in the first quarter compared to the prior year period as we initiated a number of projects, with spend heavily weighted in Q1 across technology to drive long-term growth and real estate aligned with our smart working strategy. I'd note, CapEx can be lumpier quarter-to-quarter, and we expect an investment of $200 million to $225 million to 2023. As we've said before, we manage CapEx like all of our investments on a disciplined ROIC basis. Our outlook for free cash flow growth in 2023 and beyond remains strong, and we continue to expect double-digit free cash flow growth for the full year and over the long term, driven by operating income growth and working capital improvements.Given our strong outlook for free cash flow growth in 2023 and beyond, we expect share repurchase to continue to remain our highest ROIC opportunity for capital allocation. We believe we're significantly undervalued in the market today, highlighted by approximately $550 million of share repurchase in the quarter. We also expect to continue to invest organically and inorganically in content and capabilities that we can scale to address unmet client needs.Our M&amp;A pipeline continues to be focused on our priority areas that will bring scalable solutions to our clients' growing and evolving challenges. We will continue to actively manage the portfolio and assess all capital allocation decisions on an ROIC basis.Turning now to our balance sheet and debt capacity. We remain confident in the strength of our balance sheet and manage liquidity risk through a well-laddered debt maturity profile. In Q1, we issued $750 million of 10-year senior notes, consistent with our past practice, an expectation to add incremental debt as EBITDA grows over the long term, while maintaining our current investment-grade credit ratings.Factoring in this issuance, I'd note that our term debt is all fixed rate with a weighted average interest rate of approximately 4% and a weighted average maturity of approximately 11 years. Our first quarter results reflect strong operational performance, driven by our Aon United strategy. We start the year in a position of strength and expect to continue to make progress on our key financial metrics and our commitment to drive long-term shareholder value creation.With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator, and we'd be delighted to take your questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan.Jamminder Singh BhullarSo first, I just had a question on your expectations for the tax rate for 2023. It was high. I think it was around 19.5% in the first quarter that's higher than the 17% to 18% range you've had the last few years. But what drove that? And what are your expectations for the tax rate for this year?Christa DaviesThanks so much for the question, Jimmy. As you know, we don't give guidance on the tax rate going forward. But if I look back historically, exclusive of the impact of discrete items, which can be positive or negative in any quarter, our historical underlying rate has been 18% for the last 5 years.Jamminder Singh BhullarAnd then the changes in Singapore and a few other places, should those have a material impact? Or is there any reason to expect the rate to be different this year than in the past?Christa DaviesJimmy, we feel really confident about our overall capital structure for the company. We're domiciled in [Alan]. We run a global capital pool, and we run a global cash pulling structure, and that gives us enormous flexibility as we think about any future legislation.Jamminder Singh BhullarOkay. And then just lastly, on fiduciary investment income, assuming rates stay where they are, is there further ramp-up in that, that you'd expect as like your portfolio sort of resets to where rates have gone? Or has the full impact of the rise in rates over the past several quarters, is it already reflected in your numbers?Christa DaviesYes. So what we would say is, as we roll through, we really saw the pickup in fiduciary investment income in Q3 last year. So you'll see the upside in Q2 and then less as we move through the rest of the year. I would note, as you think about our overall fiduciary balances, we have, on average, $6.5 billion of fiduciary investment -- of fiduciary assets. And every 100 basis point increase in the short end of the interest rate curve is $65 million, top line and bottom line. You should think about those fiduciary assets, Jimmy, as split roughly 50-50 between the U.S. and international.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Andrew Kligerman with Credit Suisse.Andrew Scott KligermanYou mentioned in the release that the U.S. grew modestly in terms of organic revenue growth in Commercial Risk Solutions. And transaction and M&amp;A was probably the very tough comp. So it looks like as we get into the second quarter and the rest of the year, that's really not a tough comp anymore. Could you give any sense of what that impact was in the quarter? And should we expect going into the next 3 quarters that we could see a significant contribution to organic growth?Gregory Clarence CaseSo first of all, Andrew, thanks very much for the question. We appreciate it. We would observe, by the way, across the board, if you think about sort of growth for the quarter, it's been a strong quarter for us, 6% organic across all the solution lines. I think it may be the first time we've accomplished that in a long time, and it's really been terrific.On the U.S. side, it's an exceptionally strong business. You highlighted a great very, very strong comp last year and then just very, very strong capability in the specialty areas that a few of which have been under pressure. But we continue to invest in them because we know they're going to be terrific long term. So for us, listen, continued momentum across the board. And as the market shifts a bit on the M&amp;A and transaction side, we're going to obviously benefit from that. Eric, anything else you'd add?Eric AndersenNo, Greg, I think you covered it well. I think it's still foundationally very strong. The work that we're doing for our clients today on the commercial risk side with all that's happening in the market, whether it's risk analytics, captives, the broad suite of capabilities we can help them with as they're navigating the market dynamics are still very strong. And so pretty positive on it.Andrew Scott KligermanSo basically, just tell me if I'm interpreting it right, with all these amazing things you're doing, you had a pretty big drag from transaction M&amp;A, that goes away, we could see potentially an even better organic growth quarter next quarter?Eric AndersenI would say the first quarter last year was a very strong quarter for commercial risk. The Transaction Solutions business, I think, as Greg said, great capability subject to, obviously, some outside market dynamics that, -- but we feel really strongly about that team. And when that comes back, certainly holding that skill set for us is such a great value driver for clients that we're excited about it.Andrew Scott KligermanGot it. Okay. And then Christa mentioned about $200 million to $225 million of CapEx expenditure targeted for this year. You're doing so many interesting things with ABS and other technologies. Anything stand out that you're investing in right now that will drive future growth?Christa DaviesI mean, the CapEx that I mentioned, the $200 million to $225 million, Andrew, I would say, is primarily focused on IT investments to drive long-term growth. So whether that's scale investments in our platforms to help clients innovate or whether that's in security and infrastructure to keep our clients better protected and the firm better protected, and so we're investing a lot in our Aon Business Services platform, better connectivity, better data analytics, better insight. And it's really helping our clients deliver great value to our clients -- our colleagues deliver great value to our clients.Andrew Scott KligermanGot it. Great. And then just last quickly, M&amp;A pipeline and any areas of interest right now? Should we expect anything as the year progresses?Christa DaviesYes. Thanks for the question. We have a fantastic M&amp;A pipeline, and it is focused on our highest growth, highest margin, highest return on capital opportunities. And it reflects the areas we continue to invest in, areas of content and capability that we can scale across the firm. In areas like data analytics, you saw us do Tyche and [ERN] last year in that data analytic intensive area, areas like health and wellness and human capital, areas like our core risk offerings and helping our clients be able to model and manage risk better. And so we've got lots of areas of great opportunity around the globe, and we're really excited about it.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Robert Cox with Goldman Sachs.Robert CoxCurious if there's any way you can help us quantify or help better understand the impact that higher T&amp;E and an inflation is having on the expense base?Christa DaviesSo what I would tell you is, if you look at that other general expense, which is up 20%, that is primarily driven by T&amp;E. And the thing I would note is you're comparing it against Q1 2022, which was an unusually low year in terms of -- usually a low quarter in terms of T&amp;E, because of COVID.Robert CoxOkay. Got it. And is there anything to sort of look into -- I noticed in the presentation that you added -- that the margin expansion for this year is net of investment in long-term growth. Is that more of just calling out that the things you guys are doing in terms of investing? Or is there something to look into that?Christa DaviesIt's exactly the same as always. So what we would say is we grow margins each and every year. And our margin expansion for the last 12 years has been 1,120 basis points or approximately 90 basis points a year. And that 90 basis points a year over the last 12 years has been a gross margin expansion higher than that, and then it nets to 90 basis points, net of the investments we're making in long-term growth. So that is consistent with the way we drive margins each and every year.Robert CoxOkay. Perfect. And then maybe just shifting to the Wealth segment, very strong and above-average growth in Wealth for a second straight quarter kind of despite some headwinds in the investment business. Curious how long you expect these tailwinds could play out? Is it quarters? Is it a year? How long should we be thinking about that?Gregory Clarence CaseListen, as you highlight, Robert, teams have done a terrific job in really over multiple years, we look at the last 2 quarters, the overall performance exceptional, really reflecting a lot of what's going on in the world out there. The regulatory changes we highlighted around GMP and others, pension risk transfer, and they were just uniquely well positioned to sort of address that. So that's really what's driving the demand from the client standpoint, and the team has done a terrific job.We did highlight in the opening comments, listen, the comp for next quarter is going to be particularly challenging in terms of sort of where we are. But fundamentals, exceptionally strong, and the Wealth's team has done a terrific job. Eric, what else would you add to that?Eric AndersenYes, the minor point I would say, Greg, is that it's a global answer. We're seeing growth in the U.K., in particular, especially around the guaranteed minimum pension piece, but also in North America and in Europe. And so the retirement side of Wealth has been very strong for us and really like -- and you called out the investment consulting, investment advisory business. So the challenges there will lap eventually, but you've described it right.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Weston Bloomer with UBS.Weston Clay BloomerMy first question, I noticed real estate costs were up year-over-year for the first time, I guess, since 2021. Is that primarily just a function of the investments you're making in smart working? And just given the investments in CapEx that you've made, is it fair to assume that, that should continue to grow year-over-year throughout the course of 2023?Christa DaviesYes. So the real estate is up 4%. It's reflecting back to office, in fact, reflecting the investments we made in smart working, as you said. Last year was impacted by FX. But look, I would put this in the context, Weston, of we're going to grow margins each and every year. And as I mentioned, that margin expansion over the last 12 years has been 90 basis points a year. And that margin expansion reflects a gross margin expansion much higher than 90 basis points, offset by investments in the business.And then again, on the CapEx point, we've guided to CapEx for the full year of $200 million to $225 million for the full year. That includes the CapEx investments in IT, in long-term growth and in real estate, in our smart working initiatives. And you should expect CapEx to grow each and every year in line with overall expense growth.Weston Clay BloomerGreat. And a follow-up on the Wealth performance fees. You highlighted a 2Q headwind there. Is there an associated headwind in the back half of the year as well? Or is it just isolated to the second quarter? And is there a margin impact from that as well?Christa DaviesIt is just a Q2 impact. And no, there's not an associated margin impact.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.Elyse Beth GreenspanMy first question, I guess, goes back to tying together some of the prior discussion on margins, right? So Christa, you guys -- you mentioned the historical 90 basis points of margin expansion that Ann has seen over the past 12 years. So I'm just trying to understand why we shouldn't expect that level, so the 90 basis points, in addition to the benefit that you guys are getting from fiduciary investment income, which I calculate was around 80 basis points this quarter? Or are you choosing to reinvest more in the business because of the strong tailwind we have from higher fiduciary investment income?Christa DaviesThanks so much for the question, Elyse. And look, we do think about margins over the course of each year. And as you said, we've driven 1,120 basis points over the last 12 years or 90 basis points a year. And that 90 basis points a year is reflecting a gross margin expansion much higher, net of investments we make in the business each and every year.And we do -- we did see in Q1, 70 basis points of margin expansion, with 80 basis points of favorable impact from fiduciary investment income, Elyse, just as you said, offset by investments in the business, including in our people, technology and an ongoing headwind from resumption of T&amp;E, all of which we manage in a disciplined way based on ROIC. And we think about margins balancing a number of factors, revenue growth, underlying expense growth, investment in our team, T&amp;E and then the puts and takes around fiduciary investment income and FX. And we look at them all together and over the course of a full year and expect to drive margin expansion over the full quarter 2023.Elyse Beth GreenspanAnd then my second question on reinsurance, right, 9% organic in the quarter that was stable with the fourth quarter, but I might have thought that just with the really strong rates that we saw during the January 1 renewals that, that growth might have picked up sequentially. Can you just give us a little bit of a -- just some of the trends that you saw in the reinsurance business that impacted that 9% in the quarter and how we should think about the balance of the year.Gregory Clarence CaseEric, we'll go to you with one disclaimer here. I just want to highlight, if you think about what our reinsurance colleagues have done over the last number of years, it's really been extraordinary and at least they've really driven the level of performance with clients around the globe in a very unique platform that's been terrific.And remember, again, our efforts aren't -- are connected to rate but not tied to rate. We're helping clients understand, measure and mitigate risk, which means we're shifting programs, doing things that are unique, flexing the muscle around analytics to help them make better decisions. So what we want to see is client growth, which we have seen; top line growth, which we've seen; and translate into real impact, which we've seen. So I just want to highlight that long-term piece, and we see that playing out over the course of the year. But for the quarter, Eric, additional thoughts?Eric AndersenYes, Greg, thanks. Look, I would say, Elyse, that reinsurance has been a strength-to-strength story for us over the last couple of years. It was a 7% growth in Q1 '22. And honestly, the work that's been done was nothing short of spectacular around the 1/1 renewals. We had double-digit growth, in fact, double-digit growth in our STG Advisory business, significant new wins in Treaty. We feel really good about the performance of the team year-to-date.And looking forward, the work that the team is doing with their insurer clients and others is in demand, right? What the carriers are trying to do to manage their own portfolios as they navigate this marketplace has really -- our team is providing real value to them as they think through that. So really, really proud of the work that, that team has done, not only this quarter but over the last several years, and the future looks bright for it.Elyse Beth GreenspanAnd one last one, going back to that Wealth tough Q2 comp comment. You guys saw 3% organic in Wealth last Q2. So was it just that these performance fees were elevated and there were just other businesses that offset that? It just -- it doesn't seem like a tough comp. So I just want to make sure I'm not missing something.Christa DaviesYes. It's simply about the performance fee, as you know, Elyse, performance fees are lumpy as we communicated.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of David Motemaden with Evercore ISI.David Kenneth MotemadenSo I just had a question. It looked like more of the discretionary -- some of the discretionary parts of the business had a good quarter. Travel and events and Commercial Risk Solutions and human capital and health were both singled out in the press release and in the slides. I'm wondering if you could just talk about how the pipeline looks in those businesses, just given that you tend to be a little bit more economically sensitive?Eric AndersenSure. I would say, our health business had a very solid first quarter. The Consumer Solutions part of that was up 9%. Core health and benefits was up significantly. Global Benefits, Human Capital double-digit, both in the analytics and the advisory and data solution spaces. So really solid start for the year for them with a strong pipeline as they go through the rest of the year.David Kenneth MotemadenGot it. Okay. And then I'm just looking at the CapEx and appreciate the outlook this year, the $200 million to $225 million. If I just look back pre-COVID that is running at that level or above that level, and it's been around $100 million less than that in 2020 and 2021, ticked up in the second half of 2022. I guess I'm wondering, is there -- should we be thinking about a bigger ramp, I guess, as we enter into 2024? Just maybe some of those investments that would have occurred during the COVID year sort of ramp up here as we exit?Christa DaviesThanks so much for the question, David. I would say, we expect $200 million to $225 million for 2023. And then it's reasonable to think going forward, 2024 and beyond, that CapEx will grow in line with expenses. So you're absolutely right that 2020 and 2021 will lower, really just because of the COVID situation. And as we return to more normalized levels of CapEx, 2023 is a right normalized level to start with and then grow from there based on overall expense growth.David Kenneth MotemadenGot it. Okay. Okay. And then maybe if I could just sneak one more in. You mentioned a lot, Greg and Christa, just on Aon Business Services. And I was just wondering, taking a step back, how many employees do you have located in Aon Business Services? And where you think you can get that to over the next couple of years? And what sort of margin implications that might have?Christa DaviesYes. Look, thank you for the question. And what we would say is we're incredibly excited about Aon Business Services as a core part of our Aon business strategy. It's bringing together the firm in one organization led by Mindy Simon, our fantastic COO, and bringing together an organization to drive efficiency, to drive improved service and quality and to drive innovation at scale. Because a lot of the investments we're making, David, you saw in these IT platforms and security and infrastructure, are helping us scale insights and data analytics to clients to actually deliver impact. And so we're really excited about the potential to drive productivity and margin expansion from ABS, but equally to drive improved service and quality to clients and to allow us to accelerate innovation in one area of the business across all of our countries and all of our clients immediately. And so it's proven to be an amazing competitive advantage for us over the next many years.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski with BMO Capital Markets.Unidentified AnalystThis is Jack on for Mike. Just had one follow-up regarding the M&amp;A outlook. First quarter M&amp;A volumes in the brokerage space are down over 25% according to some media reports. So wondering, would Aon consider moving downmarket in terms of employer size into the U.S. or European insurance brokerage, middle-market area where Aon currently isn't a major player, given that some of the private equity players are being less aggressive.Gregory Clarence CaseI would say, Jack, from our standpoint, as Christa highlighted before, we've got a terrific pipeline, lots of opportunities we see. We're always going to be looking at them in terms of how they're going to strengthen and build our business. So this is really content capability we can scale around the firm. So you might imagine, we look across the entire spectrum, and we continue to do that, looking for these kinds of opportunities at a return on invested capital criteria that sort of meets the benchmark, which is really buying back, which has the standard. So we're looking broad-based and looking for opportunities around the world.Unidentified AnalystGot it. And then maybe a follow-up on the more discretionary parts of your business. Some competitors have said that clients are acting as if some project work, which used to be maybe viewed as more discretionary, is now viewed as more necessary in today's world. I guess just any thoughts on that. Is that something that you're also seeing?Gregory Clarence CaseYes. We would -- absolutely. So first, I just want to highlight, if you look back in kind of overall, what's discretionary and nondiscretionary as the baseline, very limited amounts of our business is really discretionary when you get down to it. There's sometimes timing is effective, not this year, but it's not this year, it's next year. And so a very low level from that standpoint. But what you're highlighting is exactly correct. Complexity is driving demand, and complexity and urgency is driving demand. And analytics around that at which we have make some of the -- some of these what would have been really would be nice to do almost necessary to do, particularly as you think about risk connecting with human capital and the dynamic that comes with that. Eric, why don't you add to that?Eric AndersenYes. I would maybe offer 2 examples. One is around wellness and the human capital business that historically would have been considered discretionary. You can't have a conversation today with a Chief People Officer who is thinking about health overall, including wellness as people think about return to work, how they engage their own colleagues. And so that is becoming more of a blended discussion than ever before.And the other piece, I think, Greg, that jumps out is the risk analytics and the advisory work around the commercial risk business that you would have historically said would have been more discretionary in nature. Today, as the clients are thinking through how they navigate this challenging market, whether it's captives, whether it's risk studies, trying to understand their total cost of risk and how they can actually manage the process better. Those skills that we're able to bring to clients are in significant demand and feel more a part of the process going forward than maybe on a project-by-project basis, just to give you 2 examples.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields with KBW.Meyer ShieldsTwo quick ones. First, can we get a little color on what actually drove the performance fees last year? Like what are the -- what was the performance that led to that fee? And when can we expect that sort of thing to recur?Eric AndersenI would look at it as an assets under management discussion in terms of the volatility of the market. And so as that comes back around, you'll begin to see more of a stable platform on that. But that's what drove it in the second quarter.Meyer ShieldsOkay. Fantastic. That's perfect. And second question, Greg, I think this is for Greg. So we saw almost 200 basis points of improvement in the comp ratio. Should we think about that as improved efficiency? Or is there a concern maybe that there are some roles that need to be filled?Gregory Clarence CaseSo it's overall -- I mean sort of overall, as you think about, Meyer, where we are sort of in the process, we were looking at this across holistically, what we're doing, continuing, as Christa said, make investments across the business to strengthen the business, that's why you're seeing us do that. Aon Business Services underneath that drives efficiency, which Christa described.I do want to emphasize, it's not just efficiency. Aon Business Services is so much more than efficiency. It is innovation at scale and it is better service and capability, but it does drive efficiency. Let's be clear. It helps individual colleagues be more effective in serving clients and then groups of colleagues more effective serving clients. So you're seeing that reflected in all through. But we have continued to make really substantial investments in talent and content capability, and we'll continue to do that. Christa, what else would you add to that?Christa DaviesThe thing I would say, Meyer, is you're observing lumpiness in expenses in any 1 quarter, and we really think about margin expansion over the course of a full year. And we commit to drive margin expansion in 2023 and every year after that. And we think about margins over the course of the full year. And we're balancing a number of factors, including investments in people, T&amp;E and IT as well as the impacts of FX and fiduciary investment income, all with the overall goal of delivering adjusted margin expansion net of sustainable investment and long-term growth. And that's exactly what's happening in Q1 and will happen for the rest of 2023.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Michael Ward with Citigroup.Michael Augustus WardI think you guys implied that the T&amp;E headwind was much larger in the first quarter. I was wondering if that means you expect more margin expansion over the balance of the year?Christa DaviesMichael, we don't give margin expansion guidance for the full year. What we can say is over the last 12 years, we've driven 1,120 basis points of margin expansion or approximately 90 basis points per year. It is -- we expect to drive margin expansion each and every year. It's not neatly 90 basis points per year because it's lumpy. And it really what it is. It's us driving gross margin expansion net of investments. And the amount we invest every year is dependent upon our opportunities for long-term growth. I would say, specifically on your T&amp;E point, T&amp;E was a bigger headwind this quarter because Q1 '22 had a very low T&amp;E expense, given what was going on with COVID.Michael Augustus WardGot it. Okay. And then a somewhat different question. I wanted to ask about the IT solutions business. I believe it's somewhat small for you guys. I think you've quoted like $1 billion of lending that you've helped achieve there. So I was just hoping you could maybe discuss this business and maybe quantify as earnings or revenues, if possible, and maybe even size that -- the market of this business.Gregory Clarence CaseMichael, first of all, thanks for raising it. I'm happy to address it. And Eric and I can give both -- give his color commentary on this, too. But this is a phenomenal area. If you think about sort of things we do every day to move to the market, this is an area in which you step back, I think, total addressable market, what could that be? Well, start to 0 right now. And what could it build to? 85% of the world's value is connected back in tangible assets. So my gosh, what should this be? By the way, what has our industry done to defend those assets? Nothing today, until we started to really understand how to value IP such that it could be insured, which means it's a real tradable asset, which means you can borrow against it.And you're right, we've done a number of deals over the course of the last 18, 24 months, which has amounted to $1 billion of debt, which is fantastic. It means these entrepreneurs are raising growth capital without giving up ownership. But just think about that, raising growth capital without giving up ownership, who's interested in doing that if you're an entrepreneur? And the answer is that market is massive. It's going to take time to develop. It takes time to build markets as it always does. And we love the momentum, and we love the possibilities and potential. We're not going to quantify what it needs. We'll see it will play out over time, but it really does have a very specific application, and we're quite excited about the progress. Eric, what else would you add to that?Eric AndersenYes. Maybe just to go a little bit on it. Certainly, the CPI lending piece is what we have been talking about the most that's probably the most advanced in terms of the valuation process. But you've also got M&amp;A due diligence around IP. You've got traditional IP liability where a corporate is not actually trying to lend against it, but want us to protect it. But to make all that happen, you need a couple of things, right, which is what we've been building over the last period of time. You need the valuation, right? How do you actually value IP, both in an upmarket and a stressed market. How do you liquidate it? How do you get insurer partners to devote capital to it to understand the risk themselves, to trust the valuation process, to understand how you would liquidate an example. So there's a whole ecosystem that we've been building that we are very optimistic about.And as Greg said, we've been building it a little bit each time. And the team is focused or connected in with our commercial risk partners as they build market. They're connected into understanding how to get it in front of clients and build the financial institution relationships. So there's a lot to it that has been happening for us. And we're excited about the future of it and started to see a little bit of progress last year.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker with Bank of America.Joshua David ShankerFirst quarter is the strongest quarter for the reinsurance segment, obviously. In the back half of last year, you had a lot of acquisition-related growth in reinsurance, not so much in 1Q. I mismodeled it. I'm just looking at 2Q, which is a smaller quarter for revenues in reinsurance. I wonder if you can help me think about the acquisition revenue piece for 2Q? It really won't matter later in the year. But given that volatility over the last 3 quarters, trying to be smart about it.Eric AndersenWhy don't I take a crack at it? Listen, we -- the reinsurance business is kind of almost a tale of 2 halves. Certainly, the first half is much more dominated by Treaty business. Think about that through the first half of this year as always. Still some good facultative business. And obviously, with the acquisition of Tyche, the ability to do those advisory services throughout the year. The second half is much more weighted to capital market transactions, i.e., cat bonds as well as facultative reinsurance and then some casualty reinsurance that tends to go through the year as well. But if you're trying to think through the waiting of the year, property cat, which is what a lot of people focus on, is largely done by the end of June, if that helps.Joshua David ShankerAnd in terms of the acquisition, is there a property cat in that acquisition?Eric AndersenI'm not exactly sure by what you mean by acquisition.Joshua David ShankerI'm saying that your 9% boost to revenues in the back half of '22 in the reinsurance segment due to acquisitions and only 1% in 1Q, I assume there's a 12-month impact on any acquisitions you make. It was less pronounced because of the volumes, I guess, in 1Q. I'm trying to think -- yes, yes.Eric AndersenGot it. So the acquisition around Tyche was much more advisory services, less property cat, but more pricing support and data and analytics support for those clients. A lot of the activity in the second half of last year was driven by FAC and cat bonds. So I would say that's how I would think about it.Joshua David ShankerOkay. And then I want to follow up a little bit on...Christa DaviesAnd, Josh...Joshua David ShankerYes, go ahead.Christa DaviesWell, sorry, Josh, we closed Tyche in Q1. And so you will see Tyche growth included in organic growth from Q2 onwards. It will be under, as Eric said, our strategy and technology group with be advisory part of reinsurance.Joshua David ShankerThat's perfect. And I just wanted to follow up on Mike's question about T&amp;E just a little bit. Clearly, there's a variance between 1Q '23 T&amp;E and 1Q '22. But in my mind, I would imagine the variance would have been greater between 4Q '22 and 4Q '21. And maybe tell us a little something about the business cycle and whatnot. If you're spending more on T&amp;E now, is that a broad situation with regards to a resumption of how your clients are spending? And two, should we expect that T&amp;E headwind is really a '23 event more so than a '22 event?Christa DaviesGreat question, Josh. And so what we would say is, look, we wouldn't overly read into any 1 quarter. It's lumpy quarter-to-quarter. And what we would say is, think about margin expansion for the full year, which is driven by a lot of things. It's been driven by our investment in people and technology to drive long-term growth, offset by some investments in T&amp;E, a headwind from FX. There's a lot of things going into this charge. But really, that's why we come back to margin expansion for the full year 2023, similar to the margin expansion we've driven over the last 12 years of 1,120 basis points or approximately 90 basis points a year.Joshua David ShankerI appreciate you staying on message.OperatorThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the floor back to Greg Case for closing comments.Gregory Clarence CaseThanks very much. Just want to say to everyone, we really appreciate you joining the call and look forward to our discussion next quarter. Thanks very much.OperatorThank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.]"

The top line comprised organic revenue growth of 7% and a 1% favorable impact from fiduciary investment income, which were partially offset by a 3% unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation.Weaker-than-expected first-quarter earnings were caused by increased operating expenses. However, the negatives were partially offset by strong retention, business generation, growth in core P&amp;C, and solid performance in Commercial Risk Solutions’ Latin America, EMEA and Pacific region operations.Aon plc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Aon plc Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseAon plc price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Aon plc QuoteQ1 OperationsTotal operating expenses increased 4% year over year to $2,398 million due to 13% and 20% increases in information technology and other general expenses, respectively.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read  5 Best Dividend Stocks of 2023. Just when the stock market began recovering after suffering huge losses in 2022, the recent bank crisis drew the market into the vortex of uncertainty all over again. According to Federal Reserve’s March policy meeting, the Silicon Valley Bank fallout is likely to push the US economy into a mild recession later this year, as reported by CNBC. This is the first time in the high-interest rate cycle that staff economists have forecast such a recession. While this recent development sent global markets into a minor panic, investors are loading up on income-generating stocks to stay afloat during this period.High-interest rate periods generally fare well for dividend stocks as these securities tend to be more resilient due to their strong cash flows and solid balance sheets. Historically, dividend stocks have significantly represented the market’s overall return, especially during high inflationary periods. Since 1930, dividends accounted for 54% of the stock market’s total return whenever inflation has averaged 5% or more.Companies with consistent dividend hikes become top choices for investors because of their long-term growth potential and lower volatility. In fact, dividend growers have produced better returns than the broader market in the past. In 12 Dividend Kings To Buy For Safe Dividend Growth, we reported that dividend growers delivered an annual return of 9.62% on average from 1972 to 2018, compared with a 7.30% return of the S&amp;P 500. During this period, non-dividend payers underperformed dividend growers and delivered an annual average return of 2.40%.Dividend stocks are also less volatile than other asset classes because of their solid financials and proven track record of success. Investors who look for stable sources of income may be more likely to hold onto their dividend-paying stocks during market volatility, which can help stabilize the stock price and reduce volatility. Historical analysis has shown that dividend stocks have generated high returns with lower volatility over the years. From 1990 to 2022, dividend growers delivered a 9.3% return to shareholders with a 14.5% volatility. In comparison, non-dividend payers represented a 19.7% volatility during this period, while returning 4%, as reported by Capital Group.Story continuesAs dividend stocks are still gaining traction among investors, we have shortlisted some of the best dividend stocks of 2023 in this article.

(NASDAQ:SWKS), represents one such opportunity that was added to one weakness.Skyworks is one of two leading providers of radio frequency system components to smartphone makers and electronics manufacturers.

(NASDAQ:AMAT) supplies services and software for the manufacturing of semiconductor chips. The company is based in California, US. On March 13, the company hiked its quarterly dividend by 23.1% to $0.32 per share. This marked the company's sixth consecutive year of dividend growth. The stock's dividend yield on April 28 came in at 1.14%.KGI Securities upgraded Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) to Outperform in March with a $145 price target, appreciating the company's performance this year.Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) is up 16.01% year-to-date, as of April 28.At the end of the most recent quarter, 70 hedge funds in Insider Monkey's database owned stakes in Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT), compared with 67 in the previous quarter. These stakes have a collective value of over $3.78 billion.Davis Advisers mentioned Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) in its annual 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“If Berkshire represents “growing value” then Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) might be said to represent “undervalued growth.” Founded more than a half century ago, Applied Materials has grown to be the largest supplier of manufacturing tools, services and software to the semiconductor industry. Holding more than 15,000 patents, Applied has become the irreplaceable supplier to the critical global growth industry, semiconductors. Because this company’s earnings can be uneven, short-sighted investors often label this company as “cyclical” and assign it a relatively low valuation.We disagree and, having perused more than 50 years of data, conclude that Applied is unquestionably a growth company trading at a value price. Figure 8 shows the two sustainable drivers of this growth. The green bars indicate that semiconductor manufacturers have grown industry revenue at 7.5% over the last decade, more than three times the growth of the U.S. economy over this same decade. The orange line indicates that the percentage of this revenue that the industry commits to capital spending has gradually risen from roughly 20% to 30%. Putting these two trends together, it should come as no surprise that Applied has grown revenue at a rate of 11%, and operating income at more than 19% over this same time period.In the near term, the impact of the chip industry’s post-pandemic inventory correction, which could reduce equipment demand, may more than offset the benefit of recent supply chain issues that limited Applied Materials’ ability to meet customer demand. Longer term, geopolitical tensions between China and the U.S. are driving investment in potentially redundant chip production globally, while at the same time the U.S. and her allies are restricting export of leading edge production tools into China. Even though the near term is frustratingly veiled in uncertainty, the recent shortages and trade restrictions have firmly established that access to chip-production technology is essential to every major industrial economy. Given this, we see more opportunity than risk and estimate that Applied Materials could sell at about 10 times what the company could be earning three-to-five years from now.”9. A. O. Smith Corporation (NYSE:AOS)Year-to-date Returns as of April 28: 16.8%A. O. Smith Corporation (NYSE:AOS) is an American company that manufactures commercial and residential water heaters and boilers.

The gains were attributed to the release of earnings reports from Big Tech companies such as Alphabet, Microsoft, and Meta Platforms. On the other hand, First Republic Bank reported a 40% decrease in deposits in the first quarter, which renewed concerns about the broader banking sector and caused the major averages to fall on Tuesday.As concerns about the banking sector continue to rise, stock markets may face a significant loss of buying power from a key source, reported Bloomberg. According to Scott Rubner, a market analyst at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., systematic money managers have recently invested over $170 billion in global shares, which has driven their exposure to the highest level since early 2022. Rubner warns that as their positioning approaches its peak, these managers are more likely to sell off their holdings in the coming weeks. Rubner has studied fund flows for two decades and believes that this group's behavior could have a significant impact on the markets.The Conference Board has reported that consumer confidence has declined more than expected in April. The consumer confidence index dropped to 101.3 from 104.0 in March, a larger decline than the predicted decrease to 104.0 from the previously reported 104.2. Meanwhile, the Commerce Department released a report indicating that new home sales in March unexpectedly surged to their highest level in a year. Given that the real gross domestic product (GDP) increased at an annual rate of 1.1 percent in Q1 of 2023, Fed's high interest rate policy hasn't pushed the economy into a recession. Economists have been predicting a US recession since the second half of 2022. We also observe the positive effects of relatively strong consumer spending in Q1 earnings of most publicly traded stocks.Story continuesAfter geopolitical tensions led to the loss of around $446 billion in mainland Chinese shares this month, a decline in Chinese stocks has paused as dip buyers enter the market, reported Bloomberg.

The analyst notes that the company is executing well in a vibrant market. Powers communicated this information to investors on April 25.Rowan Street Capital mentioned The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s take The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) for example. Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next years forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”Click to continue reading and see the Analysts Are Increasing Price Targets of These 5 Stocks.Suggested articles:Most Advanced Countries in Artificial Intelligence10 Best Artificial Intelligence Stocks Under $10Best AI Penny Stocks Under $1Disclosure: None.

These have been some of the best-performing stocks this week.And investors are correct in bidding these names up, judging by how the first half of the year is shaping up for the sector.Consider some of the tailwinds for the food space:Inflation is slowing for input costs, which is great for margins.Resistance to rounds of price increases has been generally limited, which is also great for margins.Recovery stories are playing out in China for multinational names such as PepsiCo.""You may not be able to go out and get a new car,"" PepsiCo vice chairman and CFO Hugh Johnston said on Yahoo Finance Live (video above). ""You may not be able to go out and get a really fancy piece of technology. But you can afford a bag of Doritos, or you can afford a Gatorade Zero after you workout, or you can afford an energy drink in the morning.""Good point by Hugh.Do you ever look at how much you just spent on a bag of chips at a 7-11 or WaWa? Maybe, maybe not. But I would bet that bag of chips today is more than 10% higher in price than at this point last year. Maybe 20%, depending on the flavor.You may not have even realized it, but the CFOs of consumer food companies did, and their shareholders are loving it. Expect more price increases from these giants this year in part because consumers don't appear to care.A person dressed in a Hershey chocolate bar costume celebrates Halloween on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange shortly after the market's opening bell in New York October 31, 2014.

While I will get ridiculed by my colleague Julie Hyman for this statement, I believe we are in the golden age of food innovation.Story continuesThe aforementioned Hershey is selling Reese's snack cakes. Where was that 20 years ago?Meanwhile, PepsiCo and Coca-Cola (KO) are in active rollouts of ready-made alcoholic drinks after years of avoiding the space. Beer company Molson Coors (TAP) has started to sell whiskey with success. And Conagra Brands (CAG) has made frozen food taste great for maybe the first time ever.Then there's McDonald's rethinking how they cook a burger (thank goodness), Starbucks selling drinks with one inch of thick ""salted caramel cold foam,"" and Papa John's launching a giant hot-pocket-like product this week that has a Doritos Cool Ranch coating.Even my local pizza joint just started selling ""hot honey"" chicken pizza. I went to a whiskey distillery last week and they are serving up whiskey infused with roasted coconuts.You may be laughing at all this as it's not similar to innovations at Tesla or Apple.But it is in fact innovation that helps drive higher price points on food and, over time, fatter profits and stock prices.

As Chris and Mark will take you through our results, and outlook for the balance of the year.This is my last earnings call with Newell Brands. As many of you know, in February, we announced that I'll be retiring on May 16 and Chris will take over as the next CEO of the company. This is a historic event for us, as Chris will be the first internal CEO successor in Newell's recent history, in fact, in the last 2 decades and is a testament to a well-thought-out, well-planned succession planning process.Over the past several months, our partner is closely with Chris to ensure a seamless, smooth and orderly transition as well as a successful execution of Project Phoenix. I will also spend time in our international markets and I'm encouraged by the long-term opportunities for our key brands. I'm confident that Chris, along with the world-class management team, will assemble over the past couple of years, will get us through this difficult environment and take you to the next level.While the macro environment has put considerable pressure on our business, I am optimistic about the future of Newell Brands. Over the past several years, we've come together as One Newell, but we are still in the early stages of truly leveraging the scale of the company. We have a strong world-class executive leadership team with great brands that consumers love. We are both e-commerce and omnichannel pros. We have excellent customer relationships and are reigniting the processes and passion to drive meaningful innovation. Our team has done a superb job on systematically reducing complexity and we are gaining momentum on driving operational excellence through Project Ovid and automation.Our talented employees are our #1 asset, and we are grateful for their continued efforts, resilience and dedication, as well as their support and execution of the change agenda we've implemented as part of Project Phoenix. Phoenix is not just about efficiencies and cost savings. It is truly a new operating model. I'd like to thank our employees for their trust in me and thank the entire leadership team. It has been a distinct honor and privilege to lead the company over the last several years. I'm confident that our best days are truly ahead of us, onwards and upwards, and I now turn it over to Chris.Christopher H. PetersonThank you, Ravi, and good morning, everyone. First quarter results were largely in line with our expectations. As anticipated, this was a very difficult period for the company to top and bottom line under significant pressure. The headwinds Newell faced in the back half of 2022 from normalizing category trends, constrained consumer spending in discretionary categories, retailer destocking, fixed cost deleveraging, inflation and foreign exchange persisted into Q1.However, there were several bright spots, including stronger cash flow performance relative to last year. During Q1, we also continued to build operational excellence across the organization and made meaningful progress operationalizing the distribution and transportation benefits associated with Project Ovid and implementing Project Phoenix.Let me provide additional perspective on both initiatives. As you may recall, on February 1, we implemented the second Go-Live Wave of Project Ovid across the remaining food categories as well as the Writing, Outdoor &amp; Recreation and Commercial businesses. The conversion has been very successful, and our distribution and transportation organization is now fully centralized. We are currently operating in the new go-to-market model, utilizing both East Coast and West Coast ports via a nationwide multi-node network of mixed distribution centers, including the 2 new DCs we stood up in Pennsylvania and North Carolina.While it's still in the early days, we are beginning to realize benefits from the new model. And in the first quarter, we meaningfully improved fill rates relative to last year, reduced delivery times and have a clear line of sight to cost efficiencies.First quarter represented a crucial period in the implementation of Project Phoenix, which is expected to simplify and strengthen the organization by leveraging our scale to further reduce complexity, streamline our operating model, drive operational efficiencies and unlock significant savings. Although there is certainly a lot more work ahead of us, we made progress on key pillars of Project Phoenix during the first quarter.First, we transitioned the company into the new operating model organized into 3 segments: Home and Commercial Solutions, Learning &amp; Development and Outdoor &amp; Recreation. This should enable us to better leverage the scale of the organization, unlock new opportunities for growth while enhancing mobility for our talented employees.Second, we moved to a One Newell sales model for our top 4 customers to harness the scale of our portfolio while building win-win enduring partnerships with our top customers. We are bringing a unified approach to selling our products to our major customers to simplify customer interactions, significantly improve their experience and strengthen our position as a best-in-class partner.Third, we are in the midst of implementing a One Newell go-to-market approach across all key international geographies, which should allow us to operate more efficiently, drive incremental distribution gains and improve our agility. We moved to a One Newell go-to-market approach in Canada last year. And in January of this year, we did the same in Latin America, Australia, New Zealand and Japan. We expect to complete EMEA and all other markets by the end of this year.Fourth, we have centralized manufacturing into Newell's Supply Chain Center of Excellence. We are excited about the opportunity to turn the company's manufacturing scale into a competitive advantage and to optimize our global manufacturing network. We continue to believe that a unified global supply chain organization will drive significant cost and service efficiencies, improve our supply chain resiliency, further enhance the company's technical capabilities, strengthen our culture of customer connection and collaboration and position us to become a best-in-class scaled general merchandise supplier to our retail partners.As we continue to tightly manage costs and assess all aspects of our spend, we are also analyzing our real estate footprint, particularly given the shift towards the hybrid work environment. We closed 3 offices during the first quarter and expect additional office closures throughout the upcoming years.We are on track to achieve the planned headcount reduction associated with Project Phoenix along with the annualized pretax savings in the $220 million to $250 million range when fully implemented. Careful planning and consideration have gone into every decision relating to our employees, with communication to the impacted individuals either already complete or in process depending on the market.The past several months have confirmed our cautious stance on the macro environment and the consumer for the balance of this year particularly as it relates to discretionary spending. Our views are predicated upon macro indicators such as slowing retail sales, rising household debt and persistently high, although moderating inflation on essentials such as food, energy and housing. We expect these factors along with the rollback in government stimulus spending to restrict the share of consumers' wallets that's directed towards discretionary purchases.Elevated prices on everyday goods are not only weighing on consumption in the U.S., but we're observing similar trends in international markets, particularly Europe. We are seeing continued normalization in demand across home-based categories that benefited from stay-at-home trends during the pandemic. Given the longer purchase cycle for many of these products, we expect this behavior to persist through the year.Retailers have continued to pull back on general merchandise inventory levels and we expect this behavior to persist in the near term. Also, as you may have seen earlier this week, one of our customers, Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond, filed for bankruptcy protection and indicated they may pursue a double path of potentially selling off their assets.While we typically do not comment on individual retailers, given they were an important customer for Newell Brands in 2022, I'll shed some light on where we stand. They accounted for less than 2% of Newell's sales in 2022. Given their situation, we took steps last year to largely eliminate our credit exposure.While we have minimal risk on the receivables front due to the proactive actions we've taken, we do expect this to be a slight headwind for Newell as they liquidate inventory and shoppers migrate to other retailers.While there's a fair amount of uncertainty surrounding the macro backdrop, with Q1 results largely in line with our expectations, we are reaffirming our outlook for 2023, although we now expect the company to be towards the lower end of the guidance range. We continue to expect this to be a challenging year for the company and remain committed to stabilizing Newell's financial performance while driving foundational improvement.Our ultimate goal is to return the company to sustainable and profitable growth as macros improve.We are laser-focused on delivering against the 5 priorities we laid out on last earnings call. First, strengthening Newell's cash flow and balance sheet by continuing to rightsize inventories, carefully managing the forecasting process and staying close to the evolving consumer and customer trends.Second, driving gross margin improvement by accelerating fuel productivity savings, further advancing our automation initiatives, operationalizing Project Ovid distribution and transportation benefits and pricing for currency and inflation.Third, driving overhead savings through Project Phoenix and tight spending controls to offset the impact of incentive compensation reset to more normal levels and wage inflation.Fourth, continuing SKU count reduction progress along with other simplification initiatives.And fifth, operationalizing the new company structure to enable faster transformation progress.As Ravi mentioned, over the past several months, he and I have partnered closely to ensure a smooth transition in mid-May. At the same time, I, along with the rest of the leadership team have embarked upon a refresh of our strategy, which entails a full assessment of where Newell stands versus best-in-class competition on the key capabilities required to win in this industry, an updated and integrated set of where to play and how to win choices, an assessment of the talent and culture required to enact the strategy refresh as well as an evaluation of the capital allocation priorities required to support the new strategy.We are on track to complete this work and share our thoughts in the next few months. While we continue to face a very challenging macroeconomic environment, I am confident that our portfolio of leading consumer brands and talented employees will allow us to further strengthen the company in the years ahead as we sharpen our strategy, optimize our cost structure and fully leverage the scale of the company.Before turning over to Mark, on behalf of our entire organization, I would like to wish Ravi well on his retirement and thank him for his leadership, partnership and dedication over the past several years.I'll now hand the call over to Mark.Mark J. ErcegThanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Let's jump straight into our Q1 results, which were largely consistent with going in expectations with core sales and normalized earnings per share, both landing within guidance, albeit at the lower end of the range.Net sales contracted 24% year-over-year to $1.8 billion, reflecting an 18% decline in core sales, a 2% headwind from currency and a 4% impact from the divestiture of the CH&amp;S business and certain category exits. While we are clearly not happy with an 18% decline in core sales, it does bear mentioning that this was against a particularly difficult base period comparison since core sales grew 6.9% in Q1 of 2022 and 20.9% during Q1 of 2021. Therefore, on a stacked basis, core sales were up versus 2019 levels.Newell's normalized operating margin contracted 820 basis points versus last year to 2.4% as normalized gross margin declined 410 basis points versus last year's 27.1%. Fixed cost deleveraging due to a softer top line, along with inflation, including carryover inflation costs from last year were the largest drivers of margin pressure in Q1. These factors more than offset the favorable impact from pricing, Project Phoenix and our fuel productivity efforts, which are tracking slightly ahead of our going-in expectations.Net interest expense rose $9 million versus last year to $68 million primarily due to increases in debt and interest rates and the normalized tax benefit was $1 million, all of which netted out to a normalized diluted loss of $0.06 per share for the quarter.From a cash flow standpoint, operating cash was a use of $77 million during the quarter, which while still negative, was an improvement of nearly $200 million versus last year. Inventory was a big part of the improvement coming in $150 million lower than a year ago. Importantly, while this is good progress, we need to drive inventory levels much lower while still maintaining or increasing order fill rates.Consistent with this, it is worth noting that in-transit inventory at the end of Q1 was approximately $250 million below year-ago levels. This suggests 2 things: first, we are doing a better job of matching raw material and sourced finished good orders and internal manufacturing production to actual customer order patterns. Second, the significant inventory reduction we are expecting and counting on over the balance of the year is already working its way through the system.The company's leverage ratio was 5.7x at the end of Q1, and we don't expect it to be below 5x until the end of the year. Anticipating this, last month, we secured a temporary reduction in the interest coverage ratio and our revolving credit agreement to 3x from 3.5x for the next 4 quarters. This amendment, we believe, provides the company with sufficient flexibility to navigate through this challenging period.Moving on to our second quarter outlook, we have assumed the following: net sales of $2.13 billion to $2.24 billion with core sales down 10% to 14% and a 1% to 2% headwind from currency and certain category exits. Normalized operating margin is expected to remain under significant pressure in Q2 due to the same headwinds that weighed on Q1, as well as unfavorable mix due to a shift in some writing orders from Q2 to Q3 related to back-to-school activity.Taking all this into account, we are forecasting Q2 normalized operating margin of 6.5% to 8%. We expect a step-up in interest expense and a high teens tax rate, so normalized earnings per share are forecasted to be $0.10 to $0.18.For the full year, we are reaffirming our 2023 outlook, with net sales of $8.4 billion to $8.6 billion, driven by a core sales decline of 6% to 8% and a nearly 3% headwind from currency, divestiture of the CH&amp;S business and certain category exits.Normalized operating margin is expected to be 9.6% to 10.1% or flat to down 50 basis points versus last year as gross margin improvement is more than offset by overheads despite $140 million to $160 million of anticipated pretax savings from Project Phoenix in 2023.For 2023, we are reiterating our normalized earnings per share guidance range of $0.95 to $1.08 which includes a high-teens tax rate as well as a step-up in interest expense.As Chris indicated earlier, we now expect our top and bottom line results to come in towards the low end of the range as we are incrementally more cautious on the operating environment as well as consumer discretionary spending. We continue to expect significant year-over-year improvement in operating cash flow, driven primarily by a reduction in working capital. Specifically, we anticipate $700 million to $900 million of operating cash flow, inclusive of $95 million to $120 million of cash payments related to Project Phoenix. At the midpoint of our range, free cash flow productivity is comfortably above 100%.With Q1 actuals now in hand, along with our Q2 and full-year guidance, it becomes self-evident that we are expecting a much stronger top and bottom line during the back half of the year versus the front half. Given this reality, we thought it would be helpful to provide some specific reasons why we believe our business results should improve in the second half of the year.First, from a macroeconomic standpoint, we expect that FX pressures on profits should ease, inflation should be much less pronounced and the massive amount of general merchandise trade destocking we have been incurring starting with Q3 of last year should finally slow down.Second, as it relates to our own underlying business dynamics, our second half, historically, with the exception of last year, when significant destocking began to manifest itself during the third quarter has represented more than half of total company sales, which will help with fixed cost absorption. And as I'm sure you're all aware, starting with the third quarter, our base period comps get much easier. In addition, based on back-to-school order patterns, we now expect about a point of sale to move from Q2 to Q3 this year, which is one of the reasons why our back half mix should be more favorable.Third, we have several corporate-driven initiatives already in flight, which we believe will disproportionately benefit the second half of the year. For example, we are on track to have our biggest productivity year ever on 2 fronts. First, as it relates to gross margin, where we are on pace to save over 4% of COGS due to our fuel initiative with the savings being slightly back half weighted. Second, Project Phoenix, which Chris has already commented on, should understandably have a bigger positive impact on overheads during the second half of the year.Finally, we just completed an in-depth analysis of our domestic business at a SKU level. Our extensive analysis clearly showed that additional pricing is required to mitigate the impacts of continuing inflation on some categories and to fix the underlying structural economics on products that are because of the unprecedented level of inflation we have sustained in recent years, not generating an appropriate level of return on a fully loaded basis. We believe it's imperative that we address these issues now so they don't perpetuate or get worse. Thus, we are now expecting to take an incremental U.S. pricing action across roughly 30% of our U.S. business largely concentrated in the Home and Commercial Solutions segment in the third quarter. Absent this intervention, we will not be able to invest in the consumer understanding, brand building and innovation capabilities our consumers and retail partners expect.So based on these reconciling factors, we believe our guidance, including the associated front and back half splits is appropriate and reasonable and reflects progress on our multiyear journey to create meaningful levels of sustainable shareholder value going forward.Operator, if you could, please open the call to questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question or comment comes from the line of Peter Grom from UBS.Peter K. GromSo Chris, I guess I just wanted to get your perspective on just kind of underlying category growth but more in the context of really what's changed since the last book in February that you -- you discussed discretionary spending pressures. But it seems like those were already there or occurring back in February. So just any commentary just in terms of what's really changed, where it's really gotten worse. And then I appreciate all the building blocks around hitting the back half guidance. But if we do go into a recession, is that outlook still so feasible?Christopher H. PetersonYes, sure. Thanks, Peter. From a consumer and sort of macro environment, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks. Really, what we're seeing is continued pressure on the consumer in discretionary and durable categories. And that's a function of inflation on food, housing and energy causing the consumer to prioritize more essential items and deprioritize spending on durable and discretionary categories.Coupled with that, our -- many of our categories have longer purchase cycles. And when stimulus money came into the market a year or 2 ago in a big way, a lot of consumers bought product categories that effectively took them out of the market for a period of time. And so I don't think there's a meaningful change on that fundamental dynamic, which is why we're maintaining the range for the year.I will say that we've gotten, I guess, in terms of what's changed in the last 2 months since we talked, specifically, we did come in at the lower end of our guidance range, minus 18% on core sales growth. That was really driven by Outdoor &amp; Recreation, which got off to a slower-than-expected start to the season, primarily due to wet and cold weather in the western part of the country.We've seen, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, one of our major retailers declared bankruptcy that we do expect to have a temporary sort of disruption in the market. We expected that on the year, but that -- the timing was not certain.And then from a retailer destocking standpoint, I think in our first quarter results, probably of the minus 18% core sales growth that we reported, about half of that was underlying sort of consumer dynamics and the other half of that was really retailer destocking roughly. And so that's part of the reason why we think that retailer destocking were largely true, although we do expect it to continue to have an impact on Q2. But we think by the time we get to sort of midyear, that will largely be behind us.Peter K. GromNo, that's the problem. So just to clarify that last point, around roughly half of the minus 18% was related to retail destocking and roughly half was just kind of what you're seeing in terms of underlying demand?Christopher H. PetersonThat's right. And that underlying demand, I would say, is as a result of the base period, as a result of the pressure on consumer wallets and normalization of some of the categories from COVID peak levels, but that's accurate.OperatorYour next question or comment comes from the line of Kevin Grundy from Jefferies.Kevin Michael GrundyI'd like to pivot to cash flow. So better versus last year, 1Q is, of course, sort of a seasonally light quarter and typically tends to be a cash use for the company. How did -- a few questions, all pertinent. Number one, how did cash flow come in relative to your expectations for the quarter? Number two, what's kind of the visibility or the level of confidence you have on the $700 million to $900 million? I think the comment was around guidance broadly, it's appropriate and reasonable. I'd sort of push a little bit and say, is it conservative? And then lastly and certainly importantly, given where the dividend yield is, maybe just some updated thoughts on ability to fund it. And I think when you kind of look at the guidance a little bit and look at where CapEx could be if you kind of come in at the low end of the range, you're kind of right there. There's not a lot of wiggle room to fund the dividend. So I think an understanding it's a Board decision, I think some your updated thoughts there would be appreciated. Appreciate it.Mark J. ErcegLet me jump in and help with the cash flow piece, and then Chris can talk about the second part of your question. So -- in Q1, you're right. It's always a cash-take quarter, but we did have really good progress there, basically being up about $200 million year-over-year. If you want to get into the bridge items that relate to that, the biggest part of it was better-working capital performance. That was about $400 million better.Almost all of that was driven by inventory. We did have a lower incentive comp payment, cash payment for incentive comp for management that was about $100 million. Lower operating income was probably a $200 million differential negatively year-over-year. And then we had several items that combined for another 100 downturn, which was the Phoenix restructuring, the Brazil tax payment and some higher cash interest. So if you do that bridge, you'll find yourself comfortably at that $200 million, which was the improvement that we saw.If you think about the full year, again, it's going to be a story of basically working capital improvement because if you look at the operating cash flow from the prior period, it was down roughly $300 million. If you take the midpoint of our $700 million to $900 million range, that puts you at $800 million. So we're basically looking to bridge about $1.1 billion of improvement. And effectively, all of that comes from working capital. I mean operating income is about $100 million take year-over-year but the working capital is the $1.1 billion positive movement with inventory being about $700 million of that and then AP and AR accounting for the balance of the differential with AR being a little bit of a hurt in AP being a pretty big size help.From where we sit right now at the end of Q1, we're expecting another $400 million to $500 million to come out of inventory throughout the course of the year. Our inventory performance in Q1 exceeded our expectations. And as you heard in my prepared remarks, the in-transit inventories already $250 million down versus the prior period. So we feel pretty good about the operating cash flow elements. We're watching it very closely, but we have a high degree of confidence in it.Christopher H. PetersonYes. And Kevin, to your -- maybe I'll just take the question on the dividend. To your point, the operating cash flow range, which we kept unchanged at $700 million to $900 million on operating cash flow is sufficient to fund the current year's CapEx and the dividend and have a small amount of debt pay down. That being said, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we are taking as part of the strategy refresh, we are going to look at the capital allocation strategy for the company going forward. And certainly, the dividend is going to be part of that capital allocation strategy look.And so we haven't made any conclusion on that yet, but the strategy work will incorporate a view on that, and we will share that when appropriate once we've gone through a discussion with the Board.OperatorYour next question or comment comes from the line of Chris Carey from Wells Fargo.Christopher Michael CareyJust from a gross margin standpoint, right, seen a little bit of a step-up sequentially, but obviously, still under a lot of pressure. You're looking at taking pricing in the back half of the year now, which should give a little bit of a lift. Can you just clarify how you expect the gross margin to trend sequentially?And then just on the new pricing, I'm sorry if I missed it, but how are you factoring the macro backdrop? So if the consumer starts to get weaker, do you still go through with the program? Are you going to need to offset it with any incremental promotions if that environment seems to play out from a macro standpoint? So just how you thinking about the sensitivity of this new pricing plan that you have for the back half of the year? So thanks on the gross margins and the pricing.Mark J. ErcegYes. So let me help you on the gross margin, and I'll even help you on the operating margin line as well because obviously the two are highly correlated. It's not lost on us that the guidance that we're providing is kind of a tale of 2 halves. And if you look at the operating margin in the first half, we're calling for it to be mid-single digits. And then for the back half, we're calling for the operating margin to be in the low teens. And that obviously implies a big reversal from the first half of the second in both op margin and gross margin. But if you look at all the elements that we have in flight, I think you'll see that the splits we have are reflective of what we're seeing on the underlying trends of the business itself. So for example, if you look at the Phoenix, if you look at the fuel productivity initiatives, and if you look at the net pricing that we discussed, roughly 60% of the benefit that comes from those 3 programs will fall into the second half of the year.Similarly, if you look at inflation in FX, roughly 70% of the hurt from those 2 things falls in the first half. And then, of course, you have to look at the comps on the base periods. In the first half, we're going up against plus 4% in the prior periods. In the second half, we're going against minus 10%. So obviously, that's a big factor as well.From a trade destocking standpoint, we think most of our large customers are at their target, we have covered now. We think there might be a little bit more that kind of comes out through the second quarter. But at that point, we think we're in pretty good regard as it relates to that. We talked about normal business seasonality, where the second half historically has been just the larger dollarized value than the first half. And we talked about the shift that we see in back-to-school from Q2 to Q3. And then finally, I guess, I'd offer that in Q1, we did have some additional E&amp;O charges as we work down our inventory levels, and that actually cost us a couple of pennies on the quarter. So if you really look at the underlying pieces that drive the first half, second half split on gross margin as well as operating margin, we think they're reasonable and appropriate. And on the pricing piece, I know Chris wanted to add a few thoughts on...Christopher H. PetersonYes. On the pricing piece, one of the things that we did and actually when Mark came in, we initiated this work, was because we've been able to reduce the company's SKU count from 100 in 2000 when we started the SKU count reduction effort at the end of 2018 to 28,000 last year, we initiated a look at profitability and inflation impact at the SKU level in the U.S. business. And what came out of that work was that there was a number of SKUs that we had in the U.S. business that were structurally challenged and where we hadn't fully priced for inflation.And so we are -- we've announced -- we are announcing pricing in the U.S. that will be effective in the third quarter, it's largely -- it's on about 30% of our U.S. business, as Mark mentioned. It will be effective in the third quarter. And where we're taking the pricing, it's going to be sort of a range between high single-digit and low double-digit percentages. And we think it's appropriate and warranted because we haven't fully priced for inflation on these SKUs. I'll also mention that this is a good example of simplification helping us because if we had tried to look at the profitability by SKU 3 years ago, it would have been virtually impossible for us to do it because of the number of SKUs that we have. We're now getting much better visibility at a much more granular level that's allowing us to go after this. So we think it's warranted. We think that it's the right thing to do for the long-term health of the business. Of course, we're going to monitor the trends carefully.As the pricing gets put into the market with regard to the consumer response, and broadly speaking, in our guidance, we have not assumed that the pricing adds to the top line in the back half. We've largely assumed that the pricing is offset with volume loss. And so this is more about improving the structural economics of this business than it is about driving short-term top-line growth.OperatorYour next question or comment comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan.Andrea Faria TeixeiraCan you comment on what are you hearing on the back-to-school? I guess you mentioned -- Mark, you mentioned that it seems like normalized -- you're seeing normalized inventory levels. And Chris, you said the same with the retailers. But I'm just thinking in terms of the timing of shipments as well because I think it moved, as you said, last year. And if you can comment on both the Writing division as well as the Outdoor going to peak season. That question, what does that mean embedded in your guide for gross margin? I'm assuming, obviously, those 2 are higher-margin businesses.And then as we think about what's embedded in your gain in terms of the resin. I understand that you don't buy the resin directly, but you will eventually get the benefit from that as you lap the couple of months of -- in this case, in the case of resin is a substantial decline more than a year ago. So I was wondering if you're starting to see the benefit, and that's embedded in your guide? And if that anything has changed to better worse since you got the last?Christopher H. PetersonVery good. All right. Andrea, and I'll try to hit the business unit questions and then maybe give -- let Mark get the resin question.On the Writing business and back-to-school, we feel very good in the first quarter. Writing was effectively flat from a core sales standpoint. So despite the company being down 18% in Q1, Writing was not down. And that's important because Writing is our most profitable business and Writing being flat in Q1, means that we're meaningfully up versus the 2019 base period because we have built market share during that period from 2019 until today.As we head into back-to-school, we're just in the sell-in period. As you know, we don't really get a read on the consumption of back-to-school until kind of the July, August, September period. But I will say from a sell-in perspective, retailers are planning for a pretty normal back-to-school year. I think in general, people are expecting back-to-school to be relatively consistent with last year's back-to-school.We feel very good about our plan heading into the back-to-school period because if you recall last year, we had a little bit of supply challenge on some subsegments of our business. This year, we do not have that challenge, and we are fully available from a supply standpoint and recovered. We also already have visibility to the vast majority of the back-to-school seasonal orders, and we feel very good about our in-store display positioning in the marketplace with the leading retailers. And so we are optimistic as we head into the season.Final thing I'll say on back to school and this is true for a lot of the seasonal businesses that we're seeing in our business is that because the supply chain has improved so rapidly, retailers are now not ordering seasonal inventory as early as they did in the past. So last year, for example, if retailers wanted back-to-school inventory in February, March, April to try to secure inventory for the season. This year, we're seeing retailers say, ""No, we want it later in the season because we don't need it that early.""And so that's why we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we expect the shipments of back-to-school to go back to more normalized levels and much of the shipments to occur in May, June, July. And so that's true on the back-to-school business, it's also true on the other seasonal categories.On Outdoor &amp; Rec is a little bit of a different situation. Outdoor &amp; Rec is not one of the higher gross margin parts of the company. The gross margin on Outdoor &amp; Rec is lower than company average. And Outdoor &amp; Rec is the category that got off to a very slow start. As I think I mentioned in one of the previous questions, the Outdoor &amp; Rec was down from a core sales growth standpoint in the high 20s in the first quarter, so significantly below the company average of down 18%. And that largely is due to comping a very high base period, but also due to a slow start to the season because of the weather. And that was really the only business in Q1 that came in slightly below or below what we were expecting on the top line.It's too early to declare anything with regard to the season. The season for Outdoor &amp; Rec typically gets really going kind of May through July is sort of the big season. And so what we're seeing so far is retailers saying, hey, because of the slow weather, can you hold up the shipments in because we don't need the inventory quite as fast? But too early to declare how the season overall will wind up.Mark J. ErcegAnd then as you relate to your question on resin, resin has been a help for us since the third quarter of last year, and we expect it to remain so for all of '23. When we think about COGS inflation in totality, we expect it to be a low single digit for '23 versus what was a high single digit in '22.OperatorYour next question or comment comes from the line of Bill Chappell from Truist.Stephen John LengelThis is Stephen Lengel on for Bill Chappell. On the gross margin side, thank you for some of the color you guys gave, and sorry if I missed this, but you understandably left the guidance unchanged, but kind of mentioned some fuel savings from Phoenix. Can you kind of talk more about your freight assumptions and how those have changed over the course of the past few months? And kind of how do you see it evolving over the next 12 to 18 months?Christopher H. PetersonYes, we are seeing a noticeable drop in transportation costs. And it's really driven by a couple of things. And so I'll parse it into sort of 3 parts. First is the ocean freight market for inbound freight has dropped dramatically back to close to pre-pandemic levels. And I think as I've talked before, the contract years for ocean freight go May 1 to May 1, and we're seeing -- we've now concluded the negotiations for this upcoming contract year and we're seeing ocean container costs back close to pre-pandemic levels, which is a noticeable retreat from where they were last year and the year before. So that is a big positive.The second part of this is trucking cost in the U.S. And what we're seeing there is full truckload cost is coming down significantly as diesel fuel costs are coming down as well as demand for full truckload capacity is coming down in the U.S. market. And so that is -- that's another sort of tailwind.Interestingly, we're not seeing the same thing on less than truckload freight, which is remaining sort of stubbornly high.The third impact that's driving our transportation costs down is the Ovid implementation. And so as we've implemented Ovid and gone to the mixed distribution centers, we are seeing a meaningful opportunity for us to move from less-than-truckload shipments to full-truckload shipments. It takes work to operationalize that, but we're making very good progress with some of our top retailers at driving big shift from less than truckload into full truckload. And for perspective, full truckload cost about half the amount for similar volume versus less than a truckload.So if we can convert the business from less than truckload to full truckload for the portion of the business we convert, transportation cost goes down by 50% through that effort. And so that's sort of where we are on transportation costs broadly.Mark J. ErcegAnd then you mentioned the fuel productivity program. I just want to offer a few additional thoughts on that because it's been one of the areas that's really impressed me when I've been joining up here at Newell Brands. If you look back at 2019 and 2020, as an example, we sold $250 million averagely on CapEx during those 2 years. And in those 2 years, we spent a little less than 20% of our capital on productivity projects.If you look at '21 and '22 capital program, which was roughly $300 million, over 40% of our capital is spent on productivity projects. So the FUEL program has really started to ramp up. You're seeing that through increased automation and the move that we made as part of Project Phoenix to basically bring the supply chain management to the center following on the success of Ovid gives us huge opportunities because at this point, across our 49 plants, 90% of those are single node sites. We have an opportunity to manage that much more effectively across the entire renewable network. And if you look at the $4 billion of direct and sourced finished goods, only 60% of that right now is single source, right? So 50% single-source, 25% dual sourced and about 15% is dual qualified. So we have a tremendous opportunity going forward, and we only see the fuel productivity savings just increasing over time as we sit here today.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Filippo Falorni from Citi.Filippo FalorniJust a quick follow-up on pricing. Have you -- first, what has been the reaction from your retail partner to your additional price increases? And -- have you also seen your competitors take prices up? Or are you assuming they're going to take prices up? So that's the first question.And then longer term, just in general, can you give us some sense on the path to operating margin recovery to the mid- to high teens? Clearly, you're doing a lot of progress on the cost savings front. But the external environment is essentially removing a lot of those benefits. So what do you think is the path to get to those targets? Is your timeline delayed because of the macro environment? Can you give us some sense on the timing there?Christopher H. PetersonOkay. Let me start with the pricing. We are just -- we've just announced or just announcing the pricing as we sit here today in the U.S. So it's too early to give a full view of the retailer reaction. What I will say is that the pricing that we're putting in place effectively today, which is about 30% of our U.S. portfolio that we're pricing on is cost justified. It is on the part of the business where we haven't fully priced for inflation. And in the past, as we put pricing in over the last several years, we've generally seen competition largely follow the pricing that we put in.Of course, we don't know what they're going to do on this one. And the reason that we believe that the competition has largely followed it's because they're seeing the same inflation cost pressure as we are. Frankly, we've been focused on not overpricing given the macro environment from a consumer standpoint because we wanted to offer the consumer great value. And we're encouraged that we're not needing to take pricing on 70% of the U.S. portfolio because we think the pricing that we've historically put in has already gotten us sort of caught up.And so it's this 30% of the portfolio where we haven't fully priced for inflation and where the business is structurally challenged in some cases that we believe we really don't have a choice. We will monitor the situation. We, as always, work with our retailers on implementation of this. But I think the retail environment in general has been relatively receptive when you have a cost-based story to accepting pricing as you've seen from many of the other consumer product company reports that have come out over the past week or so.From a longer-term perspective on operating margin, we continue to believe that we've got a significant opportunity to improve the operating margin of this company. And we think that the opportunity is largely gross margin based, which is why we've got the fuel productivity savings going, why we've got the Ovid initiative going, the automation initiative and we're attempting to drive gross margin accretive innovation to help us mix up.We also think we've got continued opportunity on overhead to simplify the company to drive productivity across the company. It is being masked somewhat in the short term because of the top line pressure, but our guidance implies a pretty significant bounce back in the back half of the year, as Mark went through.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Olivia Tong from Raymond James.Olivia Tong CheangGreat. First, I just wanted to ask a follow-up on pricing. If you could talk about any SKU versus on categories that we'll see price hikes in? Any SKU in terms of more premium or more value to your products? And then as you think about -- I know you mentioned that these are cost justified, but what happens if others don't follow? How comfortable are you with wider price gaps as you try to rebuild the profitability? And then I have a follow-up.Christopher H. PetersonYes. So we can't get into the specifics given the breadth of the pricing. But as Mark mentioned in the prepared remarks, it's largely focused in the home and commercial segment. And so it is where the majority of this analysis showed that we haven't fully priced for inflation. And in some cases, we -- because of that, we've got structural profitability challenge.I think the other thing I would say on the pricing is we'll see as we go on. What we've seen generally today is where we priced and pricing has gone into the market, competitors have followed, but they have followed on a lag effect. And so we've been scraped by competitors. And so in the short term, this may put some market share at risk if we're trying to go out and take a price increase and competition follows us at some period in the future. Of course, we don't know what they're going to do. We're going to watch that.The reason why we feel like this is the right thing to do is even if competition doesn't follow us, because this pricing is geared toward products that are relatively structurally challenged, not all of the pricing but significant part of it. Even if we do have volume loss, it doesn't really cost us that much from a profitability standpoint, if you will. So that's why we're convinced it's the right thing to do, and we'll report out as we go along here.Olivia Tong CheangGreat. And my follow-up is just -- I know we're only one quarter into fiscal '23. But as you think about sort of the exit rate and your second-half growth implications. Should we expect a similar run rate at the beginning of first half of fiscal '24? I mean I know the business seasonality is going to play it, but if destocking will be in the base, the back-to-school timing base is clean, commodities get better, pricing is in place. I would imagine that first half of '24 should look -- the growth rates should look pretty compelling.Mark J. ErcegWe appreciate the question. We do, but we don't think it's appropriate for us to comment on anything related to fiscal '24 at this time.OperatorOur final question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman from Barclays.Lauren Rae LiebermanSo I know you've touched a bunch of times on the price increases coming in the third quarter. But my question was actually more about the kind of SKU by SKU analysis and kind of thinking about structural economics across the business. I was curious how much of the gaps that you're kind of seeing or other spots maybe where you're not taking pricing, but that things sort of revealed themselves to you in that work that suggested there's kind of structural dynamics to be explored to use your own words, to free up capacity for reinvesting for having a stronger and more an innovation pipeline. But this notion of looking at structural economics across the business, I found to be really interesting. And if there are things in play that aren't just about straight pricing that helped get it that maybe on a SKU-by-SKU basis.Christopher H. PetersonYes. Lauren, we are -- have the same excitement that is in your question from this work because I think one of the things that we've been building and as we've been simplifying is a much stronger analytical capability to dissect the business on many different metrics. And that capability, coupled with the complexity reduction is what has sort of revealed this opportunity, which the company really wouldn't have been able to do a few years ago.To the question of, well, are there other opportunities? I think the answer is going to be yes. And one of the things that I mentioned in my prepared remarks is that we're going through a refresh of the corporate strategy. And as part of that refresh, we're going relatively deep on all of the different capabilities that are required to win in this industry and how we stack up versus competition.We're also using this analytics to take a fresh look at the where to play choices and the how to win choices for the company. And then what we need to do from a sort of culture, talent standpoint to enable the execution of that strategy. So I think we're pretty excited about that work. We're not through it yet, which is why we're not sharing it here today. But I do think we're going to be in a position to share that in the next few months. And it's very much based on that sort of more detailed analytic look at how the business really breaks out across a whole variety of different vectors.Mark J. ErcegThe only other thing I'd add is we look at almost 6,000 SKUs in the U.S. as part of this work. We are replicating that same analysis for Latin America for EMEA. We've been building out customer P&amp;Ls, brand P&amp;Ls. We've been doing 4-wall plant, cost analyses. I mean the analytical capabilities are really ramping up, and we think it's going to provide us with tremendous opportunities in the future.Lauren Rae LiebermanOkay. Great. It's a good place to end the call, I think.Christopher H. PetersonYes. Yes, it is. Thanks, everybody, for joining, and we look forward to talking to you again soon.OperatorLadies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.

This compares to earnings of $0.36 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -50%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this consumer products company would post earnings of $0.12 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.16, delivering a surprise of 33.33%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Newell Brands , which belongs to the Zacks Consumer Products - Staples industry, posted revenues of $1.81 billion for the quarter ended March 2023, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.09%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $2.39 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Newell Brands shares have lost about 9.2% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 7.7%.What's Next for Newell Brands?While Newell Brands has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Newell Brands: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.35 on $2.2 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $1.03 on $8.5 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Consumer Products - Staples is currently in the top 37% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.One other stock from the same industry, Krispy Kreme (DNUT), is yet to report results for the quarter ended March 2023. The results are expected to be released on May 11.This doughnut wholesaler and retailer is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.08 per share in its upcoming report, which represents no change from the year-ago quarter.

(NYSE:UPS)",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/calculating-fair-value-united-parcel-110019326.html,1682766019,STORY,['UPS'],"[Key InsightsThe projected fair value for United Parcel Service is US$175 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to EquityWith US$180 share price, United Parcel Service appears to be trading close to its estimated fair valueOur fair value estimate is 7.5% lower than United Parcel Service's analyst price target of US$190Does the April share price for United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for United Parcel Service The CalculationWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$7.59bUS$8.66bUS$8.59bUS$9.35bUS$9.81bUS$10.2bUS$10.6bUS$10.9bUS$11.2bUS$11.5bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x12Analyst x12Analyst x6Analyst x2Est @ 4.90%Est @ 4.05%Est @ 3.46%Est @ 3.04%Est @ 2.75%Est @ 2.55% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.2% US$7.0kUS$7.4kUS$6.8kUS$6.8kUS$6.6kUS$6.4kUS$6.1kUS$5.8kUS$5.5kUS$5.2k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$64bThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.2%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$11b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (8.2%– 2.1%) = US$191bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$191b÷ ( 1 + 8.2%)10= US$87bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$150b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$180, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at United Parcel Service as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.033. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for United Parcel ServiceStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings growth over the past year underperformed the Logistics industry.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Logistics market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio compared to estimated Fair P/E ratio.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. For United Parcel Service, we've put together three pertinent items you should further research:Risks: Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 12 major stocks, including American Express Co. (AXP), Enbridge Inc. (ENB) and Micron Technology, Inc. (MU). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Shares of American Express have outperformed the Zacks Financial - Miscellaneous Services industry over the past six months (+7.6% vs. -2.5%). The company has adopted several growth initiatives, such as launching new products, reaching new agreements and forging alliances, are boosting its revenues. We expect the top line at $60.8 billion in 2023.Consumer spending on T&amp;E, which carry higher margins for AmEx, is advancing well. Its balance sheet looks strong with manageable debt. Solid cash-generation abilities enable the pursuit of business investments and capital deployment.However, with higher utilization of the company’s cards, expenses in the form of card member services and card member rewards are likely to strain the margins. Also, marketing and business development expense is expected to rise. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.(You can read the full research report on American Express here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Enbridge’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Production and Pipelines industry over the past six months (+4.3% vs. +4.1%). The company has the longest and most sophisticated oil and liquids pipeline system in the world, which spreads across 17,809 miles. Hence, a significant portion of the midstream operator’s earnings is generated from transportation operations, driven by a string of long-term contracts.ENB sanctioned C$8 billion of organic growth projects in 2022, bringing its total backlog to C$17 billion. The firm expects to put more than C$10 billion growth projects into service in 2024 and beyond. This is expected to generate significant EBITDA growth in the coming years.However, ENB’s significant debt exposure is concerning. ENB reported weak fourth-quarter results due to lower contributions from the Renewable Power Generation segment. Also, it has mostly been yielding lower dividends than the industry.  As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.(You can read the full research report on Enbridge here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Micron Technology have outperformed the Zacks Semiconductor Memory industry over the past six months (+17.0% vs. +14.9%). The company is witnessing growing demand for memory chips from cloud-computing providers and acceleration in 5G (fifth-generation) cellular network adoptions.Rising mix of high-value solutions, 5G adoption in Internet of Things devices and wireless infrastructure, enhancement in customer engagement and improvement in cost structure are growth drivers.Nonetheless, Micron near-term prospect looks gloomy as weakening consumer spending is negatively impacting demand for memory chips used in personal computers (PCs) and smartphones. Bit shipments for the DRAM and NAND memory chips may decline in the near-term as PC makers are adjusting their inventory due to weakened demand.(You can read the full research report on Micron Technology here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.

However, stiff competition is a headwind.CRISPR's (CRSP) Dependence on Collaboration Revenues A WoeWhile CRISPR Therapeutics' pipeline progress is impressive, the Zacks Analyst is concerned about a lack of stable stream of income as the company has no marketed drugs in its portfolio.New UpgradesSports Betting Expansion to Boost Boyd Gaming (BYD) ProspectsPer the Zacks analyst, Boyd Gaming is likely to benefit from its interactive gaming platform, FanDuel partnership and expansion initiatives.

As Barron’s put it, “big banks seem to be sailing through.” Meanwhile, the publication quoted Wells Fargo analyst Mike Mayo as saying that “there is no evidence of a banking crisis.” CNBC’s Steve Liesman tweeted on April 11 that “loans are still 18% above the pre-pandemic level,” and Robin Brooks, a former Goldman Sachs senior economist tweeted that large banks deposit outflows are “normal,” while small bank deposit outflows “have ended.” All of that information, plus the extremely low valuation of many banks and the strong overall U.S. economy, makes this a great time to buy many financial stocks, including many bank stocks.When it comes to investing in financial stocks, I’m most bullish on the strongest large banks, well-run regional banks that will benefit from the “onshoring” trend, and credit card networks that will get a boost from the strong labor market.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsJPMorgan Chase (JPM)A sign for JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM).Source: Bjorn Bakstad / Shutterstock.comJPMorgan’s (NYSE:JPM) profit soared 52% year over year to $12.6 billion last quarter. Its net interest income jumped 49% YOY to $20.9 billion and its top line increased 25% YOY to $38.3 billion, representing its highest quarterly sales total ever.Moreover, the bank raised its full-year net interest income guidance to $81 billion from $74 billion. Also noteworthy is that, despite all the hand wringing about consumers’ financial difficulties, the bank’s 30-day delinquency rate was unchanged in March, staying at a low 0.88%.CEO Jamie Dimon said “the U.S. economy continues to be on generally healthy footings — consumers are still spending and have strong balance sheets, and businesses are in good shape.”With JPM’s core businesses all performing very well, it is one of the best financial stocks to invest in now.Additionally, in a note to investors on April 17, Bank of America increased its price target on JPM stock to $158 from $152, citing what it sees as the bank’s “strong execution at the top.”Story continuesGiven JPM’s strong growth and impressive outlook, its forward price-to-earnings ratio of 10.85x is rather low.Western Alliance (WAL)Tablet with Western Alliance Bank (WAL) logo.Source: Vitalii Vodolazskyi / Shutterstock.comDespite all of the worries over regional banks, Western Alliance (NYSE:WAL) reported very strong first-quarter results on April 18.The bank’s earnings per share, excluding certain items, rose slightly to $2.30 from $2.22, while its adjusted revenue climbed to $712 million. The value of the loans that the company intends to hold for the long term soared 13% YOY to $5.3 billion.Although WAL’s deposits did drop 9% YOY, the bank reported that its deposits “quickly stabilized.” The bank is taking multiple steps to grow its insured deposits going forward.In the wake of the results, investment bank Wedbush upgraded the shares to “outperform” from “neutral” and placed WAL on its Best Ideas List. Wedbush wrote that WAL’s “higher level of insured deposits at 73% should help support [its] deposit levels going forward.”I remain convinced that, over the longer term, Phoenix-based Western Alliance will benefit from the many factories being built in Arizona.WAL is trading at a tiny forward price-to-earnings ratio of 4.3x.American Express (AXP)the American Express logo etched into woodSource: First Class Photography / Shutterstock.comEncouragingly, American Express (NYSE:AXP) reported that its “U.S. consumer credit card delinquencies were unchanged” last month at a relatively low 1.1%, while its “U.S. small business card member delinquency rate … also stayed at 1.1%.”Although American Express’ first-quarter earnings per share came in below analyst estimates, its top line jumped 22%. Moreover, the company’s bottom line was negatively impacted by AXP’s decision to greatly increase its credit loss provisions in case of a recession. Excluding the surge in those provisions, its net income climbed nearly 50% year over year.Further, investment bank Bernstein named AXP stock as one of its top 12 overall stock picks on March 29. And on April 4, investment bank Oppenheimer identified AXP as its best pick in the credit card space, as the bank expects AXP’s sales to climb nearly 14% this year. Oppenheimer trimmed its price target on AXP to $180 from $182 but kept an “outperform” rating on the shares.Also making me very bullish on AXP stock is the fact that Barron’s quoted its CEO as saying, at the outset of the banking mini-crisis, that it’s “sort of firing on all cylinders right now,” while 2022 was “the best year in the company’s history.” Worth noting, too, is that, as of the end of last year, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B) owned 20% of AXP stock. That’s a big vote of confidence from the Oracle.AXP stock is changing hands at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 14.5x, versus 30x for Mastercard (NYSE:MA) and 27x for Visa (NYSE:V).On the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Global Revenues comprised Total Devices revenues of $607.9 million, up 40.4% (up 43% at CER) and Total Masks and other revenues of $372.2 billion, up 12.7% (up 15% at CER), all on a year-over-year basis.Meanwhile, Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) revenues grew 35.3% to $136.8 million (up 9% at CER).MarginsThe adjusted gross profit in the quarter under review rose 24.7% to $626.1 million, despite a 35.5% uptick in the cost of sales (excluding the amortization of acquired intangibles).However, the adjusted gross margin for the fiscal third quarter was 56.1%, reflecting a contraction of 203 basis points (bps). This decrease can be mainly attributed to an unfavorable product mix and a higher component cost, partially offset by an increase in average selling prices.Story continuesSG&amp;A expenses rose 25.2% year over year to $228.5 million. Research and development expenses increased 14.4% to $76.4 million.The adjusted operating income was $321.2 million in the quarter under discussion, up 27% from the year-ago quarter. However, the adjusted operating margin contracted 51 bps year over year to 28.7%.Financial UpdatesResMed exited the third quarter of fiscal 2023 with cash and cash equivalents of $227.9 million, compared with $273.7 million at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Total debt (short and long-term) at the end of the fiscal third quarter was $1.59 billion compared with $775.2 million at the end of the fiscal second quarter.The cumulative net cash provided by operating activities at the end of the fiscal third quarter was $282.6 million compared with $117.4 million in the year-ago period.The company paid out $64.6 million in dividends in the fiscal third quarter.Our TakeResMed exited the third quarter of fiscal 2023 with better-than-expected earnings and revenues. The company recorded a robust sales performance in the quarter on increased demand for sleep and respiratory care devices. RMD’s acquisition of MEDIFOX DAN positively contributed to the reported quarter’s SaaS business revenues, registering continued organic growth.The organic growth of ResMed’s mask and accessory business is supported by the new patient flow and new patient growth and enhanced resupply programs to existing patients, fuelled by continuous core patient demand.Meanwhile, RMD continues expanding the base of its AirSense 11 platform worldwide by ramping up its production and availability. Despite persistent supply-chain constraints, ResMed established a foothold in its largest market for its connected sleep apnea therapy devices CPAP and APAP through the combination of AirSense 10 and AirSense 11.Meanwhile, escalating costs pressurizing the company’s operating margin are worrisome. A year-over-year increase in the fiscal third quarter’s SG&amp;A expenses was driven by a rise in employee-related expenses and travel expenditures.Zacks Rank &amp; Other Key PicksResMed currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Some other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are Edwards Lifesciences Corporation EW, Intuitive Surgical, Inc.

294,d28f8865-6731-3d32-a5b0-d2ca49e268b2,TSCO,2023-04-29,Thinking Of Buying Broadstone Net Lease? Here Are The Properties And Tenants You'd Be Adding To Your Portfolio,Benzinga,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/thinking-buying-broadstone-net-lease-130659282.html,1682687219.0,STORY,"['BNL', 'DG', 'TSCO']","[Real estate investment trusts (REITs) are often popular with income-oriented investors because receiving regular monthly or quarterly dividends is comforting to those who rely on such payments for ongoing household or other bills. But investors should also consider the properties, tenants and contractual agreements that comprise the largest percentage of a REIT’s business to ensure that those payments will continue.Take a look at one REIT that has taken the idea of diversification to the maximum to significantly reduce risk, an idea that should appeal to investors in a possible recessionary environment.Broadstone Net Lease Inc. (NYSE: BNL) is a Rochester, New York-based internally managed, diversified REIT that was founded in 2007 and had its initial public offering (IPO) in 2020. In 2021 it received a credit rating upgrade of Baa2 with a stable outlook from Moody’s Investor Service. CEO John Moragne took over the position in January.Broadstone leases properties with a net-lease strategy and a weighted-average lease term (WALT) of 10.9 years with about 19% of its top 10 tenants. Its leases carry a 2% weighted-average annual rent escalation.Broadstone’s portfolio at the end of 2022 included 804 properties, with 797 of them in 44 states and seven in four Canadian provinces. Broadstone had 221 distinct tenants in 55 industries. It has a total of 39.1 million rentable square feet.The total return on Broadstone Net Lease since its IPO is 14.19%, and year to date its total return is negative 0.65%. The 52-week range is $14.98 to $22.72, and its recent closing price was $15.81.Broadstone pays a quarterly dividend of $0.275, and the annual dividend of $1.08 per share yields 6.74%. With a forward funds from operations (F/FFO) of $1.53, that’s a price/FFO payout ratio of 71.3%, still within the comfort zone of coverage but not leaving a lot of room for further dividend growth unless FFO rises.The dividend has more than doubled in less than three years, but this is deceiving. In September 2020, the quarterly dividend was $0.135 per share, and in December it rose by 85% to $0.25 per share. Since then it’s been raised three times but only by a total of 10% to $0.275.Story continuesInvestors who buy Broadstone will indirectly acquire a diverse group of tenants. The chart below shows the top 20 tenants that lease from Broadstone Net Lease:Broadstone’s largest tenant is Roskam Baking Co., a private food manufacturer, founded in 1923 and based in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Roskam is a large, diversified bakery operation with six facilities of manufacturing, warehouse and office space. It leases seven properties totaling more than 2 million square feet from Broadstone.Roskam manufactures products such as popcorn, pretzels, snack mixes, frozen breakfast foods, dough, glazes, frostings and fresh and frozen baked goods. It also has a separate division called Organic Milling, which makes granola, snacks and other ingredients with a focus on organic, non-GMO and gluten-free foods.Other well-known Broadstone Net Lease tenants include:Dollar General Corp. (NYSE: DG) is a large retail outlet that sells everyday inexpensive items, such as health and beauty aids, cleaning supplies, housewares, seasonal items, food and snacks and paper products.Dollar General was founded in 1939 and launched its IPO in 2009. Today it has 19,147 stores with roughly 170,000 employees in 47 states. Dollar General ranks 106th on the Fortune 500 list, and last year it had $37.8 billion in sales.Dollar General leases 60 of Broadstone’s properties, making it the largest tenant by number of properties leased. Dollar General’s annualized base rent (ABR) is approximately 1.5% of Broadstone’s total.Tractor Supply Co. (NASDAQ: TSCO) is a large retail chain that serves the needs of rural America with products for homes, land, pets and livestock. Tractor Supply was founded over 85 years ago and operates 2,066 stores in 49 states. Tractor Supply had well over $15 billion in sales in 2022. Its IPO was in January 1959.Last October, Tractor Supply acquired 81 stores from Orscheln Farm and Home. Those stores will be rebranded to become Tractor Supply stores by the end of the year.Jack’s Family Restaurants is a privately owned quick-service restaurant chain founded in 1960 and located throughout the Southern U.S. There are almost 200 Jack’s Family Restaurants in four states — Alabama, Tennessee, Georgia and Mississippi. Broadstone owns 43 properties that are leased by Jack’s Family Restaurants.Other well-known companies that are Broadstone tenants include Red Lobster Hospitality, J. Alexander’s, Outback Steakhouse, Krispy Kreme Inc. (NASDAQ: DNUT), Bob Evans Restaurants, Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE: VZ), Ryerson Holding Corp. (NYSE: RYI), BJ’s Wholesale Club Holdings Inc. (NYSE: BJ) and Family Dollar, which is owned by Dollar Tree Inc. (NYSE: DLTR),Broadstone Net Lease’s strength lies in the diversity of its property types. Of its properties, 51% are industrial, 17% healthcare, 13% restaurants, 12% retail and 7% offices. Broadstone’s largest tenant, Roskam, makes up only 4% of its total annualized base rent. Of its top 20 tenants, 18 each contribute less than 2% of the ABR.The chart below shows the complete segmented breakdown of the various property types in Broadstone’s portfolio.With talk of a looming recession, this diversity is important because no single tenant defaulting on rent or local market disruption can affect Broadstone’s bottom line to any great degree.Another strength Broadstone has is the longevity that many of its tenants have enjoyed. Many of these businesses were founded decades ago, and they have seen every facet of the economic cycle and survived through the worst of times. Broadstone’s most recent occupancy rate was 99.4% and its rent collection rate is 99.9%. Even during the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic, rent collection was 99.9%. This speaks volumes about the solvency and stability of its tenant base.Broadstone has been aggressive lately in acquiring some $900 million of new properties in 2022 alone. Plans to acquire an additional $400 million of properties in 2023 are underway. Broadstone purposely takes a diversified approach with property types in its new acquisitions. The graph below highlights Broadstone’s acquisitions from 2015 through 2022:The criteria Broadstone uses in acquiring properties is for single-tenant net lease healthcare, industrial, restaurant, retail or office properties between $5 million and $300 million. It’s willing to do sale-leasebacks, build-to-suit, lease assumption, forward commitments and UPREIT (umbrella partnership REIT) transactions. Lease terms preferred are seven or more years with contractual rent escalations.Recent NewsThere has been very little analyst coverage lately on Broadstone. The last report was in December when Morgan Stanley analyst Ronald Kamdem maintained Broadstone with an Equal-Weight rating but lowered the price target from $20 to $19.On Feb. 24, Broadstone Net Lease announced its full-year 2022 earnings. Funds from operations of $273.7 million was up 6.8% from full-year 2021 and revenue of $407.50 million was up 6.4% from full-year 2021. FFO exceeded analyst estimates by 3.5%, and revenue beat the estimates by 1.5%.The fourth-quarter numbers were not as impressive. FFO of $0.36 missed the estimates by $0.03, but revenue of $112.14 million was better than the estimates by $5.64 million.  And adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) guidance between $1.40 and $1.42 per share was below the consensus number of $1.49.On March 3, Broadstone announced that independent Director Michael Coke had purchased $179,000 worth of the company’s stock for $17.92 per share. It was the largest insider purchase in a year.On March 14, Broadstone announced that its board had authorized a repurchase program of up to $150 million of the company’s outstanding common stock. The repurchase program runs for a full year.Broadstone’s first-quarter 2023 earnings release is scheduled for May 3, after the closing bell. The share price has been falling since February, so it would be prudent for investors to wait until after the operating results are announced before making any share purchases.Over the past five years, private market real estate investments have outperformed the publicly traded REIT market by about 50%.

Quote Quarter in DetailAdjusted earnings were 89 cents per share, which increased 9.9% year over year and 17.3% on a constant-currency (cc) basis. The metric surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 80 cents per share and our estimate of 78 cents a share. The year-over-year upside was mainly backed by solid operating gains, reduced shares outstanding and lower taxes. These were somewhat offset by increased interest expenses.Net revenues advanced 18.1% year over year to $9,166 million. The metric beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8,432.1 million and our estimate of $ $8,016.6 million. The uptick was driven by strong organic net revenue growth of 19.4%, and increased sales from Chipita, Clif Bar and Ricolino buyouts, somewhat negated by currency headwinds. Favorable volumes and pricing contributed to organic net revenues.Revenues from emerging markets increased 21.4% to $3,598 million, while rising 25.2% on an organic basis.

These were somewhat negated by pricing.Mondelez’s adjusted operating income rose $285 million at cc. The adjusted operating income margin contracted 60 bps to 17.2% due to input cost inflation.

When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. View our latest analysis for Capital One Financial The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Capital One FinancialOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the President of Commercial Banking, Neal Blinde, for US$921k worth of shares, at about US$115 per share. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. It's of some comfort that this sale was conducted at a price well above the current share price, which is US$95.99. So it may not shed much light on insider confidence at current levels. Notably Neal Blinde was also the biggest buyer, having purchased US$3.7k worth of shares.Over the last year we saw more insider selling of Capital One Financial shares, than buying. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeI will like Capital One Financial better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Insiders At Capital One Financial Have Sold Stock RecentlyThe last quarter saw substantial insider selling of Capital One Financial shares. Specifically, President of Commercial Banking Neal Blinde ditched US$921k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.Story continuesDoes Capital One Financial Boast High Insider Ownership?Many investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. It's great to see that Capital One Financial insiders own 1.3% of the company, worth about US$459m. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About Capital One Financial Insiders?An insider sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. Zooming out, the longer term picture doesn't give us much comfort. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. When we did our research, we found 4 warning signs for Capital One Financial (1 is a bit unpleasant!) that we believe deserve your full attention.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

Earnings of $2.31 per share lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.80 by a wide margin. The bottom line tanked 59% from the year-ago quarter. Our estimate for earnings was $2.71.Results were adversely impacted by significantly higher provisions. Also, an increase in operating expenses and lower non-interest income acted as headwinds. Yet, decent loan balance and higher interest rates aided net interest income (NII).

302,10d07a18-c12e-3025-85be-4013330abf58,ULTA,2023-04-29,Why Mary Dillon accepted the CEO role at Foot Locker after leaving Ulta Beauty’s corner office: ‘I didn’t realize how much I would miss having one big thing to focus on’,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-mary-dillon-accepted-ceo-103000613.html,1682677800,STORY,"['FL', 'ULTA', 'NKE']","[In her eight years as CEO of Ulta Beauty, Mary Dillon nearly tripled the cosmetics, hair care, and skin care chain’s sales and store footprint in one of the most successful runs in modern retail history. When she stepped down in 2021, Ulta’s revenue was at an all-time high of $8.6 billion. So Dillon, 61, could have chosen to relax and spend more time perfecting her tennis stroke, playing pickleball (her new passion), and sitting on corporate boards.More from Fortune:  5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from home Looking to make extra cash? This CD has a 5.15% APY right now Buying a house? Here's how much to save This is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home Instead, Dillon, unable to resist the challenge of restoring an illustrious company’s luster and still feeling too energetic for a slower-paced life, accepted the CEO job at Foot Locker last year, a retailer that, while not broken, has been underperforming for years. “I didn’t realize how much I would miss having one big thing to focus on and how much I would miss leading a retail company,” Dillon told Fortune in a March interview at the Shoptalk conference in Las Vegas. In taking another CEO role, Dillon became the third woman to ever run two Fortune 500 companies, after Patricia K. Poppe (CMS Energy and PG&amp;E) and Meg Whitman (Hewlett Packard and eBay).Much as she did at Ulta, which was weak in e-commerce and had too much product overlap with competitors when she took the reins in 2013, Dillon has set about differentiating Foot Locker from sports footwear rivals and improving its digital business. She was hired in large part to repair Foot Locker’s crucial relationship with Nike, which generated 65% of Foot Locker sales last year but which in 2022 said it would reduce its presence at the shoe store over time. (Foot Locker’s namesake corporate parent also owns and operates the Kids Foot Locker, Champs Sports, WSS, and Atmos chains.)Story continuesDillon, a brand-building guru and marketing data expert whose successes at Ulta include getting Estée Lauder to sell its luxury products at a strip-mall retailer, has called 2023 a “reset year.” She told investors in March that Foot Locker has “reestablished joint planning, as well as data and insight sharing” with Nike.This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.Fortune: Not even a year into retirement, you land the top job at Foot Locker. Was retirement not for you?I was so proud of creating an amazing group of leaders at Ulta to succeed me, and I felt it was time to hand over the reins to a team that was ready to rock and roll. But during the year I was executive chair of Ulta [mid-2021 to mid-2022], I didn’t realize how much I would miss having one big thing to focus on and how much I would miss leading a retail company.What did you imagine retirement would look like before leaving Ulta? I thought it would be a mosaic of things—a couple of board seats [including private equity firm KKR]. I wanted to get involved in some smaller startups, and the food industry is something I’ve always loved. I thought I would do that and maybe play pickleball, tennis, and travel. But I realized how much I miss running a company, and don’t laugh when I say this, but I’m not getting any younger. So I thought, “If I want to take another run at a company, now’s the time to do it.”But why Foot Locker? You’re going from beauty products to sneakers.Foot Locker might not be the most obvious place for me to show up, but there are many parallels between the sneaker and beauty categories. And there are parallels with Ulta. In 2013, the business was performing well, but we needed to go through an overhaul process to help Ulta hit its potential. Another similarity is that sneakers, like beauty, are a great growth category. They’re an $80 billion industry just in North America. There are tailwinds for sneakers, like mass casualization, fashion, and fitness. Foot Locker is also a more complex business than Ulta; there are multiple banners, and it’s global. It is time to really modernize and reinvigorate the brand and be an even better partner for our brand partners.Still, running shoes are very different from hair products and lip balm. How did you learn about this new-to-you industry and how to be that better partner?I’m still learning, and I will be a student forever because there’s so much innovation and newness in sneakers. Since I already understood retail companies with multiple brands, my approach has focused more on getting to know our brand partners. It doesn’t hurt that I’ve been a runner all my adult life. We just need to unlock this idea for people that Foot Locker is a place to meet all their needs. I love that a segment of our customers is sneakerheads.So what was Foot Locker not doing adequately before your arrival? One is all things digital. So we are about to start investing in a multiyear road map to modernize our tech infrastructure. We also need to develop our loyalty program, which has 500,000 members. (Ulta’s currently has about 32 million members.) Our e-commerce needs to be better and have less friction, whether you’re shopping on the app or the website, and we need better inventory visibility.Nike caused a stir in early 2022 when it said it would reduce business with Foot Locker, among other partners. What’s your approach there?This is a unique dynamic in the industry. I’ve spent a tremendous amount of time with everybody at Nike, who welcomed me into the industry. We’ve discussed the areas where we can focus on capabilities and building a road map. With Nike, it’s been about reestablishing and revitalizing our partnership with them. So we will differentiate our store brands more from one another and give all our brands a great platform, whether online or in stores. Our message is that we have a unique role to play for Nike and all brand partners. We can help drive category growth.What does that look like more precisely?We expect to be back on a growth trajectory with Nike soon and are focusing on a few key areas to collaborate. One is basketball, another is sneaker culture, and there will be more exclusives with Nike and other brands. We will go from having exclusives for Foot Locker be 15% of sales to 25%. But we also want to increase the mix of other brands, so we will grow with Nike but also brands like Adidas, New Balance, Puma, and Hoka.Could all this include selling sneakers as fashion items?All sorts of sneakers we sell are really fun to wear on the street and for different things, but we are not at that luxury price point. Down the road, who knows what we could experiment with, but that’s a different pricing tier.Since you departed from Ulta Beauty, the retailer has continued to thrive under Dave Kimbell. Why do you think that is?I am so proud of the leadership team. We worked hard to create a great succession. One of my biggest strengths is identifying great talent and giving them runway to grow. Dave is doing a great job, and Kecia Steelman started as head of stores and is now chief operating officer because she had so much runway. It’s amazing how they continue to slay it every day. I’m excited to be able to create a new chapter, hopefully, for Foot Locker as well. I think the aperture is wide to unlock the sneakerhead culture there.Get to know Dillon:While she runs shorter distances nowadays, Dillon qualified for the prestigious Boston Marathon in her first attempt at a marathon in Chicago in 2000.Before joining Ulta, Dillon was CEO of U.S. Cellular and McDonald’s marketing chief.Dillon cut her teeth in marketing at PepsiCo for 21 years, culminating in her appointment as president of its Quaker Foods division by the time she left in 2005.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

This takes the dividend yield to 2.7%, which shareholders will be pleased with. Check out our latest analysis for Norfolk Southern Norfolk Southern's Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsA big dividend yield for a few years doesn't mean much if it can't be sustained. Before making this announcement, Norfolk Southern was easily earning enough to cover the dividend. This means that most of what the business earns is being used to help it grow.The next year is set to see EPS grow by 28.1%. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 34%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.historic-dividendNorfolk Southern Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $2.00 in 2013 to the most recent total annual payment of $5.40. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 10% a year over that time. Rapidly growing dividends for a long time is a very valuable feature for an income stock.Dividend Growth May Be Hard To Come BySome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. However, initial appearances might be deceiving. In the last five years, Norfolk Southern's earnings per share has shrunk at approximately 7.1% per annum. A modest decline in earnings isn't great, and it makes it quite unlikely that the dividend will grow in the future unless that trend can be reversed. It's not all bad news though, as the earnings are predicted to rise over the next 12 months - we would just be a bit cautious until this can turn into a longer term trend.Our Thoughts On Norfolk Southern's DividendOverall, this is a reasonable dividend, and it being raised is an added bonus. While the payments look sustainable for now, earnings have been shrinking so the dividend could come under pressure in the future. The payment isn't stellar, but it could make a decent addition to a dividend portfolio.Story continuesCompanies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company.

Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Coca-Cola Step By Step Through The CalculationWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$9.28bUS$11.4bUS$12.3bUS$14.1bUS$14.5bUS$14.9bUS$15.2bUS$15.6bUS$15.9bUS$16.3bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x7Analyst x6Analyst x4Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 2.46%Est @ 2.34%Est @ 2.26%Est @ 2.20%Est @ 2.16% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.8% US$8.7kUS$10.0kUS$10.1kUS$10.8kUS$10.4kUS$10.0kUS$9.6kUS$9.2kUS$8.8kUS$8.4k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$96bThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.8%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$16b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (6.8%– 2.1%) = US$349bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$349b÷ ( 1 + 6.8%)10= US$181bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$277b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$64.2, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Coca-Cola as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.8%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Coca-ColaStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Beverage market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio compared to estimated Fair P/E ratio.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Although the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

These were partly negated by growth in the Twisted Tea and Hard Mountain Dew brands.The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has declined 16.2% in the past three months against the industry’s 7.3% growth. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Costs &amp; MarginsThe gross profit declined 10% year over year to $155.7 million, whereas the gross margin contracted 220 basis points (bps) to 38% from 40.2% in the year-ago quarter. Higher inventory obsolescence costs and higher brewery processing mainly hurt the company’s gross margin, offset by price increases. The rise in inventory obsolescence costs mainly resulted from rebranding Truly Vodka Seltzer to Truly Vodka Soda, and a non-recurring payment to a third-party contract brewery. These factors resulted in an unfavorable impact of 210 bps on the gross margin.Advertising, promotional and selling expenses declined 4% in the reported quarter to $125.4 million due to lower freight to distributors of $12.6 million on reduced rates and volumes. This was partly offset by higher brand investments of $7.4 million mainly related to investments in local marketing, as well as elevated salary and benefit costs.General and administrative expenses increased 10.1% year over year to $43.7 million mainly due to increased consulting costs.Story continuesThe Boston Beer Company, Inc.

The company currently has $150 million in its line of credit, which, along with its cash position, will be sufficient to meet cash requirements.The company repurchased shares worth $27.5 million from Jan 3, 2023, to Apr 21, 2023. Of this, it bought back shares worth $21.9 million in first-quarter 2023 and $5.6 million so far in the second quarter. As of Apr 22, 2023, the company had $62.8 million remaining under its existing share repurchase authorization worth $931 million.

The company’s adjusted earnings per share guidance excludes the impacts of ASU 2016-09.Depletions and shipments are expected to decline 2-8%. This view includes the adverse impacts of 1% due to an additional 53rd week in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2023 will have 52 weeks. On a 52-week comparable basis, the company expects depletions and shipments to decline 1-7%.SAM anticipates a gross margin of 41-43%. The company expects a year-over-year gross margin improvement in the second half of 2023 due to the expected timing of cost-reduction efforts and the timing of obsolescence expenses recognized in 2022.Advertising, promotional and selling expenses are expected between down $5 million and up $15 million in 2023. This does not include any change in freight costs. The non-GAAP effective tax rate is anticipated to be 28%, excluding the impacts of ASU 2016-09.The Truly brand is predicted to show signs of improvement in the second half of this year. The 2023 overall volumes are likely to decline due to continued weakness in Truly volume, which is expected to partly offset strong growth in Twisted Tea.For the first quarter of 2023, shipments are likely to be at the low end of 2023 guidance, backed by the launch of Truly Margarita.Consumer Staple Stocks Worth a LookWe highlighted some better-ranked stocks from the broader Consumer Staples space, namely Vita Coco Company COCO, Coca-Cola KO and The Duckhorn Portfolio NAPA.Vita Coco currently flaunts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

If you want to see more such stocks on the list, go directly to Analysts Are Increasing Price Targets of These 5 Stocks.Especially technology stocks have been performing particularly well over the last few days. The gains were attributed to the release of earnings reports from Big Tech companies such as Alphabet, Microsoft, and Meta Platforms. On the other hand, First Republic Bank reported a 40% decrease in deposits in the first quarter, which renewed concerns about the broader banking sector and caused the major averages to fall on Tuesday.As concerns about the banking sector continue to rise, stock markets may face a significant loss of buying power from a key source, reported Bloomberg. According to Scott Rubner, a market analyst at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., systematic money managers have recently invested over $170 billion in global shares, which has driven their exposure to the highest level since early 2022. Rubner warns that as their positioning approaches its peak, these managers are more likely to sell off their holdings in the coming weeks. Rubner has studied fund flows for two decades and believes that this group's behavior could have a significant impact on the markets.The Conference Board has reported that consumer confidence has declined more than expected in April. The consumer confidence index dropped to 101.3 from 104.0 in March, a larger decline than the predicted decrease to 104.0 from the previously reported 104.2. Meanwhile, the Commerce Department released a report indicating that new home sales in March unexpectedly surged to their highest level in a year. Given that the real gross domestic product (GDP) increased at an annual rate of 1.1 percent in Q1 of 2023, Fed's high interest rate policy hasn't pushed the economy into a recession. Economists have been predicting a US recession since the second half of 2022. We also observe the positive effects of relatively strong consumer spending in Q1 earnings of most publicly traded stocks.Story continuesAfter geopolitical tensions led to the loss of around $446 billion in mainland Chinese shares this month, a decline in Chinese stocks has paused as dip buyers enter the market, reported Bloomberg. The CSI 300 Index, a benchmark index of Chinese stocks, rose 0.3% in the afternoon session on April 26, having fallen by as much as 0.7% earlier. The MSCI gauge of Chinese shares also rose more than 1% after six days of losses, although it is still on track for its worst April performance since 2004. Additionally, the offshore yuan has rebounded from its nearly seven-week low against the US dollar. Key gauges are showing some signs of stability after several days of losses.Beverage giants PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) and The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) along with retail giant Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), recently came into the spotlight after receiving price-target hikes from analysts. PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) and The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) received the updated price targets following their latest quarterly performance. On the other hand, KeyBanc analyst Bradley Thomas increased its price target for Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), citing accelerating growth from margin accretive businesses and cost and efficiency benefits from automation.Meanwhile, healthcare stocks, including HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA) and Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB), were also on the list of 10 stocks receiving price-target hikes from analysts.

(NYSE:SNV) rating from Neutral to Buy and assigned a fair value estimate of $38. Marinac cited stable credit quality, manageable exposures in commercial real estate and commercial &amp; industrial sectors, as well as strong deposit growth and core account openings of new commercial accounts in the last quarter. The analyst also expressed optimism about the momentum in Synovus' business and believes it can continue.9. Cadence Design Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CDNS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 47Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya increased the price target of Cadence Design Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CDNS) to $240 from $225 and maintained a Buy rating on the shares, following the company's Q1 earnings report, which Arya described as a ""slight beat."" Additionally, Cadence Design Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CDNS) provided a modest raise of its sales and EPS guidance for FY23. Arya acknowledged that the cyclical nature of hardware and intellectual property (IP) sales may create intra-quarter volatility, but he believes that the timing of revenue does not indicate a deceleration of the beneficial long-term secular trends that the firm sees as sustainable. Arya communicated this information to investors on April 25.Cadence Design Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ: CDNS) has recently garnered attention due to its impressive Q4 results. The company's revenue in Q4 2022 experienced a YoY increase of approximately 16.4% to $899.88 million, exceeding estimates by $15.65 million. Cadence Design Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ: CDNS) management has expressed confidence in the company's growth prospects, citing AI, machine learning, 5G, and hyperscale computing as the key drivers of its secular growth.Renaissance Investment made the following comment about Cadence Design Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CDNS) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Cadence Design Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CDNS) was another contributor. The company reported strong operating results with broad-based strength from its semiconductor customers who are migrating to next-generation manufacturing nodes. We believe the multi-year investment cycle for semiconductor design spending should drive sustainable double-digit growth well into next year.”8. O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORLY)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 47On April 25, Evercore ISI increased its price target on O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORLY) to $950 from $945 while maintaining an Outperform rating on the shares. The move comes ahead of the company's fiscal Q1 report, which is due to be released after the close on Wednesday. Despite the volatile Q1 weather, the analyst is optimistic and anticipates an above-trend quarter.TimesSquare U.S. Mid Cap Growth Strategy made the following comment about O’Reilly Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORLY) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Another boost came from O’Reilly Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORLY), a specialty retailer of after-market automotive parts and accessories, which scored a 20% gain. Revenues and earnings surpassed sell-side estimates on higher same store comparisons. Their do-it-for-me professional mechanic business generated double-digit growth while do-it-yourself increased sales by a modest amount.”7. McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 57McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) is a fast-food restaurant chain operator based in Chicago, Illinois, currently the largest chain operator globally. The company started with a single drive-in restaurant in San Bernardino, California, in 1955, and has since expanded to almost 40,000 locations in over 100 countries worldwide. McDonald's serves more than 60 million customers every year.On April 25, Morgan Stanley analyst John Glass increased the price target of McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) from $309 to $315 and has maintained an Overweight rating on the shares. The company's quarterly results had a ""relatively clean"" impact on the top and bottom line, with impressive sales across different markets. However, these results were against high expectations and an all-time high for the stock. Morgan Stanley believes that McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) is a ""core holding,"" though valuation sensitivity may exist at current levels.Like McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD), analysts have also increased its price target for PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), and Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB).6. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 58Deutsche Bank analyst Steve Powers has increased the price target of The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) from $61 to $63 and maintains a Hold rating on the shares following the Q1 results. The analyst notes that the company is executing well in a vibrant market. Powers communicated this information to investors on April 25.Rowan Street Capital mentioned The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s take The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) for example. Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next years forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”Click to continue reading and see the Analysts Are Increasing Price Targets of These 5 Stocks.Suggested articles:Most Advanced Countries in Artificial Intelligence10 Best Artificial Intelligence Stocks Under $10Best AI Penny Stocks Under $1Disclosure: None.

313,197bdcb3-4120-464f-b796-ba5b2f169123,KO,2023-04-29,Why the market loves food stocks right now: Morning Brief,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-the-market-loves-food-stocks-right-now-morning-brief-130009538.html,1682686809,STORY,"['CMG', 'MCD', 'TAP', 'TAP-A', 'PEP', 'KO', 'HSY']","[This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can receive in your inbox every Monday to Friday by 6:30 a.m. ET along with:The chart of the dayWhat we're watchingWhat we're readingEconomic data releases and earningsThere is one trade being devoured by investors right now — and no, it's not shorting First Republic (FRC).It's the food trade.From restaurant stocks such as Chipotle (CMG) to servers of soda in PepsiCo (PEP) to hawkers of chocolate like Hershey (HSY), the market has fallen in love with food stocks. These have been some of the best-performing stocks this week.And investors are correct in bidding these names up, judging by how the first half of the year is shaping up for the sector.Consider some of the tailwinds for the food space:Inflation is slowing for input costs, which is great for margins.Resistance to rounds of price increases has been generally limited, which is also great for margins.Recovery stories are playing out in China for multinational names such as PepsiCo.""You may not be able to go out and get a new car,"" PepsiCo vice chairman and CFO Hugh Johnston said on Yahoo Finance Live (video above). ""You may not be able to go out and get a really fancy piece of technology. But you can afford a bag of Doritos, or you can afford a Gatorade Zero after you workout, or you can afford an energy drink in the morning.""Good point by Hugh.Do you ever look at how much you just spent on a bag of chips at a 7-11 or WaWa? Maybe, maybe not. But I would bet that bag of chips today is more than 10% higher in price than at this point last year. Maybe 20%, depending on the flavor.You may not have even realized it, but the CFOs of consumer food companies did, and their shareholders are loving it. Expect more price increases from these giants this year in part because consumers don't appear to care.A person dressed in a Hershey chocolate bar costume celebrates Halloween on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange shortly after the market's opening bell in New York October 31, 2014. REUTERS/Lucas Jackson (Lucas Jackson / reuters)Then there is another aspect of the food trade that is getting overlooked. While I will get ridiculed by my colleague Julie Hyman for this statement, I believe we are in the golden age of food innovation.Story continuesThe aforementioned Hershey is selling Reese's snack cakes. Where was that 20 years ago?Meanwhile, PepsiCo and Coca-Cola (KO) are in active rollouts of ready-made alcoholic drinks after years of avoiding the space. Beer company Molson Coors (TAP) has started to sell whiskey with success. And Conagra Brands (CAG) has made frozen food taste great for maybe the first time ever.Then there's McDonald's rethinking how they cook a burger (thank goodness), Starbucks selling drinks with one inch of thick ""salted caramel cold foam,"" and Papa John's launching a giant hot-pocket-like product this week that has a Doritos Cool Ranch coating.Even my local pizza joint just started selling ""hot honey"" chicken pizza. I went to a whiskey distillery last week and they are serving up whiskey infused with roasted coconuts.You may be laughing at all this as it's not similar to innovations at Tesla or Apple.But it is in fact innovation that helps drive higher price points on food and, over time, fatter profits and stock prices. Combine that with cooling inflation, and you have one heck of an earnings power story in the food sector.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to James Brunk. Please go ahead.James F. BrunkThank you, Dave. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Mohawk Industries' quarterly investor call. Joining me on today's call are Jeff Lorberbaum, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Wellborn, President and Chief Operating Officer. Today, we'll update you on the company's first quarter performance and provide guidance for the second quarter of 2023. I'd like to remind everyone that our press release and statements that we make during this call may include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which are subject to various risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to, those set forth in our press release and our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This call may include a discussion of non-GAAP numbers. For a reconciliation of any non-GAAP to GAAP amounts, please refer to our Form 8-K and press release in the Investors section of our website. I'll now turn the call over to Jeff for opening comments.Story continuesJeffrey S. LorberbaumThanks, Jim. For the first quarter of 2023, Mohawk's net sales were $2.8 billion, down approximately 6.9% as reported or 5.9% on a constant basis, and our adjusted EPS for the quarter was $1.75. All of our businesses are adapting our strategies to a more challenging environment. We're managing our costs while investing for both short- and long-term growth. We exceeded our earnings expectations with the businesses maintaining higher pricing and mix and Flooring Rest of World outperforming the other segments. The commercial channel continues to be stronger than residential with home remodeling projects being postponed and new housing construction being impacted by higher mortgage rates. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we generated over $125 million of free cash flow. We strategically invested in new product innovation, enhanced merchandising in customer trade shows to improve sales. We are continuing to reduce costs across the enterprise by enhancing productivity, streamlining processes and controlling administrative expenses. Our customers remain conservative in their inventory commitments and all of our operations are running at lower utilization levels, creating higher costs from unabsorbed overhead. We see increased competition as industry capacity utilization and input costs decline. In Europe, natural gas prices have dropped dramatically, though they remain at almost double the historical levels. We expect consumer spending to improve as wages rise, inflation slows and energy costs fall. Our new product introductions provide more value options for budget conscious consumers. In the U.S. limited supply, high interest rates and persistent inflation have suppressed the housing market. Lower home sales and changing consumer spending habits are impacting their modeling category. We are maximizing our commercial business with new introductions, marketing initiatives and targeted promotions. And our other geographies, demand is similarly slowing with residential more affected than commercial. Though the Mexican economy faces challenges, our business there is holding up better, while Brazil slowed more with higher interest rates and reductions in consumer inventories. Our restructuring actions are on track in the Flooring North America and Flooring Rest of World segments and should improve the results of our business. We are limiting our other capital investments to those providing significant sales, margins and process improvements. We're expanding our constrained category that have the greatest growth potential when the economy recovers. These include LVT, premium laminate, quartz countertops, porcelain slabs and insulation products. We completed 2 acquisitions in ceramic in Brazil and Mexico that had combined sales of approximately $425 million, almost doubling our existing market share in those geographies. We are developing strategies to increase our sales by providing broader product offering and using combined brands to satisfy all price points. In each country, we're beginning to consolidate the businesses to reduce costs, improve efficiencies and optimize production. We also continue to improve the small bolt-on acquisitions in Europe and U.S. that we completed last year. Despite falling energy prices, natural gas and electricity inflation remained a headwind in the first quarter, though our future results will benefit as lower costs flow through the P&amp;L. Our sustainable strategy includes investments in both production of green energy from biomass, wind and solar, which reduces both our carbon -- our expenses in our carbon footprint. Our 2 biomass energy plants lowered our cost and improved our results in the quarter. We also purchased some of our European energy at various times to reduce future cost volatility. Italian energy subsidies have been extended at reduced levels through the second quarter. I'll turn the call over to Jim for his review of our financial performance.James F. BrunkThank you, Jeff. Sales for the quarter were just over $2.8 billion. That's a decrease of 6.9% as reported or 5.9% on a constant basis, driven by a reduction in volume and unfavorable FX as compared to Q1 2022, which was still benefiting from the COVID pandemic rebound in residential remodeling activity. The decrease was partially offset by favorable price, mix and acquisitions. Global Ceramic with a larger percentage of commercial and new construction had the strongest quarter. Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 22.9% as reported and excluding onetime items, was 24.1% versus 26.6% in the prior year. The year-over-year decline was due to the impact of inflation, lower volume, the related temporary plant shutdowns and unfavorable FX, partially offset by stronger price, mix and productivity gains. The actual detailed amounts of these items will be included in the MD&amp;A of our 10-Q which will be filed after the call. SG&amp;A as a percentage of sales was 18.4% as reported. The year-over-year dollar increase in SG&amp;A was driven by inflation, primarily in employee expenses, increased costs in product development and marketing to drive future sales, volume and unfavorable price, mix, partially offset by favorable FX and productivity initiatives. Operating margin as reported was 4.5%. Restructuring, acquisitions and other charges were $36 million in the quarter, of which $6 million was cash. These charges are primarily related to the previously announced initiatives, mainly in Flooring North America and Flooring Rest of the world. Operating margin, excluding charges, was 5.8% and similar to gross margin, the year-over-year decline is driven by higher inflation, lower volumes and related temporary plant shutdowns and costs associated with investments in new product development and marketing, partially offset by favorable price, mix and productivity gains. Interest expense for the quarter was $17 million, increasing year-over-year, primarily due to the higher interest rates. Our non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 22.6% versus 22.3% in the prior year. We expect Q2's tax rate to be approximately 19% to 20% and the full year rate to be between 21% and 22% with quarterly variations. That leads us to an earnings per share as reported of $1.26 and excluding charges of $1.75. Turning to the segments. In Global Ceramic, sales were just shy of $1.1 billion. That's a 0.5% decrease as reported and 1.2% decrease on a constant basis. Volume declines across all regions were only partially offset by favorable price, mix, FX gains and acquisitions. Overall, the U.S. business had the strongest year-over-year performance as commercial and new home construction outperformed residential remodeling. Operating margin, excluding charges, was 6.3%, declining year-over-year due to the slowing economies and higher interest rates impacting all geographies, resulting in lower volumes and short-term plant shutdowns, partially offset by favorable price, mix and productivity gains. We are focusing on expanding markets, integration of our acquisitions in Mexico and Brazil, differentiated products and growth CapEx to drive future results. In Flooring North America, sales were $953 million. That's an 11.1% decrease as reported and on a constant basis. We saw weakness across all product categories compared to a very robust Q1 of 2022, led by residential soft surface products as our commercial and laminate businesses, while still down versus prior year, had the strongest year-over-year volumes in the segment. Operating margin, excluding charges, was 0.5%. The decline in operating margin was due to the weakening in the housing market with consumers deferring home improvement projects and trading down to meet constrained budgets, leading to lower volumes and temporary plant shutdowns. In addition, the segment's margins were compressed as it absorbed peak material costs from prior periods. In the quarter, we also invested in new product development and marketing initiatives to expand future sales. These headwinds were partially offset by favorable price, mix and productivity gains. And finally, Flooring Rest of the World with sales of $793 million. That's a 9.7% decline as reported including unfavorable FX and 6% on a constant basis as housing-related purchases significantly declined, negatively impacting our flooring products as compared to our installation business, which maintained a positive year-over-year growth, driven by the push to further conserve energy. Operating margin, excluding charges, was 12.6%, declining versus prior year due to the higher inflation, lower volumes and temporary plant shutdowns, partially offset by favorable price, mix and benefit from our green energy production. We are implementing selective promotion, executing our restructuring actions and increasing supply chains outside of Europe to drive sales and margin growth. Corporate expense and eliminations were $10 million, in line with the prior year and I would expect full year corporate expenses should be approximately $45 million. Turning to the balance sheet. Free cash flow for the period was $129 million versus a $75 million use of cash in the prior year. Receivables were just shy of $2.1 billion, with DSO at 56 days versus 54 in the prior year, but improving from 60 days as of the end of the year of 2022. Inventories were just over $2.7 billion. Now excluding the impact of acquisitions, inventories decreased $114 million versus Q4 of 2022. Inventory days stand at 128 days versus 111 in the prior year, but improving from 138 days at the end of 2022. Property, plant and equipment was just over $4.9 billion, and Q1 CapEx was $128 million, with D&amp;A at $170 million. Full year, our '23 forecast includes CapEx of $570 million and D&amp;A of approximately $600 million. And finally, gross debt of $3.3 billion and leverage at 1.7x adjusted EBITDA gives us the strength and flexibility to manage through this uncertain market. Now I will turn the call over to Chris to review our Q1 operational performance.William Christopher WellbornThank you, Jim. The Global Ceramic segment spans many countries with each having their own unique economic conditions. All of our regions are being impacted by slowing economies and higher interest rates. The commercial channel is strongest and new home construction held up better than residential remodeling as consumers reduce discretionary purchases.In this softening environment, our customers are lowering their inventory levels with significant differences in each region. As industry volumes decline, we are facing additional competitive pressures in our markets. Our pricing has lagged our cost changes, though we are seeing decreases in energy and material expenses, which should benefit our future results. The U.S. is performing better than our other ceramic markets due to our greater sales in the commercial sector. Our domestic production is more reliable than imported alternatives, which is benefiting our sales, particularly in our premium collections, which compare favorably to European alternatives. We are shifting our sales force focus to target opportunities in the multifamily and exterior channels and are expanding our commercial and builder distribution with curated collections for immediate delivery. To increase our countertop volume, we are expanding our business with national accounts, contractors and kitchen and bath retailers. We are reengineering our entry-level quartz to countertop to lower our cost and enhance the value.To manage through the slowing environment, we continue to reduce our costs across the business, including overhead and discretionary spending. Our ceramic business in Europe remains under pressure as demand has declined due to ongoing inflation and higher interest rates. We maintained higher average selling prices than we anticipated, partially due to our new introductions. Our overall (technical Difficulty]OperatorWe have lost our speaker connection. Please stand by while we reconnect.Jeffrey S. LorberbaumDavid, have you reconnected him?OperatorI have now brought Chris Wellborn back in, and the conference can continue.William Christopher WellbornPressure as demand has declined due to ongoing inflation and higher interest rates. We maintained higher average selling prices than we anticipated, partially due to our new introductions. Our overall volumes were down in the quarter with all markets impacted by slowing residential remodeling. As the market slows, competition is becoming more aggressive in all channels. We are increasing porcelain slab production to support continued sales growth through enhanced visuals and specialized textures. A drop in fourth quarter energy prices benefited our cost in this quarter and subsidies from the Italian government helped to offset the impact of energy inflation. We continue to focus on cost containment, including productivity projects and R&amp;D initiatives. Our other ceramic markets are slowing, and we are reducing our production to align with demand. Sales trends improved as we progress through the quarter, and we expect these markets will continue to improve. Our 2023 product launches with new sizes, unique visuals and polished finishes are being well accepted in the market. The integration of our acquisitions is progressing and we are implementing specific sales, marketing and operational plans to improve the businesses. This year, we will convert the acquisitions to our information systems to enable operating as a single business and enhance efficiencies. In our Flooring Rest of World segment, our European business have been compressed as high energy prices and inflation impacted consumer budgets. In the first quarter, higher volumes reduced shutdowns, lower energy costs and production of green energy improved our business from the fourth quarter. The contraction in the housing market has reduced volume levels in our industry as consumers change spending priorities and customers' adjusted inventory levels. We are increasing promotions to attract additional volume and expanding product options for more constrained consumer budgets. We have increased controls to manage our cost and reduce our inventories. We are reengineering our formulations and expanding our supply base to improve our competitive position. We are executing our restructuring actions to adapt to the current environment. As input costs decline, we anticipate greater competitive pressures in the market. As consumers have deferred residential remodeling projects, our flooring category was most impacted during the quarter. Both laminate and LVT volumes were lower in the quarter, and we are controlling our cost and production levels in response. We have begun the conversion of our residential LVT from flexible to rigid and are preparing to restructure the operations. Our sheet vinyl increased in volume as consumers sought options to lower remodeling costs. We are improving the product offering at our new Eastern European sheet vinyl acquisition with updated styling as we enhance the facility's production efficiencies. Our panels business has slowed with market and inventory reductions in the channel. Our margins are higher than anticipated due to stronger pricing, lower input costs and benefits from our biomass energy plans. We are making progress on achieving our planned synergies of our French panels plant and our recent mezzanine flooring acquisition. Our insulation category performed the best in this segment as energy efficiency has become a greater priority. Government regulations around energy conservation continue to increase, and our polyurethane products provide the greatest heat-resistant properties. We have integrated our insulation acquisition in Ireland and the U.K., and our new facility is ramping up ahead of schedule. In Australia and New Zealand, the economies are slowing and inflation and higher interest rates have affected the housing market. In the quarter, our results were impacted by lower volumes in both residential soft and hard surfaces. We're implementing additional price increases to offset inflation and selectively introducing promotions to drive sales. The commercial sector is outperforming residential and we are expanding our emphasis in specified projects. We are controlling costs and adjusting inventory levels to market demand. Our Flooring North America segment has been challenged by significant inflation, higher interest rates and more restrictive lending, which have weakened the housing market and our industry. Many consumers are deferring home improvement investments or trading down due to budget constraints. As a result, our customers are more tightly managing their inventory levels. The segment's earnings for the quarter were compressed due to lower volumes and absorption of peak material costs, which our pricing did not cover. We significantly reduced inventory as we align production with demand and benefited from lower energy and material costs. Our restructuring actions are on track and will lower our cost in our residential and commercial soft service categories. As the market conditions evolve, we are adjusting our manufacturing and sales strategies and reducing inventory with market demand. To control cost, we are postponing capital projects and reducing discretionary spending. Our second quarter margin should expand as our input cost improved and plant utilization increases. Our first quarter commercial sales remained solid with new construction and remodeling projects continuing in most channels. The Architectural Billing Index indicates limited softening in the planning of new commercial projects this year. We are providing exciting flooring options that are carbon neutral with superior features to deliver greater value for the desiring green alternatives. Developed in partnership with disabled and disadvantaged artists, our new art lifting collections, fashionable designs are quickly gaining traction in the market. The commercial flooring accessories acquisition we completed last year has complemented our product offering and benefited our business. Sales of residential soft surfaces declined more than other categories as retailers reduced inventory due to weaker consumer discretionary spending in the slowing housing market. The multifamily business remains the strongest category in residential, and we are expanding our participation in this channel. Retailers have responded positively to our new product launches, including Everstrand Polyester collections at accessible price points and our proprietary SmartStrand Silk collections that provide superior softness in design. The new merchandising systems for our new carpet collections are being well accepted by our customers. In the quarter, we enhanced our LVT collections with higher value introductions, featuring our Web Protect and antimicrobial technologies. We're seeing a more competitive market as the industry slows and ocean freight costs decline. Imports from Asia are being interrupted as the U.S. requires proof of compliance with the Force Labor Protection Act. It is still too early to determine the disruption this legislation will create.Sheet vinyl sales are outperforming as consumers seek more budget-oriented options. Our West Coast LVT plant is continuing to ramp-up and our production will expand as we move through the year. During the quarter, our laminate sales in retail expanded with its increased acceptance as a waterproof alternative. Volumes in other channels are declining as consumers deferred remodeling projects and our customers reduced their inventory levels. We expect our Redwood collections to continue taking share due to their realistic visual, superior scratch resistance and waterproof properties. Our signature technology advances the design and texture of our Redwood products so that they are indistinguishable from premium wood flooring, by offering greater value and durability. Our input costs are declining, which will help us recover the inflation that impacted our margins. Now I'll return the call to Jeff for his closing remarks.Jeffrey S. LorberbaumThanks, Chris. Our industry is operating in a completely different environment than a year ago. Around the world, Central Banks are raising interest rates to slow their economies and reduce inflation. These actions lower our industry volume as new home sales and residential remodeling are postponed.The commercial sector has remained stronger than residential, though higher interest rates and tighter lending requirements could affect business investments as the year progresses. We're maximizing our sales and distribution by focusing on better performing channels, introducing differentiated products and providing enhanced service and value. We are proactively managing our spending and cost structures to optimize our results. We anticipate that industry volume and pricing will remain under pressure across our markets. We expect seasonal improvement in demand along with reduced energy material costs to improve our future results. Given these factors, we anticipate our second quarter adjusted EPS to be between $2.56 and $2.66, excluding any restructuring, acquisition and other charges. The industry down -- this industry downturn is unique with employment remaining high, businesses continuing to invest and homes maintaining their valuations. We are conservatively managing the near term, while we invest in the long-term growth through product innovation, capacity expansions and acquisitions. Our strong balance sheet enables us to navigate the current downturn as we prepare for the industry rebound that follows. Longer term, all of our regions require the updating of aging homes and significant new home construction to satisfy market needs. With our strength across regions, markets and products, we anticipate capturing increased opportunities when the recovery occurs in the housing market and the economy. We'll now be glad to take your questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) The first question comes from Joe Ahlersmeyer with Deutsche Bank.Joseph David AhlersmeyerCongrats on the solid start to the year. Jeff, the headwinds impacting results and the reasons to continue to be cautious as we go forward here, those reasons are well understood. And even as we look to make our own predictions about your business, it's probably not fair to expect you to make any definitive predictions beyond what you've given us in the guidance for the upcoming quarter. But you've also said in the past that managing the business as it's emerged from contractions gives you the confidence that it will recover, but that also means you're probably among the best position to help investors conceptualize those scenarios realistically. So especially, since you've no doubt contemplated this as you've taken actions to position your business and you touched on this a bit in your conclusion to your prepared remarks there. But my first question is simply, without necessarily getting into when specifically, we see a recovery, can you just offer some thoughts on how that might realistically manifest maybe by category, your end market or geography?Jeffrey S. LorberbaumWhen you go through a cycle, our industry always goes through a similar direction. So going into the cycle, the first thing that slows down is the residential remodeling because the consumers can immediately postpone it and it's followed by the new housing construction and then by the commercial businesses that take longer to execute. When you come out of the cycle, it comes out in the same order for the same reason. So to their remodeling piece should pick up first and do better. This cycle is not typical of the other cycles. Historically, by this point, employment would be down significantly, and it still remains strong. You have wages are still increasing. We have housing is in short supply and mortgage rates are limiting people to move. These things, combined with aging homes and higher home values, should support more remodeling and commercial projects continue to be initiated. So when you take all this together, we're expecting the rebound on the other side to be stronger and faster than it has in past cycles because we're not under the same compression that we've been in these areas we just discussed.Joseph David AhlersmeyerAll right. Thank you, Jeff, for those thoughts. Jim, we've discussed in the past, the trade-offs and running the business with respect to choices you make around price cost, market share, production and inventory levels. And then it's probably unrealistic actually to assume that as the industry recovers, you'd face earnings headwinds from all of these things at once. And so without making this a specific question about your volumes or price cost relationship in any one quarter, particularly beyond the next quarter, are you able to give investors any guardrails around Mohawk's annualized earnings power once we've maybe seen markets recover, we see a more typical input cost environment, but after you've then made choices around market share, pricing and production capacity?James F. BrunkI think, Joe, you would start with looking at the relationship between materials, energy, and pricing, as you kind of alluded to. If you think about it, the cost really started to gradually fall for us late in 2022. And it takes anywhere from 3 to 6 months for it to flow through the P&amp;L. What we would expect in 2023 is that inflation to become a more kind of declining headwind and become a benefit in the second half with price and mix weakening with more competition from lower industry volumes. Volume itself -- it was interesting in the first quarter, it was lower against some very, very strong comps in the prior year with pricing lighting inflation. Another point is, as we had indicated, we did not build inventory as normal. And so some of the shutdowns compressed our margins, though it improved sequentially. In the second quarter, we would anticipate higher production and fewer shutdowns. And as I said before, kind of all the details of this certainly will be in our 10-Q in terms of the bridge items. But also one other point would be around the growth investments. Our current expansion projects, we are focused on future sales opportunities and capacity constraints, very focused on laminate, LVT, quartz, countertops, ceramic slabs and their installation businesses. They are postponing other investments until visibility improves, but these investments should really set us up along with their acquisitions to help our business in '24 and beyond.OperatorOur next question comes from Tim Wojs with Baird.Timothy Ronald WojsMaybe just the first question I had, as you kind of think about energy prices, how would you expect that to kind of mechanically kind of work through the P&amp;L? I would imagine maybe you get some benefit early and then pricing kind of starts to react to that. But how quickly do you think pricing reacts to energy prices? I mean is it pretty immediate? Or do you think it's more like what you would see with like oil-based inputs in like Flooring North America, for example?James F. BrunkWell, as I just said, now with Joe's, it takes some time for it to flow through the P&amp;L. So sequentially, if you think about that, you would see improvement from -- we saw some from Q4 to Q1 on input costs. I would expect from Q1 to Q2 for that to be even stronger because of Flooring North America having to absorb in the first quarter, most of that peak material cost. So that's raw materials. But obviously, we also have energy in there as well on the inflation.So from Q1 to Q2, you would see that improvement. But the pricing and mix would continue to be under pressure as competition steps up, especially with the lower industry volumes.Timothy Ronald WojsOkay. So is it fair to say it would kind of be like normal input costs? We just haven't seen this type of energy inflation before. So that's what I'm trying to ask.James F. BrunkYes, even though it's down, I would expect you'll see some -- you've saw the headwinds in Q1. And then from a year-over-year perspective, in Q2, get we better turning -- if it stays on the trajectory, it is right now from a year-over-year perspective, that energy should turn to a tailwind in the back half of the year.Timothy Ronald WojsOkay. Okay. Good. And then on price/mix, just kind of holding up better than you thought in the quarter? I mean, is that -- do you think that's due to the overall consumer not trading down as much as maybe you thought? Or is it something that Mohawk's kind of done internally around product mix or channel mix that has kind of held that up a little bit better?Jeffrey S. LorberbaumWell, there's a third option, too, which includes our expectations and we're having to outguess the future. So we're trying to be conservative about our future guesses and take everything that account. So we turned -- we were a little more conservative than it turned out. There's still continued pressure on pricing and mix. The lower volumes in the industry always drives -- people trying to run their assets, including us, we expect in this environment to continue to have more competition and promotions, but the input costs are going to decline. And with that, we're really expecting as we go through the next quarter or 2 for some of that to get passed through and lower pricing by the industry.James F. BrunkDon't forget also, you were seeing falling ocean freights, which is reducing the cost of imports to the U.S. So the weaker dollar certainly will partially offset.OperatorOur next question comes from Susan Maklari with Goldman Sachs.Susan Marie MaklariMy first question is, appreciating that you've got limited visibility to the second half. But can you talk contextually about how you're thinking about the operating environment as it relates to housing activity, R&amp;R, commercial and then even maybe the U.S. versus Europe? And are you still expecting that we will see more normal seasonality as we move through the balance of this year?Jeffrey S. LorberbaumAs you said, the visibility is really limited. We're expecting economic growth to still be under pressure as we go through the year. Presently, we're anticipating remodeling being somewhat better. We think the new housing part will be stabilizing, and we're anticipating commercial slowing down somewhat as it -- with the same thing as we've just talked about, we are expecting the price and mix, to continue to be under pressure with plant utilization improving from the first quarter, which was low. In Europe, most people believe that the demand -- the consumer demand could increase because these high energy costs were such an impact to people. And second is in Europe, the wages are rising at a higher rate than they are in the United States. When you look through the normal seasonality, remember, the third quarter is always affected outside the United States by vacations and then we're assuming the normal seasonal decline as we go through the year. A little longer term, we expect the recovery when we rebound from it our industry, you postpone purchases, you don't lose them. And so during this time that it's going to be down, we're expecting those to create a significant upturn on the other side as it always does. And in this time, right now, we're investing more in growth investments, which we haven't done in prior cycles, which should put us in a better position we come out and the new acquisitions should also be helping us a year from then.Susan Marie MaklariOkay. That's helpful. And then focusing in on the Flooring North America segment. Obviously, that's been under pressure recently, just given the reduced production there. But as you think further out and the strategic initiatives you've been taking the cost actions, all the various things that have been going on there. Where do you think that margin can get to? And any thoughts on how that might compare to what we've seen more recently from that segment?Jeffrey S. LorberbaumWell, the segment was impacted more with the oil and energy costs than the other businesses, which impacted the material costs all through it. We were still -- we raised the inventories, trying to catch up to help people in the first halves of the last year. So we came out with high inventories, and we never anticipated the thing collapsing like it did. So the -- the pricing is leading the -- the pricing we're going -- we've never recovered the total price at the peak and then the promotions and things are causing the pricing to flow through faster than the material costs are flowing through in the first quarter. We're expecting to see that turn in the second quarter as the margins expand will help. And then in most of the categories, we're expecting the margin -- the cost decreases to help us recover the margin we didn't cover in a lot of the categories in the fall of last year. So the margin should increase as we go through and we're expecting all the businesses to do better in the rest of the year.OperatorThe next question comes from John Lovallo with UBS.John LovalloThe first one on SG&amp;A was a little bit higher than we were looking for in the quarter. And I think you guys noted a few items, including higher employee expense and some investment spend. But is there anything in the first quarter SG&amp;A number that you think won't repeat? And maybe if you could just help us think about SG&amp;A dollars or as a percentage of sales as we move into the second quarter?Jeffrey S. LorberbaumFirst, you have to remember on the comparisons, we came out of '21, the inventories were low. We were having trouble getting materials. We were hitting limitations with employees. So we went into the first quarter of last year with low inventories, and our customers also had low inventories. So we didn't put out as many new products. We didn't spend as much in marketing and merchandising. And so this year, we're going back to a more normal level. It's always heavier in the first quarter, and then we expect it to come down as we go through the year. We're putting investments in new merchandising and product categories across the businesses, trying to upgrade the product and mix and maximize the opportunities that are here in the environment that we're in.James F. BrunkAnd we're also doing that with the balancing the administrative side and trying to control that cost, making sure that we emphasize the selling and the marketing aspects as we go forward.John LovalloMakes sense. Okay. And then just on the commercial channel remaining pretty resilient here in the first quarter. There's obviously some growing concern of slowing activity in U.S. commercial. And Jeff, I think you talked to your expectation that, that could slow a bit. Are you seeing any signs right now that things are moderating on the commercial side in Mohawk's business?Jeffrey S. LorberbaumThere is some slight slowing in the category, but it's still doing reasonably well. Hospitality is outperforming the other categories. You have health care and education are still strong. But the cycle, there's other categories that aren't performing as well. We like you are looking at the architectural billing index and we see some weakening in it. So we're assuming that it's going to weaken with lower investments as we enter the second half of the year, but we'll have to see.OperatorOur next question comes from Stephen Kim with Evercore ISI.Stephen KimI believe you mentioned in the multifamily business or in the F&amp;A business that you were sort of leaning into multifamily increasing your participation there. I was curious if you could describe what kind of actions you're taking there? And then related to that, multifamily completions are really lagging multifamily starts and the pipeline is still growing, it appears from the national numbers. And so I think your products tend to go in later kind of closer to completion. So does that mean that the surge in demand from this multifamily category is still ahead of you? If you can just sort of talk about how you'd see the shape demand there [ahead of] you?Jeffrey S. LorberbaumUsually, you go into cycles, the multifamily will slow down as well and then people start having to move around as jobs get harder. We haven't seen that here. So what you have is the multifamily. The vacancy rates are still reasonably low. You still have more completions coming in and we're trying to maximize our share in what we think is going to be one of the stronger parts of the business this year.Stephen KimRight. Any specific kind of actions are you increasing your sales force? If you have made any other kind of changes that you could describe that would -- you can provide a little color around that?Jeffrey S. LorberbaumIn the multifamily side, they tend to have lower value products because they're trying to control the cost of the rentals. So we have a broad selection in carpet LVT and laminate that are all going into the category and -- as well as sheet vinyl. And I'm not -- we're not doing much different with the products because we've always had a broad offering to satisfy it. We're just being more aggressive in our selling.Stephen KimOkay. That makes sense. And then secondly, you've been pretty active on the acquisition front, not so much the big ones, although I know you just bought Vitromex and Elizabeth, it looks like they look like they're closing in 1Q. So a couple of questions regarding acquisitions. First of all, I think, Vitromex and Elizabeth, you said $425 million in annual sales. What was the purchase price combined for that? And then secondly, I think in the last couple of years, you've spent about $330 million on acquisitions of various kinds. Can you quantify what the general annualized sales benefit you think are coming from all of those businesses?James F. BrunkSo in the first quarter, you're right, we closed on Vitromex and Elizabeth purchase price is just over $500 million combined. If you step back, we did about 5 bolt-on acquisitions last year in 2022, plus 2 ceramic acquisitions that we just completed. And to frame it from a sales perspective, it should be in the $600 million range on an annual basis given normal conditions. Obviously, the markets are a little bit tighter in Brazil and Mexico, like they are in other geographies. So what we gave you was their sales from the prior year.Stephen KimGot you. And that's excluding Vitromex and Elizabeth -- sorry, including Vitromex and Elizabeth's $425 million, right, in that $600 million?James F. BrunkYes. All in, it's about a little over $600 million.Jeffrey S. LorberbaumSo there were small acquisitions, but then some of the sales are also included in last year.OperatorOur next question comes from Keith Hughes with Truist.Keith Brian HughesYou had said in the prepared comments, taking less down production days in the second quarter versus the first. Is that just a function of seasonality or do you have inventories kind of where demand is and that's not quite as necessary in the second quarter?Jeffrey S. LorberbaumCombination of everything. First is that we did take some inventories down. The second is we expected -- we expect an improvement from seasonal improvements from one or the other, so where there are less shutdowns across the business all over.Keith Brian HughesOkay. And one other question. You said in answer to another question, in the second half of the year, energy turning. I think you said energy turning in your favor. I just want to make sure you're talking about energy, are you talking about energy and input costs?James F. BrunkI was speaking about the question, Keith, was on energy. That was the comment on energy.Keith Brian HughesWhat's your view on raw material cost? Is that something where we could see some deceleration in the second half of the year?James F. BrunkIn total, if you take energy and raw materials, again, that should be really a declining headwind as you go through from Q1 to Q2 and becoming a benefit in the second half of the year. And that's also leading to some price/mix weakening as well with competition with lower input costs and volumes being lower.OperatorOur next question comes from Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan.Michael Jason RehautFirst, I just wanted to, if possible, get a little bit of quantification on how you're thinking about the incremental benefit from lower energy costs in 2Q itself? And you talked about it turning into a tailwind in the back half. So how much do you expect energy costs, if you could kind of quantify it would benefit margins in 2Q versus 1Q? And incrementally, what would flow through further into the back half?James F. BrunkWell, sequentially, is what I think you're asking from Q1 to Q2, energy, the savings of the lower-cost energy will pick up from the prior quarter. So it should become -- sequentially, it will be a benefit in the quarter -- in the second quarter compared to the first quarter.Michael Jason RehautAnd I appreciate that, but any way to quantify that benefit?James F. BrunkThe headwind that you're going to see. Well, let me put it in terms of the total inflation, again, from a year-over-year perspective that we saw in the first quarter, it was about $158 million. So you'll see that detail later today. And so I would expect that total inflation from a year-over-year perspective to be significantly lower than that in the second quarter.Michael Jason RehautOkay. And then maybe just on the restructuring benefits, any -- also any way to quantify how you're thinking about the dollars in terms of benefits in 2023 and where we are in terms of the percentage realization of that in the second -- what you expect to have in the second quarter versus by year-end?James F. BrunkSo we have -- so if you step back, we've announced the 2 restructuring plans early last year. And the total cost is somewhere between $135 million and $140 million, only about $25 million of that is cash. So we're going to save a little bit over probably $60 million annually. That will be ramping up as you go through this year. Most of the savings for Flooring North America, the actions are on track. And you'll see that in the Florida North America results as you go Q2 and Q3 and to the end of the year. The actions in Flooring Rest of the World which are really around phasing out our residential flexible LVT and turning that in concentrating on rigid. That will take a little bit longer as you go through 2023.Michael Jason RehautOkay. One last quick one, if I could squeeze it in. As you look at the sales patterns for the rest of the year given that you have easier comps in each of the next 3 quarters, if you were to take current sales patterns today or sales trends today, would you expect first quarter's 7% decline to lessen and potentially even turn positive as you get to the fourth quarter?Jeffrey S. LorberbaumIt depends whether you're looking sequentially or year-over-year. So last year, you had, it slowed down. So as we go through the year, year-over-year.Michael Jason RehautYear-over-year, Jeff?Jeffrey S. LorberbaumYes, year-over-year, the volume will improve as you go through the year with the comparisons.James F. BrunkYes. So we have an easier -- a very difficult comp in the first -- the first half of the year, and then that will become a little bit easier as you get to the back half of the year. So you would see those -- you would assume if we stay where we are in terms of the recovery that those percentages would decrease the difference would decrease as you go through the back half of the year.OperatorOur next question comes from Adam Baumgarten with Zelman.Adam Michael BaumgartenI believe you guys talked about some European ceramic competitors shutting down production when natural gas prices were spiking. Have you seen those competitors reenter the market at this point?Jeffrey S. LorberbaumThe gas prices have declined substantially. Each of the competitors have different purchasing strategies. So I don't know exactly where the costs are today. And when they purchased the gas prices, but Europe, the market is still under pressure because the demand from the consumers is significantly down. Chris, you want to add some more?William Christopher WellbornWell, I would say, especially those competitors that were producing at the low end -- pricing at the low end, Spain, other places have been under particular pressure with the natural gas. And yes, there have been a few competitors that have fallen out of the market, but we don't have really good visibility on that. None of the major ones have gone out. It would be smaller ones.Adam Michael BaumgartenOkay. Got it. And then just on LVT, just given some of the declines you guys talked about on imported product. Maybe just if you could help us walk through your cost competitiveness of the U.S. and Mexico capacity that you guys are now bringing up?William Christopher WellbornWell, on the LVT, we have a broad offerings for both residential and commercial and all price points are rigid and flexible. And our local production is valued for faster, more consistent service. We're improving our operations and differentiating it with features. And our West Coast plant efficiencies will increase over time.Jeffrey S. LorberbaumAnd overall market is tough as resetting prices with the materials and freight costs moving, there's still a significant inventory in the channels. And then right at the moment, there's this thing we talked about, about the U.S. government stopping some shipments impact on service, and it's really difficult to tell what impact that's going to have on the supply and the marketplace today.OperatorThe next question comes from Mike Dahl with RBC.Michael Glaser DahlJeff, just as a follow-up to that, around the -- with import dynamic, I know it's tough to tell how it could resolve. But in terms of what's currently sitting at ports, is there any way you can quantify kind of how much supply has currently been stopped from coming into the domestic market? And then do you have any insight on whether this issue has significantly stemmed the flow of ships on the water making their way to the U.S. at this point?Jeffrey S. LorberbaumThat's about -- the only thing I can tell you is one of the largest suppliers in the United States, all those products have been stocked. And so the question, what we don't know is how many others are going to be impacted. And then the reverse side is, we don't know what will take to get them released and come back in. So I mean you're really just at the start of it and we're going to have to see what happens with the government.Michael Glaser DahlOkay. Got it. And then as a follow-up to kind of the price conversation. I mean, you mentioned that price/mix came in better than you guys had forecast during the quarter. Wondering, as you went through the quarter, have you seen price/mix evolve in a way that was closer to your expectations, i.e., you have referenced still seeing some pressure. So are you seeing the pressures that you initially expected now coming through? Or is it still better than you expected? And if I could kind of add a second part to that question in response to Mike's question around volumes. Presumably, the price/mix comp will get worse as the year progresses even as the volume comp gets better. So from a total revenue standpoint, just should we think that the declines in total revenues also get better? Or does the worsening price mix offset the easier volume costs?Jeffrey S. LorberbaumHow to answer that one? The first is our expectations coming in we had -- we didn't know how much the channel inventories were declined and how much they were going to -- how much more where they were going to decline. And then the other part was pricing and mix, it was a combination of both and it wasn't as depressed as we expected to be. The pricing and mix is getting more difficult as you have these low volumes. And depending upon which category you're in, as you would suspect, where you have really high capital investments, people try to keep running the investments, and that pushes the prices down. You have more competition and promotions coming on as the input cost decline. And then you have the mismatch between the flow-through of inventory and the pricing that happens to us. So we're trying to estimate all those things at the same time.James F. BrunkThat's the bottom line. If you're talking just the sales line, then you also have -- so you have the improvement in comps in terms of volume, which will help as well as the acquisitions we described. So those helped on the top line.Jeffrey S. LorberbaumMost people in Europe are expecting that due to the substantial decline in energy that the consumers have pulled back dramatically because of the cost of heating -- heating their homes and the use of energy over they got so high. They're expecting that the demand is going to improve as we go through the year, and we are, too.OperatorOur next question comes from Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research.Eric BosshardTwo things. First of all, Jeff, I think you made a comment that you had a more favorable view on North American remodel activity in the second half. I just want to clarify, is that -- did I hear that right? And what are you seeing that supports that viewpoint?Jeffrey S. LorberbaumWe just thought that the postponement of projects had gotten really significant at this time that people aren't moving as much as they normally do that they might be getting more comfortable with the interest rate. So we just thought it was at a depressed level. And we -- in our things, we're assuming there's going to be some relief as we go through the year, but we'll have to see.William Christopher WellbornAnd I would just add to that, that the activity in the Daltile service centers has been higher. And the comment would be that the people coming in are very serious about getting projects done.James F. BrunkAnd probably one last thing, Eric, as Jeff said earlier, this cycle is a little bit different with the employment remaining strong, wages increasing and housing, obviously, remaining in short supply and people staying in their homes. And as they get more comfortable from a consumer confidence standpoint if that evolves, then they would come back to the remodeling.Eric BosshardOkay. And then secondly, the guidance from 90 days ago, you ended up doing $0.40 better, and it sounds like it was price/mix was better than your assumption. As you look into this next 90 days, and Jeff, I guess we all appreciate your comment on predicting the future is not that easy. But in terms of how you've made this assumption with the 2Q guidance relative to the 1Q, have you considered price/mix differently? Or is it a similar conservative price/mix viewpoint that you had for 1Q?Jeffrey S. LorberbaumThe 1Q -- the question was how much was the inventory and the channel is going to change also? We are assuming at this point that most of the inventory and the channels are aligned around the world, we're expecting that. And then we're expecting the raw material prices to benefit us, but we're expecting that with competition, some of that's going to get passed through. So we're expecting the price/mix to decline as the competition increases with the general economy. .OperatorOur next question comes from Truman Patterson with Wolfe Research.Truman Andrew PattersonFirst on Rest of World, margins inflected pretty nicely from 4Q. You mentioned some increased promotion to help your sales activity there. Maybe a bit better consumer trends in Europe and you reduce costs [by --] I would imagine that a lot of that you're also doing in North America. I'm just hoping you can give us a little bit more color on the Rest of World margin inflection?William Christopher WellbornYes. So in Q1, our margin expanded from Q4 was seasonal growth. We had fewer shutdowns. We had lower energy and the green production. Our pricing and mix were a little better than we expected. Going forward, we anticipate greater competitive pressures as the input cost decline. And -- but we're implementing selective promotions. We're doing a lot to control our cost and we're also doing some restructuring.Truman Andrew PattersonOkay. Perfect. And then Jeff, not necessarily looking for guidance here. Always enjoy getting your kind of big picture view on the cycle and everything. I'm just hoping you can help us think through 2024, how that might trend primarily on the residential side? Do you think we're kind of in the eye of the storm here in 2023 with the volume declines and you're expecting or positioning the company for some improvement in '24 volumes? I'm just trying to see where your head is at here because clearly, there's a lot of moving parts with inflation, Fed actions, war in Europe, but there's still a pretty healthy job and wage -- job growth and wage gains right now. So I just want to kind of wrap my head around that.Jeffrey S. LorberbaumWhat, I guess, multiple parts. One is what you know as well as I do, there's different views on what's going to happen with the economy. One is that the economy is going to slow down and that the Fed is going to start lowering rates at the end of the year, the first of next year and start the improvement in the whole housing cycle. The second says it's going to take longer, and they're going to keep rates up longer. I can't tell you when it's going to occur. I know that every time that this happens, all these consumers that pull back that don't like the way their houses look, they postponed the purchases. And if you go back historically, the volume increases substantially in the first 2 years coming out of a downturn because of this. We've been in a downturn now for close to 9 months and the rest of the economy hasn't reacted as much. We're in a industry that is really affected by interest rates as people postpone things. So we're looking that when it does occur, that it's going to be greater than normal. We are investing in the categories that are the highest growth categories and constrained growth, and we expect to get benefit out of all those as it comes up.Truman Andrew PattersonPerfect. And just a follow-up there on kind of the resi R&amp;R side. In your view, the typical downturn a year or 2 years normally?Jeffrey S. LorberbaumI mean, typically, they go from 12 to 18 months is the general range, some go longer and shorter.OperatorOur next question comes from Phil Ng with Jefferies.Philip H. NgJeff, your comments on demand feels like things have bottom here and in general little more up beat about the back half. When you think about the recovery within your end markets, products or regions, the other view where you think things could potentially pick up faster. And then from a pricing standpoint, any markets in particular that you have more concerns that prices will fall a little more significantly?Jeffrey S. LorberbaumHappy go around the world. I mean Europe was so impacted by energy costs, which they're still double what they were before we started. But if you go back to 5 months ago, they were 10, 12x where we started. So the energy impact on Europe has been dramatic. How to figure that in with the war and what's going on, it's hard to guess. The other side that's different, we're seeing in Europe, the increase in wages is generally higher than the U.S. There are some countries that we know the wages are going up 10% or more is there. So as the wages increase, it's possible that they have less impact on their consumption. And we're assuming that it's going to get better as we go through this year. All the other markets, they've all gone through a similar downturn. The interest rates are being raised everywhere. The -- as in every market, the residential fell off substantially in all of them and the commercial is trailing. Some of the areas like Mexico, the economy is held up better. There's things moving in as we have problems with China. So the Mexican market is doing better. The Brazilian market, for instance, turned down later, but it turned down later. And in our marketplace, the last quarter, there's been huge changes in the inventories in the channel as we go through. So each one is different, but it looks like the whole world is more interconnected and they're more closely aligned than they have been in the past 20, 30 years.Philip H. NgIn any markets where you -- or products you see more pricing pressure?Jeffrey S. LorberbaumThere's pricing pressure in all of them. And as the markets -- again, as the markets slow down, all of us, where we have large capital investments, try to find ways to minimize the unabsorbed overhead. And typically, we pass through the decreases and work on lower margins in prior cycles. So I don't see it be any different this one.Philip H. NgGot it. And your ceramics business has held up very well. What's [drive them into] relative strength? You see that business holding up pretty good from here and now. Pricing in particular has been strong. You've had a nice pricing umbrella from inflation. Now that energy prices and ocean freight container prices have come down, how are you thinking about competition or pricing pressure from imports on the ceramic side of things?William Christopher WellbornWell, on the ceramic side, we have performed better than our other ceramic markets in the U.S., one due to a greater mix of commercial. Our domestic production has been reliable or is reliable, more than the imported alternatives, and that's helped us. We've developed premium collections that have been used versus Italian imports, and we're increasing our focus on the multifamily exteriors, kitchen and bath channels. And we're also enhancing our commercial and builder markets with curated collections. .Having said that, the imported ceramic prices are decreasing with freight, which has partially been offset by weakening dollar. We do have more of our sales in the mid- to high-segment, which has insulated us a little. But no doubt, it will be under pressure as we go through the year with imports coming down.OperatorThe next question comes from Rafe Jadrosich with Bank of America.Rafe Jason JadrosichI wanted to just follow-up on some of the comments on the import restrictions on LVT from China. Can you remind us sort of your exposure to Chinese imports on the LVT side? Maybe how does that compare to competitors? And just given your higher domestic production, and if there are additional restrictions, is there a share gain or pricing opportunity there?Jeffrey S. LorberbaumOur imports from China are fairly limited, but it's affecting not only the local producers. They've extended this thing back to the raw materials and some of the surrounding countries use raw materials out of China, and that's also causing the problem with the supply outside of China.Rafe Jason JadrosichGot it. Okay. That's helpful. And then on commercial, can you remind us of your exposure overall? And then is there any regional difference you hire commercial exposure in Europe relative to the U.S.? Then what's the typical lag time between when a commercial project starts and when your products go in? So if commercial is slowing today, like when would we actually expect that to have an impact on your revenue?James F. BrunkWell, from a percentage basis, it runs different by segment. We have more commercial exposure in global ceramics especially in the U.S. that could have over 35% or so of its business in ceramic -- or excuse me, in ceramic being in commercial in the U.S. And then in Flooring North America would be the next largest with limited exposure in Flooring Rest of the World.Jeffrey S. LorberbaumThe commercial sales typically fall off later because and it depends on which projects. They can take anywhere from 12 months to 3 years to complete. So all these different projects have started. It tends not to fall off for at least about a year after residential starts falling off. And this one is different because you have really sectors in the commercial business that are still going up like the hospitality pieces. So it's really an unusual environment.OperatorThis concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference over to Jeff Lorberbaum for any closing remarks.Jeffrey S. LorberbaumThank you very much. We appreciate all of you joining us. We're navigating the current environment, and we're investing to optimize our results when the economy improves. Thank you for joining us. Have a good day.OperatorThe conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.]"

Shares of this leading global flooring manufacturer jumped 6.09% in the after-hours trading session on Apr 27.Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum, chairman and CEO of Mohawk, said, “We exceeded our earnings expectations with the business maintaining higher pricing and stronger mix and Flooring Rest of the World outperforming the other segments.

(Operator Instructions) It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Andy Taylor, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you, Mr. Taylor. You may now begin.Andy TaylorThank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss Weyerhaeuser's First Quarter 2023 Earnings. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. Our earnings release and presentation materials can also be found on our website. Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation, slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements, as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call. We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and a reconciliation of GAAP can be found in the earnings materials on our website. On the call this morning are Devin Stockfish, Chief Executive Officer; and David Wold, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Devin Stockfish.Devin W. StockfishThanks, Andy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Yesterday, Weyerhaeuser reported first quarter GAAP earnings of $151 million or $0.21 per diluted share on net sales of $1.9 million. Adjusted EBITDA was $395 million, a 7% increase over the fourth quarter of 2022. These are solid results, and I'm pleased with the operational and financial performance delivered by our team despite various market and weather-related challenges throughout the quarter. Turning now to our first quarter business results. I'll begin with Timberlands on Pages 6 through 9 of our earnings slides. Timberlands contributed $120 million to first quarter earnings. Adjusted EBITDA was $188 million, a 25% increase compared to the fourth quarter. In the West, adjusted EBITDA increased $33 million compared to the fourth quarter, largely driven by increased sales volumes in domestic and Chinese markets and lower per unit log and haul costs. These favorable results were partially offset by lower sales realizations. Turning to the Western domestic market. Demand and pricing for domestic logs faced downward pressure at the start of the first quarter. Mills reduced consumption in response to lower pricing and takeaway of finished products, and we're carrying elevated log inventories. As the quarter progressed, log consumption increased as end market demand improved, but log supply was constrained by consistent winter weather conditions. This dynamic drove log inventories to lower levels and cause log pricing to stabilize. For the quarter, our average domestic sales realizations were significantly lower than the fourth quarter. Our fee harvest and domestic sales volume as well as per unit log and haul costs improved in the first quarter as we return to full run rate operations following the work stoppage in the fourth quarter. First quarter harvest activity included a portion of the deferred volume resulting from the work stoppage, and we remain on track to capture the majority of the deferred harvest volume in 2023. Forest and road costs were also seasonally lower. Moving to our Western export business. Log markets in Japan continued to soften in the first quarter in response to elevated inventories of European lumber imports as well as lower consumption driven by reduced post-and-beam housing activity. As a result, our average sales realizations for export volumes to Japan were moderately lower compared to the fourth quarter, and our sales volumes were comparable. In China, log inventories at the ports declined during the quarter and daily takeaway increased as construction activity improved following the Lunar New Year and in response to the recent lifting of pandemic-related restrictions. As a result, log demand from our customers remained solid in the first quarter. Our sales volumes increased significantly compared to the fourth quarter and we intentionally flexed additional volumes to China to take advantage of improving market conditions in the first quarter. Our average sales realizations were slightly higher compared to the fourth quarter aided by improved ocean freight rates and a favorable exchange rate. Turning to the South. Adjusted EBITDA for Southern Timberlands increased $4 million compared to the fourth quarter. Despite reduced log consumption in response to lower finished product pricing and demand, southern sawlog and fiber markets remain fairly balanced during the first quarter as log supply was constrained by wet weather conditions. As a result, our average sales realizations were comparable to the fourth quarter. Our fee harvest volumes increased slightly despite the adverse weather conditions. Per unit log and haul costs were slightly lower in the first quarter, and forestry and road costs were slightly higher. Adjusted EBITDA in the North was comparable to the fourth quarter. Turning to Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources on Pages 10 and 11. And Real estate and ENR contributed $53 million to first quarter earnings and $89 million to adjusted EBITDA. First quarter EBITDA was $43 million higher than the fourth quarter primarily due to a significant increase in real estate acres sold, partially offset by a decrease in royalty income from our Energy and Natural Resources business. Similar to prior years, our real estate activities in 2023 and are more heavily weighted towards the first half of the year. Average price per acre decreased compared to the fourth quarter due to the mix of properties sold but remained elevated compared to historical levels, as we continue to benefit from steady demand for HBU properties. Despite broader macroeconomic headwinds, buyers continue to seek the safety of hard assets, resulting in high-value transactions with significant premiums to timber value. Moving to Wood Products on Pages 12 through 14. Wood Products generated $95 million of earnings in the first quarter and $148 million of adjusted EBITDA. First quarter adjusted EBITDA was a 25% reduction from the fourth quarter, largely driven by continued softening in wood products pricing. Regarding the lumber and OSB markets, benchmark prices for both products entered the first quarter showing signs of stabilization after receding in the back half of 2022. Pricing for both products increased slightly through early February in response to stronger-than-expected demand for housing and buyers replenishing lean inventories. The increase was more pronounced for lumber as supply concerns weighed on the market following a series of mill curtailment announcements, particularly in British Columbia. As the quarter progressed, overall buyer sentiment remains cautious. As adverse weather impacted homebuilding in several regions and in response to ongoing concerns about inflation and the economy. Despite lean inventories, orders were limited to necessity purchases through quarter end, and benchmark prices for both products were generally range bound. I would note, however, that prices for both products have trended higher as we've moved into the second quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for our lumber business was comparable to the fourth quarter. Both the framing lumber composite pricing and our average sales realizations decreased 9% in the first quarter. Our sales and production volumes increased significantly versus the fourth quarter which was impacted by the work stoppage at our Northwest mills. Reliability also improved across the system. With increased production in the quarter, unit manufacturing costs improved significantly. Log costs were comparable to the fourth quarter. OSB adjusted EBITDA decreased by $32 million compared to the fourth quarter, primarily due to the decrease in commodity pricing. Our average sales realizations decreased by 20% in the first quarter, largely in line with OSB composite pricing. Sales volumes were significantly higher as production volumes increased from less planned downtime for annual maintenance and transportation networks improved following adverse weather conditions late in the fourth quarter. Unit manufacturing costs and fiber costs improved moderately during the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for Engineered Wood Products decreased by $28 million compared to the fourth quarter due to softening demand for EWP products. As a result, our sales and production volumes and average sales realizations were lower for most products in the first quarter. That said, we have seen a recent uptick in our order activity and our current realizations remain above pre-pandemic levels. Unit manufacturing costs were comparable to the fourth quarter and raw material costs decreased primarily for OSB web stock. Adjusted EBITDA for distribution was comparable to the fourth quarter as higher volumes and lower operating costs were offset by a decrease in realizations for EWP and commodity products. With that, I'll turn the call over to David to discuss some financial items and our second quarter outlook.Story continuesDavid M. WoldThank you, Devin, and good morning, everyone. I'll be covering key financial items and first quarter financial performance before moving into our second quarter outlook. I'll begin with key financial items, which are summarized on Page 16. We ended the quarter with approximately $800 million of cash and cash equivalents and total debt of approximately $5 billion. Our balance sheet, liquidity position and financial flexibility remain exceptionally strong. And we reinforced our flexibility in the first quarter by extending the maturity of our existing $1.5 billion revolving credit facility to 2028. In the first quarter, we generated $126 million of cash from operations. It's worth noting that the first quarter is usually our lowest operating cash flow quarter due to seasonal inventory and other working capital build. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $71 million, which is a typical level for the first quarter. We returned $139 million to shareholders through the payment of our quarterly base dividend which was increased by 5.6% to $0.19 per share during the quarter. This is in line with our commitment to grow our sustainable base dividend by 5% annually through 2025. During the quarter, we also returned $660 million to shareholders through the payment of our supplemental dividend, which was associated with our 2022 financial results. We returned $35 million to shareholders through share repurchase activity in the first quarter. These shares were repurchased at an average price of $31.25 and as of quarter end, we have completed nearly $660 million of repurchase under our $1 billion authorization. Looking forward, we will continue to leverage our flexible cash return framework and look to repurchase shares opportunistically when we believe it will create shareholder value. First quarter results for our unallocated items are summarized on Page 15. Adjusted EBITDA for this segment decreased by $6 million compared to the fourth quarter. This decrease was primarily attributable to changes in intersegment profit elimination in LIFO and as well as the absence of nonrecurring health care and workers' compensation items that were benefits in the fourth quarter. Looking forward, key outlook items for the second quarter are presented on Page 18. In our Timberlands business, we expect second quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be approximately $20 million lower than the first quarter of 2023. Beginning with our Western Timberlands operations, domestic log markets were fairly tensioned at the outset of the second quarter, driven by improved pricing and takeaway of finished products, leaner than normal log inventories and log supply constraints due to persistent winter weather conditions. As the quarter progresses, we expect further improvement in log demand and an increase in log supply as the weather improved seasonally. As a result, our domestic sales realizations are expected to remain fairly stable throughout the second quarter. That said, we anticipate the quarterly average will be lower compared to the first quarter as log prices have fallen since the beginning of the year. We anticipate our fee harvest volumes will be moderately higher given seasonally favorable operating conditions in the second quarter. Forestry and road costs are expected to be significantly higher as we enter the spring and summer months, and per unit log and haul costs are expected to be significantly lower, partly due to lower fuel prices. Moving to the export markets, starting with Japan. As Devin mentioned, elevated inventories of European lumber imports and reduced consumption continue to weigh on log demand and pricing. We expect these conditions to persist through the second quarter. As a result, our Japanese sales volumes and realizations are expected to be lower compared to the first quarter. That said, we expect European lumber inventories to normalize as the year progresses, which should increase demand for our logs in the Japanese market. In the meantime, we are shifting a certain amount of logs to our internal mills to capitalize on domestic market conditions. In China, construction activity and log consumption continued to improve following the Lunar New Year and the lifting of pandemic-related restrictions. That said, log imports from New Zealand have increased significantly following the disruption in the first quarter due to Cyclone activity. This dynamic is likely to put downward pressure on log pricing until excess inventories are cleared. As a result, our sales realizations into China are expected to be slightly lower compared to the first quarter. We anticipate our sales volumes will be significantly lower as we direct logs to domestic customers to capture higher-margin opportunities. In the South, we expect sawlog markets to remain fairly balanced in the second quarter as log supply improves with drier weather conditions and mills bolster inventories in response to weather-related challenges in the first quarter. Southern fiber markets are expected to soften as a result of end market demand and pricing. Despite improving weather conditions, our fee harvest volumes are expected to be comparable to the first quarter largely driven by a higher mix of fiber logs as thinning activity increases following wet weather conditions earlier in the year. With a higher percentage of fiber logs we expect our sales realizations to be slightly lower compared to the first quarter. Per unit log and haul costs are expected to decrease slightly as a result of lower fuel prices, and forestry and road costs are expected to increase seasonally. In the north, our sales realizations are expected to be slightly lower than the first quarter and fee harvest volumes are expected to be significantly lower as we enter the spring breakup season. Turning to our Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources segment. As Devin mentioned, we are still seeing steady demand for our real estate properties, and we continue to expect a consistent flow of HBU transactions with significant premiums to timber value. For the second quarter, we expect earnings will be comparable to and adjusted EBITDA will be approximately $20 million lower than the first quarter of 2023 due to the timing and mix of real estate sales. For the full year, we continue to anticipate adjusted EBITDA of approximately $300 million for the segment. For our Wood Products segment, we expect second quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be slightly higher than the first quarter of 2023, excluding the effect of changes in average sales realizations for lumber and OSB. Benchmark prices for both lumber and OSB have been fairly stable quarter-to-date, but we are seeing signs of increased demand for wood products as we get further into the spring building season, while channel inventories remain lean. As shown on Page 19, our current and quarter-to-date average sales realizations for lumber are moderately higher than the first quarter average. For OSB, our current and quarter-to-date average sales realizations are slightly higher than the first quarter average. For our lumber business, we expect higher production and sales volumes in the second quarter and moderately lower unit manufacturing costs as operating rates at our Northwest mills return to a more normalized level, reliability improves across the system and inflationary pressures continue to ease. Log costs are expected to be moderately lower compared to the first quarter, primarily for Western and Southern logs. For our oriented strand board business, sales volumes are expected to be comparable to the first quarter. We expect slightly lower production volumes and moderately higher unit manufacturing costs due to more planned downtime for annual maintenance in the second quarter. Fiber costs are expected to be slightly lower. Turning to our Engineered Wood Products business. As Devin mentioned, we have seen an uptick in order activity quarter-to-date, and we expect steady demand as the quarter progresses. As a result, we anticipate significantly higher sales volumes for most products compared to the first quarter. That said, sales realizations are expected to be moderately lower as supply and demand continue to rebalance across the broader EWP market. We anticipate moderately lower raw material costs for most products, including for OSB web stock. For our distribution business, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be slightly higher compared to the first quarter due to improved sales volumes. With that, I'll now turn the call back to Devin and look forward to your questions.Question and Answer SessionDevin W. StockfishThanks, David. Before wrapping up this morning, I'll make a few comments on the housing and repair and remodel markets. Our view on the housing market is largely unchanged, and we still anticipate a somewhat more challenging backdrop in 2023 and compared to the last couple of years. We've clearly seen some softening from the peak levels of 2022 as home buyer sentiment remains cautious. That being said, there have been some positive signs lately that the housing market is holding up better than we anticipated at the beginning of the year. Specifically, we've seen improvements in homebuilder sentiment and increase in new home sales and an uptick in single-family starts over the last couple of months. Additionally, the labor market and household balance sheets are generally in good shape and inventory of existing homes for sale remains well below historical levels. Putting this all together, we continue to believe that underlying housing demand is solid. As we saw in the first quarter, there are buyers willing to step back into the market in response to lower mortgage rates and homebuilder incentives. Ultimately, we'll need to see further rate reductions, combined with a stable to improving U.S. economy before the housing market fully returns to the levels of the past few years. However, notwithstanding any near-term headwinds, we continue to maintain a positive and constructive longer-term view on housing fundamentals, supported by strong demand, favorable demographic trends and a significantly underbuilt housing stock. Turning to repair and remodel, where activity remained fairly stable in the first quarter and continued to be supported by steady demand from the professional segment. Demand from the do-it-yourself segment has largely normalized to pre-pandemic levels. Looking forward, we expect customer demand to be bolstered to some degree by prospective homebuyers choosing to remodel in lieu of purchasing a new home in a higher mortgage rate environment. Lower commodity building product prices may also support repair and remodel activity in the near term. And in any event, we continue to have a bullish longer-term outlook for repair and remodel demand, supported by strong home equity levels and an aging housing stock. In closing, we delivered solid operational and financial performance in the first quarter. We remain as focused as ever on operational excellence and supporting our customers to drive industry-leading margins. In addition, we remain committed to returning cash to shareholders. During the quarter, we increased our base dividend by 5.6% and returned more than $830 million to shareholders through base and supplemental dividend payments as well as share repurchase activity. Looking forward, we remain constructive on the longer-term demand fundamentals that will drive growth for our business, notwithstanding the current macroeconomic headwinds. Our financial position is exceptionally strong, and we are focused on delivering superior operating performance across our unmatched portfolio of assets as well as enhancing shareholder value through disciplined capital allocation. So with that, I think we can go ahead and open it up for questions.Operator(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Anthony Pettinari with Citi.Anthony James PettinariDevin, as you look at Southern log prices, are you seeing any regional trends worth calling out? And I guess, specifically, over the past few years, the Southern log prices have seen some strength. I think we saw maybe stronger price appreciation in some of these coastal regions versus inland regions. Now that log prices appear to be kind of moderating a bit, I'm wondering, are you seeing those coastal regions holding price better? Or alternately, are they may be giving up kind of more of the gains that they've had and maybe acting with a little bit more volatility. I don't know if there's any trend that you would call out. I'm just kind of curious what you're seeing and maybe how your portfolio is positioned there.Devin W. StockfishYes, Anthony, good question. As we think about the Southern sawlog pricing dynamic, as you say, there are certainly regional differences. And we've seen that play out over a number of years. As you mentioned, the Atlantic Coast, and we think about that from North Carolina really all the way down through Florida and Georgia, certainly have been a stronger market. I think there are a couple of things at play there. To some extent, the sawlog market is also impacted by the pulpwood markets on the coastal region. As you think about a lot of these mills and where they source logs, if you're if you're next to the ocean, your sourcing radius is only about 180 degrees versus 360. And so that tightens up some of those markets, and I think that bleeds into sawlogs. And certainly, I think that's been one of the drivers of late for why you've seen those prices tick up. We'll see if with a little softening in the fiber markets, if that wanes a little bit more. But I think more broadly, as you mentioned, we have seen some capacity coming into the south and certainly, that's benefited us in some of the markets where we have large fee holdings, you think Mississippi, Southern Arkansas, some spots in Louisiana. What we have seen is as new capacity comes into a particular wood basket, we see an uplift on sawlog prices, and we expect that to just continue to be the case as more capacity comes into that region. I think the other thing at play of late has been -- and this is particularly true, I'd say, over the last 18 or so months, there's just been a bit of a constraint on log and haul capacity and I think that's another driver for why you've seen a little bit of an uptick in sawlog prices just as mills wanted to maintain inventory so they didn't lose out on the high lumber price opportunity. I would say that the haul capacity has probably gotten a little bit better here as we've gotten into 2023. But over the long term, I continue to think you're going to have constraints on both log and haul capacity across the South, just as labor will continue to be an issue. So the net-net is we are seeing regional differences, will we see the Atlantic Coast come down? A little bit more perhaps. But on balance, we still feel pretty optimistic about the trajectory of southern sawlog prices in the years to come.Anthony James PettinariOkay. That's super helpful. And then just on Natural Climate Solutions, I don't know if there's any kind of update you can give us in terms of level of interest and engagement and maybe how you're tracking towards that $100 million EBITDA target for '25? Or if there's any kind of specific projects or work streams that you feel like are moving faster or slower than expected?Devin W. StockfishYes. I think the good news is there just continues to be an increasing level of interest across really all parts of that natural climate solutions business. That's true with renewables, solar, wind, a lot of interest and activity there. It's true with mitigation banking. We've seen certainly a lot of interest in carbon capture and storage in the forest carbon market. So I think we're as optimistic as ever about the trajectory of growth over time with that business. And that's really, like I say, true across every component of that Natural Climate Solutions business. I think the trick continues to be managing the time line to get these projects to fruition. And that's unfortunately the case across each of those different businesses, whether it's the permitting and getting tied into the grid across the renewable section sector or just the time line to get forest carbon projects through the process of a third-party audit and I think that's going to continue to get better over time as more resources go into the system. But it's really a question of timing more than magnitude, but we're really optimistic about the long-term opportunities across really each of those businesses within natural climate solutions.OperatorOur next question is from Ketan Mamtora with BMO Capital Markets.Ketan MamtoraGood morning, Devin and David. First question, just related to Anthony's earlier question. Dave any update on the main carbon offset project, how that's coming along? And when do you anticipate kind of sort of incremental information around that?Devin W. StockfishYes. So I feel like we're right at the goal line. We've had all of our materials and responses into the third-party auditor for quite some time. I think one of the things that we've come to appreciate in this space is that there are not enough third-party auditors really to manage the magnitude of carbon credits that are coming to market. I do think that's something that will be resolved over time. But that's really been the bottleneck for us as we've tried to move that through to the end game. I think we should have something here shortly, and we would anticipate in the very near future, getting those credits issued and then hopefully start selling those forest carbon credits. But I would say also, we've also learned some things through the process that I think should help us scale this program going forward. So more to come on that hopefully in the very near future.Ketan MamtoraGot it. And Devin, when you say very near future, I would still assume that to be kind of 2023. Is that fair?Devin W. StockfishAbsolutely.Ketan MamtoraGot it. And then just switching to capital allocation. I'm curious kind of your approach towards share repurchases, especially in the context of broader capital allocation. In a year like 23, where cash generation will be kind of hit by lower product prices. Obviously, you guys have laid out the base and the supplemental portion. I'm just curious kind of how do you approach share repurchase this year?David M. WoldYes, sure. Thanks. I mean we have -- as we've said for a while now, we believe share repurchase is a useful tool in the right circumstances. And certainly, we're fortunate to have a number of capital allocation levers, including M&amp;A, investing in our business and adjustments to our capital structure. So the current share price, share repurchase is an attractive lever. But we're constantly weighing that in light of all the alternatives and the overall backdrop. And we've been quite active repurchasing shares since we announced our increase to our authority in fall 2021, making our way through about 2/3 of that $1 billion authorization, including about $550 million last year. So as we moved into 2023, the process really remains the same. But to your point, with the cash return framework, the amount of cash committed to be returned to shareholders is going to flex up or down year-to-year based on the amount of adjusted FAD generated. So in light of the economic environment, we saw to start the year with the relative choppiness in housing. It's important to be disciplined and balanced as we deploy our cash over time, weighing all the market conditions and those available levers and ultimately allocating the cash in the way that creates the most value for shareholders. So in summary, I'd say the evaluation process remains consistent. We'll continue to assess share repurchases along with all the other capital allocation options and report out our activity quarterly.OperatorOur next question is from Susan Maklari with Goldman Sachs.Susan Marie MaklariThank you. Good morning, everyone. Our first question is on the DIY segment of the R&amp;R market. Devin, I know you gave some comments there on the activity that you're seeing. But as we get into the spring, what's the tone from your customers there? And how are you thinking about the spring playing out?Devin W. StockfishYes. On balance, we've seen pretty solid demand. I would say just for context, Q1 is always a little bit softer from the DIY segment just because people aren't doing R&amp;R projects in the Northern regions this time of year. I would say in the South, we've actually seen the activity up a little bit year-over-year as we feed into the big box retailers. It's been a little lagging in the West, I would say, year-to-date, but that's starting to pick up. So on balance, we're still expecting a very solid year from the DIY segment. I don't think it's going to be at the same levels that we saw during the peak of the pandemic, but certainly very strong relative to pre-pandemic levels.Susan Marie MaklariOkay. That's helpful. And then looking at the EBITDA margin in lumber and OSB, it was really impressive, given what you're seeing from a pricing perspective. And it does seem like it reflects some of the benefits of the productivity initiatives that you have put in place in the last couple of years. How are you thinking about the production costs going forward, just given the various puts and takes there. And with that, is there any update generally on OpEx 2.0. Any thoughts on how you're progressing against the $175 million, $200 million target for '25?Devin W. StockfishSure. Well, at a high level, I think the benefits of this OpEx program that we've been undertaking for a number of years are really reflected in the Q1 numbers, as you said, in a very challenging market we were still able to deliver positive margins across all of our businesses. And I think just from a relative operating performance standpoint, that's really, really served us well and has been a core part of our operating strategy for quite some time. we are progressing, I think, quite well to that $175 million to $250 million target. And I would say I'm particularly pleased with the progress we made last year. We generated $40 million of OpEx in an environment where we saw historically high levels of inflation. And so that was quite a headwind to navigate through. I think this year, as we see some of the turnover starting to go back to maybe a more normal level and inflation comes down, I feel very good about the tailwinds that we'll have from an OpEx standpoint. And I think it's just a real testament to the teams that we have all across the organization that are staying focused on improving how we operate every day, trying to innovate everywhere we can and serving our customers to make sure that we're not just maintaining industry level -- industry-leading margins, but we're growing that over time. So really pleased with the efforts there.Susan Marie MaklariAnd any thoughts just on those production costs for lumber and OSB as we get into the spring?Devin W. StockfishWell, I think as we look across the key cost elements of each of those businesses. The labor piece has remained elevated. I don't think it's increasing at the clip that we've seen over the last several years, but it still remains at an elevated level. But besides labor, I would say, on balance, we are seeing some progress in having that inflationary pressure kind of back off a bit, whether it's fuel, energy, resins, really across the board, we've seen some of the fiber costs come down. So we are seeing some of those inflationary pressures start to wane. And I think that will be a tailwind for us as we get through the year as well.OperatorOur next question is from Kurt Yinger with D.A. Davidson.Kurt Willem YingerGood morning, everyone. Wanted to start out on the EWP business. I mean, it's been a really nice source of stability kind of in spite of volatility in commodity markets. Realizations there held in better than we expected. It looks like you're expecting some additional pressure in Q2. But could you talk about how you're thinking about profitability there over the next couple of quarters? And maybe give a little bit more color on what you're seeing on the volume side after maybe some destocking issues the last couple of quarters?Devin W. StockfishWell, I think not surprisingly, given that EWP's primary market is single-family construction. We did see softening in EWP demand as we got into Q4 last year, and that really flowed through into Q1. As you say, I think to a large extent, as the housing market softened last fall, the inventory levels across the channel probably built up a little bit more than expected, and we certainly saw in Q1, many of our customers had to work through some existing inventory. And so we adjusted our operating posture down to more -- to be more reflective of the demand environment. And that, I think, together with just a little bit of softening on the price side is really what you saw reflected in the Q1 EBITDA numbers for EWP. But again, as we step back and look at this business from a high level, we're still at pricing that's well above historical levels, prepandemic levels. And I think as we get deeper into the spring, we've seen our order files start to build. Certainly, I think what we've seen going on recently with single-family construction in particular, starting to get a little bit more optimistic about how that's going to be playing out in the months to come. So we're going to be increasing our production in Q2, as David mentioned, not -- still not up to the levels that we're running full out, but certainly above where we were in Q4 and Q1. And I think that will continue to trend in the right direction as we get deeper into the year, assuming that housing continues with this momentum. So we feel really good about the business. It's a quality product. We have great service, and I think really a lot of customer loyalty. And so we'll continue to serve our customers and as single-family housing continues to recover, that business will be in really good shape for us going forward.Kurt Willem YingerMakes sense. And then just second, on southern log pricing. I guess as you look over the next year, do you think we're kind of in a situation where maybe you see kind of a slow bleed in realizations absent a real inflection in demand? Or from where you sit today, any kind of confidence in the idea that things could really level out in the near term at all?Devin W. StockfishI think our view is that it's going to stay fairly stable for most of this year, absent a material change in market dynamics. That's certainly our view from a sawlog perspective I think there's probably a little risk with respect to fiber logs just given end markets in the pulp and paper space has softened a bit. And so there may be a little softening here until that stabilizes and firms up. But for the sawlog prices, our view is it's going to stay pretty consistent over the course of this year. And then as the market improves overall going forward, a lot of the same drivers for that log price appreciation we've seen over the last couple of years should kick back into gear and we still feel pretty optimistic long term that we'll see that gradual price increase across the sawlog portfolio.OperatorOur next question is from Paul Quinn with RBC Capital Markets.Paul C. QuinnYes. Just following up on this real estate energy networks or is it especially the natural climate solutions, looking for the extra color on the carbon project. But where are we at with the -- you signed 2 deals of the carbon storage. Just wondering how that permitting is going for those companies that you're involved with?Devin W. StockfishYes. I think it's progressing as expected. We -- as we said before, there's a fair amount of work to do between signing the deal on actual first injection. You've got to prove out the data, which has been underway and that's progressing well. The permitting and ultimately building out the infrastructure. But I think from a time line standpoint, things are progressing as expected, and we continue to believe we'll see first injection in late 2025 or into 2026. But I think a big part of why we chose those 2 partners is they're both very well equipped to manage through the process and the time line. So we think it's progressing on plan.Paul C. QuinnOkay. And then just switching over to Wood Products. If I look at 2023, whole year. What are we tracking for lumber volumes? Is this -- last year was down. Are we going to go back to 21 levels and especially on the OSB side as well, it looks like you're tracking at record lows for '23.Devin W. StockfishYes. For lumber, we'll definitely be up year-over-year. Sitting here today, it's probably kind of a mid-single digit, high single-digit percentage-wise improvement year-over-year. And remember, last year, there were some things going on around, the strike in the Pacific Northwest. And frankly, with some of the labor issues, probably the production was down as a result of that to some degree as well. So we should see that improve in 2023? And then from an OSB standpoint, that should be up slightly as well.OperatorOur next question is from Mark Weintraub with Seaport Research Partners.Mark Adam WeintraubReal quick on the OSB pricing. You show current up $5 versus the 1Q average. And by my math, when I look at the random length pricing, it's something like $450 million. And is that just because what you're showing is really where prices were 3 or 4 weeks ago given your order files? Or is there something else that might be going on that would depress the type of uptick you would expect to see in OSB pricing?Devin W. StockfishNo, you hit on it exactly, Mark. It's just a function of when you have a 3- to 5-week order file, it takes time for the current prices that are reflected in random lengths to flow through to realization. So there's a lag on the way up. But then there's also a lag on the way down. So it nets out to be the same. It's just a timing issue.Mark Adam WeintraubGot it. Okay. And then on the question on the U.S. South, a couple of questions on the timber markets. and where they may be going. Of course, you don't just grow trees, you also consume logs and making lumber. So I was hoping to get a sense as to what your net position on sawlogs might be? And if there's a difference regionally if you're more long in the Carolinas or the Atlantic Coast versus in some of the Mississippi Arkansas, Louisiana basket, that would be super helpful.Devin W. StockfishYes. That's a really good question, Mark. I think from our standpoint, we have 7 million acres across really all of the major markets across the South unparalleled diversification. I think generally speaking, we have peer-leading scale in every market. So I think as we move forward in a world where we think sawlogs are going up, I think we're really well position going forward. And as you know, there's just been a lot of new capacity coming into the south. And I think -- and we've seen this in markets where new capacities come in, that's pushed up sawlog prices. So as we think about how does that impact our business as a whole going forward. I think it's positive. First, on the timberland side, we are a net seller of logs. So on balance, we generally sell between 40% to 50% of our grade fee logs in the south to our internal mills. So that means the remainder of those logs go to third-party customers. So higher sawlog prices in the South will have a net benefit to Weyerhaeuser on those third-party logs. Now obviously, higher log prices also have an impact on wood products manufacturing as that's a key input cost. But I think, again, the integrated model that we have is going to help us in that respect. So the manufacturing side is those sawlog price increase over time. Those logistics and efficiency benefits that our manufacturing operations enjoy today on the fee timber that we supply is going to become even more important in maintaining industry-leading margins. And you can just look to the Pacific Northwest for an example of that. So I think on balance, we feel very good about that. Obviously, there are regional differences, but I would say outside of the Southeast, we have manufacturing operations in every other wood basket. So most of those dynamics will play out very similarly. And I think all in, if you want to look at log prices and where they're going, I think with our business to scale the integrated nature, we're going to be the premier investment vehicle to leverage increasing Southern sawlog prices into the future.Mark Adam WeintraubOkay. That's super helpful. Just one follow-up. You mentioned that you use about 40%, 50% of your logs go to your own mills. Do you buy much from the outside for your sawmills?Devin W. StockfishWe do. So generally speaking, our internal mills are going to get 50% of their logs from our fee timber and then they will buy the remaining 50% from third parties.Mark Adam WeintraubOkay. So you're kind of moderately net long. Is that a fair if I just do that -- if I do the math in my head, it would suggest you're moderately net long sawtimber in the U.S. South. Is that fair?Devin W. StockfishCorrect.OperatorOur next question is from Buck Horne with Raymond James.Buck HorneQuick question on the lumber markets and just kind of one of the wildcards that's kind of probably affected prices this year. I'm just wondering if you could help us characterize, what's happening with the European wood imports that either hit domestically and/or impacting international markets? Do you see a peak of some of that European wood out there? Or how long will it take to work through some of that inventory that's hitting the domestic market?Devin W. StockfishWe certainly have seen an uptick in particularly the European lumber hitting the U.S. market, and I'll speak to Japan here in just a moment as well. I think that's a function really of a couple of different things. First, if you look back over the last couple of years, clearly, the lumber pricing dynamic in the U.S. made it a very attractive place to send wood. And so even overcoming the logistics and transportation costs, it was a margin positive move to get lumber from Europe into the U.S. market. Even as lumber prices have come down in the U.S., I think, to some extent, it's still probably the best margin opportunity for some lumber because the European demand has really come down with all of the dynamics that are going on there. And so I think you're going to see European imports come down a little bit in 2023, probably not dramatically, however, until you start to see the European Economy and European demand pick up. We did see in Japan, a pretty significant slug of lumber hitting that market at the end of 2022. And as David mentioned, that has put a little bit of pressure on the Japanese market for our customers and our log deliveries. We have started to see the European volume coming into Japan, Wayne. And so we expect that excess inventory of European lumber to work down here in the second quarter, and we should be back into a more normalized position as we get into the third quarter. I think over the long term, though, but the reality is with the beetle infestation issue that they've had in Central Europe, that volume is rapidly becoming less viable. I think as the Russian imports of lumber into Europe assuming that those don't come back in a material way in the near future. The overall dynamic is going to be the Europeans will have to keep more lumber in Europe in a normalized circumstance. And so I think this is a short-term issue that will resolve itself in the not-too-distant future.Buck HorneVery helpful color. I appreciate that. And then shifting to -- you mentioned capacity that's come into the U.S. South in terms of mill production. Can you help us maybe characterize in terms of like how quickly some of that capacity is coming online in the U.S. South. Is that -- is the growth rate that you're seeing faster? And are we bringing in more lumber capacity in the U.S. South than where I guess, replacing that's being curtailed in Canada? Or how do you see that dynamic in terms of what's being added domestically versus what's coming out of Canada?Devin W. StockfishYes, there's certainly been a lot of new capacity coming into the South, but we've also seen a lot of capacity coming out of BC. I suspect there will be more to come. If you just step back and look at the overall amount of new lumber capacity into the U.S., it's really not a significant amount over the last several years. And we're continuing to see new mills come in and new announcements, although that's probably slowed just a little bit over the last 6 to 9 months because of what's going on in the broader economy. But I think a good way to think about it is you're going to see 1 billion, 1.5 billion board feet coming into the South, more or less every year for the next little bit. But I think you're going to see a comparable amount come out of British Columbia, just given what's going on and the dynamic there. So net North American lumber additions, I'm not sure it's going to be all that much really.OperatorOur next question is from George Staphos with Bank of America.George Leon StaphosJust a couple of quick questions here. Number one, Devin, David, can you remind us or call out what the headwind factors, the strikes to whether, what that might have taken away from fourth quarter and perhaps aided operations, specifically in Wood Products during the first quarter. And similarly, were there any things that specifically or particularly went well for you on operations within the Wood segment during the first quarter because performance there was well ahead of our forecast even with the decline in realization. Second question I had; all my other ones have pretty much been asked. Can you remind us what you're seeing in terms of log inventories in China at the ports? I seem to remember that inventories remain pretty elevated. But the outlook seems to be relatively stable to constructive from your vantage point. So I just want to see what the interplay is between inventories at the ports and what you're seeing.Devin W. StockfishYes, George. So maybe I'll take China first and then comment briefly on the lumber piece. From a China standpoint, the latest published numbers from an inventory standpoint in China were down. However, what we saw on the ground in April is a number of ships that were coming over from New Zealand with wood that had been delayed post cyclone. And so I think the inventories in the next published number are going to be up a bit. And I think we've also seen some very low-quality European logs in that market that they're trying to get rid of more or less at fire sale prices. And so I think here, in the very near term, it's just going to be a little bit softer environment as they work through some of that inventory. That being said, the takeaway has really started to pick up here as we've come out of the Lunar New Year. I think as we get out past this period of working through some of this inventory that support at the moment, we're feeling pretty good about the back half of the year in China, and I think that will be a nice flex opportunity for us out of the Pacific Northwest. On the lumber side, and David may have the specific numbers in terms of the Q4 impact. But I would say beyond the strike impact, the one thing I would point out is just as we get into an environment where, as I mentioned earlier, turnover is starting to lessen a little bit more stability. We've got the transportation networks that are starting to get a little bit more, I would say, healthy. And so, on balance, the business just ran better overall in Q1. And I think that's really, again, a testament to the work that our teams are doing and what's still a relatively challenging environment.David M. WoldYes, George, I'd just call out the impact in Q4 would have been pretty negligible based on where margins were at that point in time of the work stoppage. I mean we had a marginal amount of costs associated that may have offset those marginal piece of additional income there. So not really much there. I'd just call out just another great example of the work we've done over time on our cost structure and the OpEx performance of the team to deliver a great quarter in challenging market conditions.George Leon StaphosSo Dave, on a going-forward basis, obviously, there's going to be seasonality. But if we hold pricing constant, this is pretty much a good baseline for operations and for our own margin forecast on a going-forward basis. Would that be fair?David M. WoldYes, I'd say so. As Devin referenced earlier, we've seen some easing on the inflationary side with the labor piece still kind of being persistently strong, but across the board in terms of the other costs, we're seeing some nice signs of easing there. So I think this would be a reasonable baseline moving forward.OperatorThere are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to Devin Stockfish for closing comments.Devin W. StockfishOkay. Well, thanks to everyone for joining us this morning, and thank you for your continued interest in Weyerhaeuser. Have a great day.OperatorThis concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and we thank you for your participation.]"

The quarter’s performance reflects strong execution across the businesses, offset by macroeconomic headwinds, supply chain disruptions and dynamic market conditions.WY’s shares inched up 0.2% in the after-hours trading session on Apr 27, after the earnings release. Notably, the world's leading private owner of timberlands increased its base dividend by 5.6% to 19 cents per share (76 cents annually) from 18 cents (72 cents).Devin W. Stockfish, president and chief executive officer of Weyerhaeuser, said, “Looking forward, we remain constructive on the longer-term demand fundamentals that will drive growth for our businesses, notwithstanding the current macroeconomic headwinds. Our financial position is exceptionally strong and we remain focused on driving operational excellence across our unmatched portfolio of assets and enhancing shareholder value through disciplined capital allocation.""Inside the HeadlinesThe company reported adjusted earnings of 21 cents per share, beating the consensus mark of 12 cents by 75% but decreasing 84% from the year-ago reported figure of $1.31 cents.Net sales for the quarter came in at $1.88 billion, missing the consensus mark of $1.895 billion by 0.7% and declining 39.6% from the $3.11 billion reported in the prior-year quarter.Adjusted EBITDA came in at $395 million, significantly down from $1,497 million in the year-ago period.Segment DetailsTimberlands: Net sales (including inter-segment sales of $142 million) from the segment came in at $604 million, down from the year-ago figure of $626 million. Adjusted EBITDA came in at $188 million, down from $247 million in the year-ago quarter.Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources: For the reported quarter, the segment’s net sales amounted to $101 million, down from $128 million a year ago. Adjusted EBITDA came in at $89 million, reflecting a decline from $116 million reported in the year-ago level.Wood Products: For the first quarter, segment sales totaled $1,318 million, down from $2,519 million in the prior-year period. Adjusted EBITDA came in at $148 million, significantly down from $1,233 million a year ago.Story continuesFinancial HighlightsAs of Mar 31, 2023, Weyerhaeuser had cash and cash equivalents of $797 million, down from $1.88 billion at 2022-end and $1.2 billion at March 2022-end. Long-term debt was $4.07 billion at quarter-end, in line with 2022-end and down from $5.05 billion at March 2022-end.Net cash from operations was $126 million for first-quarter and $957 million in the respective year-ago period.Q2 OutlookFor the Timberland segment, the company expects earnings (before special items) and adjusted EBITDA to be $20 million low sequentially. In the West, it anticipates moderately lower sales realizations, partially offset by significantly low per-unit log and haul costs as well as slightly high fee harvest volumes. In the South, sales realizations and per-unit log and haul costs are likely to be slightly low, while fee harvest volumes are projected to be comparable. Forestry and road costs in the South and North are expected to be seasonally higher.In the Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources segment, Weyerhaeuser expects earnings to be sequentially comparable. Adjusted EBITDA is likely to be $20 million lower than first-quarter, thanks to the timing and mix of sales.Within the Wood Products segment, the company predicts earnings and adjusted EBITDA to be moderately higher, sequentially (excluding the effect of changes in average sales realizations for lumber and oriented strand board or OSB). WY anticipates comparable sales volumes, slightly lower fiber costs and moderately higher unit manufacturing costs for OSB. Sales volumes are likely to be significantly higher and raw material costs are projected to be moderately low for most engineered wood products, partially offset by slightly lower sales.Zacks Rank &amp; Recent Construction ReleasesCurrently, WY carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Otis Worldwide Corporation OTIS started 2023 on a solid note.

It also intends to expand operating margins, return cash to shareholders through a capital-allocation strategy and pursue additional progress toward ESG goals.United Rentals, Inc. URI reported first-quarter 2023 results. Its earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, but revenues beat the same. Nonetheless, on a year-over-year basis, earnings and revenues increased, courtesy of sustained demand in its end markets and the strength of its core rental business.URI also reaffirmed its 2023 guidance, given broad-based end-market activity, contractor backlogs, customer sentiment and solid visibility. Also, it unveiled a quarterly dividend of $1.48 per share with an annualized yield of approximately 0.4%. The company also repurchased $250 million of stock under its existing $1.25 billion share repurchase program.Masco Corporation MAS reported better-than-expected results for first-quarter 2023.

That’s because we have this idea that doing good involves sacrificing capitalistic intent like achieving profitability. To some extent, it’s a reasonable assumption. After all, true charity doesn’t involve a cynical attempt to move up financially. However, some evidence indicates that ESG stocks to buy can also have a positive impact on the bottom line.Increasingly, the public monitors indices such as ESG ratings to make more informed purchasing decisions. As well, the relevant millennial generation and the emerging Generation Z care deeply about environmental issues and other sustainability initiatives. Put another way, you don’t want to be the company ticking off your consumer base.

However, it’s also one of the top ESG stocks to buy. Notably, Microsoft committed that by 2030, the enterprise will be carbon negative. By 2050, the company seeks to remove its historical emissions since its founding in 1975.Financially, Microsoft confirms that ESG investing doesn’t necessarily need to result in giving up all pretenses of profitability. First, the enterprise benefits from a strong balance sheet, as evidenced by its stout Altman Z-Score of 8.99. Also, the tech giant posts a three-year revenue growth rate of 17.4%, outpacing 71.17% of companies listed in the software industry. As well, Microsoft’s net margin pings at just over 33%. This stat ranks better than nearly 97% of the competition.Story continuesFinally, Wall Street analysts peg MSFT as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target comes out to $307.37, implying almost 8% upside potential.Intuit (INTU)An image of a street sign post with directions labeled ""Buy"", ""Hold"", and ""Sell""Source: PX Media / ShutterstockAnother example of ESG stocks trading in the software space, Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) focuses on the financial services realm. It’s best known for its tax-preparation software TurboTax and QuickBooks. However, the company also attempts to do good in the world. Primarily, Intuit ranks high on corporate responsibility, supporting diversity, equity, and inclusion programs.Financially, Intuit also delivers an attractive canvas. First, it enjoys a solid balance sheet, posting an Altman Z-Score of 8.17. This measurement indicates high fiscal stability and a low risk of imminent bankruptcy. In addition, Intuit features a three-year revenue growth rate of 20.4%, outpacing 75.55% of its software peers. Moreover, the company benefits from strong profit margins, particularly its net margin of 14.22%. This stat rises above 85.3% of the competition.Lastly, covering analysts peg INTU as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target lands at $488.88, implying almost 10% upside potential.IDEXX Laboratories (IDXX)Man holding stacks of money. Millionaire.Source: Epic Cure / ShutterstockBased in Westbrook, Maine, IDEXX Laboratories (NASDAQ:IDXX) engages in the development, manufacture, and distribution of products and services for the companion animal veterinary, livestock and poultry, water testing, and dairy markets. One of the top ESG stocks, Idexx supports various positive initiatives, ranging from environmental sustainability to community services. In addition, the company features strong scores among various ESG ratings.On the financial front, Idexx matches the prior ESG leaders with a stout Altman Z-Score. In this case, Idexx hit 15.62, indicating an extremely low risk of bankruptcy. Operationally, the company features a three-year book growth rate of 52.4%, outpacing 88.24% of firms listed in the medical diagnostics and research industry. Also, it’s consistently profitable year in, year out. In the trailing 12 months, Idexx’s net margin stands at 20.17%.To close out, analysts peg IDXX as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target hits $559.57, implying nearly 13% upside potential.Pool (POOL)A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.Source: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.comHailing from Louisiana, Pool (NASDAQ:POOL) bills itself as the world’s leading distributor of swimming pool supplies, equipment, and related outdoor products. Attempting a recovery from the consumer economy fallout of 2022, POOL stock gained over 14% of equity value since the January opener. In the trailing year, it’s still down about 20%.Nevertheless, fortunes might change as POOL ranks among the ESG stocks to consider. Featuring a commitment to governance protocols – including ethics and compliance – Pool also seeks to minimize its environmental footprint through energy efficiency solutions and waste reduction. As millennials and Gen Z continue to expand in purchasing power, these efforts should be appreciated.Regarding the financials, Pool makes a case for investments tied to ESG growth. Operationally, its three-year sales growth rate pings at 25.6%, above 91.72% of the competition. Also, it’s consistently profitable. Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg POOL as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $395, implying 15% upside potential.NextEra Energy (NEE)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar bills. Bank stocksSource: shutterstock.com/CC7An obvious idea among ESG stocks to buy, NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) easily represents one of the ESG leaders thanks to its core business. An energy company, NextEra represents the largest electric utility holding firm by market capitalization, per its public profile. Featuring a vast network of wind and solar facilities, the company also operates generating plants powered by multiple means.Naturally, NextEra represents a mainstay for ESG investing because of its commitment to clean energy generation. As well, its energy efficiency programs include bolstering transmission lines for both efficiency and resilience. Admittedly, NextEra could use some work in the financial department. For example, its balance sheet on paper doesn’t offer the most confident look.However, like other utility plays, NextEra benefits from a natural monopoly. As a result, it enjoys consistent profitability. Looking to the Street, analysts peg NEE as a consensus strong buy. Overall, their average price target comes out to $91.73, implying over 16% upside potential.Host Hotels &amp; Resorts (HST)tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comSitting within the broader lodging industry, Host Hotels &amp; Resorts (NASDAQ:HST) might not be the first idea that comes to mind when targeting enterprises with strong ESG ratings. Nevertheless, HST might be an intriguing opportunity for contrarian market participants. A real estate investment trust that focuses on hotels, Host Hotels may benefit from relevancies from Gen Z.According to a recent CNBC report, Gen Z consumers – who on average care about sustainability – tend to value experiences more so than prior generations. Therefore, they’re willing to spend on various excursions despite being short on cash. Sure enough, the company commits to various environmental initiatives, which might attract this age cohort.Financially, HST represents a higher-risk profile because of its negative long-term sales trend resulting from the Covid-19 impact. However, it might be undervalued based on operating cash flow. Lastly, analysts peg HST as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $20.09, implying nearly 24% upside potential. Thus, it’s an interesting example of ESG stocks if you can handle the risk.Bunge (BG)Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words ""buy"" and ""sell"" displayed on the screen.

Specializing in the international soybean export industry, Bunge also targets food processing, grain trading, and fertilizer manufacturing. Despite its pertinence, BG slipped half a percent below parity for the year. In the past 365 days, it fell more than 18%.As one of the top ESG stocks, Bunge cares deeply about sustainability issues. According to its website, management makes decisions across its value chain built on the foundations of ethical leadership, accountability, and environmental stewardship.On the financial spectrum, Bunge delivers decent stability in the balance sheet with an Altman Z-Score of 4.58. Also, its three-year revenue growth rate pings at 14.7%, above 76.43% of its peers. Notably, the market prices BG at a forward multiple of 8.12. As a discount to projected earnings, Bunge ranks better than 87.78% of the competition. On a final note, analysts peg BG as a consensus moderate buy.

325,b562dcde-b6e1-3ff5-9a8c-537befd04ea7,LYB,2023-04-29,LyondellBasell Industries N.V.'s (NYSE:LYB) Stock Has Shown A Decent Performance: Have Financials A Role To Play?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lyondellbasell-industries-n-v-nyse-110023364.html,1682766023,STORY,['LYB'],"[LyondellBasell Industries' (NYSE:LYB) stock is up by 1.8% over the past month. We wonder if and what role the company's financials play in that price change as a company's long-term fundamentals usually dictate market outcomes. Specifically, we decided to study LyondellBasell Industries'  ROE in this article.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. Check out our latest analysis for LyondellBasell Industries How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for LyondellBasell Industries is:31% = US$3.9b ÷ US$13b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.31 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.A Side By Side comparison of LyondellBasell Industries' Earnings Growth And 31% ROEFirst thing first, we like that LyondellBasell Industries has an impressive ROE. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 16% the company's ROE is quite impressive. As you might expect, the 2.2% net income decline reported by LyondellBasell Industries doesn't bode well with us. Based on this, we feel that there might be other reasons which haven't been discussed so far in this article that could be hampering the company's growth. These include low earnings retention or poor allocation of capital.Story continuesSo, as a next step, we compared LyondellBasell Industries' performance against the industry and were disappointed to discover that while the company has been shrinking its earnings, the industry has been growing its earnings at a rate of 13% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Has the market priced in the future outlook for LYB? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. Is LyondellBasell Industries Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?Despite having a normal three-year median payout ratio of 40% (where it is retaining 60% of its profits), LyondellBasell Industries has seen a decline in earnings as we saw above. So there could be some other explanations in that regard. For instance, the company's business may be deteriorating.Moreover, LyondellBasell Industries has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more suggesting that management must have perceived that the shareholders prefer dividends over earnings growth. Based on the latest analysts' estimates, we found that the company's future payout ratio over the next three years is expected to hold steady at 45%. As a result, LyondellBasell Industries' ROE is not expected to change by much either, which we inferred from the analyst estimate of 25% for future ROE.ConclusionIn total, it does look like LyondellBasell Industries has some positive aspects to its business. However, given the high ROE and high profit retention, we would expect the company to be delivering strong earnings growth, but that isn't the case here. This suggests that there might be some external threat to the business, that's hampering its growth. With that said, we studied the latest analyst forecasts and found that while the company has shrunk its earnings in the past, analysts expect its earnings to grow in the future.

During today's call, we will focus on first quarter results, current market dynamics and our near-term outlook.With that being said, I would now like to turn the call over to Peter.Story continuesPeter Z. E. VanackerThank you, David. Welcome to all of you. We appreciate you joining us today as we discuss our first quarter 2023 results. We will begin on Slide #3 with our safety performance. Our workforce continues to deliver excellent safety performance for the start of 2023.LyondellBasell's year-to-date incident rate for employees and contractors is 0.16, which continues to be below the rate seen in prior years. Safety will continue to be a fundamental part of our core values as we move forward with the implementation of our exciting new strategy.Let's turn to Slide #4 and review the new strategy that we launched last month at our Capital Markets Day. As you can see, much work was already underway. Our strategy is built around 3 pillars. We're convinced that the successful implementation of our new strategy will increase our normalized EBITDA by $3 billion to $10 billion by 2027.This should ultimately result in a more profitable and sustainable growth engine for LyondellBasell. The 3 pillars for growing and upgrading our core, building a profitable circular and low-carbon solutions business, and finally, stepping up our performance and culture.And the grow in upgrading the core, we are focused on the areas of our portfolio where we have leading positions and competitive advantages that are aligned with our long-term goals. We will reinvest to grow and improve upon those advantaged positions by leveraging our leading technologies to generate returns at scale.In the second pillar, we are committed to building a profitable circular and low-carbon solutions business that would enable our leadership in circularity and address the massive customer demand for these products and solutions in a profitable way. We expect this business will generate at least $1 billion of incremental EBITDA by 2030.The third pillar of our strategy is to step up our performance and culture. Our company has a well-earned reputation for strong operational excellence and cost leadership. Our goal is to build on these strengths to capture untapped value across the company through modest investments. We have established a value enhancement program that is prioritizing and delivering on these initiatives. Our value enhancement program is on track to deliver more than $750 million of recurring annual EBITDA by the end of 2025.These 3 pillars do not stand alone. The pillars of our strategy are interconnected and reinforce each other. For example, we step up our performance and culture to create value. We will reinvest that value in growing and upgrading our core. Returns from a larger and more profitable core will be allocated to build a more sustainable circular and low-carbon solutions business.And the cash generation from all these activities will continue to provide generous shareholder returns. Our strategy serves the needs of our customers, employees, investors and society. We did not wait until our Capital Markets Day in March to start executing this strategy.Slide #4 highlights our actions across 3 pillars over the past year. As part of growing and upgrading the core, we announced in April 2022 that we would exit the refining business. We are now evaluating options to transform the facility to serve our long-term objectives, particularly around circular and low-carbon solutions. Last April, we divested our Australian polypropylene business and at our Capital Markets Day, we announced a strategic review for our ethylene oxide and derivatives business.We are improving our focus with investments in businesses that fit with our long-term strategy. An example is the successful start-up of our new PO/TBA facility, the largest propylene oxide plant in the world over the past month. This project was an enormous undertaking across 2 Houston area facilities. During the height of construction, we had a workforce of more than 3,000 people.This is the sixth PO/TBA plant built by LyondellBasell since inventing the technology in the 1960s. Our plant doubles the scale of our prior plants, improves yields, increases product recovery and incorporates hundreds of design improvements that save energy, reduce emissions and lower costs. The net result is that we believe propylene oxide from our PO/TBA technology has a lower carbon footprint relative to the most widely used PO technologies.And our cost of production is the lowest in the world. The new plant was producing on-spec products at rates of 70% or above within 1 month from start-up. I want to sincerely thank our team for all the hard work and dedication that went into this extremely successful launch of a new production capacity. The PO/TBA plant is just 1 example of how we are growing and upgrading our core businesses.Through our value enhancement program, our team is unlocking additional production volumes across our business portfolio through hundreds of initiatives to increase capacity and improve reliability. In the second half of last year, we established our circular and low-carbon solutions business unit to address the rapidly growing demand for circular and renewable products.Since that time, we have staffed up the organization and announced multiple acquisitions, partnerships and other arrangements. Just this week, we announced that LyondellBasell will acquire the other half of our QCP mechanical recycling joint venture in Europe. This is another step forward in our work to achieve our sustainability goals.We are securing recycled and renewable feedstocks and building regional hubs to leverage our technologies and provide powerful advantages for our comprehensive business model. Last December, we increased our greenhouse gas emission reduction goals to establish a leadership position within our industry by aligning with science-based climate guidance. As part of this, we set a goal to procure at least half of our global electricity from renewable sources by 2030.In just 10 months, we've announced agreements that will achieve 70% of our renewable power target with approximately 1,100 megawatts of renewable generation capacity. The agreements will reduce LyondellBasell's greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 1.1 million tons, and that is nearly 15% of our 2020 Scope 2 emissions. We provide an in-depth look at our progress on sustainability with our newly published 2022 sustainability report. And as you know, that is available on our website.This report highlights how we can create substantial enterprise value through leadership in sustainability, which is core to our strategy of creating solutions for everyday sustainable living. Our work to step up performance and culture is the third pillar of our strategy.In October, we streamlined our organizational structure to improve line of sight with clear accountabilities and improved alignment across our commercial and manufacturing functions. And at our Capital Markets Day, Torkel described the work that is underway to transform our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment. In addition, we are leveraging the structure of our value enhancement program to drive commercial excellence and improve our customer focus.Altogether, the 3 pillars of LyondellBasell's strategy are working side by side to form a growth engine that captures value and delivers a more profitable and sustainable portfolio of businesses. Let's now turn to Slide #5 to discuss our financial performance. During the first quarter, LyondellBasell's business portfolio delivered solid results, reflecting moderately improving market conditions.Earnings were $2.50 per share, more than 90% at best our fourth quarter results. EBITDA was $1.5 billion, and we generated nearly $500 million in cash from operating activities. We ended the quarter with $1.8 billion of cash on hand and $5.8 billion of available liquidity. Our company generated 12% return on invested capital over the past 12 months.The strength of our investment-grade balance sheet and our disciplined approach to capital allocation enable us to confidently move forward with our strategy, while continuing to provide attractive returns to shareholders through all stages of the business cycle.With that, I will turn the call over to Michael first and then to each of our business leaders, who will describe our financial and segment results in more detail.Michael C. McMurrayThank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 6, and let me begin by describing how we are extending our track record of outstanding cash generation. In the first quarter, LyondellBasell generated nearly $500 million of cash from operating activities that contributed toward our total of $5.1 billion over the last 12 months. Our cash balance was $1.8 billion at the end of the first quarter. Over the last 4 quarters, our team efficiently converted 89% of our EBITDA into cash.During the first quarter, our cash conversion dipped to 35% driven by increased sales volumes and additional inventory required to serve customers during upcoming maintenance. Nonetheless, we expect to continue converting approximately 80% of EBITDA to cash over the longer term, as we have done in the past. We remain committed to delivering strong returns to our shareholders. Over the last 12 months, we returned $3.5 billion in the form of dividends and share repurchases.Let's continue with Slide 7 and review the details of our cash generation and allocation during the first quarter. The LyondellBasell team remains focused on disciplined capital allocation to provide strong returns for our shareholders. During the past 4 quarters, we returned 107% of free cash flow to our shareholders. This is well above the annual target of 70% that I shared with you at our Capital Markets Day.During the first quarter, we returned approximately $460 million to shareholders through our quarterly dividends and share repurchases. First quarter capital expenditures were $352 million, approximately $120 million less than the fourth quarter. With a successful start-up of our world-scale PO/TBA plant, capital expenditures related to the construction of the plant will be replaced with growing cash generation.Our continued investments in maintenance and smaller growth projects remain within our plan of $1.6 billion for 2023. Now I'd like to provide an overview of the results for each of our segments on Slide 8. LyondellBasell's business portfolio delivered $1.5 billion of EBITDA during the first quarter. Our results reflect moderate margin and volume improvements across most segments due to improving global demand and lower energy costs.Results in our olefins and polyolefins businesses benefited from higher asset utilization. Demand for fuels remained strong, and our oxyfuels and refining businesses continued to earn margins above historical averages. Please note that our first quarter segment results reflect the movement of our Catalloy and polybutylene businesses from the APS segment to the O&amp;P Americas and O&amp;P EAI segments, effective as of January 1.We filed an 8-K on March 7 that provides summary historical financial information for the 3 prior years. During the quarter, we recognized $69 million in cost related to the exit from a refining business and a noncash goodwill impairment of $252 million related to our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment.As I mentioned last quarter, we expect to incur approximately $75 million of EBITDA impact as well as $55 million of depreciation related to the exit from our refining business during each quarter of 2023. As a follow-up to our 2023 plant maintenance guidance, we decided to pull forward some planned maintenance in our O&amp;P Americas segment to the second quarter. We expect this will result in an additional impact of $90 million for a total estimated EBITDA headwind of $110 million for the segment during the second quarter of 2023.With that, I'll turn the call over to Ken.Kenneth Todd LaneThank you, Michael. Let's begin the segment discussions on Slide 9 with the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins Americas segment. During the first quarter, O&amp;P Americas EBITDA increased $157 million to $541 million. North American Olefins margins improved on lower feedstock costs, while polyethylene margins increased on higher pricing.In the second quarter, we expect slightly better seasonal demand leading to modest improvements in volume and margins. The recent start-up delays for new industry polyethylene capacity should tighten markets and benefit margins over the coming months. Costs for feedstocks and energy are expected to remain relatively low during the summer season. LyondellBasell will continue to manage operating rates in line with moderately improving demand.We expect to operate our O&amp;P-Americas assets at a rate of approximately 85% in the second quarter. This is inclusive of the additional planned maintenance mentioned by Michael. In February, we announced a new long-term feedstock agreement with Nexus Circular. This will supply LyondellBasell's circular and low-carbon solutions business unit with 24,000 tons per year of recycled feedstock.Nexus Circular's new facility will convert mixed plastic waste into recycled liquid feedstock for our ethylene crackers, ultimately producing new plastics under the circular revived brand. This agreement is just 1 component of our rapid multifaceted strategy execution. We'll now turn to Slide 10 to review the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins Europe, Asia and International segment.In the first quarter, we increased operating rates after the restart of our integrated cracker in France. European margins benefited from lower energy costs, but weak demand for durable products persisted. As a result, O&amp;P EAI first quarter EBITDA increased $225 million to $77 million. Looking ahead, we expect slightly better seasonal demand in the second quarter.Our operating rates will reflect that improvement, targeting approximately 85% of capacity for the O&amp;P EAI assets. While Europe remains a challenging environment, especially for durable goods, we are focusing on serving customers and optimizing our assets to deliver highest value. As we mentioned at our recent Capital Markets Day, our teams continue to make good progress developing our regional hub model for circular and low-carbon solutions.Through a fit-for-purpose diverse mix of products and technologies, we will scale this up to become a leader in circular and renewable solutions. With that, let's turn to Slide 11 to discuss the hub model in more detail. The first of which will be located in Cologne, Germany. As Yvonne van der Laan described at our Capital Markets Day, our business model is built upon an integrated approach to plastic waste. This begins upstream with an advanced waste sorting through our joint venture with SourceOne Plastics and partnership with EEW Energy for Waste, both of which focus on recovering plastic waste that would otherwise be incinerated.From there, we can utilize our mechanical recycling footprint with our QCP and APK investments, which can be sold under the circular recover brand or move further down the value chain into compounding where we can leverage our APS segment and the newly acquired Mepol Group to create additional value. Alternatively, these waste sorting operations can take hard to recycle plastic waste to create feedstock for advanced recycling.Newly developed technologies such as our catalytic MoReTec process, allow for waste to be converted into pyrolysis oil. In addition to our MoReTec technology, which we hope to FID later this year, we are utilizing long-term feedstock agreements with suppliers like Nexus Circular. This pyrolysis oil from advanced recycling is the feedstock for our ethylene crackers.Most importantly, it allows us to produce materials identical to virgin resins under our CirculenRevive brand. This generates meaningful value for our customers that use polyethylene and polypropylene in applications such as health care, where mechanically recycled plastic waste cannot be used.Lastly, renewable feedstocks are another sustainable option for ethylene crackers. Through suppliers such as Neste, we are able to process feedstocks from bio-based sources such as waste and residual oils and fats to produce CirculenRenew polymers with a low-carbon footprint. Advanced recycling and renewables are excellent feedstock sources for ethylene crackers. Both are similar to naphtha or heavier liquids, making LyondellBasell well positioned to capture this value with the feedstock flexibility of our existing assets.All of this is already underway, and our hub model will allow us to scale globally and reach at least 2 million tons per year of recycled and renewable based products by 2030. Since 2019, we have sold nearly 200,000 tons of products. We are convinced that LyondellBasell is uniquely positioned to be the supplier of choice for our customers and brand owners who want to partner with us to lower their greenhouse gas footprint and make their products more circular. We see tremendous value across the entire value chain, and we will continue building on our momentum.With that, I'll turn the call over to Kim.Kimberly A. FoleyThank you, Ken. Please turn to Slide 12 as we look at the Intermediates and Derivatives segment. EBITDA for the segment increased by $135 million in the first quarter to $426 million. Propylene oxide volumes increased with higher operating rates after planned downtime last quarter while margins decreased on continued weak demand for durable goods. Oxyfuel margins remained strong, supported by low inventories and steady demand for gasoline. Overall, we operated our assets at approximately 85% for the quarter.As highlighted at our Capital Markets Day in March, we have successfully started up our new PO/TBA plant, which is the largest propylene oxide plant in the world. This start-up was many years in the making, and I am incredibly proud of what our team has accomplished. In line with the guidance from last quarter, a heavy planned maintenance schedule across our propylene oxide assets in 2023 will largely offset the benefits from this new volume during the first year of operations.In 2023, we'll be focused on driving safety, quality and reliability as we fine-tune the operation of this new PO/TBA plant and ramp up cash generation in 2024. For the second quarter, we expect to run our global IND assets at approximately 80% of capacity in line with demand.Our new PO/TBA capacity is included in the calculation of our I&amp;D segment operating rates beginning with the second quarter. Now let's turn to Slide 13 and discuss the results of the refining segment. First quarter EBITDA of $315 million was fairly comparable with the prior quarter, which benefited from a $40 million in tailwinds from a LIFO inventory valuation. In the first quarter, the Maya 2-1-1 spread remained stable at about $49 per barrel.Industry inventories for fuels remain low following winter weather and significant maintenance, coupled with stable demand. We operated the refinery at approximately 85% of capacity with an average crude rate of 226,000 barrels per day. In the near term, we expect the Maya 2-1-1 spreads to moderate due to declining diesel spreads while remaining well above historical averages. We plan to operate the refinery at approximately 95% of capacity in the second quarter.We remain committed to safe operation of these assets with a focus on high reliability to capitalize on current market conditions. As Peter mentioned earlier, we have started the evaluation of several projects to transform the site to fit with our circular and low-carbon solution strategy.With that, I will turn the call over to Torkel.Torkel RhenmanThank you, Kim. Now let's review the first quarter results on Slide 14. First quarter EBITDA increased $52 million to $26 million. Margins for the polypropylene compounding business improved as product sales prices captured a higher share of rising raw material prices. All of our business areas saw moderately higher demand. We expect demand will moderately improve across most APS businesses during the second quarter.After spending time in this role, I've met with many customers who have told us how much they value our products and innovations. We're working every day to improve our service levels and meet our customers' needs to transform this business.As we mentioned last quarter, we have reshaped APS by moving the Catalloy and polybutene businesses into the O&amp;P Americas and O&amp;P EAI segments, which will allow us to focus on what is core to APS, serving customers with tailored solutions. To further support the growing and shaping of APS' core, we announced in March that we have entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Mepol Group.Mepol's expertise in sustainable compounding fits perfectly into our overall strategy to be a leading provider of sustainable solutions. We are confident that our APS platform has significant potential. While our team will have some autonomy to install a more customer-centric business model, we will also be highly accountable for delivering value from our initiatives.With that, I will return the call back to Peter.Peter Z. E. VanackerThank you, Torkel. Please turn to Slide 15, and I will discuss the results for the Technology segment on behalf of Jim Seward. First quarter EBITDA of $73 million reflected stable catalyst volumes and lower licensing revenue. In the second quarter, we expect that licensing revenue and catalyst volumes will be moderately better.Nonetheless, we estimate that second quarter technology segment results will be similar to the first quarter. As Ken discussed, we believe that LyondellBasell's circular and low-carbon solutions business has a strategic advantage with our integrated hub solution. A key enabler to scale our hubs is LyondellBasell's proprietary MoReTec advanced catalytic-recycling technology.Engineering work for our first commercial scale plant is underway. We hope to provide you with further updates and reach an investment decision for a commercial scale plant during the fourth quarter of this year.Let me now summarize our first quarter and the outlook for our company with Slide 16. Our first quarter results illustrate how our teams capturing value through our new strategy with help from moderately improving market conditions.LyondellBasell's foundational commitment to safety remains at the core of our culture and will continue to be a critical enabler for our future success. Our O&amp;P businesses benefited from moderately improving demand. Our oxyfuels and refining businesses continue to see margins above historical averages, supported by low inventories and steady demand.During the first quarter, we returned approximately $460 million in dividends and share repurchases, demonstrating our commitment to shareholder returns. Looking ahead to the second quarter, we anticipate modest seasonal demand improvements. North American polyethylene margins should benefit from delays in industry capacity additions.In response, we're aligning our operating rates to match market demand. We remain watchful for market improvements in China as stronger economic activity could help drive recovery in global markets during the second half of the year.LyondellBasell is focused on serving rapidly growing demand for our valuable Circulen products from our circular and low-carbon solutions business. We're entering multiple arrangements to secure plastic waste feedstocks and build out the regional apps that will drive our advantage. And we are making progress on our climate targets.In less than 1 year since signing our first power purchase agreements, we achieved 70% of our target to procure at least half of global electricity from renewable sources by 2030. At our Capital Markets Day last month, I hope you sensed our excitement around our new forward strategy. Last week, we gathered 150 of our global leaders to provide feedback and align on implementation.The energy and enthusiasm around our initial progress is incredible from our frontline operators and manufacturing to engineers developing innovative solutions for our customers to 3 pillars of our strategy for providing focus and clarity for our progress to capture incremental value and deliver a more profitable and sustainable growth engine at LyondellBasell.We're now pleased to take your questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Steve Byrne with Bank of America.Stephen V. ByrneYes. This FID that you're targeting at the end of the year for the MoReTec technology, is it fair to assume that you're thinking about building this at the refinery site given you have all these hydrotreaters available that could be used to treat the pyrolysis oil, you could also use the hydrotreaters to make your own renewable feedstock rather than buying it from Neste and you will need a lot of hydrogen to do all this. Could this site become a hydrogen hub as well and get some DOE funding?Peter Z. E. VanackerSteve, this is Peter. Thank you for your question. Of course, as usual, very good question. The first MoReTec industrial scale deployments that we are referring to the -- we plan to have an FID until the end of this year will be in the Cologne hub. But of course, we're also looking at the Houston hub, and I have alluded to that before, that we are looking at the refinery to also deploy an investment in terms of MoReTec, our own technology.So -- but the first one, to be very clear, will be in Cologne. And rightfully so, I mean, as you recognized, if we do a MoReTec investment in the Houston hub, we can leverage upon the hydrotreaters and hydrocrackers that we have there to upgrade a plastic oil and then feed the plastic oil through the pipeline to our Channelview cracker. So it's an ideal situation that we have there. So that's the focus that we currently have. It's all around our more advanced recycling technology.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.Jeffrey John ZekauskasWhat are the total cash costs for shutting down the refinery and remediating whatever needs to be remediated if there is something.Michael C. McMurrayJeff, it's Michael. Let me help you out with that. So I'll refer you back to an 8-K that we issued last year. But we anticipate a number of charges. So there's charges associated with the existing operating lease assets. So this would include like tanks and other infrastructure. There's asset decommissioning cost, so like things like tank cleaning and then personnel-related costs as well and then some miscellaneous charges.So our total cost estimate -- and this is still a good estimate today. We had given a range of about $600 million to $900 million. It's unlikely and this is happening, that they're not going to be recognized all at once, so we've been incurring some cash and some noncash costs, now largely noncash this year, and they'll continue into 2024 as well. And you're seeing charges per quarter right now of about $85 million, similar to what we had seen in 2023 as well.On the fourth quarter, we did raise our estimate on asset decommissioning costs slightly, and you've seen some incremental depreciation related to that. But that's within our $1 billion for estimate for the full year. And then don't forget, there will be a meaningful working capital release when we shut down the refinery -- it's on the order of about $700 million is what we're expecting.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Mike Sison with Wells Fargo.Michael Joseph SisonNice start to the year. In terms of fundamental polyethylene demand, where do you think we're running at here in the first quarter, heading into the second quarter and how do you think it holds up in the second half of the year?Peter Z. E. VanackerYes, Mike, I'm going to give that to Ken to answer that question. The first thing that I want to say is our sales teams as well as the operations team, they have done an excellent job in navigating very well both in polyethylene as well as in polypropylene through challenging market environments. And the result is, of course, what you see then on the EBITDA in Q1. Ken?Kenneth Todd LaneYes. Thanks, Mike. We're seeing modest improvements from Q4. Q4 being very low, and we saw a lot of destocking, especially in Europe in the fourth quarter.So I'd say overall demand is going to modestly improve going into Q2. We typically see some seasonal improvement. We have begun to see some improvement in China. The consumer is sort of waking up there.So my expectation is that as we get into the second half of the year, that's probably going to be the biggest opportunity for improvement in the market, is going to be how quickly China comes back. I don't think in Europe and in the U.S., you're going to see anything different than the normal kind of Q2, Q3 peak and then a decline in Q4, which is normal for those markets. But we should see Asia performing stronger in the second half.Peter Z. E. VanackerAnd I'll hold that in the context, of course, if you just look at Eurozone GDP first quarter, that was practically no growth, okay, not a deep recession, but on the other hand side, I mean, 0.1% growth. And needless to say, as you will hear it all over the place is that this is especially in durable goods that the market continues to see a very conservative consumer behavior.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Duffy Fischer with Goldman Sachs.Patrick Duffy FischerI was just trying to figure out in your PO business, your non -- other than the new plant you're starting up, roughly, what are you running the rest of your fleet at? And then what do we need to see for PO to get healthier? Do we need to see some industry shutdowns? Or do we just need to see business come back to a normal level and the profitability levels per unit can kind of come back to where they were maybe 1 year, 1.5 years ago. But just what's your outlook there for the rest of the year, if you would produce?Peter Z. E. VanackerThank you, Duffy. Very good question. And that allows me again to repeat what a huge success that is to be able to start up that PO/TBA plants, I mean the largest that is in the entire industry, on time, safely and is now ramping up just like inset to demonstrate, I mean maximum capacity in that plant.So really, I mean, an incredible -- and I must say, even when I compare that to my previous assignments and other companies, I've never seen it going that smooth. So really great job by the entire team, which gives you given Kim some time to answer the question.Kimberly A. FoleyAs it relates to the business environment, I think it's very similar to what you heard from Ken and Peter related to durable demand. The biggest outlets for propylene oxide are polyurethanes that go into insulation, they go into furniture, they go into the construction industry, paintings and coatings.So until we see housing turn, you're going to -- the demand is going to be weak. And the question is what's going to happen with interest rates and how will that influence housing demand, not only in the U.S., but also some of the challenges that they have in Asia -- as far as their construction and real estate markets.So as we look forward, we have some optimism, but I think it's heavily weighted on what happens with interest rates. To your other question as it relates to industry consolidation. Yes, we would love to see some consolidation from fourth quartile assets around the world, but those are decisions that each and every manufacturer has to look at and make as they assess their portfolio.Peter Z. E. VanackerAnd Duffy, that a part of the PO consumption is going into bedding into furniture. But there is also a part that is going about, I would say, 20% is going into automotive. And if you look at the automotive industry in terms of builds, the latest IHS numbers were, let's say, April expectation, close to 4% increase. So it's not all negative. But as long as we don't see that the construction market will start to pick up, then we expect that it will be moderate in terms of demand growth in PO, but we are ready for that.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Josh Spector with UBS.Joshua David SpectorI wanted to follow up on one of the earlier questions on demand and specifically around China in terms of what you're seeing in terms of on-the-ground demand and inventories for polyethylene and polypropylene. And you made a comment on, I mean, your prepared remarks around delays in polyethylene capacity in North America being helpful. I mean, at least on paper, there's capacity coming out in China at meaningful scale. Is there anything you could comment on there that's going perhaps per plant slower or faster than you expected?Kenneth Todd LaneYes. Thanks for the question, Josh. No, there's nothing that we see really meaningfully different in terms of the developments around China capacity additions. They seem to be coming on about the way that we had expected. So really nothing new there.But again, what we're starting to see is consumption is improving, converters and downstream customers are being a little bit more careful. They're not wanting to build inventory. So that's point of what we see in terms of, I'd say, the slow ramp-up.They're being very risk-averse, but the demand is beginning to come back a little bit as far as consumer goods. To the point that Peter made earlier, durables are less strong in terms of the recovery, but we still see good demand in food packaging and those sorts of markets.Peter Z. E. VanackerCan we say, Ken, I mean, if you look at just at March, export fee from the U.S., that went up as well?Kenneth Todd LaneYes. So exports from North America have gone up in the month of March pretty significantly, if you look at the ACC data. So that's going to continue, I think, into the second quarter.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.David L. BegleiterPeter, can you talk to the strength of the oxyfuel margins and how sustainable it might be beyond the seasonally stronger period we're about to enter?Peter Z. E. VanackerYes. Thank you, David. Good question. We continue to believe, I mean, that the oxyfuel markets, if you look at it compared to the history, will continue to be strong. Maybe a little bit. But I will give it to you Kim, to elaborate a little bit more.Kimberly A. FoleyThanks, Peter. So I think if you think about the big drivers for the profitability of oxyfuels, at your feedstock costs, so look at your butane costs versus your crude. Look at your cost of methanol, which right now in the U.S. is favorable with low natural gas, the relative price of crude, so the higher crude is, the more favorable it is, because it's the difference between the lower gas and the crude.And then the premium. And I think that's the question many people have is what's going to happen with all this new capacity as we come into the market with the -- what we call the oxyfuel for the ether premium. And we're pretty confident we have outlets for all of that material. And we think there'll be some seasonal moderation of margins as we go into the third and fourth quarter as butane pricing increases. But no concerns or plans that we haven't forecasted within our portfolio.Peter Z. E. VanackerYes. One needs to look like Kim said in the prepared remarks, I mean the new PO/TBA plant, even if we would operate at 90%, 95% of capacity, we have actually proactively scheduled 3 turnarounds at other plants. So at the end, net-net, there is not substantial more volume that comes into the market.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Aleksey Yefremov with KeyBanc Capital Markets.Aleksey V. YefremovI had a question on your Cologne hub slide. First, there's mechanical recycling that's present in the diagram -- and as you know, there is a very well-developed mechanical recycling industry that already exists. Do you have any special sauce or advantage by owning the mechanical recycling assets and having them on that 1 site?Peter Z. E. VanackerWell, we do believe, and it's a very good question, I mean, Aleksey, and rightfully noted as well that this is -- as we said at the Capital Markets Day, this is the who breadth of different technologies that we are deploying globally, not just at the Cologne hub. And one of those technologies is actually the mechanical recycling technologies. And you saw from our announcement this morning that we have agreed to meet to buy out and now have full ownership over the QCP assets, which are assets in Galena in the Netherlands as well as the Tekova assets in Belgium. So these assets are on one hand side, industrial mechanical waste focus, and on the other hand side, was consumer waste focused.So again, here, we have the breadth of technologies that we then can bring to the market. We do believe that we have differentiated technology not just on the mechanical of course, as you know, but also on the advanced recycling and intend to continue to deploy that.Kenneth Todd LaneAnd just -- one thing I do want to add to that is when you look at the resins that we develop and the mechanical recycling capability that we have, being able to optimize those things. So if you think about some of our new resins coming out of the Hyperzone asset, they are very good to be able to increase the recycled content. So there is an advantage by optimizing your portfolio of virgin resins and recycle its content.Peter Z. E. VanackerYes, that's a very important point. And that's why, I mean, this approach, the synergies that we have, the optimization that is possible to maximize the value out of our waste.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.Vincent Stephen AndrewsI'm wondering if you can give us a bit of a bridge in EAI from 1Q into 2Q and a couple of questions within that. One would just be on the energy cost position of the plant footprint. I know you said it was $90 million better versus 4Q. Does that improve any further into the second quarter? And then also, you commented in the release about in the first quarter, I believe it was 70% naphtha as a feedstock. What was the reason why you were so rich in naphtha versus LPG? And what would you anticipate for the second quarter?Kenneth Todd LaneI'll take that one, Vincent. Thanks for the question. So just to give you a feel, recall that we had in the fourth quarter, the -- our French cracker down. So that certainly has an impact on our energy mix and our feedstock mix as well. I think what was interesting in the first quarter is that propane was in the feedstock mix, which is atypical when you think about winter months, normally propane is not in the feedstock mix. And we have a lot of flexibility in that cracker in France. So as we were ramping that up, we started to optimize the portfolio through the quarter. So you'll see some more impact.The full quarter impact of having the bar cracker up and running in the second quarter, but I'd say it's marginal. We do have a good cost position in terms of energy costs in France. So I don't expect there to be a big difference in the second quarter versus first quarter, other than what you can see in the improving price of gas in Europe.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Matthew Skowronski with Credit Suisse.Matthew Stephen SkowronskiKen, ethane prices have fallen quite a bit. Can you provide color on your outlook for feedstock costs for the rest of the year? And also, now that we're at the end of the month, where do you expect North American polyethylene prices to settle in April?Kenneth Todd LaneSure, Matthew. So we are in a really good position, as you can imagine, for North American feedstock advantage, the oil and gas ratio is very strong. Our outlook is that that's going to continue. We've seen good increases in production in North America in NGLs. And if you look at ethane and propane inventories, they're at high levels and production continues -- so I expect that we're going to see in the midterm continued strength in the advantage for North America.And like we said in the prepared statement, some of the delays in the production issues that are happening with the North American capacity that's coming on, should continue to lend support to polyethylene pricing. And -- we've got price increase announcements out there. And certainly, we're optimistic that we'll be able to secure for that.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners.Kevin William McCarthyJust to follow up on the prior question. Can you comment on the demand side of polyethylene? Do you think that destocking has run its course at this point? And if so, would you anticipate any restocking in coming months?And then with regard to the new supply that's coming domestically, it seems that, as you alluded to, there's either delays or we've also heard that some units are having trouble running on specs sustainably. So welcome any color you have along those lines for the market or individual grades of resin.Peter Z. E. VanackerKen?Kenneth Todd LaneYes. Sure. So listen, I'll just continue. Nothing really more to add. We are seeing tightness in some market segments more than others, which is things like high-density polyethylene, you've probably heard the issues around some of the tightness in the markets there. We expect that's going to continue. But not a lot really to add. It's -- these things are a little bit hard to predict.And exports, like we had mentioned earlier, did creep up in March, and that's always going to be one of the key factors in terms of new capacity coming on with the feedstock advantage that we have here, a lot of that new capacity is going to go offshore.And we're not faced with any of the supply chain issues like what we were seeing kind of early fourth quarter those issues are gone. So the ability to move product offshore is going to help sort of evacuate that volume fairly quickly.Michael C. McMurrayKen, we think destocking is largely done, but folks are buying cautiously, right?Kenneth Todd LaneYes, yes. I would say destocking, we don't really see that occurring anymore and people are being cautious in terms of their inventory levels.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets.Arun Shankar ViswanathanJust a question on how you're thinking about the year and maybe next year as well. We appreciate the '27 $10 billion number. But if you just look into the rest of this year, you were able to do the $1.5 billion for Q1 on EBITDA. Usually in Q2 and Q3 a little bit better, and you're still talking about weak demand. So I'm assuming there's a little bit of improvement as we go through the middle of the year. That should put you on a pace of around $6 billion. Next year, you have, unfortunately, the refinery out, which maybe is a loss of $1 billion. How do you -- are some of those kind of ways of thinking about Lyondell accurate? And how do you kind of plan to plug that $1 billion hole for next year?Peter Z. E. VanackerArun, good question. Thank you very much. And of course, in the context of not giving guidance on a yearly basis, we alluded already, I mean, to the fact that we see maybe a little bit of movement in China but not substantially. So that will be a very important factor to look at if and it's a big if, during the second half of this year, demand growth would be there in China on a substantial basis.And the other point, we expect, that energy costs were going to be, let's say, relatively modest, of course, a big advantage that can leverage upon in the United States. Energy costs have gone down in Europe. But of course, we all know that they are still -- energy is still very expensive in Europe.But we don't see immediately from today's perspective that energy costs in Europe would certainly return back means that like we had gas price above EUR 130, EUR 140 per megawatt hour that we have seen at the end of 2022. So China continues to be a big question mark. And then how will the inflation influence consumer behavior in Europe as well as in the United States.Michael C. McMurraySo to put a bow around that, Peter, we think the second half should be better than the first half. That's broadly in line with what the analyst community is thinking as well. But as you said, China is the linchpin and uncertainty generally is high right now.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Matthew Blair with TPH.Matthew Robert Lovseth BlairOn natural gas, I think you've given sensitivity that every dollar per MMBtu is about $175 million of op costs. Did you realize all those benefits in Q1 from both lower U.S. as well as lower European gas prices? And I guess, should we expect any sort of incremental benefit heading into Q2?Peter Z. E. VanackerMichael?Michael C. McMurraySure. Happy to take that question. And we got some feedback from a few folks that they didn't like our rule of thumb. So I'll give you a bit more data this morning, which hopefully is helpful. But as you all know, energy prices last year surged significantly, both in Europe and the U.S. And so just looking at energy cost for last year versus 2021, up about $1.7 billion. If you benchmark last year versus 2020, up $3.3 billion. So we faced into some significant energy cost increases over the last couple of years.But obviously, have seen relief that started in the fourth quarter and has followed through into the first quarter of this year and now is continuing into the second quarter. So -- what I would say is that if you looked at energy cost overall for the fourth quarter for the enterprise, about $1 billion overall. In the first quarter, down roughly $200 million. Our expectation as we move into Q2, that it's largely flattish, maybe a little bit of kind of full quarter effect.And then just from a modeling perspective, I'll give you a couple of more data points to be helpful both around North American average natural gas prices that we incurred and then Europe average natural gas prices. So for North America, average price in the fourth quarter was $5 -- roughly $5.30 per MMBtu. In the first quarter, the average was $3.10 -- roughly $3.10. And then for Europe, fourth quarter was $26.70, and in the first quarter was $16.60. So hopefully, those data points will help you all as you kind of think about the balance of the year from a modeling perspective.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Hassan Ahmed with Alembic Global.Hassan Ijaz AhmedI wanted to revisit a series of questions that you guys obviously got on polyethylene supply additions. I mean if I were to sort of dig deeper into the different grades of polyethylene, there seem to be fairly major divergences in those capacity adds. Meaning, if I take a look at LDPE, the capacity adds are fairly tepid versus HD and LL. So how do you see that sort of playing out in the near to medium term?Peter Z. E. VanackerKen?Kenneth Todd LaneThank you for the question, Hassan. I mean like I said before, we've seen this capacity coming for several years. There's not anything really new here -- you're exactly right, linear low and high-density capacity has really been differentially higher coming online than low density.But it doesn't change our outlook. We know -- if you go back to the fourth quarter, we really did hit sort of the bottom of the cycle at that point. And now as growth begins to come back in the market, that's going to absorb that capacity. We will sometime in the next several years, get back to a more normalized level of earnings. So not really anything new to add to that. These are things that happen, and we just have to -- we have to work through that in the marketplace.OperatorLadies and gentlemen, that concludes our time allowed for questions. I'll turn the floor back to Mr. Vanacker for any final comments.Peter Z. E. VanackerThank you very much, everybody. As usual, excellent questions, very thoughtful questions. We, of course, look forward to sharing our progress in delivering LyondellBasell strategy and unlocking additional value over the coming months. I wish you all a great weekend, and as usual, stay safe. Thank you.OperatorThank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

Also, a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures was provided with the news release. Statutory accounting data is prepared in accordance with statutory accounting rules and, therefore, is not reconciled to GAAP. Now I'll turn over the call to Steve.Story continuesSteven Justus JohnstonThank you, Dennis, and good morning. Thank you for joining us today to hear more about our results. Net income of $225 million for the first quarter of 2023, rebounded from a net loss position for the same quarter a year ago. As gains and losses from securities still held in our equity portfolio run through net income, we'll continue to experience these swings. Last year, we saw a reduction in portfolio fair value, and this year, we recognize a significant investment gain. We aren't concerned with these quarterly fluctuations in our equity portfolio. We believe the value will continue to grow over the long term. Currently, our equity portfolio holds $5.7 billion in appreciated value. Non-GAAP operating income of $141 million for the quarter was down $119 million from a year ago, including catastrophe losses that were $163 million higher on an after-tax basis. Our 100.7% first quarter 2023 property casualty combined ratio was 10.8 percentage points higher than last year's first quarter driven by an increase of 11.0 points for catastrophe losses. Our first quarter 90.1% ex-cat accident year combined ratio was 0.8 percentage points worse than the same period a year ago but 0.1 points better than the full 2022 ex-cat accident year combined ratio of 90.2% that we reported at our last conference call. Despite the increase in catastrophe losses and the persistency of elevated inflation effects, we see several reasons to be confident about performance for the remainder of the year. Pricing during the first quarter of this year was higher than the fourth quarter of last year for each major line of business. To help address inflation, we also make changes to factors that adjust premiums to account for rising property costs. On a current accident year basis, measured at March 31 before catastrophe losses, our 2023 consolidated property casualty loss and loss expense ratio improved from 2022 by 6.7 percentage points on a case-incurred basis, which includes a 1.6 point improvement on a paid basis. However, we increased the incurred but not reported, or IBNR component of the ratio by 9.2 points as we continue to recognize uncertainty regarding ultimate losses remaining prudent in our reserve estimates until longer-term loss cost trends become more clear. We also earned a small underwriting profit on our commercial umbrella line for the quarter, another positive given recent quarter challenges we and the industry have experienced in various casualty lines of business. We're proud of our underwriters who are working with Cincinnati's appointed insurance agencies to overcome various challenges facing our industry. They continue to emphasize retention of profitable accounts, addressing the ones that we determine have inadequate pricing while also seeking profitable new business. While the first quarter of last year was a record high for new business at that time and created a difficult comparison for growth this year, we believe our associates' pricing and underwriting discipline was also a factor in our 14% reduction in commercial line's new business written premiums in the first quarter of this year. Turning to net written premiums. The consolidated property casualty result rose 6% for the first quarter. That included a 10% increase in the first quarter renewal written premiums with a significant portion from higher levels of insured exposures as we factor in elevated inflation. Our commercial lines insurance segment had estimated average renewal price increases near the high end of the mid-single-digit range. Our excess and surplus lines insurance segment moved higher in the high single-digit range. And personal lines average renewal price increases were in the mid-single-digit range, including both auto and homeowner. As we previously disclosed, we expect premium rates will continue to rise for our personal auto line of business, reaching a full year 2023 premium rate increase of approximately 10%. I'll briefly highlight premium growth and profitability by insurance segment. Commercial lines grew first quarter 2023 net written premiums 4%. Its combined ratio was 8.1 percentage points higher than a year ago, including 9.0 points from catastrophe losses. Personal lines grew net written premiums 20%, largely from planned expansion of Cincinnati Private Client business for high net worth clients of our agencies. Its combined ratio was 28.6 percentage points higher than a year ago, including 23.0 points from catastrophe losses. Excess and surplus lines had a combined ratio of 89.9% with net written premiums growing 10%. Its combined ratio was 4.0 percentage points higher than a year ago, including a 16.0 point increase in the IBNR component. Both Cincinnati Re and Cincinnati Global had an impressive level of profitability for the first quarter of 2023. Cincinnati Re had a 79.6% combined ratio while net written premiums decreased by 9%. We benefited from the firm reinsurance market. Our pricing is stronger relative to the risk we assumed, and we tightened terms and conditions, while also exercising underwriting discipline. We reallocated capacity to participations where seeding companies selected higher loss retention levels and non-renewed certain quota share reinsurance treaties, where we had previously assumed risk on a retrocessional basis. Cincinnati Global's combined ratio was 87.5% with net written premium growing 25%. Our life insurance subsidiary had another good quarter with net income up 12% from last year's first quarter in term life insurance earned premium growth of 4%. I'll conclude, as usual, with the value creation ratio, our primary measure of long-term financial performance. Our first quarter 2023 VCR was 3.1%. Net income before investment gains or losses contributed 1.3%, while favorable valuation of our investment portfolio added another 1.9%. Now our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, will comment on other key factors of our financial performance.Michael James SewellThank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Investment income continued to grow, up 14% for the first quarter 2023 versus last year and outpacing the 12% we reported for the fourth quarter. Dividend income increased by 2% for the quarter as dividend rates are increasing more slowly. Looking ahead to next quarter's dividend growth, you may remember, we received a $5 million special dividend from one of our stockholdings in last year's second quarter that will make for a tough comparison in the second quarter of 2023. Net equity security purchases for the first quarter totaled $18 million. Bond interest income was up 14% in the first quarter compared with the first quarter of 2022. We added more fixed maturity securities to our investment portfolio with net purchases totaling $303 million for the first 3 months of the year. The pretax average yield of 4.25% for the fixed maturity portfolio was 24 basis points higher than a year ago. The average pretax yield for the total purchased taxable and tax-exempt bonds during the first quarter of 2023 was 6.18%. Valuation changes for our investment portfolio during the first quarter of 2023 were favorable in aggregate for both our stock and bond holdings. The overall net gain for the quarter was $269 million before tax effects. At the end of the quarter, total investment portfolio net appreciated value was approximately $5 billion. The equity portfolio was in a net gain position of $5.7 billion, while the fixed maturity portfolio was in a net loss position of $684 million. Cash flow continued to augment rising bond yields, helping to grow interest income. Cash flow from operating activities for the first 3 months of 2023 was $250 million, up 26% from a year ago. Regarding expense management, we intend to appropriately balance controlling expenses with making strategic investments in our business. The first quarter 2023 property casualty underwriting expense ratio was 1.7 percentage points lower than last year. Most of the decrease was from a small ratio for accrued profit-sharing commissions for agencies and related expenses. Moving on to loss reserves. We maintain a consistent approach that targets net amounts in the upper half of the actuarially estimated range of net loss and loss expense reserves. As we do each quarter, we consider new information such as paid losses and case reserves and then updated estimated ultimate losses and loss expenses by accident year and line of business. During the first quarter of 2023, our net increase in property casualty loss, loss expense reserves was $271 million, including $266 million for the IBNR portion. We experienced $59 million of property casualty net favorable reserve development on prior accident years that benefited the combined ratio by 3.2 percentage points. On an all-lines basis by accident year, net reserve development for the first 3 months of 2023, included favorable $44 million for 2022, unfavorable $2 million for 2021, favorable $34 million for 2020 and unfavorable $17 million in aggregate for accident years prior to 2020. We remain steadfast in how we approach capital management, and we repurchased shares that include maintenance intended to offset shares issued through equity compensation plans. We believe our financial flexibility is quite good and that we have excellent financial strength. During the first quarter of 2023, we repurchased nearly 202,000 shares at an average price per share of $123.84. As in the past, I'll conclude with a summary of the first quarter contributions to book value per share. They represent the main drivers of our value creation ratio. Property casualty underwriting decreased book value by $0.05. Life insurance operations increased book value $0.12. Investment income other than life insurance and net of noninsurance items headed $0.46. Net investment gains and losses for the fixed income portfolio increased book value by $0.81. Net investment gains and losses for the equity portfolio increased book value by $0.53, and we declared $0.75 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value increase of $1.12 per share during the first quarter to $68.33 per share. And now I'll turn the call back over to Steve.Steven Justus JohnstonThanks, Mike. Before we open the call for questions, I'd like to comment on some transitions within our Cincinnati Re team. Later in the first quarter, Managing Director and Head of Cincinnati Re, Jamie Hole, resigned to pursue other interests. We thank Jamie for his significant contributions to our reinsurance business and for his work in assembling a strong team of seasoned reinsurance professionals. We wish him well with his motor sports ambitions and with any other future endeavors. Phil Sandercox, who has led our Casualty Reinsurance division since 2016, is now leading Cincinnati Re. Phil has more than 35 years of reinsurance experience, including leadership roles with Aspen Re America and Gen Re. We are all confident in the future of Cincinnati Re under Phil's leadership and look forward to continuing to grow this aspect of our business over time. As a reminder, with Mike and me today, are Steve Spray, Steve Soloria, Mark Schambow and Theresa Hoffer. (inaudible), please open the call for questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Greg Peters from Raymond James.Charles Gregory PetersI'd like to begin -- I was going through your press release on Page 4, you talk about how the commercial lines average renewal pricing was near the high end of the mid-single-digit percent range. And then in the next sentence -- and you commented this in the prepared remarks, you talked about the 14% decrease in new business written by agencies. So it seems to be moving in 2 different directions, strong pricing or increasing pricing. And is it increased competition? Maybe you could give us a sense of why pricing is holding up, yet there's more competition for new business at least?Stephen Michael SprayYes, Greg, thanks, Steve Spray here. First of all, on that higher end of the mid-single-digit range, on average, I think the key to that for us as well, and I'd like to talk about it, is just the segmentation that we have in the book. So the average certainly doesn't tell the entire story. We're segmenting the book. We're getting more rate on those risks that we feel like we need more and then really focused on retaining those accounts that we feel we've got an adequate price on.Rates are still strong on the renewal book. And then to your question on new business, the field reps across the country, whose primary responsibility is to underwrite and price new commercial lines business, they have just executed precisely the way we have wanted them to. And it is around underwriting and pricing discipline. We've got the tools for them to use per risk to know how their pricing is on each one of those risks. And they've just been showing just great discipline on the pricing. So it's -- it is really around, I would say, price adequacy is where we're feeling the pressure and competition, I think, (inaudible).Charles Gregory PetersJust as a follow-up to that answer. Is there any geographic areas that are -- seem to be running a little hotter from a competition standpoint? Or is it just fairly broad-based?Stephen Michael SprayI would say there are areas that get hotter than others from time to time, Greg. And the way we look at the business is we still think insurance and commercial insurance is a local business. So we'll have local competitors or regional competitors in probably almost every state where we do business. Obviously, we compete with the nationals as well. But yes, there are different jurisdictions that will run hotter or colder than others or you'll see increased competition more so in a specific state than you will another. But it bounces around quite a bit, quite frankly.Charles Gregory PetersYes. I guess the second and other question I have is just like on the underlying margin in commercial. It seems like (inaudible) inflation running there. Just going over your statistics in the commercial casualty, property and auto. Can you talk about how you're feeling about your reserve position and the inflation trends? Have you altered your inflation assumption rates for '23 versus '22, et cetera?Steven Justus JohnstonGreg, this is Steve Johnston. And I think for your question, we still see inflation. We feel that we're in a good position in terms of, as Steve described, the -- and I described in the set presentation, the increases that we are getting in terms of keeping pace and exceeding our loss cost inflation. Keep in mind for us, it's always prospective. We're basically always trying to look at data that we have, forecast out what we think will be the loss costs in prospective policy periods and then do our best to charge premiums that cover those loss costs and provide our target profit returns. And we feel we're in a good position to do that. And also our underwriting, everybody on the team is chipping in on this in terms of underwriting. Steve mentioned the segmentation. Our book continues to shift to a mix that we feel is a mix that contains more of the policies with the high profit potential than the low profit potential. That's an ongoing effort that we have, and we feel very optimistic about our future prospects.OperatorOur next question comes from Mike Zaremski from BMO.Michael David ZaremskiI guess first question on -- stick with commercial lines and kind of talk about pricing versus exposure. So I feel like you and others have talked about updating replacement costs, which I believe is more on the property side to reflect the inflationary levels of inflation to per square foot to replace things. And am I correct that runs through exposure and not through pricing? And if so, kind of is there any numbers you can put around where you are in terms of getting your exposure levels to kind of be in line with the updated replacement costs? And is that also -- is this phenomenon also driving up pure pricing exposure too?Stephen Michael SprayMike, again, Steve Spray. Great point. And yes, for quite a few quarters now, we have continued to -- quite frankly, we're always taking increases in the exposure on the property side and on the casualty side for that matter, you have wage inflation, you have increased sales on casualty. But on the property, we always are taking inflationary increases on property values. And as those have obviously increased or been persistent, we've increased those percentages. As far as a breakdown between net rate and exposure change on commercial property, I would say it's about 50-50 for the first quarter -- I'll just speak to the first quarter of '23. But it's about half and half rate and exposure. And I know you're not asking this right on that specific question, but you have the same phenomenon in homeowner as you do commercial property.Michael David ZaremskiGot it. And so then back to the previous question, Greg, then the -- if we think about your pricing and premium growth, it would -- is it -- the premium growth decelerated a lot. Is -- was there -- is it just there were some tough comps? Or are you kind of -- are there like some types of maybe corrective actions being taken to get the combined ratio down to lower levels? And then I know my next question is on the catastrophe load. So I don't know if that delves into that, too.Stephen Michael SprayYes. I think -- this is Steve Spray again. Steve Johnston may want to weigh in here as well. I do think, yes, it is -- it's pricing and underwriting discipline that is showing up. Our retentions remain strong. The mix of business can change a bit that can affect that. Obviously, the new business being under a bit of pressure from our underwriting action and our pricing. If you would note in the last several quarters, we've had some increased loss experience in umbrella. We're taking corrective action as an example, on our umbrella line of book, reducing capacity, increasing pricing, that's putting pressure on the umbrella policy retention. So it's a multitude of things. It's a great question, but there's a lot of moving parts there, as you pointed out.Michael David ZaremskiOkay. Great. And my final question was just, is it fair for us -- and I appreciate, right, one of the reasons (inaudible) protect against catastrophe losses, and so it's just inherently going to be volatile. But the catastrophe levels, it feels like it's been a bit of a trend higher than expected, if I think over the last decade-plus. So is it fair for us in our models to just look at an average of -- catastrophe losses by segment over -- we can do -- we can go back 15 years or so? Is that the way you guys think about it? I know there's just -- there's changing dynamics, too, with higher reinsurance costs, too, which some companies have kind of told us -- I know there's still ongoing negotiations, but they've kind of hinted at we might be retaining more, which you guys gave some disclosure to, which could also increase the catastrophe load level. So any thoughts on whether -- also kind of thinking that maybe catastrophe levels are expected to be a bit higher on a forward basis?Steven Justus JohnstonThis is Steve Johnston. And Mike, the way we go about it, and we don't give guidance on the cats as we do a combination of looking at our past experience, the way you described it, but also using our models, the catastrophe models in terms of building the loads that we have in. And there is just volatility across time. I think one of the make-ups of our business that might be different is that we have more exposure to severe convective storm, which has a higher frequency but lower severity distribution. And we have just seen more of that type of loss, particularly here in the first quarter but over a period of time. So we focus on the overall and realizing we're going to have losses, whether they be cats or they're in the ex-cat bucket and focus on making sure that we can keep that combined ratio to our target level. And I think we've been successful with it now with 11 years in a row with a combined ratio under 100. And so we'll continue to take action to help mitigate the catastrophe losses in our underwriting and selection and so forth. I would say since we did increase the retention on our cat program and talked about that in the last call, that would not have an impact on the cats that occurred in the first quarter of this year. They were all under $100 million, which was our retention prior to our change.OperatorOur next question comes from Paul Newsome from Piper Sandler.Jon Paul NewsomeI was hoping, first, you could maybe dumb down for me the IBNR increase in the quarter and where are the pieces of that added conservativeness is coming from and just how we should -- maybe just a little bit more of how you think we should interpret that piece in particular?Michael James SewellPaul, this is Mike Sewell. Let me -- I'll make a brief comment and then whether or not anyone else wants to add on to that. But for the IBNR for the quarter, we do lay that out really nicely, I think on Page 10 in the supplement. And so you obviously know that you can see from there that, through March, we added $209 million of net loss IBNR, and that compared to an increase of $52 million through the same quarter of last year. The largest increase of that IBNR in the first quarter was related to the commercial casualty, which was about $101 million. We did add $50 million of IBNR between CGU and Cinci Re. We added some on the E&amp;S, $26 million there; and then also commercial auto, $24 million; and homeowner, $21 million. Part of the $209 million in total that was added, there was a $19 million decrease in IBNR related to catastrophes. So we had some favorable development in there. But of course, IBNR is only one ingredient to the entire loss combined ratio, et cetera. So -- but that's kind of a summary. And maybe, Steve, if you got anything else.Steven Justus JohnstonYes, excellent coverage by Mike there. And I thought I would also maybe talk a little bit about more -- maybe a little more detail on the comment I made in my fixed talk about the current accident year quarter having an improvement on a case-incurred basis. And when we speak case incurred, and I think it's pretty common for the industry, it would be the paid losses plus the case reserve. And that's where we saw -- when we look at those 2 elements, a 6.7 percentage point improvement over the first quarter a year ago. However, we did add IBNR of 9.2% loss ratio points. So we think it's a good point to make and that we see the improvement in the underlying case incurred ratio. But prudent as we always are with reserves as the -- we recognize that the first accident quarter is very green. We did add a pretty substantial amount of IBNR. And so I think it gives us a good position and that we're seeing improvement in the paid -- in the case, yet we're still being true to our prudent reserving and the strong balance sheet that we always advocate. And actually, while it wasn't in the script, the same would hold for our first quarter calendar year loss ratio improvement in the paid, improvement in the changing case. And we added about 10.5 points of IBNR. And so in total, it was up 1.7%. But just kind of decomposing that total loss ratio into paid case IBNR and comparing it to the quarter prior. Just to give a little more color on that.Jon Paul NewsomeThat's great. And I apologize if I was just a little slow. Separate question. I think on the last earnings conference call, you folks mentioned that you thought that the company was capable this year of getting sort of mid- to low 90s combined ratio. Maybe you could square those comments with what happened in the actual results in the first quarter. And should we think about the remainder of the year differently, given what happened in the fourth quarter? Just to kind of maybe square those comments with what happened and how we should think about it prospectively?Steven Justus JohnstonSure, Paul. And you're never slow on anything. You always are on top of things. We still feel confident in the same guidance that we gave. The last time, I think catastrophe losses are a little higher than we would have probably anticipated for our first quarter, but we still have 3 quarters to go. And with all the positives we see happening in terms of pricing, segmentation, underwriting, loss control, the whole team effort that we're putting forth, we still stand by the same guidance.OperatorWe now have a question from Meyer Shields from KBW.Meyer ShieldsFirst question, I guess, it seems like at 1/1, there was no shortage of well-priced property premium reinsurance premium available for anyone that wanted it. And we didn't see or we saw the decline in reinsurance premiums, I don't know breakdown between property and other lines. So I was hoping you could sort of describe your current appetite for -- specifically for cat reinsurance business.Steven Justus JohnstonYes. Excellent question. The net written premium for Cinci Re was down. I think it was due to intentional action that we took in a couple of areas. One, we were assuming business retrocessional business. And as part of a re-underwriting effort or looking at the Cincinnati Re book, we didn't feel that we wanted to do that anymore. And so we exited doing property retrocession assuming. And that premium decrease really represented all of the decrease in the Cincinnati Re premium for the quarter as a result of no longer doing property retrocession reinsurance. We also -- as we look at each contract quantitatively, qualitatively and look at the risk reward, felt that we were best served to go higher as other companies increase their retention the way we did, those that we were reinsuring that we're doing the same. We stayed with those at better rates, better terms and conditions, I'd say, on that property part, strong double-digit increases. And so with the reinsurance business, it's profit first, and we are looking at every avenue of growing and growing profitably. This quarter, we thought we needed to take some action there with the retrocessions. But we are very confident on a go-forward basis of continued growth as you kind of suggest in your question, it's out there. We have a talented, very talented team that is well positioned to take advantage of the opportunities.Meyer ShieldsOkay. That's helpful. I really appreciate the clarification. Second question, this is more of a process question. We're hearing a lot of discussion of (inaudible) E&amp;S market. And I was wondering, within Cincinnati, is there like an official capability to transfer that program from your admitted segments to E&amp;S?Stephen Michael SpraySteve Spray. With E&amp;S business, the -- I guess the official process is, every state is a little different. When you have an account that's admitted, you need to typically get a certain number of admitted market declinations before you can export that to the non-admitted market. And so I think to answer your question, if I don't hit it, follow up on that with me, but to just move something from our admitted market into non-admitted, you cannot do that. You need to get the -- you need to follow the -- what they call a diligent search to do that. That being said, -- we are -- our E&amp;S business CSU is about 90% casualty. We are writing an increased amount of homeowner business on an excess of surplus basis. And I think we're doing an excellent job providing our agents and the policyholders in their communities with alternatives and with capacity in areas that are maybe a little more just -- they're prone to E&amp;S solution. And I think we've been able to be very nimble, very flexible and really step-up for our agents and on E&amp;S on all fronts. So hopefully, that answers your question.Meyer ShieldsIt does, very thoroughly. And then one final question. And -- it's going to sound like nitpicking, so I apologize in advance. But Steve, in your introductory comments, you talked about uncertainty over loss trends. And I guess I was wondering whether it's actual uncertainty or whether we're seeing practically speaking, in casualty lines like real signs of loss trends, just maybe the word uncertainty surprised me.Steven Justus JohnstonYes. I think uncertainty had to do with when you're making trends coming out of pandemic and the time period that you look at, when you look at increasing inflation in different areas and how it's evolving, social inflation, I think economic conditions in terms of what one might expect in terms of a possible recession, just all the various different things of uncertainty that go into it. It was more of a, I think, a general statement, Meyer.Meyer ShieldsOkay. Thank you for your patience and clarifications.Steven Justus JohnstonNo, that's -- it's a good question. Thank you.OperatorOur next question comes from Mark Dwelle from RBC.Mark Alan DwelleI think what I want to try to do is just knit together some of the things that we've been talking about already this morning. In the 10-K -- hello?Steven Justus JohnstonWe're here. We're here. Can you hear us?Mark Alan DwelleYes, I was getting some echo. In the 10-Q, there's a comment with respect to the commercial umbrella that kind of add -- it suggested that it added about 1 point to the Commercial Lines combined ratio in the quarter. It also suggested in the same subsequent paragraph that there was a substantial IBNR add. And then I think you said in your opening remarks that you're kind of pleased with the fact that, that line had become profitable this quarter after -- that was a line that had been difficult over the last several quarters and certainly gave rise to some reserve adds earlier last year. So I guess what I wanted to try to ask is maybe using that particular line as a lens, what are you trying to communicate there? Is this a line that you like or a line that is rehabilitating? I guess I feel like there's a lot of different noise going on and the different things that you're trying to communicate there.Steven Justus JohnstonYes. I guess cutting right to the chase, it is a line that we like. It is a line that we saw a challenge last year. It is a line where we've taken corrective action on multiple fronts, and we see it in an improving fashion now, and it did produce a small underwriting profit for the first quarter that we were happy to see. And so I think the most important point is it's been a line of business that has been good to us for decades in terms of growth and profitability, and we think it will in the future and that it has needed a little bit more attention here of late and that we've given it that attention.Mark Alan DwelleAnd then -- and so the drag that it's producing on the overall combined ratio, is that exclusively the result of the IBNR add? Or is that just reflective of the fact of where it is in its, I'll call it, rehabilitation cycle that it had been a bigger drag, and now it is a smaller drag even with an IBNR add?Steven Justus JohnstonThat's right. And it is, I think, comparing to our ex cat combined ratio when we talk about the deterioration.Mark Alan DwelleRight. Of course. Okay. Yes. And I think you had commented earlier about some of the pricing action. Can you give a general idea of where -- I know the overall growth in the line was about 10% on the premium but what -- where the range of pricing improvement on that is?Stephen Michael SprayYes. Yes. Mark, I would say that the -- that's almost exclusively price in that 10%.Mark Alan DwelleSo really not. So the exposure is probably flat to even maybe declining a little bit, and the rate is really everything that's happening there?Stephen Michael SprayThat's correct.Mark Alan DwelleGot it. Okay. The second thing, again, this is building on a question you just answered for Meyer. I just wanted to make sure I kind of got that right. As far as the decline in premium in the reinsurance unit, it sounds like it's ultimately sort of 2 things: one being that you've exited some portion of the retro, the property retro market. And the second is that you're higher in the tower. So accordingly, you're getting less premium. And accordingly, in theory, should be taking more distant exposure, all else equal. So if I reach the right conclusion on that, you have net reduced your overall cat and property exposure as a result of the underwriting actions you're taking there?Steven Justus JohnstonThat's exactly right. And Mark, probably well -- better stated than I did.Mark Alan DwelleI had the advantage of being able to listen to the answer first. All right. And then one more question that I wanted to talk about, and this is on the personal lines side. And it's also going to be a catastrophe-related kind of question. So you had 30 points of current period cat exposure. In my recollection, that's among the highest ever for that segment of the business. As you think about the 30 points that you had, and we know that there is a certain number of events in the quarter, when I think about that number, should -- is that a product of the particular geographies that were impacted? Was it a product of the changes that you've made and where your reinsurance attaches and how that coverage operates? Or is it a change in the fact that you're writing a lot more high net worth homeowners and accordingly, pound for pound, if the tornado hits a $1 million house, that's a bigger impact than if it hits a $500,000 house. Which of those pieces, I guess, dominate as far as why that number was quite as large as it was?Steven Justus JohnstonYes. I would say, first off, I wanted to clarify that it didn't have to do with us buying less reinsurance, and that -- for those that occurred in the first quarter, each of them were under $100 million, which was our retention in 2022. So our raising our retention did not impact that any. I think that it was just widespread. I think that for the third quarter in a row, we had one that happened on virtually the last day of the quarter, which makes it a little bit tougher to estimate in the time frames we have to estimate them, which leads to a little bit of uncertainty, still saying we made our best estimate, and our claims people do a great job of being out there and on the spot and making estimates, but it was just a widespread quarter where there were a lot of catastrophes that affected us.Mark Alan DwelleOkay. So if I'm hearing you right on that, it's sort of a frequency plus maybe a little extra scoop of conservatism just because it was right at the end of the quarter?Steven Justus JohnstonCertainly on the frequency, I'm hoping that way on the extra scoop, but we do get with our best estimate, and we'll have to wait and see how that 1 plays out. I might have tipped my hand a little bit to my personal thoughts on that.OperatorThank you. And our next question comes from Grace Carter from Bank of America.Grace Helen CarterSo new business written has been pretty strong in personal lines for the past several quarters. I was just wondering how that's trended relative to expectations as you've ramped up rate increases and how you see that progressing over the course of the year as you continue to do so? And if there's just any differences you're expecting this pricing cycle versus previous periods where you've needed higher rate just given the increased tilt towards high net worth business?Stephen Michael SprayGrace, Steve Spray. Great question. I think a lot of the growth that you're seeing in personal lines is our continued growth in the high net worth area. I would also add that we're now about -- as a company, we're about 50% high net worth or private client and 50% middle market. And we think that gives us an advantage in the marketplace for our agents. And over the last several years, personal lines was taking necessary corrective action, primarily in the middle market space, pretty tough action in some specific states. And that put a lot of pressure on growth over time. And we think we've got that turned. And so that now bottoming out and coming back up has helped us with growth in personal lines. I would also add that we have continued to improve in pricing sophistication in personal lines. That's contributing there as well. I might add that -- and Steve mentioned it in his script, of what we're doing with rate increases. And as those continue to come in to the written premium, and then also as over a longer period of time as they continue to earn, I would expect that it's going to put some pressure on our new business growth.Grace Helen CarterAnd just one more quick question. Is there anything worth calling out from the recent reforms in Florida in the results this quarter?Stephen Michael SprayAgain, Grace, this is Steve Spray. I would say that -- we look at the changes in Florida, just on the surface, it's very positive. We think it's a move in the right direction. But I think it is far too early to tell how that's going to play out. But we think it's promising, something we're going to watch very closely, but probably too early to draw any conclusions.Operator(Operator Instructions) Our next question is coming from Mike Zaremski with a follow-up at BMO.Michael David Zaremski(inaudible) I guess you gave us some good color on the paid loss ratios improving a bit, which we can also do the math ourselves. I guess (inaudible) commercial umbrella which popped up last year, which you guys haven't specifically mentioned it. Is -- do you feel that the trends you're seeing are normalizing commercial auto for the industry too and for everyone seems to be kind of getting worse again with social inflation potentially? Or maybe it's just (inaudible) severity side? So just kind of curious as pricing is moving in the right direction. It seems like the paid loss ratio moving in the right direction. But do you -- maybe you could touch on commercial auto and umbrella. And do you feel like industry-wide pricing is moving in the right direction because loss costs are also kind of moving a bit higher?Steven Justus JohnstonYes. It's Steve Johnston. Good question, Mike. I do think that we're taking the appropriate action. I do think that we're seeing a little bit more of a normalization of the trends in umbrella. However, I want to be cautionary in that it's still, for us, volume-wise, it's a low frequency, high severity line for us. So it is going to have noise from time to time. And that makes the trends a little bit harder. But I do think that we're seeing the action that we're taking, both on the pricing and underwriting side, having a positive effect. And I would say, basically, the same thing for commercial auto. It's an area where we've paid good attention to over a long period of time, and I think we're on the right track and feel optimistic about it.Michael David ZaremskiOkay. That's helpful. And maybe the last follow-up, just because Cinci has best-in-class disclosure on the property side, both on commercial and personal lines. Is it fair to look at a ratio excluding large losses and then looking at the accident year that way? Because if you do that, the accident loss ratio is up on the property lines. Any thoughts there?Steven Justus JohnstonYes. I think -- and thank you for the compliment on the transparency and the disclosure. I think what we like to do is lay it out there with as much detail for you so that different people, different analysts have different ways that they go about making their forecast. And so if you want to do something ex cat, ex large loss and then build in kind of a long-term provision for both or you want to do it just ex cat and building a long-term provision for ex cat, you can do it that way. So we just basically try to lay out as much detail as we can for you, be as transparent as possible and give you as much information as we can so that you can do your jobs well.Michael David ZaremskiAnd so if we do that, the underlying ratios in property have been getting (inaudible). Is that why there's corrective actions being taken and pricing is moving higher? And is that a fair way of looking at things and why you're getting more exposure to reprice on the replacement costs? So just trying to see if that's -- that ratio is okay for us to look at as a -- the trend still looks like it's not improving at this point.Steven Justus JohnstonYes. No. We have been taking the rate in property and corrective action in property for some time. We do our rate indications. In terms of where we're getting the rate, we feel comfortable as we do our forecast on the property line. We're getting solid rate increases, a solid increase in terms of the exposures, as Steve mentioned earlier, really looking at our underwriting as well, improving on our technology and just really addressing it on all fronts. And we feel pretty good about the way we're going.OperatorAnd this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Johnston, for any closing remarks.Steven Justus JohnstonThank you, (inaudible), and thanks to all of you for joining us today. We hope to see some of you at our Annual Meeting of Shareholders on Saturday, May 6, at the Cincinnati Art Museum. You're also welcome to listen to our webcast of the meeting available at cinfin.com/investors. And we look forward to speaking with you again on our second quarter call.

But if you choose individual stocks with prowess, you can make superior returns. For example, the Cincinnati Financial Corporation (NASDAQ:CINF) share price is up 57% in the last three years, clearly besting the market return of around 38% (not including dividends).While this past week has detracted from the company's three-year return, let's look at the recent trends of the underlying business and see if the gains have been in alignment. See our latest analysis for Cincinnati Financial To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Over the last three years, Cincinnati Financial failed to grow earnings per share, which fell 13% (annualized).Thus, it seems unlikely that the market is focussed on EPS growth at the moment. Since the change in EPS doesn't seem to correlate with the change in share price, it's worth taking a look at other metrics.Do you think that shareholders are buying for the 2.3% per annum revenue growth trend? We don't. So truth be told we can't see an easy explanation for the share price action, but perhaps you can...The graphic below depicts how earnings and revenue have changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-and-revenue-growthWe like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. If you are thinking of buying or selling Cincinnati Financial stock, you should check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of Cincinnati Financial, it has a TSR of 70% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe regret to report that Cincinnati Financial shareholders are down 22% for the year (even including dividends). Unfortunately, that's worse than the broader market decline of 4.1%. However, it could simply be that the share price has been impacted by broader market jitters. It might be worth keeping an eye on the fundamentals, in case there's a good opportunity. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 11%, each year, over five years. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

342,70acef8d-8c3e-369d-9d1d-b591d6ddbc65,PG,2023-04-29,FedEx and Charles Schwab have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fedex-charles-schwab-highlighted-zacks-121612473.html,1682684172,STORY,"['FDX', 'SCHW', '^GSPC', 'KMB', 'PG', 'PEP']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – April 28, 2023 – Zacks Equity Research shares FedEx Corporation FDX as the Bull of the Day and Charles Schwab SCHW as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on PepsiCo PEP, Kimberly-Clark KMB and Procter &amp; Gamble PG.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks.Bull of the Day:Company OverviewMemphis-based Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) FedEx Corporation is the leader in global express delivery services. Since 1971, it has been providing transportation, e-commerce, and business services for its customers. Three main segments drive FedEx: FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, and FedEx Freight.FedEx Express: Offers time definite delivery to more than 220 countries and territories.FedEx Ground: A low-cost, day-certain service to any business address in the United States and Canada.FedEx Freight: Offers less-than-truckload (LTL) freight services in the United StatesA Straightforward Bull CaseThe meteoric rise of e-commerce in the United States and worldwide presents significant opportunities for freight companies to grow and expand their business. Beyond traditional delivery, e-commerce consumers demand more efficient and innovative delivery solutions, producing more potential revenue.Industry TailwindsZack’s in-house studies have shown that the top 50% of industry groups tend to outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of two to one. The Transportation – Air Freight and Cargo group meets the threshold by a long shot. The group is ranked in the top 9% of all industries tracked by Zacks and has drastically outperformed the S&amp;P 500 Index over the past three years.FundamentalsDespite a recent earnings slowdown, FDX has delivered positive surprises on earnings for two quarters running. Though earnings growth slowed last quarter, investors must look to the future. Analysts have earnings per share soaring to new highs within the next two years.The Total PackageBeyond strong industry tailwinds and a larger total addressable market, FedEx management is intent on rewarding shareholders through dividend payouts. In April, FDX raised its dividend by 10% to $1.26 per share or $5.05 annually. The company also raised its full-year outlook based on its cost savings plan, saying, “We are pleased with the company’s efforts to reward its shareholders even in these difficult times.”Story continuesTechnical ViewOne of the most impressive traits of FedEx is its stable yet robust technical performance. FDX has a beta of 1.01, meaning it’s a very tame stock, and its volatility is in line with that of the S&amp;P 500. Despite the low beta, year-to-date, the stock has returned 30% versus 6% in the S&amp;P. Furthermore, the share price is pulling back to the 50-day moving average – an area the stock has found support at for months.TakeawayOverall, the rise of e-commerce presents significant opportunities for freight companies like FDX to improve their profitability, increase their market share, and enhance their competitiveness. Furthermore, FDX’s drive to reward shareholders through dividends and cost savings should drive the stock higher in 2023.Bear of the Day:Company OverviewZacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stock Charles Schwab is a financial services company that offers a broad range of investment and wealth management services. The company was founded in 1971 and is headquartered in San Francisco, California.Schwab’s investment services include trading and investing in stocks, bonds, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), options, futures, and more.Toxic Combo: Rising Costs + A Regional Banking CrisisPrior to 2023, a rising interest rate environment was mostly viewed as a positive for the banking sector. However, the unusually rapid hikes from unprecedented, near-zero interest rates caused mayhem in the regional banking sector – leading to the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB).At the root of SVB’s collapse was a large amount of bank deposits in the long-term U.S. treasuries and mortgage-backed securities (assets that typically fall when interest rates rise). As word spread of SVB’s liquidity crisis and investment issues, depositors began to panic, leading to a classic bank run.Though Schwab is not a regional bank, rumors and fears are leading to real world issues for the bank. According to Bloomberg, Schwab is “facing dwindling deposits.” As if that wasn’t enough, Schwab’s costs are rising rapidly and have been doing so for years. In fact, between 2016-2022 expenses rose at a compound annual growth rate of more than 15%.Industry WoesOur studies show that stocks within the bottom half of the Zacks industry group list tend to underperform dramatically. By now, it is no secret that the banking sector is underperforming. The Zack’s Financial Investment Banking Industry is in the bottom 13% of all industries tracked by Zacks.Bearish Price and Volume ActionSchwab is dramatically underperforming the S&amp;P 500 Index. Year-to-date SCHW is down 37.9%, while the S&amp;P is up 6.1%. Furthermore, a few weeks ago, Schwab’s CEO tried to inject life into the stock by purchasing one million dollars’ worth of stock. Since then, the stock has barely budged and is setting up in a bearish chart pattern.TakeawayBetween rising costs and dwindling deposits, Charles Schwab is stuck between a rock and a hard place. Expect volatility on both sides of the tape and avoid the stock at this juncture.Additional content:3 Companies That Recently Raised GuidanceThere have been several pockets of strength during earnings season so far, particularly in the Consumer Staples sector. We’ve seen many companies in the realm come out and post better-than-expected results, with pricing power leading the way.In fact, several companies – PepsiCo, Kimberly-Clark and Procter &amp; Gamble – have raised guidance following better-than-expected quarterly results, causing buyers to swarm as of late.As we can see, all three have displayed relative strength over the period, outperforming the market handily. Let’s take a deeper dive into each company’s current standing.PepsiCoPepsiCo reported earnings of $1.50 per share, handily exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by nearly 10%. Quarterly revenue totaled $17.8 billion, above expectations and improving 10% from the year-ago quarter.Investors cheered on the results, with PEP shares closing 2.5% higher post-earnings. The company’s shares have regularly gotten a boost following quarterly releases.Regarding the strong results, CEO Ramon Laguarta said, “We are very pleased with our performance and business momentum as our categories and geographies remained resilient during the first quarter. Given our strong start to the year, we now expect our full-year 2023 organic revenue to increase 8 percent (previously 6 percent) and core constant currency EPS to increase 9 percent (previously 8 percent).”And consistent with its previous guidance for FY23, PepsiCo expects total cash returns to shareholders to total roughly $7.7 billion, consisting of $6.7 billion in dividends and share repurchases of $1 billion.Kimberly-ClarkKimberly-Clark also posted a double-beat, exceeding earnings expectations by nearly 25%. Top line results were also solid, with the company generating $5.2 billion in revenue and improving modestly from the year-ago quarter.In addition, KMB’s gross margin increased 340 basis points year-over-year, primarily driven by favorable net revenue realization amid increased prices. Cash generated from operations totaled $613 million, reflecting a sizable jump from the year-ago value of $204 million.KMB shares saw a nice reaction from the market post-earnings, closing 1.5% higher. The market has had somewhat-mixed reactions following quarterly releases from Kimberly-Clark.The company raised its FY23 EPS guidance, now expecting 6% - 10% growth compared to FY22 and up from prior views of 2% - 6%. In addition, KMB increased its operating profit outlook to low double digits, again up from the previous mid to high single digits expected.Procter &amp; GambleLike the companies above, Procter &amp; Gamble posted better-than-expected results, exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by 3.8% and delivering a positive 4% revenue surprise. Earnings improved 3% year-over-year, whereas revenue saw growth of 4%.Impressively, PG’s recently declared dividend increase reflects the 67th consecutive year that the company has increased its dividend. The company returned more than $2.2 billion in dividends to shareholders throughout the quarter.Procter &amp; Gamble raised its FY23 all-in revenue guidance, now expecting growth of 1% compared to FY22, up from a prior guidance range of down -1% to flat year-over-year.  In addition, PG raised its organic revenue growth guidance for FY23, expecting growth of 6% compared to prior expectations of 4% – 5%.Bottom LineStocks in the Zacks Consumer Staples sector carry a defensive nature, as these companies’ products have an advantageous ability to generate consistent demand in the face of many economic situations.And as seen by the quarterly results from all three companies above, consumers have had little issue forking up extra cash for their products.In addition to uplifting guidance, all three companies currently sport a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), indicating bullish sentiment among analysts.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

Dan?Story continuesDaniel Joseph HoustonThanks, Humphrey, and welcome to everyone on the call. This morning, I will share highlights of our financial results and key performance highlights for the quarter. Deanna will follow with additional details on our first quarter results, our current financial and capital position as well as some details on our investment portfolio. Our integrated business model remains resilient during periods of macroeconomic volatility, as shown on our strong first quarter results. While we are not immune to credit and market pressures, we are well positioned for a variety of economic conditions. Starting on Slide 3, we reported $367 million of non-GAAP operating earnings or $1.48 per diluted share in the first quarter. We returned more than $300 million of capital to shareholders during the quarter through share repurchase and common stock dividends. We are delivering on our capital deployment strategy by investing for growth in our business, and returning excess capital to shareholders. We ended the quarter with $660 billion of total company managed AUM, an increase of 4% from year-end 2022, reflecting favorable equity and fixed income markets, positive net cash flow as well as positive impacts from foreign currency. We generated $600 million of positive total company net cash flow, a strong result during a period of outflows across much of the industry. This highlights one of the benefits of having a diversified and integrated business model across the asset management, retirement and benefits and protection. Turning to investment performance on Slide 4. Market volatility is underscoring the value of our diversified offering. Our fixed income strategies are delivering strong results, managing through a challenging credit environment. While our asset allocation in U.S. equity strategies have been impacted in their short-term performance, our international equity strategies are delivering strong alpha so far this year, boosting 1-year performance. Our approach to invest in high-quality, high-growth companies continues to resonate with our clients, winning additional mandates. We have also received gold and silver ratings from Morningstar for several of our key equity funds. Turning to Slide 5, I'd like to spend a moment on our investment portfolio as there has recently been increased market focus on credit and commercial real estate exposures. We're confident in our high-quality, diversified investment portfolio, which is well aligned with our liability profile. We actively manage our investment risk and have been intentional about further improving credit quality of our portfolio since the global financial crisis. The reinsurance transaction we completed in 2022 decreased our general account by 25%. This reduced our credit exposure and lowered our investment asset leverage well below the industry average. We are a global real estate leader with more than 7 decades of experience, managing nearly $100 billion of assets, including more than $70 billion for third parties. Today, we have over 300 real estate investment professionals, 55 of which have more than 3 decades of real estate experience through many different market cycles. Over the last decade, we have reduced office exposure in our commercial mortgage portfolio as we saw signs of stress coming in this segment, a move which has proven to be appropriate as the recent stress on the banking sector has raised financing concern for office properties in particular. We've also enhanced our underwriting standards since the global financial crisis, producing a high-quality portfolio with substantial cushion to withstand severe downturns. Our investment and risk management teams have been diligent in transforming the portfolio, delivering a track record of strong financial performance and positioning us to weather a variety of economic conditions and market cycles. Turning to our growth drivers and some additional highlights for the quarter. We continue to benefit from strong employment and wage growth in the U.S. particularly in the small to midsize segment with our retirement Benefits and Protection business. In retirement, we generated strong sales across all segments, growth in net participant activity and positive net cash flow with reoccurring deposits up 11% on a trailing 12-month basis. While large market sales and lapses can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, we have good momentum, and our pipeline is strong for the rest of the year. Our SMB segment is holding up very well with strong reoccurring deposit growth, and low contract lapses contributing to a 33% increase and net cash flow compared to the first quarter of 2022. And in Benefits and Protection, our focus on the durable small to midsized business market continues to drive growth. Over the last 12 months, the small to midsized employer market has experienced record sales, strong retention and demonstrated continued strong employment growth, all of which are contributing to our above-industry growth in premium and fees for Specialty Benefits. In Asset Management, our broad distribution and geographic footprint continues to produce benefits. PGI-managed net cash flow was a positive $400 million in the first quarter. While flows for many active managers were negative in the quarter, we continue to benefit from our integrated business model and differentiated investment capabilities, including hybrid target date, stable value and guaranteed income products. We are winning business from both new and existing retirement customers while generating flows from our general account. As we look forward, we continue to see active engagement with global institutional clients involving investment strategies in private debt and credit, specialized investment income capabilities and opportunistic investing in real estate. We also drove strong quarterly net cash flow of $800 million in Principal International. These flows were well diversified across Southeast Asia, Brazil, Mexico and Hong Kong as we continue to execute on our strategy, building upon our market leadership and key joint venture relationships. Specific to Brazil, we remain a market leader in pension AUM, deposits as well as net cash flow. Bottom line, we are very excited about the growth opportunities which lie ahead. I'm confident we have the right product mix, the right market focus and the right distribution channels to drive value for our customers and our shareholders. Deanna?Deanna Dawnette Strable-SoethoutThanks, Dan. Good morning to everyone on the call. This morning, I will share key contributors to financial performance for the quarter, an update on our current financial and capital position and details of our investment portfolio. Reported net income attributable to Principal was a negative $140 million in the first quarter. Excluding the loss from exited businesses, net income was a positive $347 million with $11 million of credit losses. Credit drift was slightly positive in the quarter. Excluding significant variances, first quarter non-GAAP operating earnings were $395 million or $1.60 per diluted share, a strong result despite macroeconomic pressures on AUM levels during 2022. As Dan noted, first quarter results highlight the value of focus and the strength and resiliency of our diversified business strategy. As detailed on Slide 17, significant variances had a net negative impact on our first quarter non-GAAP operating earnings of approximately $33 million pretax, $29 million after tax and $0.12 per diluted share. The significant variances were primarily due to lower-than-expected variable investment income in RIS and Benefits and Protection. Mortality experience true-ups in RIS were mostly offset by LDTI model refinements in Specialty Benefits. As discussed during our 2023 outlook call, we expected variable investment income from alternative investment returns, real estate sales and prepayment fees to be lower than 2022 levels and lower than our expected long-term run rate due to macro environment heading into the year. VII was positive in total for the quarter, but we did not have any VII from prepayment fees or real estate sales. Macroeconomic volatility continued in the first quarter and pressured earnings in our fee-based businesses relative to a year ago quarter. While the S&amp;P 500 daily average increased 4% from the fourth quarter of 2022, it was 11% lower than the first quarter of 2022 and 10% lower on a trailing 12-month basis. Foreign exchange rates were a tailwind compared to the fourth quarter but a headwind relative to the year ago quarter and on a trailing 12-month basis. Impacts to reported pretax operating earnings included a positive $7 million compared to fourth quarter of 2022, a slight negative compared to first quarter 2022 and a negative $17 million on a trailing 12-month basis. Turning to the business units. The following comments on our first quarter results exclude significant variances. As a reminder, comparisons to first quarter of 2022 are impacted by the reinsurance transactions that closed in the second quarter of 2022. Revenue growth and margins in Specialty Benefits and Principal International were in line with our expectations in the first quarter. Revenue growth in RIS and PGI were pressured by the impacts of macroeconomic volatility and lower account values and AUM compared to a year ago but both businesses are benefiting from more favorable conditions relative to the assumptions in our 2023 outlook. Despite the pressures on revenue growth, the margin in RIS was strong in the first quarter and benefited from diligent expense management, onetime items in the quarter and timing of expenses. For the full year, we continue to expect to be within the 35% to 39% guided range with the ultimate level impacted by macro conditions for the remainder of the year. PGI's margin and pretax operating earnings were pressured by expected expense seasonality as well as expected lower transaction and borrower fees. Expenses in the first quarter were elevated by approximately $20 million due to seasonality of payroll taxes and deferred compensation. We continue to expect PGI's margin to be within the 34% to 37% guided range for the full year. Principal International had strong earnings in the first quarter driven by growth across the business and higher AUM. Favorable impacts of inflation and higher interest rates in Brazil were offset by lower-than-expected encaje performance and VII in Chile. In life, pretax operating earnings and margin were lower than expected, primarily due to higher claims experience in the quarter. The decline in premium and fees was driven by the 2022 reinsurance transaction and will normalize throughout the year. We continue to expect to deliver on our 2023 guidance for the full year, both at the business unit level as well as for the total company. Turning to capital and liquidity. We remain in a strong financial position despite the volatile environment. We ended the first quarter with $1.8 billion of excess and available capital including more than $1.5 billion at the holding company. This includes our $800 million target and $700 million of proceeds from debt issuance in the first quarter that is earmarked for debt maturity and redemption in the second quarter, $300 million in our subsidiaries and $30 million in excess of our targeted 400% risk-based capital ratio. During the quarter, in addition to returning excess capital to shareholders, we accelerated our organic capital deployment as we saw attractive return opportunities in our businesses. This was a pull forward of our business plan for 2023. Looking ahead, our free capital flow generation will increase throughout the year. We returned $306 million to shareholders in the first quarter, including $150 million of share repurchases and $156 million of common stock dividends. Last night, we announced a $0.64 common stock dividend payable in the second quarter, in line with our targeted 40% dividend payout ratio. We remain focused on maintaining our capital and liquidity targets at both the life company and the holding company, and we'll continue pursuing a balanced and disciplined approach to capital deployment. I want to end my comments by providing some additional details of our investment portfolio, including our real estate exposure. As Dan mentioned, we have intentionally improved the overall credit quality across our fixed maturity and real estate portfolios since the global financial crisis. Our investments are high quality, well aligned with our liability profile, and we are well positioned for a variety of economic conditions. Starting on Slide 11. Specific to the real estate portfolio. As of the end of the first quarter, our commercial loan portfolio has a current average loan-to-value of 46% and a debt service coverage of 2.5x. This has improved from 62% and 1.8x in 2008. We have minimal exposure to floating rate loans and a very manageable maturity schedule of high-quality loans with only 4% maturing in 2023 and another 7% in 2024. Our commercial office portfolio is geographically diverse and high quality. We saw signs of stress building in this sector and proactively reduced our office exposure from 37% of our mortgage portfolio in 2016 down to 25% today. We have taken a conservative approach with our office portfolio and have manageable near-term maturities. We have already reduced valuations in our office portfolio by 22% from the peak, and they are 20% below the current implied index value. The current loan-to-value on our office portfolio is 52% and debt service coverage is 2.5x. We have looked at a number of different stress scenarios on office valuation. This includes an additional 20% to 40% decrease from our current conservative valuations and assumes an immediate default of all office loans over 100% LTV. The ultimate impact to our RBC ratio is estimated to be 2 to 3 percentage points under the 20% additional decrease scenario and 10 to 12 percentage points under the 40% additional decreased scenario, both very manageable. That said, we have the experience and a long-established track record of navigating real estate cycles. It will take time for any market cycle to emerge, and the impacts would play out over a number of years. Looking at our CMBS portfolio, relative to 2008, we have decreased the overall size of our portfolio by 22% and improve the quality to 98% with an NAIC 1 rating today. Our equity real estate portfolio is well diversified with a high concentration of property types with strong fundamentals, such as industrials and life sciences. The market value of our portfolio is substantially higher than our carrying value. Overall, we are confident in the quality of our real estate portfolio, remain diligent in monitoring and proactive in servicing it. We have built a high-quality portfolio that is well diversified and a good fit for our liability profile. 2023 will not be without its challenges, but we are positioned to focus on maximizing our growth drivers of retirement, global asset management and Benefits and Protection which will drive long-term growth for the enterprise and long-term shareholder value. We have the financial flexibility, discipline and a track record of managing through times of macro volatility and uncertainty. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, please open the call for questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) The first question comes from Ryan Krueger with KBW.Ryan Joel KruegerFirst question was just on the office stress scenario that you provided. Just curious in -- I mean that was a pretty severe scenario and a pretty limited RBC impact. Was that just based on the impact of downward ratings migration and some level of credit losses? Or did you assume anything for the impact if you'd have to take over some of the properties and they get the higher capital charge from being an owned real estate property?Daniel Joseph HoustonYes, appreciate that question, Ryan. I'll have Deanna handle that.Deanna Dawnette Strable-SoethoutYes. It was us taking over those properties in a complete default. Obviously, the extreme one was very unlikely 40% additional decrease from our already reduced 22% values. And then I also think it's important that, that wouldn't all happen at one time and would happen over an extended period of time.Ryan Joel KruegerGot it. And then could you talk about, I guess, the amount of committed capital you already have to deploy into real estate within PGI over time as well as your evolving thoughts on when the market may pick up for new deployment opportunities?Daniel Joseph HoustonThat's a great question. Really appreciate that, Ryan. Pat, can you help us out on that one?Patrick Gregory HalterYes. So thanks for the question, Ryan. I think as you know, we have been a very strong and very active advisor to investors throughout the world in real estate. And we do have a very strong committed but unfunded pipeline through those conversations with clients throughout the world. As you can imagine, we have not deployed that pipeline, that sort of drive power into the marketplace until we believe that valuations have gotten to a point where we believe we can start to enter into the markets again. But that pipeline is over $7 billion today in unfunded committed capital, both in the debt and in the equity strategies. So at the right time -- at the right appropriate time, we will deploy that. To your second question, that timing will be, I think, dependent again, once we see valuations are at a place we are desirable for us to engage. That probably is going to be later this year. We believe it's going to have a transmission effect over the next 2 quarters yet to get valuations to a place where we think we can start to enter with any sort of strong conviction. But we will and have a desire to get back in the markets when we think it's appropriate. One other thing just to mention, Ryan, I just was in Asia 3 weeks ago. And not only in terms of the additional sort of funds we have today, but the active interest from institutional investors to eventually take advantage of the opportunity in real estate is quite pronounced. And we're having some new and active conversations with institutional investors in many parts of the world to raise money, particularly in private debt right now because I think that's the first place of entry point, but also in terms of private equity as we go into 2024.Daniel Joseph HoustonHopefully, that helps, Ryan?Ryan Joel KruegerGreat.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan.Jamminder Singh BhullarSo the first one is just on the fee retirement business. And if I look at the flows in 1Q, even if you include the spread retirement, the flows seem pretty light relative to what you've had in previous 1Qs over the last several years, especially given the fact that the labor market is as strong as it is. So if you could just give some color on what drove that?Daniel Joseph HoustonChris, please.Christopher James LittlefieldYes, sure. Thanks for the question, Jimmy. Yes. I think when we look at flows in the first quarter, I'd comment on a few different things. We certainly are seeing lumpiness in the large market, and we had 1 low fee plan that lapsed in the quarter, that was about $2.8 billion in assets. Despite that 1 lapse, we are seeing really strong pipeline in large -- and a reminder that in large -- are you going to see lumpiness, both on the flows in as well as flows out when they happen since they're larger plans. When I think about transfer deposit performance though, up 22%. We got really strong momentum in our business and a really strong pipeline. The underlying fundamentals are strong as well. I think Dan mentioned in his comments, particularly in the SMB. And so while when you look at recurring deposits growing at about 4% versus a year ago and 11% on a trailing 12-month basis, it's particularly strong in the SMB space. Those recurring deposits are up sort of 8% to 9%, and our net cash flow in SMB alone was nearly $2 billion in the quarter. So we're seeing really strong performance there. But again, it doesn't take away from some of the lumpiness you're going to see on flows when you have 1 large plan (inaudible) and the full fee plan.Daniel Joseph HoustonYes, 1 large plan like that can mask a really strong quarter. Do you have a follow-up, Jimmy?Jamminder Singh BhullarYes. Just -- it was on PGI margins, as we think about margins for the rest of the year, is 1Q a good number to use going forward in terms of expenses and just overall margin levels in PGI?Daniel Joseph HoustonPat, please.Patrick Gregory HalterYes. So thanks for the question, Jimmy. As you note, the margin for the first quarter was a little over 30%. That should not be a good reflection of where we see the rest of the year in terms of margins. We did have -- as you recall, every year, we have a sort of onetime expense adjustment associated with retirement deferred compensation and also payroll taxes that is a onetime first quarter. That was around $20 million. So that's one thing just to highlight, Jimmy, in terms of that margin discussion. The second thing is we do think and have seen a first quarter sort of reset in terms of some valuations starting to increase, and that's going to allow for a little bit larger AUM base going forward along with the growth that we continue to expect in the platforms we have. And so our guidance of 34% to 37% that we presented to you in the outlook call, we remain very confident that we will achieve that 34% to 37% by the end of the year, Jimmy.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of John Barnidge with Piper Sandler.John Bakewell BarnidgeOftentimes, you talk about employee withholding match and the trends there. How has that trended versus last year? Are you seeing employees or employers pull back at all on how much they're contributing? And how did that factor into the recurring deposit growth within RIS?Daniel Joseph HoustonYes, it's a great question. The one thing that's amazing is just how competitive that SMB marketplace still is in terms of attracting and retaining talent. Those things still remain strong. But Chris, you want to provide some additional detail on the strength of the matching contributions.Christopher James LittlefieldYes, sure. I would say we still see growth, although it's certainly slowing from what we saw in 2022. So John, when I look at the number of participants deferring the numbers receiving a match, the new participants with account value and the overall average of deferred dollars per participant, all of those metrics are up 3% to 4% year-over-year. And again, as I highlighted in the SMB, it's particularly strong at 8% to 9% on recurring deposits. So that's all positive, albeit a bit slower than we've seen in past years.John Bakewell BarnidgeAnd my follow-up question, maybe just to clarify, on the $1.8 billion on Slide 3 of the presentation, there is a footnote you talked about in your prepared remarks about the $700 million in proceeds. Are we supposed to normalize for that? Or is the $1.8 billion the number we should be using?Daniel Joseph HoustonDeanna, please.Deanna Dawnette Strable-SoethoutYes. Thanks, John, for the question. I hope your recovery is going well after your accident. Just a couple of things there. That $1.8 billion that you see on the slide is elevated due to the $700 million of debt issuance that we issued in the first quarter but we will pay off the corresponding existing debt in the second quarter. So a pro forma would be more like the $1.1 billion. Your follow-up is then why did that go down from where we were at the end of the year. And so just a couple of comments on that. Really, the 2 things that are going to impact that roll forward other than that issuance of debt I just referred to is, one, the return of capital to our shareholders, and two, any free cash flow and dividends between entities during the quarter. So obviously, you saw during the first quarter, we continued to return a sizable amount to our shareholders, over $300 million with $150 million of share buybacks and a slightly larger amount through our common stock dividend. On free cash flow and dividends, first quarter is always seasonably light. It's really kind of 2 primary drivers there. We build up, and then there's just seasonality in the timing of dividends. And then also in the first quarter, you have all the cash payments of bonuses that also pressures first quarter as well. If you go back to '22 and look at the roll forward from fourth quarter of '21 to first quarter of '22, you're going to see a very similar pattern which pointed to minimal free cash flow in the first quarter, but albeit a very strong free cash flow for the full year. Beyond that, fourth quarter is always our largest quarter for free cash flow. As you heard me mention in our prepared remarks, one thing that was a little different this quarter versus first quarter of last year, is we did see a higher volume of high-return organic deployment opportunities in the quarter and accelerated a portion of our full year sales plan -- we're not changing our full year sales expectation. So again, it's just a shifting from future quarters into the current quarter and we actually then will see higher than originally anticipated free cash flow in the other quarters. The one I would point to that is most obvious is PRT. We had nearly $600 million of sales in the quarter, and first quarter is typically a very, very light quarter. So I think bottom line, the seasonality we saw was not unexpected. We've seen it in prior years. We'll continue to see it in future years, and we remain confident about our free cash flow opportunities for the entire year. Thanks.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Tracy Dolin-Benguigui with Barclays.Tracy Dolin-BenguiguiI would like to touch upon specialty group benefits. Can you add color regarding what drove higher loss ratios across several products like dental and vision, group life, the individual disability.Daniel Joseph HoustonAmy will handle that accordingly. Amy, please.Amy Christine FriedrichYes, sure. So I think I would settle in on saying we were generally feeling good about the loss ratios you're seeing. They're within the ranges that we would have expected. And dental is probably the one that I would highlight there. It does have a bit of seasonality in it. As you know, and as we've discussed on a lot of private call -- previous calls, the dental loss ratios really got out of track in terms of seasonality with COVID. So with some of the closures and other things that happened, we sort of lost our ability to see that seasonality in the industry for a couple of years. What I see in dental seasonality is it's returning back to pre-COVID levels. So when I look at how dental utilization emerges over the year, it's typically the highest in first quarter. So what I would say is that loss ratio that we're seeing for dental is seasonal. It's back to expected patterns, and it's still within what we would expect to see. Our full year range is for some of the loss ratios that we're seeing across our group benefits, and IDI block are within normal levels.Deanna Dawnette Strable-SoethoutTracy, you also mentioned Group Life. Actually, group life is down once you adjust first quarter of '22 for the COVID claims. It is up from fourth quarter, but it was more because we had an abnormally low loss ratio in the fourth quarter of '22. So you had mentioned group life, so I just wanted to touch on that one as well.Tracy Dolin-BenguiguiExcellent. Just circling back on the comments about adjusting your available and excess cash. So if I take out the $700 million from your $1.5 billion of OCO cash, you're exactly at the $800 million minimum threshold. And then when I'm thinking about it, there isn't a lot of excess capital from your subsidiaries, $300 million or so. You do sound confident about meeting your 75% to 85% free cash flow conversion. Are you expecting greater organic surplus generation through earnings and that's how you'll get there for the remainder of the year?Deanna Dawnette Strable-SoethoutYes. So as you're aware, our free cash flow is all driven by statutory results as well as, again, in non-life entities, it would be the movement of that excess cash and capital up to the holding company. We are confident on that. As mentioned, the seasonality and some of just the pressuring of dividends and the fact that we dividend a high amount in the fourth quarter. So you start the year at a smaller level in those subsidiaries. We feel very confident relative to that. I don't see any meaningful disruption to our capital plans in the current environment. And the other thing I'd bring you back to is, post the transactions last year, our risk profile of our business mix is lower. Our credit risk is lower. We've talked a lot and given you a lot of material of why we feel really good about the high-quality of our investment performance, our portfolio that will perform well. And so again, when you bring that all together, we will see higher dividends in 2Q, 3Q and 4Q. And we also do see that seasonality in statutory results as we go throughout the year.Daniel Joseph HoustonHopefully that helps, Tracy.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Wes Carmichael with Wells Fargo.Wesley Collin CarmichaelI kind of wanted to stick with free cash flow for a second, too, but on Slide 2 of the deck, it mentions that you expect free cash flow conversion to increase throughout the year. But my understanding is that ratio is on the net income, excluding the exited business. So if I looked at the first quarter, the $300 million returned to shareholders, I calculated a ratio of 86%. So it seems like you're kind of there already in the first quarter. So I'm just trying to reconcile that with your thoughts on that should accelerate.Daniel Joseph HoustonI'll have Deanna handle that. But Wes, welcome and appreciate you picking up coverage on PFG.Deanna Dawnette Strable-SoethoutWes, just so you're aware, the deployment can come out of 2 places. It can come from excess you had coming into the quarter as well as the free cash flow generation during the quarter. And we came in at about -- I think it was just shy of $300 million of excess coming into the year in our holdco and in the entities. And so again, you need to factor that into that result as well.Wesley Collin CarmichaelGot it. And can you maybe just talk about your outlook for 2023 for pension risk transfer sales. You had $600 million in the first quarter in RIS. But seems like it might be a pretty good environment with higher interest rates and as well as a tailwind from the equity markets bouncing back.Daniel Joseph HoustonTrue to that. Chris, do you want to go ahead and respond?Christopher James LittlefieldYes. Welcome, Wes. Thanks for the question. Yes. I mean as Deanna mentioned, we had a very strong start to the year, which was a little bit unusual for first quarter. We do expect to grow our PRT business, call it, 10% to 15% over year -- over last year, so in that $2.3-ish billion range is kind of what we're shooting for. The industry is expecting opportunities of the $30 billion to $40 billion range overall, and plans are still really well funded according to Mercer at 102%. So we do see a lot of opportunities for PRT. I think the most important thing for us, though, is we deploy that capital in a disciplined way. And so we're not going after every PRT opportunity, we're going for those where we can get a good return on the capital that we're investing in that business.Daniel Joseph HoustonIt's also probably worth calling out Wes is that about 25% of those PRT sales actually came from existing full-service customers. And again, that comprehensive approach to retirement solutions is what we're about. And you can see where those intersections come together and help drive results for the organization.Christopher James LittlefieldAnd to that point, Dan, about $150 million of the $600 million in this quarter were existing DB customers of ours. So you do see the power of that in our business.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Michael Ward with Citi.Michael Augustus WardI really appreciate the disclosures on CRE, very helpful. I think you guys mentioned that the LTVs are revalued quarterly. So I was just curious about the debt service coverage component and how current these metrics are? And I'm just trying to figure out mechanically, not necessarily just for principal, but for CRE debt like this -- how might this evolve over time? And how sort of current are the debt service coverage metrics that we see?Daniel Joseph HoustonAppreciate that, Michael. And Pat also might be able just to maybe share a little bit with the group about the resources we have surrounding this in terms of valuations and feet on the streets to assess this asset class.Patrick Gregory HalterYes. Thanks, Michael, for the question. I think one of the sort of the benefits that we have as an organization, as Dan highlighted in his prepared remarks in terms of the size of our organization. So on the office component, which I know is very important to all on the line here, but we also do this for the broader portfolio. But office, we're actually reevaluating -- re-underwriting each one of those loans every quarter. So we have a very deep, wide experience team that covers 40 of the major markets in the U.S. And we have underwriters who are steep in knowledge, steep in those markets to do basically quarterly reevaluations, reconstructing the cash flows associated with the rental streams and lease structure of those transactions real time along with getting market data on where cap rates may be, where they may be heading, what's going on in terms of market rents relative to the contract rents in our sort of property, tenancy changes and really updating on a cash flow basis, each one of those assets from a property income expense perspective. So we are actually doing a very deep cash flow analysis, which allows us to have a lot of confidence in those debt service coverage ratios as a result of that in terms of analysis, Michael. And then in terms of valuations, obviously, we also have a very deep experienced equity real estate group, which is developing, managing real estate throughout the country. So they're getting real-time broker opinions as to the trends that are going on in terms of cap rates, trends that are going on in terms of investor sentiment. And so it's a very robust process that we're engineering every quarter now for our office portfolio. And then on the residential and industrial portfolio is also, we're going through that same process over a sequence of quarters.Daniel Joseph Houston(inaudible) Did that help, Michael?Michael Augustus WardYes. That's very helpful, guys. So maybe on commercial mortgage loans versus CMBS. Just wondering if you could comment. I think you guys are mainly or almost all conduit. And I believe about 30% of that is office. So hoping you could comment on that and whether or not that's included in the RBC stress test.Daniel Joseph HoustonPat, please.Patrick Gregory HalterYes. So we do have analysis that goes on relative to our CMBS portfolio also. And interesting to note that our sort of office exposure in the private space in terms of that percentage is somewhat similar to what we have in our CMBS portfolio holdings, 25%, 30% is in office. We are actually evaluating those assets also from the point of view of both maturity and in our sort of CMBS portfolio, those office loans in terms of maturity are quite limited in terms of 2023 and 2024. But we're also -- because of the subordination levels, we're doing a sort of a bottom-up analysis as to -- how are those subordination levels protecting us from (technical difficulty) now as just I highlighted, Michael, and the cash flow analysis is highlighted. And we're then applying that to the actual structure of those CMBS structures in terms of subordination levels. And what we're finding is very positive thus far. And that is when we stress test those portfolios, we still have subordination levels that would allow us to have a great deal of comfort because those subordination levels would still be in a stress test environment of 21% or better. And that is an A quality approach and level of rating if we looked at that from a sort of a comparable sort of rating agency perspective.Deanna Dawnette Strable-SoethoutMike, that was not included in the stress test that we included. But if you actually look at Page 14 and given that 98.5% of those CMBSs are NAIC 1, I think any impact in a stress scenario, and again, in addition to the commentary that, Pat, would be very, very minor relative to that risk.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Suneet Kamath with Jefferies.Suneet Laxman L. KamathI appreciate all the color on how you go about valuing the office CRE, it does sound like you have a lot of resources. But just curious, is there part of the process where you go through getting a sort of a third party to kind of validate the analysis, just to kind of give you one more check.Daniel Joseph HoustonPat?Patrick Gregory HalterYes. So typically, you'd get an appraisal. The challenge today, as you can imagine, Suneet, is the appraisals are probably not as current, not as, I think, active in understanding real time what's going on within the reconstruction of those cash flows, the buildings and how the tenancy and the market rents relative to the contract rent buildings are evaluated and changing. So we do not sort of -- in that sort of analysis go out and get a third-party valuation opinion. We think that our expertise, our deep analysis is probably superior frankly, to that.Daniel Joseph HoustonWe meet once a week, Suneet, with the real estate team and assess these investment options in our investment committee. We -- these professionals are in there. They're talking about this. They have deep relationships with brokers in each one of these subcategories. And so I think there is a really honest assessment and valuation associated with how we keep these on the books. And again, it's a rigorous process that is staffed incredibly well.Patrick Gregory HalterJust to add to that, we have over 550 institutional investors in over 34 countries, and they also feel very comfortable with the process we deploy here.Suneet Laxman L. KamathGot it. Makes sense. And then I guess a quick one for Deanna. Just in terms of the outlook for buybacks, I guess you did $150 million here in the first quarter. Is that about the pace that we should expect going forward? Or -- just any color in terms of expectations on that?Deanna Dawnette Strable-SoethoutYes. I think there will be volatility quarter-to-quarter. But I think if you annualize that amount, that's in the ballpark. And I think if you kind of looked at kind of our free cash flow estimates relative to kind of what you'd be expecting, you'd get to that same level. Obviously, we want to recognize the current environment. We need -- there is some lumpiness quarter-to-quarter, we need to take into account. But yes, I think that's a good indication of what could occur through the rest of the year.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Erik Bass with Autonomous Research.Erik James BassIn the RIS business, net investment income increased pretty materially from the fourth quarter, even adjusting for variable investment income. So I was just hoping you could talk about what's driving this, and the outlook going forward? And then how we should think about how much of that benefit drops to the bottom line?Daniel Joseph HoustonChris, please.Christopher James LittlefieldYes. Sure. Thanks for the question, Erik. I mean, I think -- we definitely are seeing 3 primary drivers in what's happening in that investment income. Certainly, we've seen the benefit to the increase in short-term interest rates, and that certainly had a positive effect. We've seen some additional timing difference between when the rates are increasing and when that rates are credited back to the customer, so the lag. That's been a second driver. And then we've seen overall growth in the block of our business. So those are the key drivers in NII. I think when you look at the supplement, you look just at NII, it can -- it's not necessarily the best picture because you also have to take into account the interest that's being credited in the BCSD line. And so there is certainly a benefit that we're seeing, but it's not as large as you would see just by looking solely at the NII line. So definitely a benefit. We expect to see some additional benefits if interest rates continue to rise, although I think we're kind of nearing the end of the larger increases that we saw over the course of 2022, and we expect to have some benefit. What we've also said through '22, and what I'll reiterate again today, that will normalize over time in net interest margin. There are competitive pressures and others, and that will tend to normalize over the long term, but we will -- we expect to see some benefit.Daniel Joseph HoustonDo you have follow-up, Erik?Erik James BassYes, a follow-up for Pat. Just curious what you're seeing in terms of client demand for fixed income. Has interest started to pick up now that rates have stabilized a bit? And if so, are you seeing new money going into traditional active products? Or is more being allocated to passive?Patrick Gregory HalterYes. Great. Thanks, Erik. Thanks for that question. It's been interesting. We actually were in our fixed income sort of portfolio. We had a couple of things that were kind of interesting in the first quarter. One was, as you know, we're very active in preferreds. And given the banking prices, we did have a little bit of outflow from preferreds. Interesting to note, though, as we sort of communicated to investors, and we've gotten sort of maybe on the other side of the banking crisis, investors are now starting to look at preferreds again. And I mentioned that because I think our specialty income sort of capabilities continue to be relevant in the marketplace even with investors moving to money market and to CDs. We do think there's been a little bit of a pause because of that, but there is a lot of active discussions underway about high yield. There's a lot of active discussions I mentioned about preferreds and relatively speaking, things that we think we're very good at like emerging market debt REITs. That activity is also increasing in terms of income-producing investments. So we think that fixed income, once interest rates stabilize and the Fed starts to maybe get in place of not raising rates, there will be maybe more of an interest -- a bigger amount of active investing in fixed income, and we're expecting that.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher with Evercore.Thomas George GallagherMy first one, Deanna, I just wanted to ask about some of the details about cash flow generation in the quarter. Recognizing your seasonal comments, I can appreciate that. But if I saw -- forgetting about seasonality for a minute, if I saw for normal capital generation in the quarter versus how much you produced, I end up with about a $350 million to $400 million shortfall versus normal. Now I'm assuming PRT consumed around $50 million. The seasonal cash payments that you highlighted, maybe that's another $50 million to $100 million. That would leave me with about a $200 million shortfall. Tell me if that math sort of adds up? And if so, what else would fill in the gaps here?Deanna Dawnette Strable-SoethoutYes. Thanks, Tom, for the question. I think the seasonality is greater than what you're giving credit to. If you went back to the roll forward from fourth quarter to first quarter last year, there we deployed approximately $900 million in the quarter, and our capital was reduced by just shy of $900 million. And so again, very modest free cash flow. So you're understating the amount of seasonality. I think maybe the organic opportunities is probably in the ballpark. But really that seasonality is much greater than what you were anticipating in your roll forward. There were some modest one-timers in the quarter. I'd say either they were anticipated in our capital plan, but we knew they would be pressuring first quarter or they will reverse in future quarters, but it's really that seasonality that you're understating, and I take you back to a year ago to kind of do a comparison.Thomas George GallagherThat's helpful. And then my follow-up is for Pat. The -- this part of -- it's a question on your updated investment disclosure, the $2.9 billion off-balance sheet gain on your equity real estate, if I just look at the carrying value versus the current estimate of market value, that's a very big, we'll call it off-balance sheet gain. How should we think about what we should do with that number? Should we just assume slow, steady monetization and the difference is going to help you produce your alternative return goals? Or would you ever look to do a big acceleration a bigger portfolio sale to create a lot more excess capital?Daniel Joseph HoustonYes. Let me have Deanna go ahead and respond to that. I gave her responsibility over cap marks.Deanna Dawnette Strable-SoethoutYes. I think there's a couple of things there, Tom. I think -- we obviously haven't disclosed this over a period of time, but this would be something that we've had in our portfolio. Obviously, we're going to do what's right for our investors and our customers over the long term. Sometimes we'll see that offset some credit pressures, other parts of our -- in our portfolio. Sometimes we'll actually roll it into new equity real estate investments. So it doesn't drop to the bottom line. But again, I think your bottom line observation relative to that is right.But again, it's not something that we would pull just to return to our shareholders because, again, we want to do what's right over the long term relative to this portfolio. It's a very high-quality portfolio. It's a very diversified portfolio. And it's something that has served our customers well over many decades. And again, we're very active at looking at those opportunities and pulling triggers and pulling the levers when it makes sense for our customers and our shareholders. But Pat, anything to add there?Patrick Gregory HalterNo, I think that's really well said. Just to add a little bit, Tom, to the dimensionality of it. It is -- does have a big concentration in industrial and has a big concentration in residential. So that's really good. I think we've identified in the office in the past what carrying value is a little over [500] -- a little over $1.5 billion versus the cost base $500 million. So -- but it's a very diversified portfolio. I think we have a lot of flexibility to use the portfolio as Deanna highlighted, and it's well positioned for that.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Alex Scott with Goldman Sachs.Alexander ScottThe first one I had is on the RIS expense timing, compensation and other came down a pretty good amount year-over-year. And I know you called out expense timing. So I just wanted to see if you could unpack that a little bit for us. I mean I'm cognizant of the fact that you guys have been very good at managing expenses over time. So I want to understand how much of it is like more pure expense timing versus good old-fashioned expense management, the way you guys have been doing in the last couple of quarters?Daniel Joseph HoustonWe try to have good old expense management around here all the time across all the businesses. And I think what makes RIS a little bit unique is the post transaction with the Wells Fargo IRT business. But Chris, do you want to provide some additional detail?Christopher James LittlefieldYes. Thanks for that, Alex. I mean what I would say is we continue to exercise good disciplined expense management. And I think as I said last quarter, we're committed to maintaining our margins. And so we're going to take the actions that we need to align revenue and expenses. We definitely did see some onetime benefits from some prior period accruals that were no longer needed. We had some timing, which we think will catch up in the quarter over the course of the year. We're delivering on the expenditure synergies from IRT, and we're investing for growth.So when I put all of that together, we -- by the end of the -- through 2023, we expect comp and other to essentially be flat year-over-year. We'll get some good savings, but we're also investing in for future growth as well. So hopefully, that answers the question. The only other thing I'd point out that we haven't highlighted is when we're taking these disciplined expense management, we had about $3 million of severance expense in the first quarter that we didn't call out especially. We had about 7% in the fourth quarter last year, and we had 11 for full year last year. So we're still showing good expense management despite some of those additional severance costs.Deanna Dawnette Strable-SoethoutNow it's just one thing to point. I don't know what you were comparing to. But if you were comparing back to first quarter of '22, that would have included expenses relative to the retail fixed annuity business. Again, that will normalize. And we still had PSA expense and some other items in there as well.Alexander ScottYes. Understood. And then maybe just high level on PGI. Could you talk us through the outlook for flows and any nuances in your portfolio that kind of push it one way or the other? Or should we just think about some of the overall industry pressures? And any color you could provide to help us out there?Daniel Joseph HoustonPat, please.Patrick Gregory HalterYes. So thanks for the question, Alex. Clearly, I think on the retail side, the platform side, there still continues to be a lot of investor uncertainty relative to market conditions, the economy, inflation, the path of interest rates. And as I mentioned in my response to Erik, there is a lot of money that continues to flow into money market accounts, CDs. And that is, I think, something that will continue to probably be an active area for investors. That being said, I think, as I mentioned earlier, we do like our relative position to specialized investment income products, as I mentioned in my previous response. And I think we will continue to see, as I highlighted, also more active interest in private credit, private debt. Some of the real estate sort of offerings that we believe are viable in this marketplace as we look forward to next year or 2. And so I think that's an area of potential growth on the institutional side. The equity space, we have some strong equity sort of capabilities. We had a couple of nice wins. I think we highlighted that in the material in the first quarter. So I think there's still uncertainty, there's still a lot of sort of thought capital we need to provide investors were to position themselves in an uncertain marketplace. But our broad-based of investment capabilities, I think, offer a lot of choice to them.OperatorOur final question comes from the line of Josh Shanker with Bank of America.Joshua David ShankerJust an easy one. I want to follow up on (inaudible) Tom was asking. In the prepared remarks, you talked about the pull forward on your business plan. What's the normal seasonality of deploying capital into the business plan. Is it usually equal in every quarter? And how big is the variance?Daniel Joseph HoustonDeanna?Deanna Dawnette Strable-SoethoutYes. I don't think that's an easy answer because every product is different. Again, the one we highlighted was PRT because that was different than what was kind of a normal seasonality where PRT tends to be in a normal year, very back-end loaded, and we saw, again, great opportunity, great returns and wanted to take advantage of that. And so again, seasonality, as I said, first quarter free cash flow, very pressured. Fourth quarter free cash flow, very strong. But again, product-by-product, that seasonality is very, very different.OperatorWe have reached the end of the Q&amp;A. Mr. Houston, your closing comments, please.Daniel Joseph HoustonYes. I appreciate that, Christine. A couple of quick comments. The first of which we appreciate your insights and your questions. Secondly, a large portion of the management team that's here today was here during that '08, '09 period. We've been through this cycle before, and we'll find an appropriate path through this cycle. Maybe third, just recognizing that we're trying to be very proactive with investors on the disclosures, in particular, around commercial real estate and office because we think it's the right thing to do to provide that level of transparency. Also, I think it's helpful to understand the clarity and the emergence of our free cash flow, again, reaffirming where we had set out from the beginning of the year. Again, the first quarter has had this historically. And then also to recognize the fundamentals of the markets in which we serve. And by the way, the international markets as well, which we didn't get into a lot of conversation today, has really held up well. So seeing very positive cash flows in both Asia and Latin America. So in spite of some very challenging and what I'd call volatile macroeconomic environment, the markets from which we serve have held up very well, and it's certainly our intention to deliver on the promises we made during our outlook call. So thank you, and look forward to seeing you on the road. Have a great day.OperatorThank you for participating in today's conference call.

The company has declined the purchase offer, confirming that its water system is not for sale and pointing out that MPWMD does not have the legal authority to purchase or operate the potable water system serving the area. California American Water reiterated its commitment to working cooperatively with MPWMD and other community partners to bring approved new sources of water supply online to protect the Carmel River.""California American Water has provided high-quality and reliable water service to its customers on the Monterey Peninsula for many decades and plans to continue serving its customers and working to address the real issues of water supply and environmental protection facing the Monterey Peninsula,"" said Evan Jacobs, Director of External Affairs for California American Water. ""MPWMD should stop wasting taxpayer money and reconsider its reckless and infeasible attempt to purchase our water system.""In 2018, after previous failed attempts to secure voter authorization to pursue a takeover of California American Water’s Monterey Peninsula system, the Measure J ballot measure authorized MPWMD to explore the feasibility of the purchase and operation of California American Water’s Monterey Peninsula water system. In 2021, after more than a year of careful consideration and public hearings, the Monterey Local Area Formation Commission (Monterey LAFCo) rejected MPWMD’s application to become a retail water utility. This authorization is a necessary prerequisite to any attempt to purchase and operate the water system that serves the Monterey Peninsula. Monterey LAFCo cited several reasons for the rejection, including the financial risk to MPWMD’s and its taxpayers, as well as the impact of severing the Monterey Peninsula water system from California American Water’s other operations in Monterey County. MPWMD subsequently sued Monterey LAFCo for its decision; that lawsuit is pending in the courts.Story continues""MPWMD has spent over $3 million dollars pursuing its effort so far and is putting tens of millions more at risk by proceeding without the needed legal authority,"" added Jacobs. ""It’s time to recognize that they have fulfilled the voter mandate to explore the feasibility of purchasing the water system and return to their core mission of promoting conservation and protecting the Carmel River.""If MPWMD moves forward with an eminent domain action to condemn the water system, we expect that it will be subject to dismissal by the court. A failed attempt will result in MPWMD bearing responsibility for its own attorney’s fees as well as those of California American Water.About California American Water:California American Water, a subsidiary of American Water (NYSE: AWK), provides high-quality and reliable water and wastewater services to more than 700,000 people.

It means that companies logging strong results are getting rewarded by investors. Those that are not posting good results are getting hammered. So do your homework, and pick correctly.Examples of this were abundant during the week.Meta’s stock price (META) rocked after earnings showed the House of Zuck is coming back to life. Snap (SNAP), meanwhile, was showing none of that, and a stock price disaster followed.PepsiCo's (PEP) earnings were more impressive than Coke’s (KO), and its stock was rewarded accordingly. Amazon (AMZN) called out weakness in its cloud services in April, and investors dumped the stock.I suspect this stock picker's market narrative will continue next week too. Cheers to an AI-filled Apple (AAPL) earnings call on May 4!Snackable statsAmazon said AWS net sales grew by about 11% in April. That marks a deceleration from 16% in the first quarter.Snap called out a 6% year-over-year revenue decline for the second quarter. Meta guided to about 7% sales growth in the second quarter.Meta ended the first quarter with 77,100 employees, down 11% quarter over quarter.Bed Bath &amp; Beyond stock is slated to get delisted on May 3 in the wake of its bankruptcy filing.Tesla stock is down by 16% in the past month on post-earnings profit margin concerns.Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg smiles during an announcement at Facebook headquarters in Palo Alto, Calif., Wednesday, July 6, 2011. (AP Photo/Paul Sakuma) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)Earnings call vibesThe vibes from this week's crop of earnings calls ranged from being upbeat on the consumer (PepsiCo, Chipotle) to downbeat on cloud services demand (Amazon).""The uncertain economic environment and ongoing inflationary pressures continue to be a factor, and we believe it's continuing to drive cautious spending across consumers,"" Amazon CFO Brian Olsavsky said. ""This means our customers are looking to stretch their budgets further and are focused on value. We saw some moderated spending on discretionary categories as well as shift to lower-priced items and healthy demand in everyday essentials, such as consumables and beauty.""""So far, we've gone through two of the three waves of restructuring and layoffs that we have planned for this year in our recruiting and our technical groups,"" Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said. ""In May, we're going to carry out our third wave across our business groups. And this has been a difficult process, but after this is done, I think we're going to have a much more stable environment for our employees.""""We do see some of the pressures that give us reason to believe that our view on the macro outlook is accurate,"" McDonald's CEO Chris Kempczinski said. ""One, we are seeing a slight decrease in units per transaction. So things like did someone add fries to their order? How many items are they buying per order? We're seeing that go down in most of our markets around the world slightly, but it's still going down.""""And then the other thing is we continue to monitor very closely the acceptance of our pricing,"" Kempczinski added. ""I'm really proud of how our system has executed pricing in light of the double-digit inflation that we have been experiencing. But we are seeing in some places resistance to pricing, more resistance than we saw at the outset. So I think all of those things are reflective of again, a more challenging macro environment.""Story continuesChart of the WeekIn search of a good quarter and a sales bottom for Snap, here's a chart from Jefferies tech analyst Brent Thill.Will things ever get better for Snap?

Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.Nick Baker, CoinDesk deputy editor-in-chiefBeing a Consensus newbie this year, I am like a small-town yokel blown away by how big and impressive this event has been. Here are a couple of my takeaways:One, the level of optimism people have about crypto is very high, which is a surprise given just how bad the regulatory outlook is. And I know it's partly self-selection bias at work: People who are going to pay a lot of money to attend this event are going to be optimistic about the space. Still, that juxtaposition of existential questions and lots of optimism is striking to me.Two, the people I know best are from traditional finance and they, too, remain quite high on the future of crypto and moving TradFi stuff to crypto or crypto-adjacent infrastructure. Now, of course, they’ve been trying for years to show progress along those lines and have little to show for it. But they’re undeterred. This point rhymes with my first point.Ben Schiller, head of Consensus MagazineSomething that really struck me arose from what Kate Brady, head of communications for Web3 at PepsiCo, said on stage. As you know, PepsiCo is a very mainstream American brand. It's not part of the crypto industry by any means, but it’s looking to get into Web3. And one of the things she said on stage was that she was being stymied in her work and PepsiCo has been stymied in its work by the lack of regulatory clarity, and I thought that was interesting because obviously this is something the industry says a lot that we need to do. There are guidelines from Washington, D.C., from lawmakers and from policymakers. And we think that that conversation or that that issue only affects people in the relatively small world of crypto.Story continuesBut it really came home to me that actually this regulatory conversation affects all of corporate America, all of anyone who wants to develop in Web3, across the United States. And that's a pretty broad based group of people. So, if somebody from a company like PepsiCo is worried about crypto policy, then it's something that we as an industry, or we as a country, should really be focused on more. If they're saying it, it's something really important for everybody.Additionally, what's evident is that the lack of policymaking and predictable enforcement in D.C. is a wider threat to the U.S. than we might think. It’s a concern for American competitiveness at large and, at this point, it’s really unforgivable. Europe and much of Asia now have relatively clear frameworks – and in what is supposedly a major hub for blockchain industry, we still don’t. That affects an increasingly large number of people and organizations.Nikhilesh De, CoinDesk managing editor for global policy and regulationWhat's really fascinating to me about the regulatory conversation is we're seeing these discussions happen in parallel with ongoing work in Congress and other jurisdictions, lending a bit more urgency to this week's talks. It has been a very busy week.Over the last couple days, we've seen Congress introduce a bill to assess how crypto might be used for criminal and other terrorist activities. We've seen multiple hearings addressing cryptocurrencies held at the same time as Consensus – no relation, just at the same time as our panel on various policy issues.Just this morning the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Government Accountability Office and the New York Department of Financial Services all published reports explaining what they see as the root causes for the failures of Signature Bank and Silicon Valley Bank.We're watching the regulation unfold, even as we hold this conference, talking about the same policy issues that are playing out in real time.It's still debatable whether we'll see any resolutions on legislation or rulemaking but we're seeing progress, and that ain't nothing.Amitoj Singh, CoinDesk regulatory reporterMy takeaway is on how non-U.S. regulators are thinking about crypto while the U.S. remains in a deadlock both in Congress and among regulators (Commodities Futures Trading Commission and Securities and Exchange Commission). Other major economies won’t frame it in a way in which it sounds like they want to take advantage of the U.S. deadlock. But with the likes of Coinbase threatening to go off-shore, that’s exactly what these non-U.S. jurisdictions are ready for.The question is when the U.S. does come up with its own regulatory framework, will other jurisdictions adjust their rules in order to have globally coordinated rules that the G-20 nations have said are imperative for successfully overseeing this space?Cheyenne Ligon, CoinDesk regulatory reporterThe session hosted by Jesse Hamilton on the turf war between the CFTC and the SEC was really interesting. Unsurprisingly, the two former regulators – one from the SEC, one from the CFTC – disagreed about the path forward for finding regulatory clarity for crypto. Brian Quintenz, former CFTC commissioner, called on Congress to legislate the issue, but former SEC lawyer Dan Berkovitz said he didn't think legislation would fix anything.Everyone agreed that, in the meantime, regulation would continue to be done via enforcement. It was a bleak discussion – and evidence that crypto regulations will probably continue to be a hot mess for a long while yet.]"

If you want to see more such stocks on the list, go directly to Analysts Are Increasing Price Targets of These 5 Stocks.Especially technology stocks have been performing particularly well over the last few days. The gains were attributed to the release of earnings reports from Big Tech companies such as Alphabet, Microsoft, and Meta Platforms. On the other hand, First Republic Bank reported a 40% decrease in deposits in the first quarter, which renewed concerns about the broader banking sector and caused the major averages to fall on Tuesday.As concerns about the banking sector continue to rise, stock markets may face a significant loss of buying power from a key source, reported Bloomberg. According to Scott Rubner, a market analyst at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., systematic money managers have recently invested over $170 billion in global shares, which has driven their exposure to the highest level since early 2022. Rubner warns that as their positioning approaches its peak, these managers are more likely to sell off their holdings in the coming weeks. Rubner has studied fund flows for two decades and believes that this group's behavior could have a significant impact on the markets.The Conference Board has reported that consumer confidence has declined more than expected in April. The consumer confidence index dropped to 101.3 from 104.0 in March, a larger decline than the predicted decrease to 104.0 from the previously reported 104.2. Meanwhile, the Commerce Department released a report indicating that new home sales in March unexpectedly surged to their highest level in a year. Given that the real gross domestic product (GDP) increased at an annual rate of 1.1 percent in Q1 of 2023, Fed's high interest rate policy hasn't pushed the economy into a recession. Economists have been predicting a US recession since the second half of 2022. We also observe the positive effects of relatively strong consumer spending in Q1 earnings of most publicly traded stocks.Story continuesAfter geopolitical tensions led to the loss of around $446 billion in mainland Chinese shares this month, a decline in Chinese stocks has paused as dip buyers enter the market, reported Bloomberg. The CSI 300 Index, a benchmark index of Chinese stocks, rose 0.3% in the afternoon session on April 26, having fallen by as much as 0.7% earlier. The MSCI gauge of Chinese shares also rose more than 1% after six days of losses, although it is still on track for its worst April performance since 2004. Additionally, the offshore yuan has rebounded from its nearly seven-week low against the US dollar. Key gauges are showing some signs of stability after several days of losses.Beverage giants PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) and The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) along with retail giant Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), recently came into the spotlight after receiving price-target hikes from analysts. PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) and The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) received the updated price targets following their latest quarterly performance. On the other hand, KeyBanc analyst Bradley Thomas increased its price target for Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), citing accelerating growth from margin accretive businesses and cost and efficiency benefits from automation.Meanwhile, healthcare stocks, including HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA) and Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB), were also on the list of 10 stocks receiving price-target hikes from analysts.

(NYSE:SNV) from $31 to $33, while maintaining a Neutral rating on the stock. Preston updated the net interest income (NII) assumptions, resulting in 2024 estimates that are relatively unchanged. The analyst communicated this information to investors in a research note.Also on April 24, Christopher Marinac, an analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott, raised Synovus Financial Corp. (NYSE:SNV) rating from Neutral to Buy and assigned a fair value estimate of $38. Marinac cited stable credit quality, manageable exposures in commercial real estate and commercial &amp; industrial sectors, as well as strong deposit growth and core account openings of new commercial accounts in the last quarter. The analyst also expressed optimism about the momentum in Synovus' business and believes it can continue.9. Cadence Design Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CDNS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 47Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya increased the price target of Cadence Design Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CDNS) to $240 from $225 and maintained a Buy rating on the shares, following the company's Q1 earnings report, which Arya described as a ""slight beat."" Additionally, Cadence Design Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CDNS) provided a modest raise of its sales and EPS guidance for FY23. Arya acknowledged that the cyclical nature of hardware and intellectual property (IP) sales may create intra-quarter volatility, but he believes that the timing of revenue does not indicate a deceleration of the beneficial long-term secular trends that the firm sees as sustainable. Arya communicated this information to investors on April 25.Cadence Design Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ: CDNS) has recently garnered attention due to its impressive Q4 results. The company's revenue in Q4 2022 experienced a YoY increase of approximately 16.4% to $899.88 million, exceeding estimates by $15.65 million. Cadence Design Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ: CDNS) management has expressed confidence in the company's growth prospects, citing AI, machine learning, 5G, and hyperscale computing as the key drivers of its secular growth.Renaissance Investment made the following comment about Cadence Design Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CDNS) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Cadence Design Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CDNS) was another contributor. The company reported strong operating results with broad-based strength from its semiconductor customers who are migrating to next-generation manufacturing nodes. We believe the multi-year investment cycle for semiconductor design spending should drive sustainable double-digit growth well into next year.”8. O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORLY)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 47On April 25, Evercore ISI increased its price target on O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORLY) to $950 from $945 while maintaining an Outperform rating on the shares. The move comes ahead of the company's fiscal Q1 report, which is due to be released after the close on Wednesday. Despite the volatile Q1 weather, the analyst is optimistic and anticipates an above-trend quarter.TimesSquare U.S. Mid Cap Growth Strategy made the following comment about O’Reilly Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORLY) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Another boost came from O’Reilly Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORLY), a specialty retailer of after-market automotive parts and accessories, which scored a 20% gain. Revenues and earnings surpassed sell-side estimates on higher same store comparisons. Their do-it-for-me professional mechanic business generated double-digit growth while do-it-yourself increased sales by a modest amount.”7. McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 57McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) is a fast-food restaurant chain operator based in Chicago, Illinois, currently the largest chain operator globally. The company started with a single drive-in restaurant in San Bernardino, California, in 1955, and has since expanded to almost 40,000 locations in over 100 countries worldwide. McDonald's serves more than 60 million customers every year.On April 25, Morgan Stanley analyst John Glass increased the price target of McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) from $309 to $315 and has maintained an Overweight rating on the shares. The company's quarterly results had a ""relatively clean"" impact on the top and bottom line, with impressive sales across different markets. However, these results were against high expectations and an all-time high for the stock. Morgan Stanley believes that McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) is a ""core holding,"" though valuation sensitivity may exist at current levels.Like McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD), analysts have also increased its price target for PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), and Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB).6. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 58Deutsche Bank analyst Steve Powers has increased the price target of The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) from $61 to $63 and maintains a Hold rating on the shares following the Q1 results. The analyst notes that the company is executing well in a vibrant market. Powers communicated this information to investors on April 25.Rowan Street Capital mentioned The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s take The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) for example. Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next years forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”Click to continue reading and see the Analysts Are Increasing Price Targets of These 5 Stocks.Suggested articles:Most Advanced Countries in Artificial Intelligence10 Best Artificial Intelligence Stocks Under $10Best AI Penny Stocks Under $1Disclosure: None.

These have been some of the best-performing stocks this week.And investors are correct in bidding these names up, judging by how the first half of the year is shaping up for the sector.Consider some of the tailwinds for the food space:Inflation is slowing for input costs, which is great for margins.Resistance to rounds of price increases has been generally limited, which is also great for margins.Recovery stories are playing out in China for multinational names such as PepsiCo.""You may not be able to go out and get a new car,"" PepsiCo vice chairman and CFO Hugh Johnston said on Yahoo Finance Live (video above). ""You may not be able to go out and get a really fancy piece of technology. But you can afford a bag of Doritos, or you can afford a Gatorade Zero after you workout, or you can afford an energy drink in the morning.""Good point by Hugh.Do you ever look at how much you just spent on a bag of chips at a 7-11 or WaWa? Maybe, maybe not. But I would bet that bag of chips today is more than 10% higher in price than at this point last year. Maybe 20%, depending on the flavor.You may not have even realized it, but the CFOs of consumer food companies did, and their shareholders are loving it. Expect more price increases from these giants this year in part because consumers don't appear to care.A person dressed in a Hershey chocolate bar costume celebrates Halloween on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange shortly after the market's opening bell in New York October 31, 2014. REUTERS/Lucas Jackson (Lucas Jackson / reuters)Then there is another aspect of the food trade that is getting overlooked. While I will get ridiculed by my colleague Julie Hyman for this statement, I believe we are in the golden age of food innovation.Story continuesThe aforementioned Hershey is selling Reese's snack cakes. Where was that 20 years ago?Meanwhile, PepsiCo and Coca-Cola (KO) are in active rollouts of ready-made alcoholic drinks after years of avoiding the space. Beer company Molson Coors (TAP) has started to sell whiskey with success. And Conagra Brands (CAG) has made frozen food taste great for maybe the first time ever.Then there's McDonald's rethinking how they cook a burger (thank goodness), Starbucks selling drinks with one inch of thick ""salted caramel cold foam,"" and Papa John's launching a giant hot-pocket-like product this week that has a Doritos Cool Ranch coating.Even my local pizza joint just started selling ""hot honey"" chicken pizza. I went to a whiskey distillery last week and they are serving up whiskey infused with roasted coconuts.You may be laughing at all this as it's not similar to innovations at Tesla or Apple.But it is in fact innovation that helps drive higher price points on food and, over time, fatter profits and stock prices. Combine that with cooling inflation, and you have one heck of an earnings power story in the food sector.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

361,70acef8d-8c3e-369d-9d1d-b591d6ddbc65,PEP,2023-04-29,FedEx and Charles Schwab have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fedex-charles-schwab-highlighted-zacks-121612473.html,1682684172,STORY,"['FDX', 'SCHW', '^GSPC', 'KMB', 'PG', 'PEP']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – April 28, 2023 – Zacks Equity Research shares FedEx Corporation FDX as the Bull of the Day and Charles Schwab SCHW as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on PepsiCo PEP, Kimberly-Clark KMB and Procter &amp; Gamble PG.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks.Bull of the Day:Company OverviewMemphis-based Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) FedEx Corporation is the leader in global express delivery services. Since 1971, it has been providing transportation, e-commerce, and business services for its customers. Three main segments drive FedEx: FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, and FedEx Freight.FedEx Express: Offers time definite delivery to more than 220 countries and territories.FedEx Ground: A low-cost, day-certain service to any business address in the United States and Canada.FedEx Freight: Offers less-than-truckload (LTL) freight services in the United StatesA Straightforward Bull CaseThe meteoric rise of e-commerce in the United States and worldwide presents significant opportunities for freight companies to grow and expand their business. Beyond traditional delivery, e-commerce consumers demand more efficient and innovative delivery solutions, producing more potential revenue.Industry TailwindsZack’s in-house studies have shown that the top 50% of industry groups tend to outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of two to one. The Transportation – Air Freight and Cargo group meets the threshold by a long shot. The group is ranked in the top 9% of all industries tracked by Zacks and has drastically outperformed the S&amp;P 500 Index over the past three years.FundamentalsDespite a recent earnings slowdown, FDX has delivered positive surprises on earnings for two quarters running. Though earnings growth slowed last quarter, investors must look to the future. Analysts have earnings per share soaring to new highs within the next two years.The Total PackageBeyond strong industry tailwinds and a larger total addressable market, FedEx management is intent on rewarding shareholders through dividend payouts. In April, FDX raised its dividend by 10% to $1.26 per share or $5.05 annually. The company also raised its full-year outlook based on its cost savings plan, saying, “We are pleased with the company’s efforts to reward its shareholders even in these difficult times.”Story continuesTechnical ViewOne of the most impressive traits of FedEx is its stable yet robust technical performance. FDX has a beta of 1.01, meaning it’s a very tame stock, and its volatility is in line with that of the S&amp;P 500. Despite the low beta, year-to-date, the stock has returned 30% versus 6% in the S&amp;P. Furthermore, the share price is pulling back to the 50-day moving average – an area the stock has found support at for months.TakeawayOverall, the rise of e-commerce presents significant opportunities for freight companies like FDX to improve their profitability, increase their market share, and enhance their competitiveness. Furthermore, FDX’s drive to reward shareholders through dividends and cost savings should drive the stock higher in 2023.Bear of the Day:Company OverviewZacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stock Charles Schwab is a financial services company that offers a broad range of investment and wealth management services. The company was founded in 1971 and is headquartered in San Francisco, California.Schwab’s investment services include trading and investing in stocks, bonds, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), options, futures, and more.Toxic Combo: Rising Costs + A Regional Banking CrisisPrior to 2023, a rising interest rate environment was mostly viewed as a positive for the banking sector. However, the unusually rapid hikes from unprecedented, near-zero interest rates caused mayhem in the regional banking sector – leading to the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB).At the root of SVB’s collapse was a large amount of bank deposits in the long-term U.S. treasuries and mortgage-backed securities (assets that typically fall when interest rates rise). As word spread of SVB’s liquidity crisis and investment issues, depositors began to panic, leading to a classic bank run.Though Schwab is not a regional bank, rumors and fears are leading to real world issues for the bank. According to Bloomberg, Schwab is “facing dwindling deposits.” As if that wasn’t enough, Schwab’s costs are rising rapidly and have been doing so for years. In fact, between 2016-2022 expenses rose at a compound annual growth rate of more than 15%.Industry WoesOur studies show that stocks within the bottom half of the Zacks industry group list tend to underperform dramatically. By now, it is no secret that the banking sector is underperforming. The Zack’s Financial Investment Banking Industry is in the bottom 13% of all industries tracked by Zacks.Bearish Price and Volume ActionSchwab is dramatically underperforming the S&amp;P 500 Index. Year-to-date SCHW is down 37.9%, while the S&amp;P is up 6.1%. Furthermore, a few weeks ago, Schwab’s CEO tried to inject life into the stock by purchasing one million dollars’ worth of stock. Since then, the stock has barely budged and is setting up in a bearish chart pattern.TakeawayBetween rising costs and dwindling deposits, Charles Schwab is stuck between a rock and a hard place. Expect volatility on both sides of the tape and avoid the stock at this juncture.Additional content:3 Companies That Recently Raised GuidanceThere have been several pockets of strength during earnings season so far, particularly in the Consumer Staples sector. We’ve seen many companies in the realm come out and post better-than-expected results, with pricing power leading the way.In fact, several companies – PepsiCo, Kimberly-Clark and Procter &amp; Gamble – have raised guidance following better-than-expected quarterly results, causing buyers to swarm as of late.As we can see, all three have displayed relative strength over the period, outperforming the market handily. Let’s take a deeper dive into each company’s current standing.PepsiCoPepsiCo reported earnings of $1.50 per share, handily exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by nearly 10%. Quarterly revenue totaled $17.8 billion, above expectations and improving 10% from the year-ago quarter.Investors cheered on the results, with PEP shares closing 2.5% higher post-earnings. The company’s shares have regularly gotten a boost following quarterly releases.Regarding the strong results, CEO Ramon Laguarta said, “We are very pleased with our performance and business momentum as our categories and geographies remained resilient during the first quarter. Given our strong start to the year, we now expect our full-year 2023 organic revenue to increase 8 percent (previously 6 percent) and core constant currency EPS to increase 9 percent (previously 8 percent).”And consistent with its previous guidance for FY23, PepsiCo expects total cash returns to shareholders to total roughly $7.7 billion, consisting of $6.7 billion in dividends and share repurchases of $1 billion.Kimberly-ClarkKimberly-Clark also posted a double-beat, exceeding earnings expectations by nearly 25%. Top line results were also solid, with the company generating $5.2 billion in revenue and improving modestly from the year-ago quarter.In addition, KMB’s gross margin increased 340 basis points year-over-year, primarily driven by favorable net revenue realization amid increased prices. Cash generated from operations totaled $613 million, reflecting a sizable jump from the year-ago value of $204 million.KMB shares saw a nice reaction from the market post-earnings, closing 1.5% higher. The market has had somewhat-mixed reactions following quarterly releases from Kimberly-Clark.The company raised its FY23 EPS guidance, now expecting 6% - 10% growth compared to FY22 and up from prior views of 2% - 6%. In addition, KMB increased its operating profit outlook to low double digits, again up from the previous mid to high single digits expected.Procter &amp; GambleLike the companies above, Procter &amp; Gamble posted better-than-expected results, exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by 3.8% and delivering a positive 4% revenue surprise. Earnings improved 3% year-over-year, whereas revenue saw growth of 4%.Impressively, PG’s recently declared dividend increase reflects the 67th consecutive year that the company has increased its dividend. The company returned more than $2.2 billion in dividends to shareholders throughout the quarter.Procter &amp; Gamble raised its FY23 all-in revenue guidance, now expecting growth of 1% compared to FY22, up from a prior guidance range of down -1% to flat year-over-year.  In addition, PG raised its organic revenue growth guidance for FY23, expecting growth of 6% compared to prior expectations of 4% – 5%.Bottom LineStocks in the Zacks Consumer Staples sector carry a defensive nature, as these companies’ products have an advantageous ability to generate consistent demand in the face of many economic situations.And as seen by the quarterly results from all three companies above, consumers have had little issue forking up extra cash for their products.In addition to uplifting guidance, all three companies currently sport a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), indicating bullish sentiment among analysts.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

Furthermore, you'd generally like to see the share price rise faster than the market. But Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) has fallen short of that second goal, with a share price rise of 47% over five years, which is below the market return. Zooming in, the stock is actually down 19% in the last year.In light of the stock dropping 4.5% in the past week, we want to investigate the longer term story, and see if fundamentals have been the driver of the company's positive five-year return. View our latest analysis for Union Pacific To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During five years of share price growth, Union Pacific actually saw its EPS drop 3.7% per year.By glancing at these numbers, we'd posit that the decline in earnings per share is not representative of how the business has changed over the years. Since the change in EPS doesn't seem to correlate with the change in share price, it's worth taking a look at other metrics.The revenue growth of 1.5% per year hardly seems impressive. So it seems one might have to take closer look at earnings and revenue trends to see how they might influence the share price.The image below shows how earnings and revenue have tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-and-revenue-growthUnion Pacific is a well known stock, with plenty of analyst coverage, suggesting some visibility into future growth. So it makes a lot of sense to check out what analysts think Union Pacific will earn in the future (free analyst consensus estimates)What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for Union Pacific the TSR over the last 5 years was 64%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market lost about 4.1% in the twelve months, Union Pacific shareholders did even worse, losing 17% (even including dividends). However, it could simply be that the share price has been impacted by broader market jitters. It might be worth keeping an eye on the fundamentals, in case there's a good opportunity. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 10% per year over half a decade. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider risks, for instance.

Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. With that in mind, the ROCE of Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) looks great, so lets see what the trend can tell us.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. To calculate this metric for Cisco Systems, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.21 = US$14b ÷ (US$96b - US$27b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to January 2023).Therefore, Cisco Systems has an ROCE of 21%. In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Communications industry average of 10%. View our latest analysis for Cisco Systems roceIn the above chart we have measured Cisco Systems' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Cisco Systems.The Trend Of ROCECisco Systems has not disappointed in regards to ROCE growth. We found that the returns on capital employed over the last five years have risen by 58%. That's not bad because this tells for every dollar invested (capital employed), the company is increasing the amount earned from that dollar. Speaking of capital employed, the company is actually utilizing 29% less than it was five years ago, which can be indicative of a business that's improving its efficiency. A business that's shrinking its asset base like this isn't usually typical of a soon to be multi-bagger company.Story continuesIn Conclusion...From what we've seen above, Cisco Systems has managed to increase it's returns on capital all the while reducing it's capital base. Investors may not be impressed by the favorable underlying trends yet because over the last five years the stock has only returned 22% to shareholders. So exploring more about this stock could uncover a good opportunity, if the valuation and other metrics stack up.On a final note, we've found   1 warning sign for Cisco Systems  that we think you should be aware of.If you want to search for more stocks that have been earning high returns, check out this free list of stocks with solid balance sheets that are also earning high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?
