Given the legitimate concerns for a US expat considering a move, it's crucial to acknowledge the present realities for prospective retirees in the home country, making it an idea that cannot be easily overlooked. The delicate balance between these considerations warrants thoughtful reflection and careful decision-making. After all, the cost of living in the country is, on average, an estimated 40% lower than that of the United States of America. Moreover, medicine and healthcare costs are almost 50% cheaper. There are beaches abound, food a plenty, and culture so diverse that a retiree is bound to feel alive.

Meanwhile, Mexico is one of the best countries for expats not only for its affordable costs and healthcare, but also because it has been enjoying a consistent ranking in the top 5 in the Expat Insider Survey since 2014.

Most of the supermarkets in the country are owned by Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) itself, a major factor that can make retirees feel at home. Top it all with the 1.5 million US residents living in the country, no wonder living here is quite easy. Lastly, Mexico's proximity to the U.S. enhances the expatriate experience, offering a sense of home that puts them at ease. An individual expat retiree can retire easily on $1,500 a month."", 'This brings us back to the question: Is Mexico safe? Or where in Mexico is it safe to retire, to be precise?

Other states have been assigned advisories such as “reconsider traveling”, “exercise increased caution”, and “exercise normal precautions”. Nevertheless, Mexico is a nice destination to retire to, and provided expats live in expat-communities and exercise due diligence, this country can prove to be a wonderful retirement destination.', 'Pixabay/Public Domain', 'To compile the list of safest places to retire in Mexico, we have chosen to go with a consensus approach based on the experiences of expats as well as websites such as Nasdaq, Travel & Leisure, US News & Money, International Living, and Finance Buzz, amongst others.

A two-bedroom near the beach, for instance, can cost around $2,000 a month. For those who choose to live towards the North side of this town can manage living expenses within this budget entirely.', 'Insider Monkey Score: 14', 'One of the safest cities in Mexico for expats is Oaxaca City or Oaxaca de Juarez. There are three major hospitals and plenty of doctors and dentists to tend to expats. Provided due diligence is done, the city is quite safe for retirees to live and enjoy a comfortable lifestyle.

Whether strolling along the endless stretches of white sandy beaches in Riviera Maya or cycling through the picturesque beachside city, there is an abundance of activities to enjoy in this world-class destination. There are many expat forums on social media for retirees to join and socialize with other expats in the same area. The cost of living in Playa del Carmen isn't much compared to the US. Houses near the shore are expensive while those farther away can be as much as 50% less of the cost. A two-bedroom can be easily rented for $1,000 and a single individual can afford to live a comfortable lifestyle for $1,700 a month."", 'Insider Monkey Score: 15', 'Number seven on our list of safest places to retire in Mexico for retirees is Puerto Vallarta. Many international visitors have acclaimed it to be one of the safest and friendliest places in the country, admiring it for its many beaches, restaurants, and bars, as well as its lively nightlife. Theaters and piano bars make this place all the more appealing, as do the many water activities that can be found in this destination. Just north of the town is a full-service Marina as well, with many expats enjoying the luxury of having their boats. A single individual retiree can enjoy living a life of comfort here in Puerto Vallarta for well under $1,500.', 'Insider Monkey Score: 16', 'Home to over 15,000 expats, Lake Chapala is another enticing place to retire in Mexico.

Fixating on a single price target can be unwise though, since the consensus target is effectively the average of analyst price targets. As a result, some investors like to look at the range of estimates to see if there are any diverging opinions on the company's valuation. Currently, the most bullish analyst values Under Armour at US$15.50 per share, while the most bearish prices it at US$8.00. Note the wide gap in analyst price targets? This implies to us that there is a fairly broad range of possible scenarios for the underlying business."", ""Taking a look at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can understand these forecasts is to see how they compare to both past performance and industry growth estimates. It's pretty clear that there is an expectation that Under Armour's revenue growth will slow down substantially, with revenues to the end of 2025 expected to display 1.1% growth on an annualised basis. This is compared to a historical growth rate of 3.6% over the past five years. By way of comparison, the other companies in this industry with analyst coverage are forecast to grow their revenue at 7.1% per year. So it's pretty clear that, while revenue growth is expected to slow down, the wider industry is also expected to grow faster than Under Armour."", ""The most important thing to take away is that there's been no major change in sentiment, with the analysts reconfirming that the business is performing in line with their previous earnings per share estimates. On the negative side, they also downgraded their revenue estimates, and forecasts imply they will perform worse than the wider industry. Even so, earnings are more important to the intrinsic value of the business. The consensus price target held steady at US$10.01, with the latest estimates not enough to have an impact on their price targets."", ""Following on from that line of thought, we think that the long-term prospects of the business are much more relevant than next year's earnings. We have forecasts for Under Armour going out to 2026, and you can see them free on our platform here."", ""You can also see our  analysis of Under Armour's Board and CEO remuneration and experience, and whether company insiders have been buying stock."", 'Have feedback on this article?

The economy appears to be on a firmer footing than it was previously presumed to be. As a result of that surprising strength, however, the Federal Reserve may not be cutting interest rates as soon or as aggressively as hoped. Political turmoil and uncertainty as to who will be the next president of the United States further complicates matters.', 'As a result, this may be a time to worry less about finding the right growth stocks -- or even the right value stocks -- and instead just pocketing as much cash as you can while you can.', ""With that as the backdrop, here's a rundown of three high-yield dividend stocks to consider scooping up before the calendar moves further into 2024."", 'A tobacco company? In this environment? What about the worldwide smoking cessation movement?', ""There's no denying efforts to get people to stop smoking are getting traction -- but it's not getting nearly as much traction as you might expect. Numbers from The Tobacco Atlas indicate the worldwide prevalence of regular smokers has fallen from nearly 23% of the population in 2007 to around 17% now; sheer population growth has kept the absolute number of smokers steady during that time."", ""Moreover, forecasts from the World Health Organization suggest the global number of tobacco users is only apt to be 4% less in 2025 than it was in 2015. That's modest progress, at best."", ""For income-minded investors, though, it's an opportunity."", ""Enter British American Tobacco (NYSE: BTI), parent to familiar cigarette brands like Camel, Pall Mall, and Lucky Strike.The total number of cigarettes it sells has actually held surprisingly steady in recent years, and any contraction it's experienced on the cigarette front has been offset by growth from its vaping and tobacco-heating brands like Vuse and Glo (respectively)."", 'Even British American Tobacco knows its cigarette business is living on borrowed time. The company plainly states, ""our purpose is to build \'A Better Tomorrow\' by reducing the health impact of our business through offering a greater choice of enjoyable and less risky products for our consumers."" Its foray into heated tobacco and vaping is part of that plan.', 'Even the relative safety of such products remains in question, though. The odds of its products remaining marketable into the distant futures seem low. That\'s why British American Tobacco can\'t be viewed as a true ""forever"" holding. The clock is ticking.', ""Its eventual end is arguably years and years down the road, however. You can plug into what's still a robust cash-creating operation in the meantime, stepping in while the stock's dividend yield is a similarly robust 9.7%."", ""Unlike British American Tobacco, Annaly Capital Management (NYSE: NLY) is a high-yield dividend stock you could hold on to indefinitely -- maybe even for a lifetime. Better yet, today's buyer will be getting in at an incredible yield of 13.5%. Not bad. Even if its payout never grows again or the underlying stock never makes gains again, that's still better than the stock market's average annual gain."", 'Realistically speaking, though, neither of those possibilities is a serious risk.', ""Annaly Capital Management isn't a conventional company. It's actually a real estate investment trust, or REIT, for short. That usually means the organization owns rent-bearing or revenue-bearing properties like apartment buildings, office buildings, or hotels. In Annaly Capital's case, however, it also means holding bundles of mortgage loans or even owning access to mortgage-servicing rights."", ""The key to success in the business? Earning more interest than you're paying out on money you've borrowed to buy assets, and collecting more in rent than a property costs you own."", ""That's been easier said than done of late. Interest rates on short-term borrowing have been greater than interest rates on long-term loans since the middle of 2022 (you may have recently heard this relatively rare phenomenon described as an inverted yield curve), throwing a wrench in the normal operating mechanics of REITs. Indeed, Annaly Capital's dividend has actually been regularly reduced since 2010, thanks to the abnormally low interest rates that have been in place since 2009."", ""The thing is, interest rates are now back near long-term norms, and likely to remain there for the foreseeable future. The yield curve is also inching its way back toward being un-inverted, restoring real estate investment trusts' usual profitability. It's conceivable that Annaly's dividend will finally go from being pressured by crimped cash flow to being expanded by wider margins. At the very least, the bulk of any dividend cuts are now in the past."", 'Last but not least, add real estate investment trust Realty Income (NYSE: O) to your list of ultra-high-yield dividend stocks to own if safe income is a priority for you in 2024.', ""OK, it may not be ultra-high-yield. While its dividend yield of 5.7% is certainly respectable -- and above the overall market's average yield -- that doesn't hold a candle to the kind of payouts British American Tobacco and Annaly Capital Management shareholders are seeing on their investments. It's still an attractive yield, though, given the relatively low degree of risk shareholders are taking on with Realty Income."", ""Like Annaly Capital Management, Realty Income is a REIT. But it's a very different kind of REIT. Realty Income's focus is retail real estate. Its top tenants are Walgreens, Dollar General, and Dollar Tree, although it's also landlord to names like Walmart and Starbucks."", ""At first blush, this niche seems risky. Brick-and-mortar retailing is a relatively cyclical business after all, and the industry as a whole is competing with e-commerce's growth."", 'Dig deeper, though: While retailing as a whole may be under fire, the bulk of Realty Income\'s tenants tend to be consumer staples retailers and essential service providers like gas stations. In fact, the REIT\'s management estimates that 91% of its total rent flow comes from tenants that are ""resilient to economic downturns and/or isolated from e-commerce pressures."" These tenants also tend to remain in place once a store has been established, as they\'ve already invested so much money in setting up shop in a particular location.', ""This is why Realty Income's been able to not just fund 643 consecutive monthly (yes, monthly) dividend payments, but raise its payout for 105 consecutive quarters. You won't find a much better track record than that -- especially with a stock yielding as much as Realty Income is right now."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Annaly Capital Management right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Annaly Capital Management, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Annaly Capital Management wasn’t one of them.

It operates pipelines, processing plants, and storage terminals that generate stable income backed by long-term contracts and government-regulated rate structures.', ""Last year, MPLX produced nearly $5.4 billion in cash, more than 7% above 2022's level. That gave it the money to cover its monster cash distribution by a comfy 1.6 times, even though it increased its payout by 10% for the second straight year. It used the cash it retained to invest in expansion projects and maintain its fortress-like balance sheet. The company has several projects slated to come online over the next two years. Meanwhile, it recently made a small acquisition. These growth-related investments will increase its cash flow, giving MPLX more fuel to increase its already hefty payouts. "", 'Clearway Energy (NYSE: CWEN)(NYSE: CWEN.A) is a clean energy-focused infrastructure company. It operates environmentally sound natural gas power plants and renewable energy projects. It sells the electricity these assets produce to utilities and large corporate buyers under long-term power purchase agreements that supply it with the predictable cash flows it uses to pay its generous dividend. ', 'The company has set a target of increasing its already sizable payouts by 5% to 8% each year, and management expects its hikes will come in toward the upper end of that range through 2026. Powering that growth are its investments in expanding its renewable energy portfolio. Clearway sold its thermal assets a couple of years ago and is recycling the proceeds from that transaction into higher-returning renewable energy investments. It has already signed deals to invest the proceeds into new projects that should close over the next few years as they go into commercial service. Those new investments give it lots of visibility into its future earnings and dividend growth. ', ""MAA (NYSE: MAA) is a REIT that primarily owns apartment communities in the fast-growing Sunbelt region. That geographic concentration enables MAA to benefit from strong demand, which keeps occupancy levels high while driving healthy rental growth rates. Its durable and growing rental income supports the REIT's attractive dividend. "", ""After paying dividends and ensuring it's maintaining a strong balance sheet, the apartment landlord invests its remaining cash in enhancing its portfolio. It routinely redevelops older properties by renovating units to capture higher rental rates. It will also invest in new developments and acquire additional properties. For example, MAA in October spent $102 million to buy a recently completed apartment community in Phoenix. Meanwhile, it's investing nearly $650 million to develop five new communities it expects to complete over the next two years. These investments help grow its cash flow, enabling the REIT to steadily increase its dividend. It gave investors a 5% raise at the end of last year. "", 'Verizon (NYSE: VZ) operates a leading telecom network. It generates significant cash flow as businesses and consumers pay their wireless and broadband bills. That gives it the money to invest in enhancing its network, paying dividends, and strengthening its balance sheet.', 'The telecom giant has increased its dividend annually for 17 straight years, the longest current streak in the U.S. telecom sector. Verizon is in an excellent position to continue increasing its payouts. Its investments in 5G should contribute to growing cash flow over time. Meanwhile, it expects its capital spending to decline in 2024 after it completed a major capital outlay early last year. That growing free cash flow will enable Verizon to pay down its debt faster, saving it money on interest expenses. It should also allow the telecom to continue increasing its big-time dividend. ', 'Realty Income, MPLX, Clearway Energy, MAA, and Verizon are all great dividend stocks for those seeking to generate income. They offer much higher-yielding payouts than most other stocks. Meanwhile, they should continue to increase those dividends in the future. Because of that, they will enable investors to make more money now and supply them with growing income streams over time.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Realty Income right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Realty Income, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Realty Income wasn’t one of them.

With various pressures due to changes in routes for ships, and production lapses due to conflicts, Yahoo Finance Senior Business Reporter Ines Ferré takes a closer look at what is happening, and what to expect.', 'For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.', ""Editor's note: This article was written by Eyek Ntekim"", '- Crude futures have been steadily climbing as persistent tensions in the Middle East show no signs of abating. Our very own Ines Ferre is here, tracking those moves in oil, Enes.', ""INES FERRE: Yeah, Brad. And we are looking at WTI that's above $77 per barrel. Brent crude also above $82 per barrel. A couple of developments this week. One is that Israel rejected the proposal from Hamas for a ceasefire, calling it delusional, basically."", ""So this has been lifting oil prices because that area, the Middle East area tensions, there's no clear signs of when those tensions will be abating, will be stopping. You've got also the Red Sea issues with cargo ships that are avoiding that Red Sea."", 'And also, the Strait of Hormuz, which is near Iran. Remember also that Iran produces more than 3 million barrels of oil a day. So were any of that to be knocked off, you would see higher oil prices. I do also want to mention the EIA data that came out this week, basically lowering its growth forecast for US oil production.', ""Those high levels that we saw in December 2023, the EIA isn't forecasting that to come again until February 2025. So that concern that we saw in the market about, perhaps, oversupply in the market this year, that concern is abating with those forecasts."", 'I just want to pull up a year to date chart for WTI and for Brent crude. WTI up more than 9%. Remember we started the year kind of bearish when it came to oil, but really solidly above that $75 threshold that we had been watching for so long.

And on that front, there aren't many companies that have been as consistent as Realty Income (NYSE: O). The real estate investment trust (REIT) has increased its dividend for 29 straight years, announcing its 643rd consecutive common stock monthly dividend in January."", ""To determine whether Realty Income's dividend is sustainable, let's first look at what the company does and how it grows its distribution, and then address what risks its dividend could face."", 'Realty Income owns a portfolio of real estate assets, primarily serving the retail sector. It also owns some industrial and gaming properties.', ""The REIT's main focus is leasing out its properties to economically resilient retailers that aren't being disrupted by e-commerce. This includes grocery stores, convenience stores, pharmacies, home improvement centers, dollar stores, and restaurants. Walgreens, Dollar General, Walmart, and Tractor Supply are some of its notable tenants. Its properties are generally freestanding single units. It doesn't own any malls, and its properties usually aren't attached to other tenants in a strip mall."", ""Realty Income's steady results can be attributed to its long leases, which typically have a 10-20-year initial term with rent escalators. It also employs what are known as triple net leases, in which the tenants are responsible for utilities, property taxes, and maintenance, shielding the REIT from unexpected cost increases."", 'Realty Income will add a bit more industrial exposure following the closing of its acquisition of Spirit Realty last month. The deal is expected to be immediately accretive because it will take out some overlapping corporate costs.', ""Realty Income generally finances the assets it acquires. As such, it makes money off the spread, or difference, between the cap rate on its properties and its funding costs. Cap rates are simply a lease's yield, which is calculated by taking a property's net operating income and dividing it by the purchase price of the asset. With higher interest rates, Realty Income is also able to get deals with higher cap rates, as cap rates tend to follow interest rates."", 'Acquiring properties -- or entire property portfolios -- is the primary way Realty Income grows its adjusted funds from operations (AFFO), which is one of the main metrics REITs use to measure the cash flow generation of their ongoing business operations, and thus their ability to maintain their dividend.', 'Going forward, Realty Income will fuel its growth via additional portfolio deals, as well as potential sale-leaseback arrangements, in which companies sell their real estate assets for cash and then lease them back from the new property owner. Of the $2 billion in real estate investments Realty Income made in the third quarter, $1.3 billion was in sale-leaseback transactions.', ""Another area of potential growth for Realty Income is Europe. It crossed the pond several years ago, opening a new market opportunity for the REIT. It benefits even more from inflation in Europe than in the U.S., because many of its agreements in Europe don't have a cap on their inflation escalators."", ""In recent years, Realty Income also hasn't been afraid to make investments in other areas as it looks to grow. It made a bet on the gaming industry recently, starting with a $1.7 billion sale-leaseback deal with Boston Harbor Casino in 2022. It then purchased a nearly 22% stake in the property of The Bellagio Las Vegas, which is operated by MGM Resorts. These deals got the REIT into a new vertical, and the Bellagio investment saw the company take a different approach to investing in real estate by acquiring an equity stake in a property."", 'Now, Realty Income and its dividend face risks as well. Sometimes tenants leave after leases are up, and sometimes they fail to pay rent or enter bankruptcy proceedings. The company recently dealt with this issue with Cineworld, and had to restructure its agreement with the European movie theater operator. At the end of the day, it says it will recapture 60%-85% of the rent it was owed. Given that the REIT owns properties, which can often be repurposed, Realty Income generally makes up much of the lost rent when it unexpectedly loses a tenant.', 'Another risk Realty Income faces is that as its debt matures, it could roll into higher interest rates. The company has a pretty steady amount of debt maturities over the next few years that it will need to refinance, including $1.8 billion coming due this year. In July 2023, Realty Income raised debt at an average annual yield of 5.08%, while its weighted average yield on fixed-rate debt maturing in 2024 is 4.48%.', 'As of right now, higher refinancing costs will likely be a headwind for Realty Income. However, its AFFO is set to solidly exceed its distribution next year. With AFFO projected to be around $4.00 based on company guidance and a dividend payout of about $3.08, the dividend is well covered.', ""As such, Realty Income's dividend is not only sustainable, but the REIT has plenty of room to continue growing it in 2024 and beyond. This should be supported by a combination of property and sale-leaseback acquisitions, European expansion, and its foray into casino properties."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Realty Income right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Realty Income, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Realty Income wasn’t one of them.

Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call.(Operator Instructions)As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Irene Prezelj, Vice President, Investor Relations and Communications for FirstEnergy Corp.', 'Irene M. Prezelj', ""Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to FirstEnergy's Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Review. Our President and Chief Executive Officer, Brian Tierney, will lead our call today, and he will be joined by Jon Taylor, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

The appendix of today's presentation includes supplemental information, along with the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. Now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Brian."", 'Brian X. Tierney', ""Thank you, Irene. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today and for your interest in FirstEnergy. It's hard for me to believe that I've been with the company for 8 months already. Time has flown by, as I've gotten to know the fantastic employees of this company who are dedicated to serving our customers every day. Some of you have heard me say previously that I consider myself to be a good teller of great stories. While our employees have given me a great story to tell for 2023, and I'll do my best to tell it well.This morning, I'll provide an overview of our financial performance for the fourth quarter and full year of 2023. I will discuss some regulatory milestones that we recently achieved. We are also unveiling today an exciting capital investment program focused almost entirely on our wires business. Over the next 5 years, we plan to invest $26 billion in our regulated system to improve reliability and the customer experience. This represents an increase of more than 44% compared to our last 5-year plan. We will maintain our vigilance on affordability as our current rates are below our in-state peers. Jon will provide more detail on this later.For the fourth quarter of 2023, FirstEnergy delivered GAAP earnings from continuing operations of $0.30 per share compared to a loss of $0.71 per share in the fourth quarter of 2022. Operating earnings for the quarter were $0.62 per share, which was above the midpoint of our quarterly guidance range and compared to $0.50 per share in the fourth quarter of 2022. For the year 2023, the company delivered GAAP earnings from continuing operations of $1.96 per share and operating earnings of $2.56 per share, $0.02 above the midpoint of our guidance range. Employees work diligently throughout the year to overcome significant headwinds.The impact of market conditions on our pension plan created an earnings drag of $0.30 per share and unusually mild weather impacted earnings by $0.28 per share. Through our continuous improvement program, employees were able to drive base O&M down over $200 million or 14% versus 2022. Half of those savings are sustainable, and this tremendous effort buoyed our full year results by $0.32 per share, allowing us to meet our operating earnings targets. In 2023, the company put $3.7 billion of CapEx to work to improve reliability and the customer experience. This was 16% more than was invested in 2022 and 9% more than budget. 93% of the 2023 CapEx was invested directly into our wires businesses.Our projects and construction organizations were able to take advantage of the improving supply chain environment and the mild weather to put the incremental dollars to work. 2023 was a game-changing year for the company in terms of strengthening its balance sheet to enable future investment and growth and are mostly wires regulated business. In February 2023, the company announced a second transaction with Brookfield to sell 30% of FET for $3.5 billion. With the successful completion of our Pennsylvania consolidation, and the anticipated order approving the filed settlement of the transaction, we are on track to close on this asset sale by the end of March. At that time, we will receive the majority of the proceeds in cash with the balance to be paid before the end of the year.In May, we successfully executed a $1.5 billion convertible debt issuance at a 4% coupon. We used these proceeds to pay down debt and make a $750 million contribution to our pension assets. In late December, we executed a $700 million pension lift-out representing over 8% of our total pension liability and reducing volatility in our pension plan by 10%. Our improved financial condition gave the board the confidence to raise the targeted dividend payout ratio to 60% to 70% of operating earnings.In September, the Board had the confidence to raise the quarterly dividend for the first time in more than 3 years. Of course, subject to Board approval, our 2024 plan includes dividend declarations of $1.70 per share versus $1.60 per share in 2023. This represents a 6.25% increase. Going forward, we anticipate growing our dividend with operating earnings growth. The significant improvement in our balance sheet puts FirstEnergy in a growth and investment mode. The fact that we do not expect incremental equity to fund our CapEx growth beyond our employee benefit programs differentiates FirstEnergy for many of our peers.We are introducing a $26 billion 5-year capital investment program to improve reliability and our customers' experience. We are branding this program, Energize 365 and Jon will provide more details in his remarks. These investments should enable 9% average annual growth in rate base over the period. We are guiding to $4.3 billion of investment in 2024, an increase of 15% over 2023. Energize 365 represents a significant increase in our investments and rate base with improved earnings quality. We expect to maintain a strong customer affordability position versus our in-state peers. We are reaffirming our 6% to 8% long-term annual operating earnings growth rate.FirstEnergy plans to execute on our long-term growth rate year-by-year. This is why we are announcing a 2024 operating earnings guidance range of $2.61 per share to $2.81 per share. The midpoint is 7% above 2023's operating earnings guidance midpoint.Turning to Slide 6. Let's take a look at our regulatory calendar. One of the questions investors have asked is, how will we know what FirstEnergy can obtain fair and reasonable regulatory outcomes? The answer that we have given is, to look for milestones in our near-term results. In 2023 and early 2024, we have achieved several milestones demonstrating constructive regulatory outcomes. Let me highlight a few.As we mentioned in our last call, we received a reasonable outcome in our Maryland distribution rate case. The commission there approved a $29 million revenue increase that supports equity returns of 9.5% and an equity ratio of 53%. We are pleased to serve and invest in Maryland to provide reliable and affordable electricity to our customers. In West Virginia, we filed a settlement in our ENEC case with staff of broad intervener support for a recovery of $255 million over 3 years with a carrying cost after year one. The settlement has no disallowances. In January of this year, we filed a settlement in our base rate case with staff and broad intervener support for $105 million rate adjustment based on a 9.8% allowed ROE and 49.6% equity ratio. This settlement reflects the $700 million increase in rate base since our last base rate case in 2014.Of course, we did not get everything we asked for, but the settlement is fair and constructive and it demonstrates West Virginia as an attractive place to invest for our customers. In New Jersey, JCP&L filed a base rate case settlement last Friday, with staff and broad intervener support that reflects an $85 million rate adjustment based on an ROE of 9.6% and a 52% equity ratio. The settlement reflects the $400 million increase in rate base since our last base rate case in 2021. The settlement will have a modest 3.4% increase in the average residential bill and JCP&L's rates will be 26% below our in-state peers. If approved, the settlement will be a fair and reasonable outcome that will incentivize JCP&L to make investments to improve customer reliability.In Pennsylvania, we received an order in December, improving the consolidation of our Pennsylvania operating companies and approving the transfer of West Pan Power's transmission assets to CATCo. Both transactions were executed on January 1 of this year. We are awaiting commission approval of the filed settlement for the FET minority interest sale, which is anticipated soon. We anticipate filing a base rate case in Pennsylvania by April. For investors looking for milestones of FirstEnergy's ability to receive a reasonable and constructive regulatory outcomes, these recent examples provide convincing evidence. In Ohio, we are actively working our way through our ESP V and Grid Mod II cases. We are fully engaged in the regulatory process with staff and interveners and expect constructive outcomes in both cases. We plan to file a base rate case in May.Turning to Slide 7. I want to briefly review the new segment reporting that FirstEnergy will adopt in 2024 to reflect how we are managing the company. Individual companies will not be split among the segments, leading to simplicity and transparency and reporting as well as accountability and management. Our Distribution segment will house our Ohio and Pennsylvania pure-play distribution-only companies. Our Pennsylvania consolidation and the transfer of the West Penn Power transmission assets to CATCo make this segment transparent and clean. This segment will represent about $10.9 billion in rate base serve 4.2 million customers and account for about 45% of forecasted 2024 operating earnings. A senior executive will lead each of FE Pennsylvania and Ohio.Our integrated business segment will report on JCP&L, Potomac Edison and Mon Power, our companies with combinations of distribution, transmission and generation. This segment will represent about $8.7 billion in rate base, serve 2 million customers and account for about 35% of forecasted 2024 operating earnings. A senior executive will lead JCP&L and another will lead Mon Power and Potomac Edison. Our last major business segment will be stand-alone transmission and it will house our pure-play transmission-only companies, consisting of our ownership interest in FET as well as CATCo.This segment will represent about $7.7 billion in consolidated rate base and account for about 20% of forecasted 2024 operating earnings. One executive will be responsible for these businesses. Finally, the Corporate and other segment will be similar to the current segment with (inaudible). It will report holding company interest legacy investments, former subsidiaries and pension and OPEB. A recast of 2023 into the new segments is available in our fact book and we will provide quarterly and year-to-date reconciliations throughout 2024.Let me provide some key updates on Slide 8. In regard to the Ohio organized crime investigations Commission, there's nothing new to report. We continue to cooperate with the commission and answer any questions they ask. The deferred prosecution agreement with the DOJ details FirstEnergy's involvement and there is nothing new with respect to the company. In the updated climate strategy published to our corporate responsibility website yesterday, we are providing an update to our greenhouse gas emissions goals.In 2020, we set a goal of achieving net carbon neutrality by 2050, with an interim goal of reducing our Scope 1 greenhouse gas emissions by 30% by 2030. Achieving the 2030 interim goal was predicated on meaningful emissions reductions at our Fort Martin and Harrison power plants in West Virginia, which account for approximately 99% of our greenhouse gas emissions. We've identified several challenges to our ability to meet that interim goal, including resource adequacy concerns in the PJM region and state energy policy initiatives. Given these challenges, we have decided to remove our 2030 interim goal. Through regulatory filings in West Virginia, we have forecast the end of the useful life of Fort Martin in 2035 and for Harrison in 2040. We remain focused on achieving our aspirational goal of net carbon neutrality by 2050.In the fourth quarter of last year, we made 2 key additions to our leadership team. In November, we announced our hiring of Toby Thomas as Chief Operating Officer. Toby joined us from American Electric Power where he spent more than 2 decades in various leadership positions, including growing and managing one of the largest wires businesses in the country. He is responsible for system planning and protection, transmission, substation and engineering project and construction management and system operations.Wade Smith joined the company in December as the President of FirstEnergy Utilities. He was previously the Chief Operating Officer of Puget Sound Energy. Wade brings more than 3 decades of experience running large-scale multistate transmission and distribution companies. The presidents of our 5 operating businesses will report to him. Ohio, Pennsylvania, JCP&L, our stand-alone transmission business and Mon Power and Potomac Edison. We are actively reviewing internal and external candidates to run these businesses and expect to make hiring announcements in the coming months. Wade and Toby are key additions to the leadership team that will grow and transform this company into a premier electric utility. In 2023 and continuing into 2024, we have made transformational strides to improve the financial strength of FirstEnergy. We have organized our company with a singular focus on growing our 5 regulated, mostly wires companies we are making the investments needed to improve reliability and the customer experience. Our strong balance sheet and organic investment opportunities differentiate FirstEnergy for many of our peers.With that, I will turn the call over to Jon."", 'K. Jon Taylor', ""Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. I'm also very proud of our performance in 2023, and I'm excited to turn a new page in our company's history. Today, I'll briefly review our 2023 results, but more importantly, discuss our enhanced 5-year plan and 2024 guidance. Our results in 2023 speak to our employees' dedication and tremendous performance, which included strategic and transformational initiatives while doing the hard work to meet our financial commitments in a very challenging year and emerge as a stronger, more nimble company.Since I've been at the company, I can't recall a more challenging year in terms of the financial headwinds we faced, including the most abnormal weather conditions that I can remember, the extremely volatile interest rate environment and a significant impact on our pension plan from the interest rate and equity market performance in 2022 But at the same time, our employees demonstrated their grid and resiliency to overcome these adversities while making strategic advancements to improve our operational and financial performance. Fourth quarter operating earnings were $0.62 a share, which is above the midpoint of our guidance. This compares to 2022 fourth quarter operating earnings of $0.50 a share. For the year, operating earnings were $2.56 this year, also above the midpoint of our guidance range. This represents 7% growth of 2022's guidance midpoint and compares favorably to operating earnings of $2.41 a share in 2022.Fourth quarter and full year results are detailed in the strategic and financial highlights document we posted to our IR website last night. As we pointed to throughout the year, we largely offset the headwinds I mentioned earlier through a strong focus on reduced operating expenses across each of our business units, the deployment of proceeds from the low-cost convertible debt offering in the spring and certain tax benefits realized in the third quarter. Our focus on operating expenses across the company resulted in a 14% or over $200 million reduction year-over-year, representing a $0.32 per share year-over-year benefit.As we've discussed, about 50% of that represents unique items or work that was accelerated in '22 from '23, the other 50%, which largely includes productivity improvements across the company, lower contractor usage and reduced corporate spending on areas such as branding and advertising are sustainable reductions to our cost structure. Our 2023 results benefited from our formulary investment programs across our transmission and distribution businesses, which resulted in a $0.20 per share improvement year-over-year.As Brian mentioned, we successfully deployed $3.7 billion of capital in 2023, about $300 million or close to 10% above our original capital investment plan for the year. In our transmission business, earnings increased $0.08 a share or close to 10% for the year, primarily from our investment programs, which resulted in rate base growth of 9% compared to 2022. Formula rate investments in our transmission business were $1.8 billion, an increase of 28% compared to 2022 and $100 million or 6% above our original plan due to emergent projects.In our distribution business, earnings declined year-over-year primarily from the lower weather-related distribution sales and the lower pension credit I spoke of earlier, but also reflect the impact of our formula rate investment programs new rates that went into effect in Maryland in mid-October, higher weather-adjusted demand and lower operating costs that I spoke of. Distribution CapEx of $1.9 billion represents an increase of 5% compared to 2022, and exceeded our original plan by $220 million or 13% as part of our planned increases we announced last year.Finally, in our Corporate segment, '23 results benefited from lower O&M and a consolidated effective tax rate of about 16% versus nearly 21% in 2022, mostly as a result of planned use of state net operating loss carryforwards. And a final point on '23. As Brian discussed, we executed a $700 million pension lift out in December, representing about 8% of our total pension liability associated with our former generation subsidiaries. Removing this obligation from our balance sheet at a 5% discount will reduce future earnings volatility related to fluctuations in pension assets and liabilities and lowers overall pension plan costs.We will continue pursuing opportunities to further derisk the pension plan through additional lift outs and pursuing pension tracking mechanisms through the regulatory process.Now let's shift gears and talk about our outlook going forward. We are very pleased to introduce our 5-year financial plan supporting our commitments to our investors, including 6% to 8% long-term annual operating earnings growth with significantly improved earnings quality investment-grade credit metrics and dividend growth in line with earnings growth. The cornerstone of this plan is a robust Energized 365 grid evolution investment plan of $26 billion, with approximately 75% of planned investments in formula rate programs that provide real-time returns. The plan includes increasing annual investments in our transmission and distribution system each year, resulting in 9% average annual rate base growth.Energize 365 supersedes our long-standing our long-standing Energizing the Future transmission program, which we're sunsetting after a decade of strong performance. Our plan targets investments that improve the customer experience and supports the energy transition or new load requirements while ensuring a fair and reasonable regulated return for our investors. The capital program is 45% weighted in FERC-regulated transmission investments in our stand-alone transmission and integrated businesses, and includes investments to enhance and upgrade the transmission system add operational flexibility to support projects like New Jersey offshore wind and new data center load and regulatory required projects.On the distribution system, the plan includes investments by our distribution and integrated segments to improve the customer experience through reliability enhancements, grid modernization and clean energy investments such as smart meter deployment, distribution automation and energy efficiency programs. This comprehensive 5-year investment plan is very solid with flexibility to adjust as projects and programs emerge. Over the next couple of years we anticipate an increase in earnings from our formula rate investment programs and as we rerate base distribution rates for over for $19 billion of state regulated rate base. Our plan builds off the approved or settled base rate cases in Maryland, West Virginia and New Jersey, our integrated segment, representing $7 billion in rate base that was earning 400 basis points below the allowed returns as well as scheduled base rate cases in Pennsylvania and Ohio later this year, where we have $12 billion in projected rate base in our distribution segment. It is also forecasted to be unearned.The true-up of returns will allow us to earn closer to our allowed regulated returns and to significantly improve the earnings quality of the company with expected declines in the earnings contribution from Signal Peak. In longer term, annual rate base growth with planned investments in formula rate programs, more timely recovery of base capital investments and cost discipline with our operating expenses will result in less regulatory lag than we've seen historically with modest and reasonable customer bill impacts. We expect our utilities to maintain their strong affordability position and keep rates at or below our end-state peers.Energize 365 will be funded with cash from operations, which we expect to average $4 billion plus annually, building off our 2024 cash flow projections as well as regulated long-term debt issuances and a portion of the $3.5 billion in proceeds from the FET transaction. And our plan does not include any incremental equity needs beyond our existing employee equity programs and it supports FFO to debt of 14% to 15% and FE Corp debt at or below 20% of total debt. Our 2024 guidance range of $2.61 to $2.81 a share represents a 7% increase off the midpoint of our 2023 guidance, which will largely be back-end loaded given the timing of new rates in West Virginia and New Jersey and O&M Mark plan for Q1 of this year.With this in mind, our projection for the first quarter are operating earnings of $0.48 a share to $0.58 a share. To give you some color on the year-over-year increase, our midpoint of $2.71 a share reflects 12% consolidated regulated growth offset by a decline in Signal Peak's earnings contribution. The increase reflects new rates and investments, largely from approved or settled base rate cases in our integrated segment, where we anticipate new rates for our West Virginia and New Jersey settlements to be implemented late in the first quarter and ongoing formula rate investments in each of our businesses.A return to normal weather-related customer demand, higher operating expenses reflecting the timing of O&M activities that I spoke of earlier, and new depreciation rates on our fossil generating facilities as part of the settlement we reached in West Virginia. It's important to note that our 2024 planned O&M is $140 million or 10% below 2022 levels, and when you adjust for timing such as planned generation outages, our O&M is $100 million or 6% below 2022, reflecting permanent cost reductions. Other drivers include improved earnings quality from the lower earnings contribution from our Signal Peak mining asset and a higher effective tax rate. The dilution from the FET transaction is largely offset by lower interest expense, representing planned debt retirements and interest income from the vendor takeback note as part of the FET transaction.Our $4.3 billion capital investment plan for this year represents a 16% increase compared to 2023. And is largely funded with $4 billion in cash from operations, which has improved year-over-year from several unique items that occurred in 2023, such as the $750 million pension contribution, contract termination costs and severance and employee separation costs as well as increases from growth and cost recovery in our regulated businesses and improved working capital. With the improvement in cash flow, closing on our FET minority interest sale and deployment of those proceeds, we're targeting 14% to 15% FFO to debt by year-end.2023 was a challenging but remarkable year, a year of significant transition, innovation and improvement with outstanding operational and financial execution from our 12,000 employees. Today, our company is a much stronger position, and we have a comprehensive plan for continued growth. Thank you for your time today.But before we go to Q&A, I'll turn the call back over to Brian."", 'Brian X. Tierney', ""Thank you all for joining us today. I'm excited about our company. We're building a strong track record of execution. We have a fantastic business model and a robust plan for the future. Starting with the initial Brookfield and Blackstone investments announced in late 2021, we have significantly improved the balance sheet via $7 billion in equity capital. And it was raised in a very shareholder-friendly manner, the equivalent of issuing common equity at $87 per share. In the past year, we've achieved several important regulatory milestones, representing constructive outcomes for FirstEnergy and our customers. This includes $219 million of increased revenues through base rate cases that will fuel our investments in reliable and affordable service.Energize 365, our 5-year $26 billion investment plan is an increase of more than 44% from our previous 5-year capital investment plan and it's funded with organic internal cash flow and utility debt, not incremental equity. We have a long-term 6% to 8% annual operating earnings growth trajectory with significantly improved earnings quality. This tremendous work together with the cultural changes and focused on continuous improvement has transformed our company. We have accomplished a lot and we're committed to executing on our plan to deliver the full value of this company to shareholders.Now let's open the call to your questions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions)Our first question comes from Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.', 'Shahriar Pourreza', ""Just, Brian, good to see the roll forward of the 6% to 8%. I guess as we're thinking about some of the sort of the earnings headwinds like Signal Peak becoming sort of immaterial next year and potential maybe future pension drag, I guess, any sense on how we should think about the linearity of that growth off the '24 base, could we see some maybe near-term gyrations around the 6% to 8%? Or you have enough contingencies to maintain that linearity?"", 'Brian X. Tierney', ""Sure. It's going to be really linear. We're not going to see much volatility. We're getting back to where a normal utility should look like. We're going to be investing in our regulated properties. And obviously, a lot of that recovery is going to come through formula-based rates. So that is -- tends to be linear, about 75% through formula base rates. And then we're going to be regularly going in for rate cases. And it's just the normal cadence of how a utility operates. You invest, you operate, you recover and you finance. And that's the cadence that we're going to be on."", 'Shahriar Pourreza', ""Got it. And the 9% rate base growth is obviously very solid. Is there still I guess, some incremental CapEx opportunities we should be thinking about in the 5-year plan. I know, obviously, John highlighted some flexibility there in the prepareds, and then any sort of rule of thumb we should think about if there is incremental equity -- incremental CapEx? Could it come with incremental equity? Or you have enough cushion in the credit metrics to not have to tap the equity markets even if there's incremental CapEx?"", 'Brian X. Tierney', ""Yes. I think we have enough cushion for sure. And we're seeing things like the PJM Open Window 3 that we responded to, where the team worked really hard to put together a solution in a short period of time, and we were able to garner over $800 million of incremental investment through that opportunity. I see more of those coming. They're not in our capital plan yet, and they won't be until we win the projects. But there's significant amounts of new CapEx that's not in our plan that I anticipate will see coming down, and we'll be able to fund that through a combination of cash flow from operations, debt equity issuances and things like the $3.5 billion of equity that's going to come into our system in 2024 from the transaction. So we're ready to fund these incremental CapEx the way a traditional utility would without having to see much access for equity from the equity capital markets."", 'Shahriar Pourreza', 'And then I think, I am sorry...', 'K. Jon Taylor', ""No, no. I would just reiterate kind of what you said. I mean had we not done the transactions over the course of the last couple of years, raising $7 billion of equity capital, really at the equivalent of a 36x PE multiple, we wouldn't be in this position today. I think a lot of it depends on formula rate CapEx versus base capital I think if you look at some of our utility capital structures, they have equity layers that are a little bit better than our targeted equity capital structure. So we have some flexibility in the plan."", 'Shahriar Pourreza', ""Perfect. And just real quick, lastly, on just -- Brian, I think you answered this, but on the OOCIC process. It doesn't sound like there's any updates its status quo. So is it fair to assume -- I haven't seen the K yet, but when it's released, we shouldn't see anything surprising in that."", 'Brian X. Tierney', 'Yes. No surprises at all, Shar. Status quo, they ask questions, we answer them and nothing new with regards to the company from what was disclosed in the deferred prosecution agreement.', 'Operator', 'Our next question is from Gregg Orrill with UBS.', 'Gregg Gillander Orrill', ""Congratulations on rolling out the new plan. So just on the cash from operations guidance. Is the guidance that the new base for growth is $4 billion and you grow off of that? Or it that's the average over the plan and there's sort of -- it's down and then you're above that level toward the end of the plan?"", 'K. Jon Taylor', 'Gregg, this is Jon. In all years, it will be $4 billion or more of cash from operations. Some of it will be just growth in our regulated programs, offset by maybe some changes in working capital. But on average, over the 5-year period, it will be north of $4 billion.', 'Gregg Gillander Orrill', 'Okay. Maybe just a follow-up for Brian. How do you sort of reconcile the idea of coming forward with the new plan that adds such a significant amount of new capital to the prior plan?', 'Brian X. Tierney', ""We're in a different place, Gregg. The work that's been done on the balance sheet since 2021, as we laid out, has been truly transformative for the first time, I think, in the company's history, we're not distracted by M&A. We don't have a competitive arm. We have a strong balance sheet with the opportunity to invest in our regulated mostly wires companies that, to be honest with, we got behind on the capital investment in them. And that's why our rate base is lower. It's why our rates are lower, and it's why we have some significant opportunities with regards to reliability and the customer experience. We are here for the first time, ready, willing and able to put the money into our regulated properties for the benefit of our customers, and it is a significant difference from what you've seen in the past."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from Nicholas Campanella with Barclays.', 'Nicholas Joseph Campanella', ""Happy Friday. Thanks for all the updates. I guess just to follow up on Greggs question because the CapEx raise is pretty material across the board. Obviously, it's good to see just -- how should we kind of I think about customer build growth to achieve this plan as it relates to just the upcoming filings and then just through the plan as well, please?"", 'Brian X. Tierney', ""Yes. So we think the increases will be in the single digit for most of the time for the 5-year period. If you look, Nicholas, at Page 23 in the fact book that we put out there in New Jersey through West Virginia and Maryland, our rates are 22% to 30% below our in-state peers. And in Ohio, there -- in Pennsylvania, they're 3% to 7% below our in-state peers. A lot of that in New Jersey, Western Virginia, Maryland represents opportunities to invest in the rate base and improve the customer experience. But also more importantly, if you look at things like customer affordability between 97 -- 1997 and 2022, our customers' electricity share of wallet has decreased to 1.3% from 1.6%. So when we talk to smart people who cover our industry and they say that you need to start getting concerned when you're at 4% to 5% share of your customers' wallet. We're nowhere near that. And electricity, whether it's for home heating, whether it's to power your vehicles or whatever still represents a considerable value for the customers in the states we serve."", 'K. Jon Taylor', ""Nick, this is Jon. And I'll just add on to that. If you look at the cases where we have approvals or settlements on file in our integrated business, if you just kind of compare to where we were since the last rate case, it's an average of 1% or 1% lower than the last time -- if you do that on an annual basis. And in fact, if you step back a little bit more and just look at the increases in customer bills over the last couple of years, most of that is generation related. And if we were to snap the line today with new generation service, for instance, in Ohio and Pennsylvania, you would see build decreases somewhere between 4% and 8%."", 'Nicholas Joseph Campanella', ""Got it. That's helpful. And then I guess just kind of a similar question on what's embedded in the plan here. And I'm just thinking about earned ROEs. Obviously, New Jersey is pretty low here, that will improve with the settlement. How do we think about kind of Ohio? And if you get an improvement versus your slides here, is that baked into the plan? Or just how should we kind of think about that?"", 'Brian X. Tierney', ""Yes. As we talked about, the next couple of years will be very important as we true up our state-regulated returns to more of their allowed return. So I think about Ohio and Pennsylvania, which will be next to file. Ohio right now is earning sub-6%. Some of that is weather-driven, but we do see an opportunity to true up the return there. And then in Pennsylvania, although it's above 9%, a lot of the O&M that's coming back in the system will be in our Pennsylvania company, which will reduce the ROE there. And we use it projected test year for our Pennsylvania company. So you'll be adding about $1 billion of rate base between where it is today and the filing that we'll make later this year."", 'Nicholas Joseph Campanella', ""Okay. And then just one last one, just on the load growth, 1% embedded in the plan. Places like PJM have just continued to see demand revisions higher. And I'm just wondering if that's conservative at all?"", 'Brian X. Tierney', ""So like capital projects and other things, we don't want to put forecast growth in until we're seeing it. And we're seeing it at about that 1% range. As things develop and go forward, like you've seen data centers in PJM and the like. We think we're going to get that here. You're seeing it to the south of us, you're seeing it to the east of us, and I think that migration will continue into our service territory. In fact, we fully believe it will. And then as you see other things like electrification of transportation and the like, I think there is some upside in the load growth. We just don't want to bake it into the plan until we're seeing it and are confident that it's coming."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from Michael Sullivan with Wolfe Research.', 'Michael P. Sullivan', 'Thanks for all the new disclosures. Just in terms of -- you mentioned kind of milestones on the regulatory front. How should we think about Grid Mod II and the ESP playing out over the next couple of months? And how, if any, that can inform the base rate filing coming in May in Ohio?', 'Brian X. Tierney', ""So we're working those regulatory processes, and you're going to see that from us. You're going to see certain things are in flight and certain things are coming and look for us to be making progress on what's in flight, and that will foreshadow what's coming down the road. ESP V and Grid Mod II, we're working through those regulatory processes. I was reviewing last night, and we'll file today our post-hearing briefing on ESP V, and we expect a constructive outcome there as we do in Grid Mod II. But regulatory tends not to move very fast. These are months long processes. And we think that the process is in both ESP V and Grid Mod II are constructive. And we anticipate it will be the same, but an actually longer process for our base rate case, which we'll file in April of this year. So we're just moving along. Things are happening as they should, and we're getting these constructive outcomes."", 'Michael P. Sullivan', ""Okay. Great. And then just on pension and limiting volatility there. Can you just give a sense on where we go forward, how much more lift out can potentially be done? And then just how you're feeling about ability to implement mechanisms? I know there were some language around that in some of the cases you already had, but nothing too prescriptive, I don't think. So yes, just the path forward on limiting pension volatility."", 'K. Jon Taylor', ""Yes, Michael. So we have another $700 million of former generation pension liabilities that we're looking at right now as to whether or not we should execute a lift-out transaction, something that we'll likely do this year if the market conditions warrant that. And then on the regulatory front, as we talked about before, some of these things take a couple of bites at the apple before we can get them in place. We did get authority to at least make a filing in West Virginia and New Jersey as part of the settlements. And we'll be thoughtful once we go through that process and get a final order on the cases as to the next steps there."", 'Michael P. Sullivan', ""Okay. Great. Just last one, maybe a little more philosophical, but just seeing kind of how the reporting season has gone so far, I think we've seen a lot of your peers kind of going the other direction in terms of dividend payout and growth. And I know you're coming from like a different starting point, but maybe just how you think about that in the context of the sector not trading well, and just other levers that you have, how you thought about continuing to grow the dividend with earnings and the payout where you have it?"", 'Brian X. Tierney', ""Yes. So we are at a different place than our peers. Announcing the increase that we did in September, the first and over 3 years, it's time to start rewarding our shareholders with dividend increases. And we felt that now is the time to do that. So September and anticipated in 2024, increases there as well. It's time for us to treat our shareholders the way utility companies traditionally do. And we're in a place where we're going to be growing the dividend with earnings over time. Our balance sheet is healthy. We don't have the equity needs that some of our peers do because of the transactions that we've done over the last 3 years or so. So we're in a different place and where some of our peers are, and we think it's a really good place."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.', 'Jeremy Bryan Tonet', 'Just wanted to dive in a little bit more on the guide here talking about rate base CAGR 9% relative to 6% to 8% EPS CAGR without additional equity needs. So I was just looking to kind of marry those 2 data points given the stronger pace of rate base growth there. Is there anything else we should be thinking about, especially the Signal Peak and pension OPEB become a smaller part of the equation?', 'Brian X. Tierney', ""It's really the things that we mentioned in our remarks. It's going in for base rate cases and updating rate base, updating returns, cost structure and those things that haven't been done in some time the 3 cases, Maryland, New Jersey and West Virginia that we've just been in Pennsylvania and Ohio coming up this year. It's a significant amount of updating the regulatory process and recovery. And then increasing as we've announced today with Energize 365, the CapEx that we're going to be investing in our regulated properties going forward.So it's the way utility operations should work. And I repeat this over and over again internally. You invest in your properties and your people, you operate safely, reliably, affordably -- you go in for recovery and if you've done invest and operate well, the recovery component goes better when you're in front of our regulators -- and then we come before investors and we tell them the story that we put together on those first 3 components and financing the companies easier as well. So we're in a place where we're at the beginning of what I call that virtuous cycle and the success that we've had and the rate cases that I discussed in my prepared remarks show that we're getting those fair and constructive outcomes, and we anticipate that going forward in the plan as well. It all holds together as a credible story where we're having success at the beginning point of that."", 'Jeremy Bryan Tonet', 'Got it. Maybe to rephrase the question slightly. Just if the rate base CAGR is 9%, are there any other drags besides lag to make EPS growth only 6% to 8%? Or is that a degree of conservatism?', 'Brian X. Tierney', ""So Jeremy, I would say it this year, just as you saw in '24, the '24 guide, you saw the step-down in Signal Peak from $0.24 to $0.12. You'll see another step down from $0.24 to $0.25. But at the same time, that's when we're truing up these rate bases that I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the $7 billion this year, the $12 million that we'll file in Pennsylvania and Ohio for this year. And then after that, it's more traditional rate base growth, a little bit of regulatory lag, but we're going to do everything we can to minimize any difference between our earned returns and our allowed returns."", 'K. Jon Taylor', ""Yes. I think it's important to note that the part that Jon mentioned about pension and Signal Peak decreasing as they decrease and as the traditional regulatory component of our growth increases, our earnings quality improves, and that happens really, really quickly in our plan. So that's also a benefit. It's not just growing earnings, it's a reduced risk profile as well."", 'Jeremy Bryan Tonet', 'Got it. Very helpful. And then I just wanted to go back, I guess, to customer bill impacts. And I think you quoted some helpful numbers there as far as share of wallet that the bill will represent in New Jersey. But I just wanted to see, I guess, in Pennsylvania, Ohio, is it kind of similar share of wallet expectations over the forecast period? Or any color you can provide there?', 'Brian X. Tierney', ""It is. That was -- the numbers that I gave you of share of wallet was an average across our 5 states. So -- and it's not significantly different in any one of those, but it's very, very low."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions)Our next question comes from Michael Lonegan with Evercore ISI.', 'Michael B. Lonegan', ""So you've talked about some sustainable O&M you've taken out of your business and a larger increase this year and then after that account for less than 2% increases over time. Given the significant ramp-up in CapEx over the years of your planning period, presumably, you'd have to expand your workforce or use of contractors is my guess to work on complete all those projects. I was just wondering, how are you planning on managing your O&M within that 2% increase level? Is there room to take out more existing costs out of the business?"", 'Brian X. Tierney', ""So I'll say this. A lot of what we talked about is actually CapEx that we're increasing. So it's not directly related to O&M. We recognize there's an O&M tail that's associated with any incremental CapEx, but we're going to be very, very focused on continuous improvement. And it's going to be part of our story that we're going to tell every time we're getting together going forward about how -- what we've been able to do and how we've been able to reduce O&M through continuous improvement. And it's just going to be part of our story going forward like it was in 2023. And you see well-functioning premium utilities are always talking about what they're doing in that regard. And we've had success here in our recent past doing that, and we anticipate that going forward."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Angie Storozynski with Seaport Global.', 'Agnieszka Anna Storozynski', ""Just a bigger picture question. So investors seem excited about the load growth accelerating load growth associated with data centers, the obvious way to play this trend, this through generation companies, but also through vertically integrated utilities that actually own generation. You guys except as Virginia a wires-only business. And I'm just wondering if you do expect to have this secondary benefit associated with the load growth, again, translating into either higher T&D CapEx or maybe improved affordability because of higher volumes. I mean you name it. Just wondering if you see that benefit accruing to you as well."", 'Brian X. Tierney', ""Thank you for the question, Angie. We absolutely do. And you're right, being mostly a wires company, certainly in 4 of our 5 states. We don't have as much of the generation opportunity. But I mentioned in my remarks in answer to an earlier question, the opportunity that we had associated with the PJM Open Window 3 for incremental transmission investment over $800 million. I had the pleasure of going out to our Maryland service territory late last year and got to go see what's going on at that quantum loophole data center development it is unbelievable what's going on out there. They are recreating something that's on the scale of the data center footprint in Northern Virginia, out kind of in the hills of Western Maryland. And it's at a site of a former aluminum smelter out there.So you have these high-voltage transmission lines that go and just stop in the middle of space where the smelter used to be and where they're investing, they're turning dirt, they're moving ground right now, to build one of the largest data center complexes in the world. So we're seeing it in Maryland. It's going to be coming to Pennsylvania, in Ohio for us as well, and we're hopeful for New Jersey and West Virginia over time. So it's coming and it's real and it does create incremental investment opportunities for us."", 'Agnieszka Anna Storozynski', ""And then just one last follow-up. So you mentioned affordability. Your rates are obviously so much lower than your peers. Your assets seem underinvested when you look at rate base per customer. But I'm just wondering because all of these investments or acceleration of investment happens in a low power price environment, given the load growth, this low power price environment is not sustainable. So I'm just wondering what happens to that investment plan when power prices go up meaningfully. And so the customer bill meaningful increases because of that commodity component."", 'Brian X. Tierney', ""So it's a good question, Angie. I think we've already seen some of that associated with things like the war in Ukraine and the like. And we saw that in some of the polar prices that we have when we went out for auctions during the period when we thought prices were going to be really, really high because of what's going on in Europe. And some of those price spikes went through to our customers, really in Ohio, beginning like the day I started on June 1 of last year. So we saw some of those price spikes go through to customer rates, and now they're coming off.As Jon mentioned earlier, we're having auctions that are printing lower prices and those lower prices are passing through to our customers. So I don't see that as being a big concern. There are some things that are moderating that impact. And again, our prices are so low. The share of wallet is so low for us that electricity still represents a significant value to customers in all 5 of our states."", 'Operator', 'Next question comes from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.', 'Paul Patterson', ""Just wanted to sort of touch base again. I apologize on this single-digit increase, is that rates? Or is it bills? And can you be a little bit more specific in terms of what that means, obviously, there's a big range there, right? Just a little bit more elaboration as to what you see sort of the rate trajectory range being associated with the with what you're planning long term?"", 'K. Jon Taylor', ""Well, Paul, so this is Jon. So I would tell you that as we think about the cases that we filed this year, the increases since the last rate case are single digits, like low, low single digits. So on average. New Jersey was 3.4%. But on an average basis since the last rate case, it's probably less than 1% a year."", 'Paul Patterson', ""And that's what you see going forward? Is that -- when you -- low single digits is what you guys been?"", 'K. Jon Taylor', ""Well, I think you got to think of it this way. We haven't been in for a rate case in Pennsylvania for quite some time. Ohio, we haven't been in almost over a decade. So I do think there'll be some increases there. But when you average it out since the time of the last rate case, it's very manageable."", 'Paul Patterson', ""Okay. And then finally, on [Grid mart], do you see any settlement possibility? I know you guys sort of had thought about that before. There was sort of a delay in staff testimony. It looks like you're now talking about hearings. You expect that to be fully litigated at this point?"", 'Brian X. Tierney', ""Look, we're always open to the settlement option and think that's always preferable. If we're going to go to hearing like we have in ESP V, we're okay with that. We think we'll get positive outcomes. And in any regard, Paul, the settlement discussions that we have start to frame people's positions for where they'll be at the table at a hearing. And so we view it as being a constructive process even if we have to go to hearing."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley.', 'David Keith Arcaro', ""I was just wondering, could you refresh us on any strategic options that might be available for the Signal Peak business as you're thinking about that now?"", 'K. Jon Taylor', ""In this environment, there's not a lot of options. Obviously, we look at that quite frequently. It's not a core business for us. We've looked at that in the past several times. It's just -- there's not a lot of buyers out there. And so the options are fairly limited. But if you think about it in the grand scheme of things, it's going to be such a de minimis part of our company moving forward. that it's not going to have the same impact that it's had the last couple of years."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Sophie Karp with KeyBanc Capital Markets.', 'Sophie Ksenia Karp', 'Most of my questions have been answered -- most of my questions have been answered. Maybe I can just ask you about the balance sheet. Are you completely happy with the balance sheet shape at this point? And if not, what are the incremental goals here in terms of credit ratings, incremental balance sheet strength? Or are you completely satisfied that you kind of done?', 'Brian X. Tierney', ""Yes. Thank you for the question, Sophie. We are really pleased with the shape of the balance sheet at this point. we're going to get the incremental $3.5 billion in the door in 2024, most of that coming in March of this year anticipated with the Brookfield transaction, that caps off what's a total of about a $7 billion raise over the last 3 years. That work has been intentional and purposeful by the Board and the management team even before I got here, for sure, to strengthen that balance sheet. So we'd be in the position that we are today to be able to invest the way that we've laid out for you today in our regulated properties. We anticipate by the end of being at 2024 of being at a 14% to 15% FFO to debt range. And we're anticipating rating agency positive actions associated with the strength of our balance sheet. So we're really, really pleased with where we are from a balance sheet strength situation."", 'K. Jon Taylor', ""Yes. And Sophie, I would just add, if you think about where the company has come from withholding company debt probably in the 30% plus range, Today, it's 26% with a plan to get it to 20% or better by 2026. And that's a strong story. And it really started back in late 2021 when we announced the equity transactions with Blackstone and Brookfield and then we followed it up with a second transaction with FET for another $3.5 billion. And we all did that in a very shareholder-friendly way. So we're excited about where the balance sheet is headed, and we wouldn't have this capital plan without the strong balance sheet that we have."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho.', 'Anthony Christopher Crowdell', ""I had 5 questions, Shar had asked them all though. But just, I guess, quickly -- you've had a big 8 months. I appreciate the CapEx update. It seems that you've accomplished a lot of what you were planning. Just the year ahead, what should we expect?"", 'Brian X. Tierney', ""So I think more of the same, Anthony, thank you for the question. So we've talked about how we're reorganizing the company about how we're changing the segment reporting to reflect that. I mentioned some of the key hires that we made at the end of 2023, we have 6 more key hires that we need to make. The 5 people to run our major businesses and a shared services executive that we're looking for as well. So as we make progress on that, we'll then have the team ready to help move in the direction that we've laid out for you and execute against the plan that we've described today. So it's really getting the right people in the right seats to manage the company the way that we've laid out for you and execute against the fantastic plan that we have."", 'Operator', ""We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And this concludes today's conference for today. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and we thank you for your participation.""]"

Many within the AI space today are large tech companies, such as the FAANG names. These days, however, a new moniker has been on the rise to identify the best tech companies of the day: the Magnificent Seven."", ""The original cohort of tech names to keep an eye on included Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) (formerly known as Facebook), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), all coming together to form the FAANG group. Today, these companies are challenged by several others in the market, particularly semiconductor giant NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). NVIDIA isn't alone either, and so the original list of FAANG stocks has had to accommodate the rise of new and old mega-tech companies bolstered by the emergence of AI."", ""Regardless of what you call these companies or who joins these new exciting groups, the fact remains that the tech sector has been abuzz with news of innovations, rising investments, and higher profitability. At the end of the day, it's starting to look like tech companies really are starting to rule the world."", 'On February 8, Gene Munster, the managing partner of Deepwater Asset Management, joined CNBC\'s ""Squawk Box"" to discuss recent trends in the tech sector and the rise of FAANG stocks, particularly Apple Inc.

Here\'s what he had to say:', '""They have the biggest upside potential relative to where expectations are... these three, I think, are largely unappreciated. I just wanna start with Meta. I think it\'s the biggest AI opportunity that\'s misunderstood. Most investors understand that Meta is using AI to improve ad campaigns, ad attribution... but there is a significant underappreciated lever that could take this into a whole different atmosphere. This theory comes from Deepwater\'s Doug Clinton. He believes that ultimately, they will monetize Llama. Llama is an opensource model. The other foundation models, Claude, and ChatGPT, and Gemini, they\'re all closed. Llama has 30 million downloads. If they monetize this, they will likely announce a cloud infrastructure... that is a whole new shift, and new benefit to Meta.""', 'On the rise of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in the AI space, Munster said the following:', '""Apple\'s gonna come out with their own foundation model likely in June, and they\'re gonna allow this to do personalized AI. This is really gonna capture 20% of the world\'s interest, and they can charge $10 a month for this.""', 'Most investors have been overlooking Apple Inc.

In our opinion, Netflix remains the most advantaged and profitable streaming service with opportunities to continue adding subscribers and raising prices as it demonstrates more value to consumers over time.

To skip the latest news and analysts’ sentiments around the current economic conditions, go directly to the 5 Best Big Company Stocks to Buy.', 'Despite the doubts, the market performed exceptionally in 2023. While several analysts believed it to be temporary, the new year isn’t showing many signs of weakness in the market. Although there have been a few hurdles, the overall prediction is that the Federal Reserve will manage to guide the US economy toward a soft landing rather than a recession, as was expected in the last two years. However, analysts still advise caution in the short term. Marko Kolanovic, Chief Global Markets Strategist and Global Co-Head of Research at J.P. Morgan, said:\xa0', '“As we approach 2024, we expect both inflation data and economic demand to soften, as the tailwinds for growth and risk markets are fading. Overall, we are cautious on the performance of risky assets and the broader macro outlook over the next 12 months, due to building monetary headwinds, geopolitical risks and expensive asset valuations.”', 'Nevertheless, the latest news suggests that the financial markets are heading in the right direction as the S&P 500 touched 5000 for the first time at the time of market opening on February 9 after December inflation data, which turned out to be even lower than initially reported. While the Fed recently revealed that it will take its time to review market data before making any decision to announce rate cuts, many analysts believe that the rate cuts can begin in the first half of 2024.', 'Despite the positive predictions around the market, the varying opinions of experts can lead to further confusion among novice investors, which is why the best big company stocks are some of the safest bets for such people. These big company stocks bring a sense of safety among investors as the losses are never permanent, even during bear market conditions. Additionally, the best company stocks are usually cash-rich with strong balance sheets and can easily weather any economic disasters. Furthermore, their wealth also allows them to pay steady dividends. For example, one of the giants in the energy sector, Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) has increased its dividends for the last 37 years, even though the last 10 years have seen some significant volatility in the energy sectors. Similarly, another blue-chip stock, PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) raised its dividend by 7% on February 9 despite year-over-year (YoY) revenue declines across major markets in the fourth quarter of 2023.', 'The big company stocks do not guarantee positive returns all the time but provide ample opportunities for investors when they fall. For example, earlier this month, we discussed the 10 blue-chip stocks at 52-week lows, which you should check out as these are also some of the best big company stocks that provide prime entry points for investors. However, our current list uses a different methodology, and some of our current best big company stocks include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). After an exceptional performance in 2023, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) declared its first-ever quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share on February 1 and increased its previous share buyback authorization by $50 billion. The company nearly gained 200% in the year and is up nearly 36% year-to-date (YTD) at the time of writing on February 9.', 'A large stock market board displaying the S&P 500 and S&P 500 Growth Index.', 'Our Methodology', 'To choose the best big company stocks, we used the FinViz stock screener to identify mega-cap stocks with an estimated 5-year EPS growth of over 15%.

The pandemic had pulled forward user growth, and the company then disclosed that there were over 100 million households that were using Netflix but not paying for it by borrowing a paid user’s account. After we assessed this information, better understood how the company could monetize shared passwords, and realized the win-win for Netflix and consumers from introducing an ad-supported subscription tier, we meaningfully added to our position in Netflix in the summer of 2022. We saw a clear path to much better monetization of an already robust and differentiated platform with a continued commitment to improved content spend efficiency and free cash flow growth.', 'Fast forward to today, Netflix has made meaningful progress on monetizing shared passwords and laying the foundation for consumer choice, although the ramp in advertising tier subscribers remains in the beginning stages. The low-hanging fruit may already have been picked on password sharing efforts, but our research shows there should be long tails of revenue and free cash flow growth. In our opinion, Netflix remains the most advantaged and profitable streaming service with opportunities to continue adding subscribers and raising prices as it demonstrates more value to consumers over time. Over the longer term, we also expect significant advertising revenue. That said, the market finally seems to have appreciated some of this.

In addition, management realized that their cost structure, especially in salespeople, had gotten too bloated.

With that, I will turn the call over to Patrice."", ""Patrice Louvet: Thank you, Cory. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. This holiday quarter, our campaigns around the world celebrated a season of giving, marked by warm, reflection and comfort that inspires people to dream of the best things in life and share them with those they love. Immersing people in our world of easy elegance and sophistication has epitomized Ralph Lauren over 57 years. And we continue to deliver this quarter-after-quarter to an ever-expanding audience to our next great chapter accelerate plan. This combination of magic and logic translated to strong financial performance in the third quarter, our biggest quarter of the year. With top and bottom line results that exceeded our expectations, along with significant EPS growth."", 'As we continue to navigate a dynamic global operating environment, our teams remain keenly focused on what we can control. This starts with our timeless and highly desirable brand which is resonating with consumers all around the world and enabling continued pricing power in the market. Our ability to leverage a broad powerful portfolio of core products that we can flex with evolving consumer needs. Our continued deliberate shift toward our direct-to-consumer channels where we can best deliver our elevated and connected consumer experiences and which once again led growth in the quarter. And all of this is underpinned by the agility and operational discipline we have built into our business so that we can continue fueling our strategic growth initiatives for the long-term.', ""As we outlined at our last Investor Day, we are strongly encouraged that we have built a sustainable and resilient model with multiple diversified drivers for long-term growth and value creation. Our third quarter performance was a clear example of how we're driving progress across our three strategic pillars. As a reminder, these include, first, elevate and energize our lifestyle brand, second, drive the core and expand for more; and third, win in key cities with our consumer ecosystem. Let me take you through a few highlights across each of these areas. First, on our efforts to elevate and energize our lifestyle brand. We continue to harness the power of our iconic brand as we expand across geographies and demographics, cutting through culture across fashion, celebrity, sports, gaming and music moments."", 'During the third quarter, key campaigns included, first, our holiday season for dreaming activations in every region generating nearly 8 billion global impressions. These included immersive holiday gifting content, unique key city takeovers across New York, Shanghai, London and Berlin and our Singles Day stream in China. Second, our Polo Ralph Lauren Artist and Residence campaign featuring Navajo Designer, Naiomi Glasses, which is the first in a series of groundbreaking partnerships focused on empowering and celebrating artisans within the communities that have historically inspired our designs. This campaign was not just a galvanizing cultural moment for our organization, but also resonated strongly with consumers, driving more than 3 billion impressions and our highest engagements ever on TikTok.', 'We also outfitted an incredible roster of inspiring women including America Ferreira, Jody Foster, Greta Lee and JLo at the L Women in Hollywood event. Janelle Monae and Kate Bock at Art Basel in Miami. And Gauravi Kumari, Princess of Jaipur for a high-profile fundraiser at the dazzling City Palace in Jaipur, India. And who could forget Taylor Swift, who chose an all-American Ralph Lauren look for the cover of Time Magazine as their 2023 Person of the Year. These activations helped to fuel our strongest quarter of new consumer acquisition and brand affinity since the pandemic. We added 1.7 million new consumers to our DTC businesses, up high single digits to last year, driven by all regions. Our Net Promoter Scores accelerated along with positive momentum in brand consideration and purchase intent.', 'And we grew our followers on social media by low double digits to last year, led by TikTok, Instagram, WeChat and Douyin. Moving next to our second key initiative, drive the core and expand for more. Consumers continue to turn to brands they know and trust and styles that live on beyond one season. And this holiday was no exception. As Ralph and our design teams seamlessly married sophisticated casual with styles exuding the luxury and glamor of the season. Our iconic core products, representing about 70% of our business, grew low double digits in the quarter, ahead of total company growth. From our Mesh Polos and Oxford Shirts, to our luxuriously soft Cashmere Sweaters and versatile Blazers, we have established a broad and highly recognizable portfolio of icons that drive our business through both choppy and more stable times alike.', ""And we are incredibly proud of the work Ralph and our creative teams are doing to drive newness and excitement behind these styles, so they appeal to our most loyal and new consumers alike. Performance in core was led by our cable knit sweaters in cotton woolen cashmere, quilted and down jackets and sports coats in the range of tweed, tartan plaid, stretch corduroy and party ready velvets. As we continue to build on the long-term foundation of our core, we also delivered strong growth in our high potential categories, including women's, outerwear and home. Together, these high potential categories increased low double digits to last year. This was led again by women's, our most significant long-term growth opportunity. Driven by an elevated assortment with AUR up mid-teens."", ""Performance was supported by our cashmere, flag and polo bear sweaters, sophisticated wool and cashmere coats, blazers and heritage tweed and modern knit tools and cocktail and evening dresses. Other special releases this quarter included our Polo Country and Element Skateboards Capsule, a limited-edition collection of unisex Polo Country styles and Element Skateboards celebrating the great outdoors. We sold over 2,000 skateboards, highlighting the lifestyle reach of our brand, and appeal to younger consumers. Our limited edition Polo ID handbag collaboration with Mr. Bags in China, which sold out within one minute on WeChat. Our innovative love of the land collaboration with Navajo Designer, Naomi Glasses; Ralph Lauren's first artist in residents."", ""And the annual and much-loved Ralph Lauren Pink Pony collection supporting Ralph's 30-year commitment to cancer care and research. Looking ahead, we will continue to drive our core icons while leveraging the breadth of our brand and assortments to fuel excitement, and desirability. Turning to our third key initiative, win in key cities with our consumer ecosystem. Our key city ecosystems around the world drive elevation and deliver consistency through all of our consumer channels and touch points. Each of these ecosystems is anchored by direct-to-consumer channels, including our stores and digital commerce sites, which combined already represent about 2/3 of company sales. During the quarter, we drove accelerated comp growth while also expanding our connected ecosystems across key markets."", ""Globally, we opened a total of 17 new stores and concessions focused on our top cities with the majority again in Asia. While comps in our Ralph Lauren stores and own digital sites were strong around the world, we were particularly encouraged by the continued improvement in our outlet trends. The key outlet actions we implemented in the first half of the year from our optimized staffing to assortment enhancements and emphasis on quality and value, served us well through holiday and will continue to be drivers as we look ahead. In addition to our existing fleet, we opened a select number of iconic Ralph Lauren stores in the quarter, including our new emblematic store at Singapore's Marina Bay Sands, the first door to offer our luxury collections in Southeast Asia."", ""Our first Ralph Lauren store in the Czech Republic, in Prague's historic old town as well as in Charlotte, North Carolina. And our first Ralph's coffee shops in Paris and the UAE. We also launched our Ralph Lauren digital flagship site in Canada, following our Toronto store opening last quarter. Combined with our elevated wholesale presence, these are helping us introduce a cohesive connected retail experience to our consumers across the Canadian market. By region, growth was again led by Asia with particularly strong performance in China, where sales increased more than 30% this quarter on both comp and new store growth. This was ahead of our expectations, even with last year's easier compares due to the surge in COVID cases. We are still in the earlier stages of brand building in China with meaningful outperformance versus peers in the quarter on consumer KPIs, including brand awareness, consideration and Net Promoter Scores."", ""Our team delivered another successful Singles Day focused on brand building with ralphlauren.cn sales up 25% on lower discounting and higher AURs to last year. Our early performance to date on Douyin has also been very encouraging following our limited launch last fall with an expanded rollout this spring. And finally, touching on our enablers. In addition to our strategic priorities, our business continued to be supported by our five key enablers. I'll share a few highlights from the quarter. As we drive towards best-in-class digital technology and analytics, we tested our sophisticated predictive buying model in our European and Asian stores this quarter. With our initial rollout limited to select sweaters, knit tops and caps, this artificial intelligence-driven model enables better in-stock availability on sizing and best-selling products to drive incremental sales and improved conversion."", ""Based on this early success, we plan to continue scaling its use to an expanded range of categories and markets over time. As we continue to integrate citizenship and sustainability to future-proof our business, we are also proud to be named once again one of Forbes World's Best Employers in 2023. In closing, Ralph and I are energized by our team's excellent execution through this important holiday season. This quarter's performance reinforces how the power of our iconic brand, together with our multi-lever strategy delivers. We are firing on multiple cylinders while not dependent on a single geography channel or category for growth. And this model, combined with our unique agility and the remarkable dedication of our teams is what will continue to differentiate Ralph Lauren through these dynamic times."", ""With that, I'll hand it over to Jane to discuss our financial results, and I'll join her at the end to answer your questions."", ""Jane Nielsen: Thank you, Patrice, and good morning, everyone. We entered this holiday season with a clear game plan. We invested in brand momentum around the world, expanded giftable core and seasonal products to delight our consumers and drove key operational improvements and flexibility to mitigate near-term macro headwinds. This quarter's strong performance was a testament to the agility of our teams and the resilience of our next great chapter accelerate plan, coupled with the power and global reach of our iconic brand. We reported third quarter revenue, adjusted operating profit and double-digit EPS growth above our outlook. And we achieved this while continuing to strengthen our brand proposition around the world and investing in our key strategic priorities to enable sustainable growth into the future."", 'Top line exceeded our guidance, driven by comp acceleration in DTC with momentum in all retail channels globally. Operating margin expansion was also ahead of our outlook despite our strategic investments and ongoing cotton headwinds as we focus on operating with discipline in an evolving global environment. And we returned approximately $425 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases this fiscal year-to-date, in line with our long-term guidance. Let me take you through our third quarter financial highlights, which, as a reminder, are provided on a constant currency basis. Our accelerating brand momentum and investments in key holiday campaigns resulted in 5% total revenue growth. This was above our outlook led by strong double-digit growth in Asia and holiday outperformance in Europe.', 'Revenue in North America was approximately flat to last year, in line with our expectations. Each of our DTC channels contributed to top line growth in the period, with total DTC penetration expanding approximately 400 basis points to last year, adding stability and resiliency to our business, consistent with our NGC strategy. Total company comp increased 9%, accelerating sequentially across all three regions. Ralph Lauren stores continued to lead our global performance. Our positive outlet comps continued to improve following investments in service and expanded core product assortments, driving solid traffic, AUR, and basket size growth in every region. Comps in our owned Ralph Lauren digital sites increased 8% on top of 11% growth last year as we prioritize ongoing investments to expand our footprint and improve the customer experience online.', 'Total digital ecosystem sales were also up high single digits, including a strong recovery in Europe as our largest pure-play account returned to growth. Total company adjusted gross margin expanded 130 basis points to 66.5%, reflecting our long-term elevation work. This was consistent with our outlook, driven by lower freight expense, favorable channel and geographic mix and 9% AUR growth. These more than offset ongoing cotton cost headwinds and targeted promotions to drive conversion during key holiday sale periods. Cotton costs will start to abate at the end of our Q4, beginning with our spring 24 collections. As previously indicated, we are planning a moderation in AUR growth based on a reduced need to pass like-for-like cost inflation onto the consumer.', ""Nevertheless, we plan to continue driving positive AUR increases as a result of our growing brand desirability, ongoing product mix elevation and favorable geographic and channel mix. Adjusted operating expenses increased 7% to 50.2% of sales a 100-basis point increase to last year. The increase as a percent of sales was driven largely by channel and geographic mix shifts in the quarter. With our DTC and international businesses contributing a significantly higher share of sales in the period versus last year. This quarter's strategic investments focused on our key city ecosystems, marketing investments and enhancing the consumer experience and service levels across our DTC channels. Variable selling expenses also rose as a result of stronger retail sales growth."", 'Marketing was 7.5% of sales, up slightly from last year to support our high-impact holiday activations, delivering improvement across our consumer metrics, including brand consideration, Net Promoter Scores and purchase intent. We still expect full year marketing at around 7% of sales. Moving on to segment performance, starting with North America. Third quarter revenue was approximately flat to last year, in line with our expectations as stronger growth in retail was offset by our reduced sell-in to the wholesale channel. In North America Retail, third quarter comps increased 5%, led by a double-digit increase in our Ralph Lauren stores. Our outlet performance continued to improve with positive comps driven by our product elevation and our recent interventions to improve the selling experience and retail environments.', ""Despite taking targeted promotions during the key holiday periods, our outlet AUR increased strongly and discount rates declined versus last year. Comps in our owned ralphlauren.com site were up 4% on top of 9% growth last year. In addition to a strong response to our Black Friday event, recent site enhancements such as upgraded search and navigation drove higher conversion in the quarter. We also launched our Canadian digital site in the quarter. In North America wholesale, revenues decreased 15%, in line with our expectations as we proactively focus on aligning inventory with softer demand trends. We continue to evaluate our brand presence in each store and exited approximately 20 department store doors this year. While we plan to manage this channel carefully into calendar '24, we were encouraged by our improving sellout trends, which meaningfully outperformed our sell-in this quarter."", ""Our AUR in the channel was also up on a year-over-year basis. Moving on to Europe. Revenue increased 6%, with performance led by our DTC channels. This was above our expectations as strong growth across the continent more than offset continued consumer and macro headwinds in the U.K., results included roughly 5 points of negative impact from the earlier timing of wholesale deliveries and lapping last year's favorable post-COVID wholesale allowances. Retail comps increased 11% on top of a strong 11% compare last year with similar performance in our brick-and-mortar and digital sites. We drove strong momentum across brands and categories in Europe, with growth led by gifting, seasonal sweaters and outerwear, which are AUR accretive. Europe wholesale was approximately flat to last year, but included about 11 points of net headwinds from unusual impacts of wholesale allowances and earlier receipts."", ""Strong underlying growth was supported by wholesale reorders, which returned to more normalized trends in the quarter, following recent destocking at digital wholesale accounts. While our Europe business has performed better than expected through the first three quarters of the year we remain cautious on the fourth quarter and into fiscal '25, given highly dynamic geopolitical and macro conditions in the region. Turning to Asia. Revenue increased 17%, with double-digit growth across our largest markets of Japan, China and Korea. Asia retail comps were up 14% with strong growth in both digital commerce and brick-and-mortar stores. China sales increased more than 30% on continued brand momentum, including successful Singles Day events as we lapped last year's COVID impact."", 'Third quarter sales in Japan were up low double digits. Overall inbound tourism recovered to pre-pandemic levels, although Chinese travelers to Japan are still down 70%. Sales in Korea also rebounded to low double-digit growth, benefiting from our recent marketing activations and a shift in the timing of the Chuseok holiday from Q2 last year. Moving on to the balance sheet. Our strong balance sheet and cash flows are key enablers of our Fortress foundation and allow us to make strategic growth investments in our business while returning cash to shareholders. We ended the third quarter with $1.9 billion in cash and short-term investments and $1.1 billion in total debt. Net inventory decreased 15%, below our revenue growth trend with units also down double digits.', ""The decline was driven by stronger-than-expected Q3 sales and our continued efforts to ensure healthy wholesale inventories. As we transition into spring, we believe overall inventory levels are well positioned relative to our outlook for each region. We still expect to end fiscal '24 with healthy inventories below prior year levels with an improved ability to chase into potential demand as a result of our predictive buying model. Looking ahead, our outlook remains based on our best assessment of the current geopolitical backdrop as well as the macroeconomic environment. This includes inflationary pressures and other consumer spending related headwinds, potential supply chain disruption and foreign currency volatility among others. For fiscal '24, we still expect constant currency revenues to increase low single digits, now centering on about 2% compared to our previous outlook of 1% to 2%."", 'Our outlook continues to embed caution around the wholesale channel where year-to-date demand has been softer than prior year. Foreign currency is now expected to benefit revenue growth by about 10 basis points. We continue to anticipate operating margin expansion of approximately 30 to 50 basis points in constant currency to 12.3% to 12.5%. Foreign currency is now expected to have a roughly neutral impact on full year operating margin. We now expect gross margin expansion in the range of 140 to 180 basis points in constant currency, up slightly from 120 to 170 basis points previously. This is driven by favorable freight costs, further mix shift toward international and DTC and continued growth in AUR, more than offsetting full year cotton inflation.', 'Gross margin expansion is anticipated to more than offset expense deleverage due to mix shift and key strategic investments. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenues to increase in a range centered around 2% in constant currency, with stronger trends in retail versus continued caution in wholesale in both North America and Europe. Foreign currency is expected to negatively impact revenues by roughly 160 basis points. While we remain cautious on North America, we expect modest sequential improvement in Q4 with stronger trends in DTC offsetting continued softness in wholesale. In Europe, fourth quarter sales are still expected to be negatively impacted by the earlier timing of wholesale shipments. Excluding this impact, we expect underlying trends in Europe to increase slightly in Q4.', ""And in Asia, we anticipate growth will be closer to our full year guide for the region of up low double digits, as we lap a more normalized compare following the easy COVID compares in Q1 and Q3. We expect fourth quarter operating margin to expand approximately 350 to 400 basis points in constant currency. Largely driven by gross margin expansion with about 40 and 50 basis points of negative foreign currency impact on our operating and gross margin, respectively. We now expect our tax rate to be in the range of 19% to 20% for the full year due to discrete tax benefits recognized in Q3 and roughly 22% to 23% for the fourth quarter. And capital expenditures are now expected in the range of $200 million to $225 million. In closing, Ralph's vision has always been about inspiring people to step into the dream of a better life and this holiday quarter was no exception."", ""We are proud of our team's strong execution on our next great chapter accelerate plan through what continues to be a highly dynamic operating environment. We are focused on what we can control, shifting to GTC, harnessing big data and AI and of course, operating and balance sheet discipline. This puts us in a position of strength as we continue to deliver our commitments and drive long-term value creation. And with that, let's open up the call for your questions."", 'See also 15 Most Common Addictions In The US and 25 Most Popular Fast Food Restaurants in America.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

However, 2024 is expected to bring significant headwinds due to elevated interest rates and slowing economic growth. Energy and utility companies, grappling with regulatory complexities and persistent inflation, face challenges in the rollout of both renewable and traditional energy infrastructure.', ""The energy landscape is influenced by four main disruptors – geopolitical factors, macroeconomic variables (like high interest rates and rising materials costs), evolving policies and regulations, and the emergence of new technologies. These factors significantly impact demand, supply, trade, and investment in the oil and gas industry. According to Deloitte, OPEC+'s output cuts and other disruptions have driven Brent oil prices above US$90/bbl, while US Henry Hub natural gas prices rebounded to US$3.50/mmBtu in November 2023. Despite these challenges, global oil demand is expected to grow by 2.3 mbpd in 2023, surpassing 100 mbpd for the first time. Electric vehicle sales increased by over 35% in 2023, with one in seven cars sold being an EV, highlighting regional differences in demand, infrastructure, technology adoption, regulatory policies, and socioeconomic factors. The industry is poised for a solid start in 2024, supported by its strong financial position and high oil prices, barring further macroeconomic deterioration. This strength is expected to facilitate investments, dividends, and a disciplined capital program, with the global upstream industry projected to maintain a 2023 hydrocarbon investment level of about US$580 billion and generate over US$800 billion in free cash flows in 2024."", ""As per Fitch Ratings, the performance of the global oil and gas sector in 2024 is expected to be consistent with 2023 and stronger than mid-cycle levels. Oil prices are anticipated to remain high and relatively stable year-on-year, attributed to OPEC+'s production cuts, geopolitical factors, and a slowdown in US crude production. Although demand growth is expected to decelerate, the spare capacity, primarily held by OPEC, is likely to be sufficient to absorb potential shocks. Looking ahead to 2025, a decline in oil prices is assumed as OPEC+'s control over supply may ease. Companies with strong cash flow and low leverage are projected to report robust earnings in 2024, supported by favorable prices and ongoing cost control measures. The cumulative EBITDA of Fitch-rated global O&G producers is expected to slightly decrease from 2023, approximately 25% lower than in 2022. Most companies are expected to maintain or reduce capital expenditures, with only about 25% increasing capex by more than 10%. Additionally, approximately 20% of companies are projected to raise dividends by more than 10%, while the rest will either maintain or decrease dividends."", 'To benefit from the growth potential in the energy sector, some of the best stocks to buy include Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY), and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM).\xa0', 'Our Methodology\xa0', 'We chose the top energy stocks based on overall hedge fund sentiment toward each stock.

Over the past few years, the company developed into a growth darling thanks to its strong track record in renewable energy development and tailwinds from the global energy transition and incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act. The problem for NextEra, and the transition broadly, is that this transformation is immensely capital intensive and many renewables projects offer lower returns on that capital. This requires high capital expenditures – often resulting in negative free cash flow – to meet the growth and financing needs of companies like NextEra. To help, the company leaned on financial engineering by using a publicly traded limited partnership called NextEra Energy Partners, providing further capacity for its parent to continue its development plans. NEP used layers of its own financial engineering to fund its own negative free cash flow and a large, growing dividend yield that we believe it could not sustain organically. Ultimately, the higher cost of debt from rising rates led NEP to lower its own growth ambitions, driving concerns about whether NextEra can execute on its extensive backlog.

For the full year, operating earnings were $1.3 billion or 33.9% of sales, down 140 basis points versus the prior year, driven by the Airwave revenue reduction and higher acquisition related expenses."", 'Looking next at our regional results. North America revenue was $2 billion in Q4, up 6% and $6.9 billion for the full year, up 9%, driven by growth in both segments and across all three technologies. And in international, Q4 revenue was $832 million, up 3% versus last year, driven by growth in Video and LMR. And for the full year, international revenue was $3 billion, up 11% versus last year, driven by growth in LMR and Video. Moving to backlog. Ending backlog for Q4 was $14.3 billion, down $88 million versus last year, inclusive of approximately $1 billion of backlog reduction related to the Airwave price control and revenue recognition for Airwave and ESN. Sequentially, backlog was down $15 million, inclusive of the Airwave and ESN reduction and $160 million of favorable FX.', 'In the Products and SI segment, ending backlog was up $93 million or 2% driven primarily by strong demand in North America. Sequentially, backlog was up $99 million, also driven by demand in North America. In Software and Services, backlog decreased $181 million from last year and $114 million sequentially. Excluding Airwave and ESN, Software and Services backlog was up almost $800 million versus last year, driven by strong multi-year agreements in both regions. Turning now to our outlook. We expect Q1 sales to be up approximately 8%, with non-GAAP earnings per share between $2.50 and $2.55 per share. This assumes a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 172 million shares and an effective tax rate of approximately 23%. And for the full year, we expect revenue growth of approximately 6% and non-GAAP earnings per share between $12.62 and $12.72 per share.', ""This full year outlook assumes a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 171 million shares and an effective tax rate between 23% and 24%. Additionally, we expect another strong year of operating cash flow with 2024 expectations of $2.2 billion in operating cash flow. And before I turn it back to Greg, I wanted to share some additional highlights. First, I want to give you some color on the technology growth expectations that are included in the sales guidance for the year. In Video Security and Access Control, we're planning for 10% growth, which is informed by the acceleration and strong adoption of our cloud offerings. For Command Center, we also expect 10% growth consistent with last year's organic growth rate. And in LMR, we expect to grow mid-single digits or high single digits when normalized for the impact of the UK Home Office."", ""Second, I would like to share with you some exciting updates about our Video business, in light of two recent partnerships that support our growth expectations, one with Jabil and another with Google. With Jabil, we've entered into a strategic manufacturing agreement where Jabil will assume responsibility for our manufacturing operations at our sites in Canada and Texas. This agreement further optimizes our video supply chain, provides redundancy, future cost savings and scalability. Additionally, it allows us to focus on engineering, designing and bringing to market video solutions that serve our customers' security needs, while continuing to enable regulatory compliance with NDAA rules for the procurement of secure equipment. And with Google, yesterday, we announced a new strategic agreement with Google Cloud that harnesses the power of their latest cloud advancements to enable assistive intelligence, such as accurate and reliable video content, mapping and other AI capabilities."", 'Google Cloud also enables Avigilon Alta, our fast growing cloud native fixed video and access control platform, which we introduced a little more than a year ago. Alta combines the power of our AI analytics with the ease and simplicity of a cloud delivered VMS that is increasingly preferred by some verticals like education. The rapid adoption in Alta contributed almost a quarter of our growth last year to total video and includes a higher subscription attachment compared to a traditional Avigilon Unity sale. And finally, we ended the year with a very strong balance sheet, including $1.7 billion in cash, a fixed rate balance debt maturity profile and our net debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.4 is our lowest since 2015, providing us with ample flexibility to continue to deploy capital and drive shareholder value.', ""I'll now turn the call-back to Greg."", 'Greg Brown: Thanks, Jason. First, 2023 was a phenomenal year for the company. We achieved [Technical Difficulty] significantly expanded operating margins, grew earnings per share by 15% and generated record operating cash flow of $2 billion. We also returned $1.4 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and we strengthened our Video Security portfolio with the recent acquisition of IPVideo. Second, this past November, we announced our new brand narrative, solving for safer. This reflects our purposeful transformation centered on public safety and enterprise security and our sharpened focus on solving for safer communities, safer schools and safer businesses. Our solutions across LMR, Video Security and Command Center that are powered by artificial intelligence enable collaboration between public safety agencies and enterprises, connecting those in need with those who can help.', ""And while we recognize technology is not the only way to a safer future, it does play a vital role. And finally, as we enter 2024, the momentum of our business remains strong. Funding for public safety continues to be a priority. Investments we've made in the portfolio, including our APX NEXT device. And by the way, the software applications that run on this device are driving higher ASPs for our products and strong growth in Software and Services. We're also seeing a noticeable acceleration of cloud adoption in Video Security that is driving margin accretive revenues in Software and Services. And with our exceptionally strong balance sheet, we have the opportunity to continue to deploy capital to drive long-term shareholder value. I'm extremely pleased how we're positioned and I expect 2024 to be another year of strong revenue and earnings growth for our company."", ""I'll now turn the call back over to Tim."", ""Tim Yocum: Thanks, Greg.

We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements. And with that, I will turn it over to Greg."", 'Gregory Q. Brown', ""Thanks, Tim, and good afternoon, and thanks for joining us today. First, Q4 was an exceptional quarter. We achieved record revenue in both segments and all 3 technologies, including double-digit growth in Video Security and Command Center highlighting the strength and robust demand for our Safety and Security Solutions that help protect people, property and places. Additionally, we expanded operating margins for the sixth consecutive quarter generated over $1.2 billion of operating cash flow and strengthened our Video Security portfolio with the recent acquisition of IPVideo, creator of the HALO Smart Sensor. Second, our full year results were outstanding. In our Products and SI segment, we grew revenue 9%, driven by strong growth in both LMR and Video Security, and we ended the year with record product backlog. We also expanded operating margins in the segment by 380 basis points, driven in part by higher ASPs and lower product costs. In Software and Services, revenue was up 10%, inclusive of the Airwave revenue reduction, highlighted by strong growth in Video Security, Command Center and our Services business outside of the U.K. And we also generated record operating cash flow of $2 billion, up 12% versus the prior year. And finally, as we enter 2024, our robust backlog position coupled with the continued strong demand for our safety and security solutions positions us well for another year of strong revenue and earnings growth. And with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Jason."", 'Jason J. Winkler', ""Thank you, Greg. Revenue for the quarter grew 5% and was above our guidance with growth in both segments, both regions and all 3 technologies. FX tailwinds during the quarter were $16 million, while acquisitions added $17 million. GAAP operating earnings were $738 million or 25.9% of sales up from 25.6% in the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $870 million, up 6% from the year ago quarter and non-GAAP operating margin was 30.5%, up 10 basis points. The increase in both GAAP and non-GAAP operating earnings was driven by higher sales and lower direct material costs. GAAP earnings per share was $3.47, up from $3.43 in the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP EPS was $3.90, up 8% from $3.60 last year. The growth in EPS was driven by higher sales and higher margins. OpEx in Q4 was $597 million, up $60 million versus last year, primarily due to higher incentives and acquisitions in the current quarter -- current year. For the full year 2023, revenue was $10 billion, up 10%, with strong growth in both segments and across all 3 technologies. Revenue from acquisitions was $98 million and the impact of unfavorable foreign currency rates was $38 million. GAAP operating earnings were $2.3 billion or 23% of sales versus 18.2% in the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by lower direct material costs, higher sales, the $147 million ESN fixed asset impairment charge in the prior year and lower intangible amortization expense in the current year. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $2.8 billion, up $416 million and non-GAAP operating margins were 27.9% of sales, up from 26% of sales in the prior year, driven by lower direct material costs, higher sales, inclusive of higher ASPs and improved operating leverage. GAAP earnings per share was $9.93, up 25% compared to $7.93 in the prior year, primarily driven by higher earnings and the asset impairment charge related to the exit of ESN in the prior year, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate in the current year. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $11.95, up 15% from $10.36 in 2022 on higher earnings, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate. For the full year, OpEx was $2.2 billion, up $178 million versus 2022, primarily driven by higher employee incentives and higher expenses associated with investments in Video and Rave. And the effective tax rate for 2023 was 21.9% compared to 20.1% in the prior year due to lower benefits from employee stock-based compensation in the current year. Turning to our cash flow. Q4 operating cash flow was $1.2 billion, driven by higher earnings, partially offset by higher cash taxes. And for the full year, we generated record operating cash flow of $2 billion and record free cash flow of $1.8 billion. The increase was driven by higher earnings, partially offset by higher cash taxes. Capital allocation for 2023 included $804 million in share repurchases, $589 million in cash dividends and $253 million of CapEx. Additionally, during the quarter, our Board of Directors approved a $2 billion increase to the share repurchase program and an 11% increase in our dividend, which is the 13th consecutive year of double-digit increases. Moving next to segment results. In the Products and SI segment, Q4 sales were up 4% versus last year, driven by growth in LMR and Video. Operating earnings were $567 million or 30.0% of sales, up from 28.4% in the prior year driven by higher sales and lower direct material costs. Some notable Q4 wins and achievements in this segment include a $90 million P25 system and devices order from a U.S. customer. A $67 million P25 device order for Emergency Services Telecommunications Authority in Australia, a $57 million P25 APX NEXT devices order for a U.S. customer. A $38 million P25 system order for the State of Arizona Department of Public Safety, a $31 million TETRA system order for a European customer and a $13 million fixed video order for an international customer. And for the full year, Products and SI revenue was $6.2 billion, up 9% from the prior year, driven by higher sales of LMR and Video. Revenue from acquisitions was $15 million and currency headwinds were $19 million. Full year operating earnings were $1.5 billion or 24.3% of sales, up from 20.5% in the prior year on higher sales, inclusive of higher ASPs and lower direct material costs. In Software and Services, Q4 revenue was up 7%, driven by growth in Video, Command Center and LMR. Revenue from acquisitions was $15 million in the quarter, and FX tailwinds were $11 million. Q4 operating earnings in the segment were $303 million and operating margins were 31.6%, down from 34.4% last year, primarily driven by the Airwave revenue reduction related to the price control. Some notable Q4 highlights in the segment include a $330 million LMR managed services renewal through 2034 for Denmark's nationwide public safety communications network. A $48 million Command Center order for the City of Chicago's Office of Public Safety Administration. A $20 million LMR service agreement for Spokane, Washington, Regional Emergency Communications and a $19 million mobile video order from a U.S. customer, and finally, a $10 million Command Center order for the City and County of San Francisco. For the full year, revenue was $3.7 billion, up 10% on growth in LMR services, Command Center and Video. Revenue from acquisitions was $83 million and currency headwinds were $19 million. For the full year, operating earnings were $1.3 billion or 33.9% of sales, down 140 basis points versus the prior year driven by the Airwave revenue reduction and higher acquisition-related expenses. Looking next at our regional results. North America revenue was $2 billion in Q4, up 6% and $6.9 billion for the full year, up 9% driven by growth in both segments and across all 3 technologies. And in international, Q4 revenue was $832 million, up 3% versus last year, driven by growth in Video and LMR. And for the full year, international revenue was $3 billion, up 11% versus last year, driven by growth in LMR and Video. Moving to backlog. Ending backlog for Q4 was $14.3 billion, down $88 million versus last year, inclusive of approximately $1 billion of backlog reduction related to the Airwave price control and revenue recognition for Airwave and ESN. Sequentially, backlog was down $15 million, inclusive of the Airwave and ESN reduction and $160 million of favorable FX. In the Products and SI segment, ending backlog was up $93 million or 2%, driven primarily by strong demand in North America. Sequentially, backlog was up $99 million, also driven by demand in North America. In Software and Services backlog decreased $181 million from last year and $114 million sequentially. Excluding Airwave and ESN, Software and Services backlog was up almost $800 million versus last year, driven by strong multiyear agreements in both regions. Turning now to our outlook. We expect Q1 sales to be up approximately 8% with non-GAAP earnings per share between $2.50 and $2.55 per share. This assumes a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 172 million shares and an effective tax rate of approximately 23%. And for the full year, we expect revenue growth of approximately 6%, and non-GAAP earnings per share between $12.62 and $12.72 per share. This full year outlook assumes a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 171 million shares and an effective tax rate between 23% and 24%. Additionally, we expect another strong year of operating cash flow with 2024 expectations of $2.2 billion in operating cash flow.

I'll now turn the call back over to Tim."", 'Tim Yocum', ""Thanks, Greg. Before we begin taking questions, I'd like to remind callers to limit themselves to one question and one follow-up to accommodate as many participants as possible. Operator, please remind our callers on the line how to ask a question."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) The first question is from George Notter with Jefferies.', 'George Charles Notter', ""I have a question on the margin expansion in the business. I guess I wanted to ask about what kind of headwinds you guys still have running through the business in 2023. I'm thinking about things like expedite fees and even freight costs. I know that a lot of those fees didn't come out of the model until you guys had burn down some backlog. So I guess I'm wondering how much of the headwind was in the 2023 numbers? And then I assume that will be all out fully for the 2024 year, I'm just kind of wondering what kind of benefit you might get on margins there? And then just as a follow-up, a second question just on Silver Lake. I'm just curious about, is there any update there on what those guys might do? And how might you kind of fund the unwind of that position?"", 'Gregory Q. Brown', ""George, so just to reconfirm, we do expect operating margin expansion for 2024. That's in part by informed continued improvement in PPV. I have to compliment Jason and the supply team and Jack's ops team did a great job exceeding what we set out as targets last year. And to remind you, we are expecting another $60 million of PPV improvement in this year in '24. From a gross margin standpoint, for the firm, we expect them to be comparable to slightly up. So I think we do a pretty good job on the operating leverage side of this business, both on gross margin and operating margin.By the way, the OpEx envelope year-over-year is probably going to be up about $80 million '24 over '23 of which half is organic, $40 million and $40 million is inorganic. As it relates to Silver Lake, really no update that they are in the final year of their second 5-year pipe. It expires in September. The diluted share count is already calculated into our EPS expectations. So really nothing to report at this point. The partnership remains good, and we'll see how that plays forward for the balance of the year. By the way, we do expect, as we think about Silver Lake on the expiration of the pipe, we do expect higher interest expense this year to be about $40 million which includes the assumption of $1.3 billion of refinancing, of which $1 billion is the Silver Lake note and $300 million is debt that expires in September this year."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from the line of Tim Long with Barclays.', 'Timothy Patrick Long', ""Just wanted to ask a little bit on the top line. Maybe, Greg, for you the Q1 guide looks pretty strong, but the full year is a little bit lower on growth. So maybe can you talk about visibility or what you're kind of expecting in the back half of the year? Is it just compares or conservatism or anything else we need to be aware of for that little discrepancy in growth rates? And then I did want to, secondly, follow-up on the Video 10% growth. I mean, obviously, the numbers are getting bigger here. But can you kind of put that in context of where you are with share gains? And getting into deeper into the government verticals and getting some benefits this year from ARPA funding, say, on safe schools and other areas, if you can, just put that into context with some of those drivers, that would be great."", 'Gregory Q. Brown', ""So let's take the full year first. I think it's important to say that I'm super proud of last year. But to your point, as we're sitting here in February, backlog is strong, but Tim, so is the pipeline. So we're in a good aged backlog position, but the pipeline remains strong as well, which makes me feel good about where we sit here for the balance of the year. I'd also tell you that when we think about the full year guide, it's coming off of a Q4 that exceeded our guidance. It's coming off of a full year that exceeded our guidance. And if you anchor it to the color I gave last time at about $10.5 billion, it's about $75 million higher than that reference a quarter ago.Now having said all that, so we guide for full year 6%. I remind you that $200 million is a headwind related to the U.K. Home Office. So year-over-year, we expect Airwave revenue to be about $375 million. But if you take year-over-year, you add in the $200 million full year U.K. Home Office headwind that can normalize the year-over-year comparison. Additionally, one other thing worth mentioning is, and Jack talked about this a quarter ago, we had exceptionally strong revenue contribution from Ukraine of $150 million last year. And based on what's expected to be shipped in backlog, we expect that to be $50 million. So you take the year-over-year 6%, you take $200 million decrement for U.K. Home Office headwind. You normalize for Ukraine, and I think our growth is quite solid and a prudent guide at this point in time."", 'Jason J. Winkler', ""One other insight into the Video growth of approximately 10% this year. Within that, we're really pleased with the Cloud growth that we're seeing. Alta, which we talked about on the call as a platform, which is cloud native is growing exceptionally well. We've also made a decision to rationalize some of our on-prem VMS. And the combination of that growth rate in '24 and rationalizing the VMS is about $40 million of impact in 2024. So we're continuing to grow, and Jack, if you want to talk about the market and how we're doing in Video?"", 'John P. Molloy', ""Yes. Tim, I'd also dimensionalize both. Jason alluded to it both in script and his comments. Cloud's growing, but we also, our expectations are also that are on-prem business is very healthy, continues to grow. As it relates to share, we believe we're continuing to take market share. You also asked a question, Tim, in government. Total government video sales, that encompasses both mobile and fixed video, are now at $500 million in 2023. And I would highlight our government video growth is growing faster than our overall total business. So I think -- I don't think it's being driven at all by ARPA. I think it's being driven by prioritization and really building more and more efficiency and mobility within police forces as they have to contend with more and more crime."", 'Gregory Q. Brown', ""Tim, one other thing, just because we're still to George's question, weaning off PPV, and we'll have some commensurate benefits this year. If you take last year and this year, as we're working through this supply chain and elevated inventory and improved freight in PPV. If you look at first half and second half, Tim, to your point about guide and linearity, it's very similar to last year. So I'm not concerned about anything as we sit here with our expectation for the full year performance."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from the line of Matthew Niknam with Deutsche Bank.', 'Matthew Niknam', ""One question, one follow-up. So just on the supply chain. I think this was alluded to a little bit, but just if you can give any more color on the latest you're seeing there? And any noticeable impact from some of the disruption we've seen on the Red Sea front, if that's impacted you guys at all in terms of costs? And then secondarily, can you just talk a little bit more about the [Jabil] agreements, strategic rationale there and any cost implications we should keep in mind?"", 'Jason J. Winkler', ""Sure. I'll answer the second one first. The [Jabil] agreement is for them in 2024 to operate the 2 factories that will be transitioning to them. So not a significant change in cost profile in '24. But as we look to '25 and with our growth expectations, there will be opportunities for cost as well as an efficient way to scale the growth that we're expecting. So it was an agreement in us looking into the future and we're very pleased with it and providing us additional redundancy as well. It will help us scale, grow and also manage our cost envelope as we grow."", 'Matthew Niknam', 'And the Red Sea?', 'Jason J. Winkler', ""The Red Sea, we remain primarily on air as our mode of transportation. And so as a result, not a lot on the ocean and the impact of higher container rates is negligible for us. So given the state of the supply chain, while it's improving, we found that air and air rates are a good investment to make. And make sure that we're getting everything we need when we need it. We've seen continued improvement from supply chain and our vendors, particularly in semiconductors. And they have some improvements to make, and we expect them to continue to improve on the deliveries of, in particular, nanometer chips of 40 nanometers and above in some cases. So improving and working through it. And as we work through the year, it would be our expectation at the end of the year, to have overall inventory reduced again this year as things normalize and improve."", 'Matthew Niknam', ""That's relative to the [$827 million] you ended last year at?"", 'Gregory Q. Brown', ""That's right..."", 'Jason J. Winkler', ""That's right. The [$827 million was down $200 million] from a 12-month predecessor, and we expect to drive the [$827 million] down even further by year's end as we navigate an improving environment."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from the line of Adam Tindle with Raymond James.', 'Adam Tyler Tindle', ""Okay. Jason, I just wanted to start on backlog trends for a clarification. I know reported backlog in total appears -- the headline appears to be down. But I think there's a lot of impact from Airwave in that. Could you just give us a sense of what backlog looks like ex Airwave? And then just as a follow-up on that topic, either Jack or Greg or if you want to both weigh in. This is just a metric that I think investors are watching very closely because backlog builds and records have happened across tech hardware, whether it's Cisco and Networking or PCs before that and led to a sharper digestion period than initially anticipated once that backlog started softening. So I wonder if you could maybe just double-click on the current state of supply and demand and address how you think about the similarities or differences in what you're seeing in your business? And the time and shape of normalization if and when that does happen?"", 'Gregory Q. Brown', ""Yes. I would start, Adam, and tell you that this is one of the things I'm most proud of when I look at the trend for the full year. Overall backlog of $14.3 billion, ending year from a year ago with absorbing just under $800 million decrement for the calculation of Airwave. And the 3-year plus or 3-year backlog that, that sits. So be able to keep that at the same level or comparable levels with that reduction is pretty significant. The other thing that gives me optimism is the exceptionally strong product backlog that we exited Q4 and the aged backlog that we sit in the position of as we enter. But I also remind you, so I love the backlog position, but I also love the pipeline. And the ongoing demand and what I see in the funnel and when I look at Molloy and his team's conversion rates, I'm optimistic by what's in backlog. I'm also optimistic what's in pipeline."", 'Jason J. Winkler', ""Couple of attributes, I think, that are important to understand in our backlog. First, over 95% of our backlog comes to us from our government customers and our public safety customers. So -- and the majority of that is a direct relationship and a contractual one between us and an end customer, that is very important. And secondly, as you think about our backlog, we entered the year much like last year in a position where about half of our revenues for the year, a little bit more than that, will come to us from backlog. And with that strength, combined with the pipeline strength, that's what informs our guide for our 6% growth."", 'Gregory Q. Brown', 'Exactly.', 'Adam Tyler Tindle', 'Very helpful. Just quickly, Jason, sorry if I missed it. Did you talk about free cash flow expectations in 2024? And any benefit from working capital with the [Jabil] agreement? I know sometimes that could have some transitional working capital that may be favorable. So free cash flow and the potential benefit?', 'Jason J. Winkler', ""Yes. Given the '24 is an operating place kind of steady agreement, the working capital benefits are minimal in terms of that agreement. That said, we do expect working capital improvement. We talked about inventory, our outlook for operating cash flow is $2.2 billion. That's up off of last year's record $2 billion. And within that operating cash flow, the contribution for our CapEx continues to be 15% or less. So we're expecting another strong year of cash flow."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from the line of Joseph Cardoso with JPMorgan.', 'Joseph Lima Cardoso', ""I just wanted to follow up on the last free cash flow question. I guess when I'm taking a look at it kind of implies that you're going to have a nice step up in free cash flow generation, which, in combination, exiting 2023 with, I think, $1.7 billion of cash on the balance sheet. It looks like you'll have a fair bit of dry powder. Can you just help us think about the appetite in '24 to deploy cash buybacks, M&A? Like should we be thinking about a more aggressive than typical nature? Any color would be appreciated."", 'Gregory Q. Brown', ""Just in terms of capital allocation, we always think of it, and I love the fact that we have the balance sheet that we do, Jason, in his remarks talked about 1.4 net debt to adjusted EBITDA. So I love the opportunity, the flexibility that, that gives us. I'm proud of the way we are good stewards of capital, both returning it to the shareholder and share repo and dividend but being surgical and thoughtful to accretive acquisitions as well. So you think about this cash flow, and I always think the wheel of 55/30/15. 55% of that cash flow is available for share repo or acquisition, fungible between the 2, representative of the opportunities that come our way. 30% is dividend and 15%, as Jason just referenced, is CapEx. Even though we made only 1 acquisition at the end of the year in IPVideo, it certainly wasn't reflective of the engagements that we had. I think there's a lot of opportunity.I love the fact that we have the organic opportunity (inaudible), whether it's device refresh, public safety prioritization, ARPA funding, enterprise opportunity, video and government. You know the opportunities that are in front of us organically, which are consequential. Equally, I'm excited about acquisition opportunities that can make our portfolio stronger, particularly around either Video, Software or Services. So that's how we think about it."", 'Jason J. Winkler', ""The other thing that was noteworthy in '23, given the strength of our balance sheet is that we did earn an upgrade from Moody's to Baa2, and as Greg mentioned, we'll be in the debt markets this year, refinancing $1.3 billion. And so having taken note of the strength of the cash flow in '23 as well as our expectations in '24, that will help us as we refinance."", 'Joseph Lima Cardoso', 'I appreciate the color there. And then just for my follow-up, can we just get an update on Airwave? I noticed in the press release, it sounded like you guys have the option to file an application with the U.K. court of appeal. Like are you guys actually taking that step? Can you provide any color around that? And then any color in terms of the next steps beyond the filing and what other options you have at your disposal?', 'Gregory Q. Brown', ""Yes, we will pursue the next step, which is appealing to the U.K. Court of Appeals. We anticipate doing that next week. I've said all along, and we remain pretty consistent that, this whole thing is beyond unique. We still believe it's unprecedented. We think it's legally flawed, but I'm not going to wine about it. I'm consistent in our description we're going to pursue all the avenues available to us to defend our position. So to your point, that will be the filing of the appeal to the U.K. Court of Appeals next week, unclear how long that will take. Probably several months, but that remains to be seen. The only other thing I'd say is in public commentary that has been made with the CMA and other Parliamentary hearings. It's pretty obvious that they believe that Airwave will be needed well beyond 2026.The references have been made by different parties to either needing it through 2029 or 2030. So we will continue to move forward as best we can, engaging where we can, maintaining the investments that we need to make in this network and customer service levels is as high as they've ever been."", 'Jason J. Winkler', 'And just as a reminder, our current backlog with the adjustment we mentioned in Q4 has our contract with the U.K. Home Office through 2026.', 'Gregory Q. Brown', ""That's right."", 'Jason J. Winkler', ""There's opportunity for us to serve that account beyond that."", 'Operator', 'The next question is from the line of Tomer Zilberman with Bank of America.', 'Tomer Zilberman', ""Just wanted to start off first with ARPA. I just want to get an update what it contributed to orders this year and your expectations going into next year? I know you previously noted it was 5% contribution in '22, and I think you said in the first half of this year, it was also 5%."", 'John P. Molloy', ""Yes, Tomer, that's consistent with what we've said before. I think, the key thing I would say as it relates to budgets right now is public safety #1 continues -- public safety spend, it continues to get prioritized. Number two, I've just scoured through the state and local budget drafts of 2025. By and large, the situation remains very solid, even the states that have had an influx of immigrants have actually appropriated more dollars to public safety, which is interesting. But in generally speaking, when we look at it, the budget situation in state and local is very solid."", 'Tomer Zilberman', ""Got it. And then maybe just as a quick follow-up. I know you've touched on backlog already, but curious how the duration of the backlog has improved in the last 3 months and maybe the start of this year?"", 'Jason J. Winkler', 'To begin this year, its duration is similar to slightly improved from the beginning of where we were entering last year. So the duration and the quality attributes of the backlog are as good or better than they were last year.', 'Operator', 'The next question is from the line of Benjamin Bollin with Cleveland Research.', 'Benjamin James Bollin', ""Greg, bigger picture question. Going into an election year, curious how that has any impact, if at all, on how you guys thought about 2024 in your top line target? And then a secondary question would be, could you share your thoughts around the typical refresh that you see in the fixed video deployments? And how you think about replacement versus net new placements in the wild and how that kind of comes together in that 10% figure that you're talking about for Video growth this year?"", 'Gregory Q. Brown', ""Yes. Ben, in terms of the election year, it's interesting, we always talk about this, too. If you kind of look back over the history of this business, we do pretty well irrespective of a Republican or a Democratic administration. So we've had great success in 2023. We expect to have another strong year this year. When there is a presidential change, there's always some period of transition. They'll typically operate under a continuing resolution. But in the main, generally speaking, we have a pretty solid foundational level of performance, with kind of low beta risk given the backlog and the continual high priority demand in public safety.On fixed video, and we talked about, Jason articulated, the 10% target for this year. Look, I actually like the fact that we have the width and breadth of the portfolio that we do. So we have the broadest portfolio in Video, fixed or mobile, prem or cloud, and we can meet the customer wherever they want to be met to buy. Most of our customers have both cloud and prem. If, in fact, that there's a notable acceleration of cloud adoption, which we've seen and we are seeing that moves more toward cloud, that's great. If that moderates the top line growth from 15% to 10%, that's okay too, because of the long-term value of that dollar of revenue, the stickiness with the customer relationship. And as Molloy said, he and we still believe we're taking share. So we feel good about the position. In terms of refresh on cameras, Jack, maybe you want to talk about that?"", 'John P. Molloy', ""Yes, Ben, it obviously varies if there's citywide deployments, meaning outside cameras, you start to see a replacement cycle of anywhere to kind of 3 to 5 years in the networks that we manage. Internally, those upgrades are more driven by the R&D investments that Mahesh and team have made around analytics. I would note one thing. The acquisition we made in Pelco, we were actually very pleased in 2023 with the growth that Pelco had. But as we think about competitive VMSs that are out there, the work that we have ahead of us this year is to go and leverage our Pelco portfolio to drive new opportunities in the camera replacement cycle."", 'Mahesh Saptharishi', ""Just one more thing to add to that is just to support our Alta growth with Video. One of our initial acquisition thesis was just the ability to expand the camera portfolio that Alta supports. And something that we did towards the end of last year was to expand the entire H6SL line, which is one of the more popular within the Avigilon camera family, now that is entirely supported with an Alta Video. And I think that's also going to help with the refresh cycles and also help with some of the transition to cloud. Unity 8, we introduced that last year, and Unity 8, one of the special things about it is it's not just an on-prem solution. It's actually an on-prem solution that can bridge into the cloud as well. So as we think about those transitions, the boundary between on-prem and cloud is a bit fuzzy and I think, in a good way for us."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from the line of Keith Housum with Northcoast Research.', 'Keith Michael Housum', 'Great job on the quarter and for the year. I guess, question for you on the IPVideo acquisition. Perhaps just walk us through some of the rationale for that acquisition and perhaps where you see some of the cross-selling opportunities and growth opportunities going forward?', 'Mahesh Saptharishi', 'Sure. So the HALO Video Sensor or [health] Halo Sensor is actually not a new thing for us. We have -- Avigilon had partnered with IPVideo for quite some years. We have actually been reselling the IPVideo solution. And the key reason there is that there are plenty of situations like in schools where video cannot be used in certain locations, but these sensors can. So think of it as the detection of smoking vape sensors, et cetera, in bathrooms, in areas where we typically do not install cameras, but become quite important from a security and a safety standpoint. HALO is sort of the leading sensor when it comes to air quality, vape sensing, audio analytics, including gunshot detection. And so as we think about really expanding our capability within education and beyond. This was just a natural fit for us to bring in and integrate more closely with our Unity and Alta platforms.', 'John P. Molloy', ""The only thing I can add on that, and just in terms of cross-sell would be that they've done very well in education. It's our role to get in and expand that business into health care into workplaces, into transit areas where you have issues with people smoking and those kind of things as well. We think we've got the relationships to extend into those markets as well."", 'Keith Michael Housum', ""Okay. Makes sense. It's helpful. I appreciate it. As a follow-up question, changing gears on you slightly here. Another conversation on PCR. I know there's been some moving pieces throughout the year in terms of getting out in some of the areas like Asia, but perhaps just give an update on where PCR stands? I know there's been also some issues with supply chain earlier in the year. Any update would be helpful there?"", 'Gregory Q. Brown', ""Yes. PCR actually did great in '23, Keith, about $1.1 billion of revenue last year, and it was a record in full year '23. So the performance by that team was exceptional. And I would expect PCR to be comparable levels this year that's informed into the LMR mid-single-digit technology growth or actually high single digit when you normalize for Airwave. So PCR is quite resilient and doing well."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from the line of Louie DiPalma with William Blair.', 'Michael Louie D DiPalma', 'I was wondering, does Google bring any special benefits for partnering with them for Alta versus the other major cloud providers. I know you have, I think, a partnership with Azure for your Command Center business?', 'Mahesh Saptharishi', ""Yes, Louie. So to begin with, Avigilon Alta video is already on Google Cloud today. And this is really a scale story and especially a scale around some key vectors, for example, AI. And so as we think about expanding Alta geographically as we think about expanding Alta and more broadly, video across our capability set. AI was important. Mapping capabilities was important, low latency data delivery, video delivery was important, and we thought that Google would be a good partner as we expand our installation and our capability of deploying within Google Cloud.In terms of sort of more a broader comment on this, look, there's lots of stuff happening in the cloud world today, whether that's on the AI side, core cloud services, et cetera. And we want to be able to provide our customers with the best performance at the best price point. And so this Google partnership is really part of our multi-cloud strategy at the end of it all. So that's really what drove it."", 'Michael Louie D DiPalma', 'Great. And are the economics significantly different for Alta versus Unity? Are you actively pushing for one instead of the other?', 'Jason J. Winkler', ""We're positioned to offer our customers a choice, as Jack mentioned, we have growth expectations for both Unity, the on-prem as well as Alta customers like those in education, we mentioned on the call are increasingly choosing Alta. The difference between the two is really how the VMS or software layers delivered. In the case of Alta, the VMS is delivered and deployed through the cloud under a term license. And in the case of Unity, it's an on-prem and more of a perpetual with a maintenance arrangement. So those are the two models we have, Jack? Customers are."", 'John P. Molloy', ""Two things there, Louie, is the purchase decision remains very dynamic up until the last, call it, 2 to 3 weeks of a decision. But it's interesting as we look at win-loss data, one of the interesting things is that we've had competitors who are more point solution providers who have been eliminated from decisions, and we've had both Alta and Unity is finalist decisions, which, again, I think speaks to the breadth and the advantage that gives us in the marketplace."", 'Gregory Q. Brown', ""And Louie, while the customer decides, it's not so much what we push, it's what they want. And as Jack said many customers deployed, they deploy both. Cloud fixed video is smaller from our overall revenue contribution than prem fixed video, but it's noteworthy to say that the growth of cloud fixed video is a strong multiple of the prem solution."", 'Michael Louie D DiPalma', 'Yes. Is there increasing momentum for Alta? I think you mentioned how 25% of the growth for 2023 with Video is from Alta. Do you think that 25% is going to increase to 35% or something like that in 2024?', 'Gregory Q. Brown', ""I don't know. It depends on what '24's growth composition ultimately ends up being. But what I will say is the cloud solution, in our case, Alta is growing significantly faster than prem. So it's hard to predict the composition at the end of year '24 until we see how things settle."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley.', 'Unidentified Analyst', ""You've got [Jamie] on for Meta. Similar to one of the earlier questions and understanding that you're still seeing strong growth and some impressive wins in the quarter. The Q4 growth and accompanying 2024 outlook and Command Center, just looked a little bit lower than what we've been modeling. So I guess, is there any additional detail you can provide as to what you're seeing there and what's driving that outlook on '24? And then as a follow-up, how should we think about the contribution from pricing broadly and the growth outlook for '24?"", 'Gregory Q. Brown', ""And maybe we could tag team this. But Command Center, that's another one I was particularly proud of because we grew 21% for the year. Now obviously, Rave was a key driver in that. And Rave has turned out to be a great acquisition for us actually exceeding its business case. If you take that out, [Jamie], and you normalize for organic growth, the organic growth is another solid year of 10% growth. And by the way, that's inclusive of the growth of a $25 million headwind that actually represents the transitioning out of ESN. So when you think about the overall 10% growth of Command Center, you do have to include the normalization of the exit of ESN that's worth $25 million, but growth remains pretty strong in that segment as well."", 'Jason J. Winkler', ""And in terms of growth drivers for '24, we would expect growth from both volume and price, inclusive of ASPs continuing to grow as they did in '23 as our customers adopt more of the feature-rich part of the portfolio, including APX NEXT, in other parts of the portfolio, we would expect that to continue, and that's included in our growth expectations."", 'Operator', ""This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the floor over to Mr. Greg Brown, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer for any additional comments or closing remarks."", 'Gregory Q. Brown', ""Yes. Thanks. Listen, thank you for dialing in and listening. I would just close by saying that I think as we're entering 2024 or in it now in February, it's pretty clear that public safety and enterprise security have never been more important. I love the fact that we've got the broadest and most comprehensive product portfolio. I like the fact that as customers index to a more notable adoption on cloud acceleration. We're able to capitalize on that with our Alta solution.I love the fact that we have the APX NEXT refresh cycle, in particular, continue to march forward, and that remains robust. And as was mentioned on the call, I am particularly excited about our partnership with Google. For all of the Motorolans listening in on the call, I'm really proud of you. I'm proud of our team's execution in '23, and I'm anticipating another strong year in 2024, and I appreciate everything you're doing. I look forward to catching up and talking with you and debriefing in a quarter. Thanks again for all the great work."", 'Operator', ""Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference.

Even better, the tech giant's latest results indicate that it could sustain its impressive rally going forward. What's sparked this heightened investor enthusiasm? Microsoft has a solid growth driver in the form of artificial intelligence (AI) pushing it higher."", ""Microsoft stock did see a dip in its stock price following the release of the company's fiscal 2024 second-quarter results on Jan. 30. It seems investors had some concern about an increase in its operating expenses. What those investors seemed to ignore however is that Microsoft's fiscal Q2 revenue jump was the fastest since 2022."", 'Let\'s take a closer look at the factors that have led to an acceleration in Microsoft\'s growth and check how much upside this ""Magnificent Seven"" stock could deliver over the next three years.', ""Microsoft's fiscal Q2 revenue (for the three months ended Dec. 31, 2023) was up 18% year over year to $62 billion.

The stock price is down more than 80% since the start of 2021, back when the coronavirus pandemic was still in many people\'s minds and ""social distancing"" was still a key phrase. Investors who have held on to the stock since the start of the pandemic likely lost all or most of the impressive gains the stock saw in 2020.', ""A decline in Zoom's value shouldn't have come as a huge surprise to investors given that a return to normal would mean less of a need for video-based communications. Plus, competitors like Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) launched products like Teams and made it easier for users to find alternative videoconferencing options, which chipped away at Zoom's dominance."", ""Given the company's actual performance over that time, it appears overly punitive for Zoom stock to fall to pre-pandemic levels. Here's why this stock is a no-brainer buy at the valuation it's trading for."", 'Like some other investors, I was doubtful whether Zoom could survive given the competition it faced. Microsoft Teams, for example, is a videoconferencing application offered as a ""free"" add-on to a Microsoft 365 subscription, which includes Word, Excel, and other popular office apps. Why wouldn\'t customers ditch a paid service like Zoom for one that is already included in a Microsoft 365 subscription?', ""But even though Zoom's year-over-year revenue growth isn't soaring, it continues to be positive (see chart below). Although it's not at the same levels as a few years ago, that growth rate was unsustainable to begin with. The fact that revenue hasn't fallen drastically is a testament to the strength and popularity of Zoom's service."", ""As someone who has used both Zoom and Teams (and knows how frustrating the latter can be), I understand why Zoom still has a following. Even though Zoom might cost users more, it's the easier, smoother, and better videoconferencing application. This is further corroborated by Zoom's high net promoter score of 62, which beats the tech average of 58, and is higher than Microsoft, which has a score of 45."", ""As Zoom's revenue growth slowed, the company saw its margins shrink and eventually its bottom line fell into the red. But as the company cut costs and worked on efficiencies, it returned to profitability, reporting positive earnings in each of its three most recent quarters."", ""It's important for growth investors to see that the company's operations are sustainable. And with positive earnings often comes strong free cash flow. In the trailing 12 months, Zoom has brought in more than $1.3 billion in free cash."", ""By accumulating free cash, Zoom can put it to work and potentially pursue acquisitions and growth opportunities. It's when a business is not growing and not generating free cash that investors should be worried. That isn't the case with Zoom."", ""Zoom's stock is trading at only 14 times its estimated future profits. It offers a lot of good value. Its product is proving to be resilient, even amid growing competition."", ""At a discounted price, the stock can make for a great buy; there's no reason it should be trading near the levels it was at in 2019. The business has evolved and become much bigger since then. Although its long-term prospects are uncertain, given its cheap valuation, Zoom is still a solid stock worth adding to your portfolio."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Zoom Video Communications right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Zoom Video Communications, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Zoom Video Communications wasn’t one of them.

I'm Dylan Lewis. Joining me in the studio, Motley Fool senior analysts, Jason Moser and Bill Mann. Gentlemen, great to have you both here."", ""Bill Mann: That's true."", ""Dylan Lewis: We've got earnings updates from Big Tech, two stories that have us checking in on the panic meter and insights from a CEO that's led his company and shareholders to 3000% returns in his tenure. We're going to kick off with the Big Tech bid. Massive week for earnings, we have updates from Apple, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, and more. Jason, growth is back at the second largest company in the world. Apple reported top-line growth for the first time in over a year in its holiday quarter results, what got the company back on track?"", 'Jason Moser: I feel like that second largest company was a little bit of a jazz.', ""Dylan Lewis: It's a little dig."", ""Jason Moser: Listen, these things come in waves. I think with Apple, relative to the other big this was an OK quarter. Nothing special, but it was good. I think the bigger question really is probably focused more on what do things look going forward. I mean, looking at the numbers, they did return to revenue growth up 2% for the quarter with earnings per share up 16%, so obviously taking advantage of that scale. When you break it out into segment, iPhone revenue was up 6%, Mac revenue basically flat, iPad down 25%, wearables, home, and accessories down 11%, and then services up at 11%. We're seeing more and more. We talk about Apple becoming the services company that continues to a degree and it is important because that services revenue is so much higher margin than the hardware. To the tune of about 2x. Basically double the gross margin of that hardware. Still big questions there in regard to China. China down 13% for the quarter, so I think all in all the tepid response from investors makes a lot of sense given that the future does. It's not so clear right now."", ""Dylan Lewis: I feel like we've been watching this services increase as a portion of the revenue for a while, but it feels an awful lot trying to change the direction of cruise ship bill. It's just such a big company."", 'Bill Mann: Well, I just wanted to ask Jason, if you could get into the heads of leadership, Tim Cook, would they get out of hardware if they could just be a services business at Apple?', ""Jason Moser: Well, I can't imagine that given how well they do hardware. That's just something that they're so well known for, but clearly, they are trying to steer this more and more in that services direction which makes a lot of sense."", 'Bill Mann: I agree. I view the hardware as being their Mot.', 'Dylan Lewis: We did get an update on their hardware offerings or at least we finally have hands on their latest hardware offering. Their Vision Pro is officially on sale this week, Jason. It costs $3500.', ""Bill Mann: That's not on sale. That is full price."", ""Dylan Lewis: It's available for purchase, I should say. What does this device mean for Apple?"", ""Jason Moser: Well, this is just the first step. I don't think it means a lot at least in the near term. This is the first step for them, and I think what will be a multi years and potentially really multi decades effort. If you listen to Tim Cook, he says the Apple Vision Pro is a revolutionary device built on decades of innovation. It's years ahead of anything else. I don't know that necessarily buy into the years ahead of everything else. It wasn't a form factor to me. It's the same as all of the others, and that to me is the biggest sticking point with all of these, whether it's Oculus or Vision Pro or whatever else. The problem is you got to get the device built first to figure out what exactly you can do with it, and I think that's what we're going to see over the course of the next several years and beyond. It's ultimately these companies trying to figure out what they can do with these devices, why we need them as consumers, and then absolutely they need to continue to work on bringing that form factor down because to me that's the biggest roadblock with all of this. Not just Apple, but with any company that's getting into this headset space. That form factor has got to change or there's no massive option."", ""Dylan Lewis: We're going to stay in the metaverse and check in on Meta. Company also reported this week, shares up 20% after we saw full year results. We got the standard updates from the company, but also a big time surprise, a dividend."", 'Jason Moser: Zuckerberg giving himself a little raise there.', ""Bill Mann: He's getting a little bump, a little $175 million per quarter given his current share count. If you annualize that, which you should do, that's $700 million a year, which is pretty good."", ""Dylan Lewis: If you don't own quite as many shares as Mark Zuckerberg, you'll be getting $0.50 per share."", 'Bill Mann: What do you make most of us by the way.', 'Dylan Lewis: Jason, what do you make of this capital allocation decision?', ""Jason Moser: It's OK. I don't mind it. It certainly is a nice diversion away from the cash incinerator. That is Reality Labs, and so that's good. Look, you look at the business and what they tried to do in 2023, the year of efficiency. Well, I think so. They saw a 10% point bounce in operating margin from 25% last year to 35% this year, so they really did deliver on that year of efficiency, but even more encouraging is now we're seeing the business start to turn back around on the revenue side. The advertising demand that obviously remains there. Three plus billion users around the world. Listen, they grew that advertising revenue. They grew that revenue 25% with expenses along the way coming down 8%. Earnings per share are better than 200%. You know the one thing that stood out to me on the release and we knew this was happening head count down 22%."", 'Bill Mann: Incredible.', ""Jason Moser: On the one hand, you have to ask the question, why did you, why were you so bloated to begin with? Well, they weren't the only ones. I think we've seen this all across the market, but it just really stood out to me. They brought their head count at 22% clearly playing a role in the cost structure."", ""Dylan Lewis: It seems like a fitting time to check in on Meta because Facebook turns 20 this weekend. Back then it was the Facebook, now it is Meta gone through a couple name changes along the way, and we've seen the business change, and I think one thing that was a little buried in the results that we saw in some of the commentary from management was a bit of a transition away from a focus on the legacy, what was namesake platform Facebook, and much more of a portfolio view of the business, Jason."", ""Jason Moser: I think you look at the name Meta Platforms. They really are just trying to communicate that we are a platform with a number of different properties. As these companies get bigger and they have more contributors to the top and bottom lines, they don't necessarily need to be so granular. We saw Apple do the same thing back in the day in regard to the numbers of devices that they were reporting this to me. It really does make a lot of sense just given where Facebook is as big as the user base is today with Meta platforms."", ""Bill Mann: I think the dividend itself and the reduction in headcount both have something to do with each other because you've come to a time in which money is no longer free, and they're sitting on $65 billion in cash that is unencumbered. It's just sitting there, and they have come to the realization that, yes, as a platform company, they've needed to rationalize some of the investments that they've made. I do think it's funny at this point that this company is called Meta, and they barely talked about the metaverse. It would be like a company called Buggy Whip Incorporated beating up $200 billion in a day."", ""Jason Moser: I think that's the biggest question in regard to Reality Labs in the metaverse aspiration. I mean, reality lives chalking up another $4.6 billion loss for the quarter not for the year, $4.6 billions of the quarter. It made me think of Amazon back in the day, and we could be very critical of Amazon and all of their investments and just perpetuating losses, but it was an easier leap at least then because you know that people are going to buy stuff, and we could see the clear trend that people were buying more and more online. Here I just, I'm not saying it's not going to happen, but it definitely requires a greater leap of faith for investors to believe that the metaverse will develop into something. It just really hasn't yet not for the masses. That's the big question mark, but they're going to keep on investing."", ""Bill Mann: The thing that you have to know about Mark Zuckerberg is that he's not a romantic, and so when things are not working he is going to cut and he's going to change, and I think that is to his credit as CEO."", 'Dylan Lewis: On that note, I want to put a reckless prediction over to you, Bill. Will Meta still be called Meta in five years?', ""Bill Mann: No, I don't think so. I mean there's the Berkshire Hathaway example where the Berkshire Hathaway is actually named after a failed investment. It should be platforms or Reality Labs, but, no, I don't think it will be."", ""Dylan Lewis: We're going to wrap the segment. Checking in on Microsoft, we have results from the newly crowned largest company in the world, Jason, and they seemed awfully strong."", ""Jason Moser: Dig number 2. Yes, very strong. The big takeaway for investors. Microsoft is absolutely seen as the leader in the AI space, at least in regard to the big three or big four. Nvidia is just in a world of their own, so I don't include them there, but when you talk about companies like Amazon, and Alphabet, and Meta, and Microsoft, Microsoft is just seen as the leader right now, and they do so many things well, beyond that I mean productivity, storage, developers, security, and now gaming. Listen, they closed that Activision Blizzard deal and that gives them $13 billion plus gaming franchises. This is a monster in the gaming space. I just don't think you can forget about that, but they grew revenue 16% excluding currency effects, cloud revenue up 24%, these guys just keep on getting it done."", ""Bill Mann: I love the fact that we're shoehorning in a $3 trillion company like right at the end."", 'Jason Moser: Speak in right before we go to break status quo.', ""Dylan Lewis: Speaking of after break, we've got one more update from Big Tech and a closer look at some of the headlines that might be scarier than they actually are. Stay right here. This is Motley Fool Money."", ""Dylan Lewis: Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. I'm Dylan Lewis joined in studio by Bill Mann and Jason Moser. We hit Apple, Microsoft, and Meta updates, but we can't leave Amazon out of the big tech party. Jason, the Cloud was a huge focus for Microsoft. When we saw results from Amazon. How are things looking over at AWS?"", ""Jason Moser: I think this quarter really pulled back the curtain on how well diversified this business has become AWS revenue because that mean a AWS, that's really the first thing we focus on now. Revenue, $24.2 billion. That was up 13% from a year ago with operating income up 38% operating margin in that cloud division 29.6%. That was up 500 basis points from a year ago. All things considered, AWS continues to, as Ron Gross might say, fire on L cylinders. But back to the diversification of this business, look at the other parts of it, advertising up 26%. They are really seeing a lot of benefit from building out that entertainment aspect, that entertainment side of the business. Then of course, the retail operations continue to kill it, growth spread out equally between US and international. One little snippet I thought was interesting because we know how important third party sellers are to Amazon. Worldwide third party seller unit mix was 61% this quarter, its highest ever."", ""Bill Mann: You don't want to see a company cost cut its way to success and in fact, that's a hard way for companies to tend to do. Because you always want to go back and say, well, if you're cost cutting now, does that mean that you were lacking discipline before? But this quarter also had, for Amazon, the rocket fuel of a reduction in overhead so they had great online sales growth. But the reduction in cost primarily at their central operations really fueled an unbelievable quarter."", ""Dylan Lewis: So much of the theme in 2023 with big tech and companies in general was the year of efficiency. Meta got the branding on that, but we saw it across the board really with the companies focusing on their capital allocation and where they're putting money to work. Looking at what we're seeing, Bill so far from big tech and the market's reaction to the big tech results, what are we zeroing in on here?"", ""Bill Mann: I think one of the more interesting things is the fact that Meta decided to declare a dividend and the market is reacting positively to it. Which is the opposite of what happened when Microsoft did a few years ago. People were like, well, don't you have more places you can put your money? Efficiency does, if you are doing it right, leave money to be allocated in a different way. We talked about this last week about how Microsoft is now $468 per man, woman and child on the planet. They are not necessarily going to become more valuable, increasing their revenues across the board as they will be more efficient going forward."", 'Dylan Lewis: Jason, any other takeaways as we put all the big tech results together?', ""Jason Moser: I think when you look at big tech particularly, I'm thinking Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet. There was some language in a lot of these calls and I'll call out something just from Amazon's call. This is in regard to Cloud, while cost optimization continued to attenuate, larger new deals also accelerated. Ultimately, I think this has broader implications beyond just these three companies. I think it's a sign that, that spend may be coming back around for a lot of these enterprises based on the language in these calls. I think that is certainly something that should play out as a nice tail win for big tech, but also a lot of their customers which represents some great investing opportunities as well."", ""Dylan Lewis: In addition to the usual earnings updates this week, some pockets of concerns with a couple stories and Bill, Jason, I wanted to get your take on where these rank on the panic meter. First up, shares of New York Community Bancorp down 40% this week after the company reported rising losses and cut its dividend. Bill, the regional banking issues of 2023 still very fresh in a lot of people's minds. Is this something people need to be concerned about?"", ""Bill Mann: Well, yes and no. This is a rather big bank. It is an interesting story because New York Community Bancorp was the company that bought the assets from Signature Bank, which failed basically due to their ownership in crypto when crypto collapsed. How would you like to be a bank director now having to explain that you've lost money off of buying something at a discount that's already taken down other banks?"", ""Dylan Lewis: It's not great. Sounds like an easy conversation to have."", ""Bill Mann: They did it. Why shouldn't we? It's going to work for somebody someday. It was a bad quarter for them. It also is a little bit of a recognition of the fact that they have a huge amount of exposure to commercial real estate. I don't know if you've heard this, but a lot of offices and a lot of places still aren't full. There have been a huge amount of bankruptcies in the commercial space. I think ultimately the reality for New York Community Bank is that nobody really focused on their need to raise their provisions for credit losses sooner, so they did it all at once."", 'Dylan Lewis: Jason, this is a literal leveling up of the requirements for this business. Does it seem like something where management is maybe a little bit behind but being prudent here?', ""Jason Moser: I would hope that's the case. I certainly understand the near term concerns in this situation. You've got a bank now, that's all of a sudden it's going to be lofted into this category for banking. These are the biggest of the bigs. There's a lot that comes with that, enhanced financial standards and reporting. They have to really rebuild this business. That takes time and capital. I certainly understand, cutting that dividend. It's nice that they've at least still maintained it. I understand concerns when you're building up allowances for credit losses. But, hey, listen, they grew tangible book value from a year ago so that's encouraging. There are a lot of unknowns when it comes with some of these deals. But I don't know that I really see this as something to be worried about longer term. But by the same token, I get the short term concerns."", ""Bill Mann: It didn't happen from nowhere."", 'Dylan Lewis: Bill, I want to give you the final take there. Is this really something that we should be zeroing on specifically to New York Community Bank, or is this something we should be watching for the industry?', ""Bill Mann: Their net interest margin collapsed this last quarter and I think that it is specific to New York Community Bancorp. The analysts on the call were absolutely withering with the fact that the changes and the set asides that they made were so big. That why is it that you haven't been able to predict this? By the way, how about some good predictions now for what's going forward now that you've done this. I think it is specific to them, but you're talking about something that's happening in an environment around the world, where commercial real estate is a financial problem. If those are the assets on your balance sheet, you should at some level be worried."", ""Dylan Lewis: You teed me up better than you possibly could have known for our second topic for the panic meter. This zooms in on real estate, but takes us outside the United States and usually I go global when I've got you on the show, Bill. This week, a judge in China ruled that failed real estate giant Evergran will move to liquidation. This is a story we've been following for a little bit, dating back to the company originally defaulting on its dollar denominated debt. How big of a deal is this, Bill?"", ""Bill Mann: It's huge in a lot of ways. It's huge. Let's start with the top number. They owe somebody $300 billion. [laughs] I don't know if you know that, but that's a lot."", ""Dylan Lewis: That's a huge chunk of change."", ""Bill Mann: A bankruptcy judge actually in Hong Kong said, fine. You've been trying to figure out how to reorganize. We're done with this, so now, we're going to wind up operations. This becomes a much more political hot burden in China. The reason is this, a lot of the money that's owed, is owed to people who have put deposits down on apartments and houses that will now never get built. Really the big issue is that this is a political question as much as it is a financial one. In China, most of the money is owed to individuals who put deposits down for houses that they're not going to get. Bankruptcy law treats them very low in the stack, but internationally, most of the debt is owed outside of the country and so what does China do here? Do they follow bankruptcy law or did they do the politically efficient thing?"", ""Dylan Lewis: Bill, Jason, We'll see you a little bit later in the show. Up next we've got a familiar name in your financial lives that might be worth looking at in your portfolio. Stay right here. You're listening to Motley Fool Money."", ""Dylan Lewis: Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. I'm Dylan Lewis. When you hear FICO, your mind might go to personal finances and your credit card statements, but you'd be pretty happy if the name was in your stock portfolio. The company is the standard in consumer credit scores and under CEO Will Lansing over the last 12 years, shareholders are up over 3,000% crushing the S&P 500. This week we caught up with Lansing about his team's management philosophy. Why investors should focus on more than just the company's scoring business and the way AI and buy now, pay later are affecting the credit industry. I'm sure our listeners know the name FICO and probably know that you're a number that matters in their financial lives. But could you kick off talking a little bit about how you fit into the consumer credit and scoring place? Because I know there are a lot of players in that environment."", ""Will Lansing: That's probably the place where we're best known is for our scores, FICO scores, that's one of our two businesses. We have scores and software. Scores has been an evolving business for us and we got started in it long ago. We're a 65 year old company and we got into proprietary scores for lenders in the 50, 60 years ago. What happened was we found ourselves building scorecards for individual banks. We did that for many years and we thought, if we could make one of these more generic, more available to everybody, there would be a market for it. In 1987, we launched the first industry wide FICO score in partnership with Equifax. That had a great success, the lenders loved that. Suddenly they had this low cost, automated way to evaluate credit and so that took off. Our next innovation was, well, instead of just doing it on the Equifax credit file, why don't we do this on Trans Union and Experience also and we'll have more of an industry wide score available to any lender who uses any of the three bureaus data. So we did that and it made the score even more popular with lenders because as you can imagine, it gave them a little bit of flexibility and leverage with the bureaus and suddenly it was available to a lot more lenders. That worked out pretty well."", ""Then what happened was the regulators who are looking for ways to evaluate the risk in the portfolios of the banks that they regulate, identified FICO score as a common way of evaluating risk. They started to ask the lenders for that. Let us see the average FICO score for this portfolio, for that portfolio, that went over pretty well. Relatively quickly the regulators came to rely on the FICO scores, pretty scientific and easy to get measure of risk for those portfolios. So now you've got the lenders who are using it because it's a great value proposition for them. They can make low cost credit decisions. You've got the regulators who are finding it useful for measuring risk. Lenders are happy to please the regulators as you can imagine. Then, a lot of, certainly in the last 40 years, a lot of lenders have taken to securitizing their loans. You have the investors saying to the lenders, hey, how can we evaluate the risk In this paper you're trying to sell us. Obviously the FICO score, which is available for every one of the loans in there, becomes a really good tool for investors to evaluate the quality of the portfolios that they're buying. Now you've got these three constituencies that are all relying on the FICO score. That's really how we became the anchor of the credit ecosystem. That's why we're so deeply embedded, where we are the industry standard. We're very predictive, there's a lot of good reasons for it. But also the network for effects are very powerful because once you're as deeply embedded as we are, it's hard to get out."", ""Dylan Lewis: So is the thought there that basically you guys have done something well, and when you do something well, the use for it just continues to grow and grow and you're able to serve more stakeholders?"", ""Will Lansing: For sure. I'm often asked, how is it that FICO became an industry standard. Everybody would like to be an industry standard. How did you guys do it? As I explained, it happened over time with building different constituencies for the score. Then you get into network effects because you have all the utility that happens in different places. Actually we worked on that, we became ever more embedded and then we thought, is there anything else we can do to really cement our position in this ecosystem? We're running a business. We came up with this idea about ten years ago. We came up with this idea of providing the FICO score to consumers. We said, hey, you lenders, you're buying the FICO score from us. How about if we give you a free reuse and you can share it with your consumer customers? Initially they were a little hesitant because they didn't want us even more embedded than we already were. But over time they came to recognize the utility of it and a number of big lenders explored it, experimented with it and found it very successful. Consumers really liked it. Now we're in 250 million accounts across the country providing free FICO scores to consumers. You probably get your FICO score from your bank for free. That's typical, but again, it just cements our position. How's the bank going to say goodbye to FICO when there's so much reliance by the consumer and everyone else on the score."", ""Dylan Lewis: Looking at the state of the business now and some of the recent results that you guys put up when you posted earnings, it seems like you're seeing good growth in scores. Seems like you're seeing relatively good growth in software as well. What are the portions of the business that you're excited about and that you feel like people should be paying attention to?"", ""Will Lansing: Well, I think you're absolutely right that we have good growth on both sides of the business and that wasn't always the case. I think if you go back 15 years ago, our software business was growing one or 2% a year. Our scores business was growing five, six, 7%. It really went with GDP. It went up and down with GDP. Which is understandable given its role and we've done a lot of things to it. Now both our software business and our scores business grow double digit, almost consistently year in year out. I'm excited about both sides of the business. They're different because the scores business is an IP licensing business. So it's got very, very high margins. It's a 90% margin business, growing double digit. That's part of why our stock is as popular as it is. Then our software business is much more of a business of the future because we're growing very fast. Our software platform business is growing over 40% year over year and has been for four years. I think that tells you that the dog is eating the food. The CRM business is alive and well and it's going to do very well, but it's not a profitable business today. It's a break even business and that's because we're pouring money into R and D, we're chasing market share and maintaining our lead from a features and functionality standpoint. Someday, we'll improve the margins. That's up to us. We have the opportunity to do that whenever we choose to. But right now, we're putting all the energy into growth, growth, growth. Which side am I excited about? I love them both. There are two wonderful children that I love equally."", ""Dylan Lewis: You've mentioned the stock performance there by my count and these are round numbers. I think stock is up about 3,000% since you took over the CEO role in 2012. Top line has gone from about 650 million to over 1.5 billion. Net income is about five x to 450 million on a trailing 12 month basis. Can you talk a little bit about the management philosophy you mentioned focusing on growth right now. But just what you guys are prioritizing when it comes to allocating capital and the projects that you're interested in."", ""Will Lansing: Yeah, absolutely. Well, thank you for pointing out statistics out, and it's really great when you point them out relative to the S&P 500 or the Russell 3,000 because we're in the top 1%. We're in the 99th percentile on total shareholder return against all the major indices. We're top 10 company out of the S&P 500 on TSR over the last 12 years. So that's the track record and the philosophy that goes with it is you start with believing that your job is to make the stock more valuable. Your job is to take care of shareholders. That's what we think we have to do here. That's what we wake up every morning thinking about. Now obviously, the only way you get there is by focusing on customers and quality product and employees and all the constituencies that the company touches. But there's no fuzziness in our thinking. There's a lot of clarity. Our goal is to take care of our shareholders and to maximize the value of FICO over the long term. We take a three to five year horizon. We do nothing on a quarterly basis. So unlike a lot of software businesses, we do not chase quarterly earnings. We give guidance annually and the business goes up and down on a quarterly basis, and we don't really pay a lot of attention to it. Unlike a lot of software businesses, you don't get extra discount for closing a deal at the end of the quarter. Our guys are instructed to tell our customers, well, this is the price and you can have next week, you can have this week when you're ready to buy the stuff we'll work with you. It's a much healthier relationship with your customers. In the long run, it took a while to get this culture in place, but in the long run, I think it's good for the business, it really is good for the business. Shareholders for long term view of the business, we treat it like a family business. We have three values in our company."", ""Speaker 1: Act like an owner, delight our customers, and earn the respect of others. Those are the three. But the Number 1 value in our company is act like an owner. I never miss an opportunity with our people to talk about, this is your company. We have very wide stock ownership also with and we have 3,500 employees, over a third of them on stock. I mean, a lot for a public company. I encourage them to think about it as a family business and you have money and resources at your disposal, you have budgets that you work, you have people who work for you, you have your own time. If you don't feel like you're spending your financial and human capital the right way, you have an obligation to stand up and change it. This is your business. If it were a family business, would you be doing what you're doing or would you change it? That's really the mentality in our place. It's a real ownership mentality. I too I'm a big owner of the business. I'm a public company CEO, but my network is tied up in this company. Everyone knows it. I treat it like a family business. In terms of capital allocation, we don't do a lot of MNA. It's an interesting problem because we have a very high PE and so virtually anything we wanted to do would be a creative. If our only goal were accretion, we would do a lot more MNA than we do. But the problem comes when you start comparing a business that we would buy with the business that we're already in. On that basis, they're all dilutive."", ""We look at it and we say, well, do we like that business better than we like our own? If the answer is no, we don't and that's typical. We say, well, let's take our free cash flow and put it into stock buyback. If you look at that over the last, it's more than just my tenure. But certainly, during my tenure, we have been very big buyers of our own stock. I mean, we were 76 million shares at the high point. We were 36 million shares when I joined the board, and we were 30 million shares when I became CEO, and today we're about 25 million shares. So we've come down quite a bit. We're basically kind of a slow-motion LBO. We like it that way. We're very confident in our own business. We love our business, we're confident in our business, and given the choice, we'd rather put the money into our own business than into another one. We still do very small acquisitions, little tuck ins for technology, sometimes talent acquisitions. But although we look all the time, we're always looking. The reality is we just like our business better than everyone else's. There's a reason we love our business. I mean, it's a good business."", ""Dylan Lewis: There are a couple things that seem to be affecting the industry that I want to dig into with you and get your take on. The first one, and this is true of anybody in the tech space, anybody of the software space, is artificial intelligence. Knowing that you're in analytics and knowing that you're in software, what do some of the AI investments look like for FICO?"", ""Speaker 1: We are obviously involved in AI. We have a bunch of patents in AI. It's an interesting area for us because we've been in analysts, we've been in AI for a very long time, and machine learning, and neural nets, and there's a time place for it. On generative AI, which is what everyone's buzzing about these days, I think that FICO will benefit in the same way that everyone else does in terms of lowering costs and call centers, and coding, and things like that. I think that in underwriting, it'll be quite a while before AI really works its way into the production side of underwriting. That's because it's so heavily regulated. The regulators demand to understand, why did you make the decision that you made? Let's make sure that it complies with fair lending practices. AI doesn't lend itself easily to that. It's a little bit more of a black box and you have to unpack how it is that the AI got to the decision that it got to. Now, we have a bunch of patents in this space where we call it explainable AI, ethical AI, and we do have patents in the space and we are prepared to use it. We do use AI and synthetic data in our modeling. You have to be careful and use it in the right places. That's how it affects us. We definitely are investing in it. For others, sometimes it's a hobby and a toy and I think there's also appropriate uses."", ""Dylan Lewis: One of the other things I wanted to ask you about was buy now, pay later. This is an interesting topic in credit. It's been growing very quickly. We actually saw quite a few consumers taking use of buy now, pay later programs this holiday season. Can you talk a little bit about how it fits into the credit industry right now?"", ""Speaker 1: Yeah, absolutely. Buy now, pay later typically is people who are expanding their access to credit by working a deal with a buy now pay later company to essentially buy a product on installment. That's basically what it is. The challenges are that the bureaus don't all treat the payments the same way. They don't treat this data the same way. There's not a consistency yet in how it's treated. I think that there's a benefit for consumers because not only do they have the access to the incremental credit, but they also can provide more data to those who care about their credit practices. There are opportunities to improve your credit standing with buy now, pay later. FICO is working with a firm right now to sort out how do we standardize the use of the buy now, pay later data so they can really be incorporated in scores and give people access to credit they wouldn't otherwise have on the revolving side. I think it's a good development in the industry. It fits a very specific need. I mean, we've had installment loans forever, but I think we've figured out how to do it in 21st century way. I think it's a good thing and we're working on trying to get the benefit of it for the consumer on the data side. We're working out how to do it well."", ""Dylan Lewis: Listeners, we're always looking for ideas on companies and leaders you want to hear from. If you've got an idea, shoot us a note at podcasts at fool.com. Coming up after the break, Bill Mann and Jason Moser return with a couple stocks on their radar. Stay right here. You're listening to Motley Fool Money."", ""As always, people in the program may have interests in the stocks they talk about and the Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against, so don't buy or sell based solely on what you hear.

Each week you bring the stocks, our man behind the glass, Dan Boyd, hits you the question, or sometimes even better yet, more of a comment. Bill, you're up first. What are you looking at this week?"", ""Bill Mann: I'm looking at one of the most powerful cosmetics brands in the world, a company called Estee Lauder. Their company has been hit very hard, lost a lot of market share. They've lost a lot of gross margin. The question for me, and their earnings are on Monday, are they going to get back to their former glory? They are forecasting $2.60 in earnings. Two years ago, they were seven dollars. If it is a $2.60 stock, it's very expensive. It's more to a seven dollar stock. It is very cheap. It's a company that's a family run company. Basically, they've had a story line that would have fit on succession, [laughs] but here we are, and the company still goes forward. What are we going to get on Monday?"", 'Dylan Lewis: Dan, a question about Estee Lauder.', 'Dan Boyd: Yeah. Bill, respectfully, what the heck do you know about cosmetics?', 'Bill Mann: Dan it depends. Eighty percent gross margins. Do you like money?', ""Dan Boyd: I mean, that makes sense. You can't just ignore it just because you're not necessarily the end customer."", 'Bill Mann: I use product.', 'Dan Boyd: Yeah.', ""Bill Mann: I've got a facial regiment. I don't know what your problem is, Dan."", ""Dan Boyd: All right. Jason, what's on your radar this week?"", ""Jason Moser: Keeping an eye on Etsy. Ticker is E-T-S-Y. We will see Etsy earnings toward the end of the month, but before that, we saw this week Elliott Management is going activist on Etsy. They built up a 13 percent stake in the company and even got a board seat. You know, it's funny. You read management's take on this, they seem to be optimistic about this. I don't know. But clearly the company has pulled back significantly after the big COVID bounce that so many companies saw over the last few years. Etsy is a good business. Let's get that out of the way. Fundamentally, it's a good business but they've hit a wall. They pulled a lot of growth forward as most did and I think now you have some questions in regard to the house of brand strategy they did, dump Elo7 in the middle of last year, and that was a relatively smaller acquisition. But it at least begs the question, are these other acquisitions paying off or will they pay off as management had hoped? Given Elliot's track record, this could very well be a positive catalyst for the stock in the coming quarter, so looking forward to the earnings report at the end of the month."", 'Dylan Lewis: Dan, a question about Etsy.', 'Dan Boyd: How about a comment and said. This is one of those shops where whenever my wife is on Etsy, I start to get a little concerned about the bank accounts, boys.', 'Jason Moser: Right there with you.', ""Dylan Lewis: I was going say, I mean, I think that this is a very Valentine's radar stock segment. We have gift ideas. We have gift ideas abound. Dan, which one's going on your watch list this week?"", ""Dan Boyd: Honestly, this is a tough one. But the truth is, I don't know Estee Lauder very well, so I got to go with Etsy."", ""Dylan Lewis: I'm a proud customer and a fan of the pick, Dan. Thank you for weighing in.

To skip the latest news and analysts’ sentiments around the current economic conditions, go directly to the 5 Best Big Company Stocks to Buy.', 'Despite the doubts, the market performed exceptionally in 2023. While several analysts believed it to be temporary, the new year isn’t showing many signs of weakness in the market. Although there have been a few hurdles, the overall prediction is that the Federal Reserve will manage to guide the US economy toward a soft landing rather than a recession, as was expected in the last two years. However, analysts still advise caution in the short term. Marko Kolanovic, Chief Global Markets Strategist and Global Co-Head of Research at J.P. Morgan, said:\xa0', '“As we approach 2024, we expect both inflation data and economic demand to soften, as the tailwinds for growth and risk markets are fading. Overall, we are cautious on the performance of risky assets and the broader macro outlook over the next 12 months, due to building monetary headwinds, geopolitical risks and expensive asset valuations.”', 'Nevertheless, the latest news suggests that the financial markets are heading in the right direction as the S&P 500 touched 5000 for the first time at the time of market opening on February 9 after December inflation data, which turned out to be even lower than initially reported. While the Fed recently revealed that it will take its time to review market data before making any decision to announce rate cuts, many analysts believe that the rate cuts can begin in the first half of 2024.', 'Despite the positive predictions around the market, the varying opinions of experts can lead to further confusion among novice investors, which is why the best big company stocks are some of the safest bets for such people. These big company stocks bring a sense of safety among investors as the losses are never permanent, even during bear market conditions. Additionally, the best company stocks are usually cash-rich with strong balance sheets and can easily weather any economic disasters. Furthermore, their wealth also allows them to pay steady dividends. For example, one of the giants in the energy sector, Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) has increased its dividends for the last 37 years, even though the last 10 years have seen some significant volatility in the energy sectors. Similarly, another blue-chip stock, PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) raised its dividend by 7% on February 9 despite year-over-year (YoY) revenue declines across major markets in the fourth quarter of 2023.', 'The big company stocks do not guarantee positive returns all the time but provide ample opportunities for investors when they fall. For example, earlier this month, we discussed the 10 blue-chip stocks at 52-week lows, which you should check out as these are also some of the best big company stocks that provide prime entry points for investors. However, our current list uses a different methodology, and some of our current best big company stocks include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). After an exceptional performance in 2023, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) declared its first-ever quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share on February 1 and increased its previous share buyback authorization by $50 billion. The company nearly gained 200% in the year and is up nearly 36% year-to-date (YTD) at the time of writing on February 9.', 'A large stock market board displaying the S&P 500 and S&P 500 Growth Index.', 'Our Methodology', 'To choose the best big company stocks, we used the FinViz stock screener to identify mega-cap stocks with an estimated 5-year EPS growth of over 15%. These stocks were then listed according to the number of their hedge fund investors in the third quarter of 2023. The hedge fund sentiment was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 910 elite hedge funds.

(NASDAQ:NFLX), ServiceNow, and Salesforce.', 'During Netflix’s pandemic grow-over issues in 2022, the market seemed to believe there was little revenue or free cash flow growth left to be had for this business. The pandemic had pulled forward user growth, and the company then disclosed that there were over 100 million households that were using Netflix but not paying for it by borrowing a paid user’s account. After we assessed this information, better understood how the company could monetize shared passwords, and realized the win-win for Netflix and consumers from introducing an ad-supported subscription tier, we meaningfully added to our position in Netflix in the summer of 2022. We saw a clear path to much better monetization of an already robust and differentiated platform with a continued commitment to improved content spend efficiency and free cash flow growth.', 'Fast forward to today, Netflix has made meaningful progress on monetizing shared passwords and laying the foundation for consumer choice, although the ramp in advertising tier subscribers remains in the beginning stages. The low-hanging fruit may already have been picked on password sharing efforts, but our research shows there should be long tails of revenue and free cash flow growth. In our opinion, Netflix remains the most advantaged and profitable streaming service with opportunities to continue adding subscribers and raising prices as it demonstrates more value to consumers over time. Over the longer term, we also expect significant advertising revenue. That said, the market finally seems to have appreciated some of this. As a result, we trimmed our position from approximately 8% of the Portfolio to approximately 5% in the fourth quarter.”', 'Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is an Indiana-based company that discovers, develops, and markets human healthcare products.', 'On February 6, Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) posted its Q4 non-GAAP EPS of $2.49, which beat the estimates by $0.12.

I'll now turn the call over to John for his prepared remarks."", 'John Albright', ""Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. As we look back at our execution in 2023, we continued to emphasize the value focus, asset recycling program we implemented nearly two years ago. This program has allowed us to reposition our portfolio into higher quality credits that derisk our cash flows and provided the liquidity needed for our opportunistic share repurchases and strong yielding first mortgage investments. Within the fourth quarter, the majority of our investment activity was concentrated in the first mortgage investments in share repurchases, and we believe these investment opportunities provide attractive risk-adjusted returns compared to other opportunities available in the market.During the quarter, we originated nearly $31 million of first mortgage loan investments and acquired two single tenant net lease properties for $3 million. The initial yield on our loan investments was 9.2%, and the cash cap rate of our property acquisitions was 7.3%, our largest investment with a low leverage $24 million first mortgage secured by 41 retail properties. In conjunction with a loan we entered into a fee sharing agreement with CTO Realty Growth, our external manager. This fee sharing agreement allows us to receive a share of the asset management disposition and leasing fees related to CTO.'s management.The other loan investments we made during the quarter were the first mortgage to provide $6.8 million in funding towards the purchase and development of a five acre project anchored by Wal-Mart and McDonald's in a growing submarket of Nashville, Tennessee. While we intend for our loan investments to remain a relatively small component of our overall asset base and strategy. They do provide future purchase options for our acquisition pipeline and serve as a catalyst for our future partnership opportunities with the sponsors, and we believe they offer compelling risk-adjusted yields supported by strong tenant credits and well-capitalized sponsors.On the acquisition front, we acquired two newly built properties leased to Dollar Tree Family Dollar as we saw fewer attractive core investment opportunities due to reluctant sellers.And finally, as it relates to our common stock buybacks, we repurchased $9.5 million of our common stock at an average price of just over $16 per share during the fourth quarter. The implied cap rate of these repurchases was above 8%, which is significantly above the cap rates for comparable fee-simple property investments available in that market, especially considering 65% of our annualized base rent comes from tenants with an investment grade credit rating in our stock pays nearly a 6.9% dividend yield at $16 per share.For the full year 2023, we acquired 14 net lease properties for a $3 million and a 7.4% cash cap rate in originated first mortgage investments totaling just under $39 million of funding commitments at the initial yield of 9.1% over 66% of the acquired base rents from the property acquisitions in 2023 come from Tenet with investment grade credit rating on the disposition side of things during the full year 2023 we sold 24 properties for $108 million at a weighted average exit cap rate of 6.3%, generating gains of $9.3 million. Overall for the year, our net investment spread, which is different between our investment yields and disposition yields, averaged 159 basis points. So even with limited access to the capital markets and the increase in interest rates over the past 18 months, we're still driving positive increases in cash flow through our asset recycling strategy.From our portfolio makeup perspective, Matt, will outline more of the specifics with his prepared remarks. But given we are coming up on our five year anniversary later this year, I wanted to take a moment to highlight the progress we've made in transitioning our portfolio through our asset recycling strategy. Since inception of the Company, we've recycled nearly $600 million of capital as we've accretively sold off primarily office assets and properties occupied not by non credit tenants and reinvested the proceeds at positive net investment spreads. As a result, we've taken our office exposure from 43% to 0%. Increase. Our exposure to investment grade rated tenants from 36% to 65%, increased per-share quarterly dividend by more than 37%. And our top tenant list, which includes the likes of the industry leaders such as Walgreens, Lowe's, Dick's Sporting, good Dollar Tree, Family, dollar dollar, general Walmart, Best Buy Hobby Lobby in Home Depot now compared favorably to many of our peers that trade at significantly better valuations. From a valuation perspective, we're currently trading well above an implied 8% cap rate on our real estate portfolio. At a significant discount to our book value of $18.36 per share. Additionally, we have strong AFFO per share growth projected for 2024 in our low and that loan investments provide a natural deleveraging opportunity over the next 24 months. To put it bluntly, we're a great value today, and we look forward to maximizing that value for our shareholders.Now I'll turn the call over to Matt to discuss our portfolio makeup, quarterly results, balance sheet and 2024 guidance section."", 'Matthew Partridge', ""As of the end of the year, our portfolio consisted of 138 properties totaling 3.8 million square feet with tenants operating in 23 sectors within 35 states. And as John mentioned 65% of our annualized base rent or ABR now comes from tenants are the parent of tenants who have an investment grade credit rating. The portfolio continues to be 99% occupied and our top tenants remain largely unchanged. However, we do anticipate occupancy increasing over the coming months as we have signed or in the process of signing multiple leases related to the vacant properties. Fourth quarter 2023 FFO was $0.37 per share, unchanged when compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. In Q4 2023, AFFO was $0.38 per share, representing a 7.3% decrease over the fourth quarter of 2022. Our quarterly results were most notably impacted by one-time expenses related to tenant credit loss and bankruptcy, primarily attributable to the seven Valero branded Mountain Express properties that we discussed during our third quarter conference call, as well as the timing of investments and dispositions. These items were partially offset by regular rent increases within the owned portfolio, attractive net investment spreads from asset recycling program, increased interest income from cash and restricted cash on balance sheet and lower interest expense driven by year-over-year effects of previously completed interest rate hedges.Our general and administrative expenses for the quarter totaled $1.5 million which includes the $1.1 million management fee to our external manager. Our G&A increased 4.5% year over year, largely a result of higher state and local taxes and increases to the management fee driven by our net equity capital markets activities over the past 12 months. The current annual run rate for our management fee before any assumed new equity issuances or repurchases is $4.2 million.For the full year, FFO was $1.47 per share and AFFO was $1.49 per share representing year over year per share decreases of 15% and 16% respectively, when compared to the full year of 2022. As previously announced, the Company paid a fourth quarter cash dividend of $27.5 per share, representing a current annualized yield of more than 7%. And our fourth quarter FFO and AFFO payout ratios remained fairly consistent at 74%, 72%, respectively. We anticipate announcing our regular quarterly cash common stock dividend for the first quarter of 2024 towards the end of February from an equity capital markets perspective, we continue to be active during the quarter on our Board approved a $15 million share repurchase program, repurchasing nearly 595,000 shares of our common stock for a total cost of $9.5 million at an average price of $16.1 per share. In 2023, we repurchased nearly 900,000 shares of our common stock for total costs for a total cost of $14.6 million at an average price of $16.23 per share and in January, we did complete the remainder of the $15 million share repurchase program. We ended the quarter with net debt to total enterprise value of 51%. Net debt to pro forma EBITDA of 7.7 times and our fixed charge coverage ratio was a healthy 3.5 times the balance sheet as well stabilized with no debt maturities until 2026 and total liquidity at quarter end through cash, restricted cash and undrawn revolver commitments was more than $187 million. And our press release last night. Initial guidance for 2024 reflects our confidence in the portfolio's quality. The year-over-year benefits from the asset recycling John referenced increased fee revenue from our fee sharing agreement with CTO. and what we believe is a reasonably cautious stance regarding our current access to capital expected activity in the transactions market and broader economic environment.As we begin 2024 with portfolio-wide in-place annualized straight-line base rent and in-place annualized cash base rent of $38.8 million and a run rate annualized interest income from loan investments of $3.2 million. Our full year 2024 FFO guidance range is $1.51 to $1.56 per share, and our full year 2024 FFO guidance range is $1.53 to $1.58 per share for 2024. Guidance for investment activity is $50 million to $80 million of investments contingent on reasonable market conditions, and our investments guidance does include the potential for additional loan investments.Our 2024 dispositions guidance is to sell between $50 million to $80 million properties. And we are currently assuming approximately 75 basis points to 100 basis points net investment spread between our investment yields and our disposition yields.And finally, we are forecasting our weighted average share count for 2024 to be approximately 14.9 million shares. And this does incorporate the effects of the of completing the remaining portion of the $15 million share repurchase program I referenced earlier. We appreciate everyone joining the call today, and we'll now open it up for questions.Operator?"", 'Operator', 'Thank you. And as a reminder, if you would like to ask a question, please press star one one on your telephone and wait for your name. To Be Your question, please press star one when again one moment.Well, CROSSTALK, our first question is going to come from the line of Rob Stevenson with Janney Montgomery Scott. Your line is open.', 'Robert Stevenson', 'Good morning, guys. Matt, just to follow up on one of your latter comment is the $0.05 guidance range. Is that just acquisition and dispositions that slide between there? Is there something else notable that would push you down to the $1.51 or up to the $1.56 or conversely the AFFO range?', 'Matthew Partridge', 'Yes, morning, Rob. Part of it is the acquisition and disposition timing and then the other component that could move that around a little bit is whether or not we get loan repayments specifically for the $24 million loan where that is intended to be a liquidated portfolio. And so that could cause interest income to be reduced over the period of the year.', 'Robert Stevenson', 'Okay. And what is the latest in terms of the Mountain Express stuff is that going to wind up being some of the sales this year? Is that all going to be retenanted some of it? How are you guys looking at that at this point?', 'Matthew Partridge', ""Yes. So we're in active discussions with a number of operators. We've got two leases signed on two of the locations. We're working on three more, and then we're in preliminary discussions on the other two, we're still anticipating selling them just given our focus on publicly traded or publicly rated tenants. But Tom, we're in active discussions to have all of that at least in the near to medium term."", 'Robert Stevenson', ""Okay. And come when you take when you guys take a look at the portfolio, how much of it is likely disposition candidates at this point versus, you know, only if you found something that was an extremely compelling buy? I mean, are you pretty much done with the recycling of the majority of the assets unless somebody comes and it makes a very strong offers are still, you know, the bottom 25% of the portfolio's likely to be sold, you know, going forward, how are you guys thinking about where this portfolio is versus where you'd wanted if you started with a clean sheet of paper?"", 'John Albright', ""Yes, I think it's a little bit of a barbell and we still have some really low cap rate property that we may decide to monetize and recycle into higher cap rates. And then o always continuing to upgrade the portfolio as a whole by selling off the bottom part of the portfolio like the Mountain Express. So we'll we'll work to basically continue to upgrade the portfolio even stronger. But so we have two levers there on the bottom and some of the super high quality."", 'Robert Stevenson', ""Okay. And then how are you guys thinking, you know, obviously grow given your size, adding even one new tenant or one new industry moves the needle for you guys still. But how are you guys thinking about tenant and industry concentrations going forward? And I'm, you know, is that I think a lot of people ask questions about Walgreens at 12% and dollar stores, which we just added a couple of them quarter at 14%. Do you keep acquiring Dollar Stores is that not, you know, can you would you take that up to 20% and Walgreens? Is that a disposition candidate at some point to lower that down below 12% exposure how are you guys thinking about? That's sort of constantly"", 'John Albright', ""So good question. So we're definitely going to look to lower the Walgreens exposure over time. We're not in a mad rush, but also hunting for more Walmart's low is that not at home, but the Home Depots and upgrading the portfolio there and getting those credits higher up on the list. But it's just like it's difficult to find the right ones, but we'll continue to pursue them and in upgrading the portfolio that way."", 'Robert Stevenson', ""And then what about dollar stores? What's your appetite to continue taking that up?"", 'John Albright', ""Yes, we're not going to I don't think you'll see us active on a dollar store acquisitions on Boca."", 'Robert Stevenson', 'And then just Doug, a couple of data ones. What were the two assets that you guys sold during the quarter?', 'Matthew Partridge', ""Yes, one was a convenience store branded as a BP and the other one was a two tenant property it was a bond guards which used to be as for our I'm sorry, is the bond ours, which is similar to a Tractor Supply. And then a I'm looking now at the BP. I'm drawing a blank on the other one are up, sorry, but it is de minimus piece of the of the overall puzzle."", 'Robert Stevenson', 'Okay. And then last one for me. Data-wise, it did the Board reauthorized a new share repurchase plan. And if so, what was the size?', 'John Albright', ""We would basically have that in our announcement if they had. So we'll monitor kind of what goes on there and the kind of reflect if things change."", 'Robert Stevenson', 'Okay. Thanks, guys. Appreciate the time. Have a good weekend.', 'Operator', 'Thanks, Robbie, to you in one moment, as we move on to our question.Next question is going to come from the line of Westleigh Golladay with Baird, your line of.', 'Wesley Golladay', 'Yes, hey, good morning, guys. Just a question on the investment guidance, does that include the buybacks and at $15 a share? Would buybacks be the top priority for use capital?', 'Matthew Partridge', ""So good question West morning. It does not include any buyback activity that would be in addition to the investment guidance. And I mean at $15 a share, we're obviously well over 8%, 8% implied cap rate.So I think that's certainly something that we'll have a discussion with the Board about in terms of potential new program beginning"", 'Wesley Golladay', 'and then know that you talked about no signing some leases and just kind of curious, would you have in guidance for assume rent from the leasing of the property?', 'Matthew Partridge', ""We have the two that we've signed so far and that's it."", 'Wesley Golladay', ""Okay. I guess we'll get kind of for to build the model and to build dispositions at our model. I guess what are the total upside in rent? Obviously you're going to sell them, but we need to put it, get it in the model and then exit the monetizing assets. So how much, I guess from the current run rate, how much upside do you have into rent from releasing the asset?"", 'Matthew Partridge', ""Yes. So the current run rate includes the two wheeler side, I would say for now assume nothing. And then obviously, as this does come to fruition. We'll report them right where we're call it two months away from from doing this again. And so we'll provide another update and update the numbers then."", 'Wesley Golladay', 'Okay. And then last one for me. What do you have for assume leverage throughout the year? And how does that impact your borrowing base based looking at the spreads?', 'Matthew Partridge', ""Yes. So we're assuming there's some slight delevering. We'll based on sort of the forecast and guidance, we should end the year closer to 7 times net debt to EBITDA, which should benefit the interest rate spread going into 2025."", 'Wesley Golladay', 'Okay. Thanks.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. And one moment as we move on to our next. Yes. Our next question is going to come from the line of Matthew Gardener with Jones Trading. Your line is open. Please go.', 'Matthew Erdner', ""Hey, guys, good morning and thanks for taking the question. So the loans look like they provide some pretty solid risk-adjusted returns. Are you seeing these more than acquisitions, dispositions at the moment? And if so, is there a certain amount of capital that you guys would be comfortable allocating to the strategy and I know that that you don't want to do this kind of off the bat. But yes, I guess what would you be comfortable getting up to for this two year period."", 'John Albright', ""I mean, I think you're seeing us on the top level of kind of where we want to be on the loans. So you what you'll see is really loans either paying down or selling off pieces of loan too, to do new loans. So I don't think you're going to see the portfolio of loans get any larger."", 'Matthew Erdner', 'Got you. Thank you. And then in terms of the transaction market, what do you think you need to see for it to kind of really get going again? Is that, you know, Fed rate cuts are kind of money coming off of the sidelines. You note, what are you guys thinking there?', 'John Albright', ""So I think you're starting to see are we're starting to see a little bit more activity now, I think people have been hanging on for a rate cut and the higher interest costs as debt rolling over is starting to bite a little bit more and so people are just kind of making harder decisions now about selling assets that there don't really want to sell, but it makes a lot of sense given given the high debt costs and so forth. So I'm pretty much a feel of the optimistic camp that as rates seem to and the further out as far as rate cuts, you're seeing more activity on that transaction market."", 'Matthew Erdner', 'Awesome. Thanks for taking the questions. Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. And one moment as we move on to our next question. Our next question is going to come from the line of R.J. Milligan with Raymond James. Your line is open. Please go ahead.', 'RJ Milligan', ""Good morning, guys. Most of my questions have been asked and answered. I'm just curious on John, on Walgreens, I think it's a split rated in terms of credit rating. Just can you talk about how you feel about that specific credit and maybe exposure to pharmacies in general, given what we've been seeing the industry."", 'John Albright', ""Yes. I mean, look, clearly, either their company and the headlines of the properties we have are very good locations. And obviously with new management at Walgreens and pay the dividend and selling off in some divisions, you know, they're going to become a healthier credit, obviously. And so the good news is our locations even if you found another tenant, there's a lot of tenant demand out there for locations. I was with the developer two days ago, who is a prolific developer of all kinds of various retailers and you can't build a box for less than $300, $30 these days. So so you're going to see tenants being very active in taking over other tenant spaces. So I think the backdrop is that, yes, there's a lot of tenant demand out there if you had some issues with particular boxes. So it's all about basis. And I think, you know, with our basis trading at $127 a square foot along the the whole portfolio, we got a lot of room there. So we're not we're not kind of having sleepless nights or Walgreens, but we will be, you know, pruning the exposure for sure."", 'RJ Milligan', ""Great. Thanks. That's it for me."", 'John Albright', 'Great. Thanks, RJ.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. And one moment as we move on to our next question.Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Howe with Truist Securities. Your line is open. Please go.', 'Anthony Hau', 'Good morning, guys. And thanks for your question. So in 2023, you guys are doing all the right things, right, completing numerous initiatives to close the valuation gap for the market. Now rewarding for those actions like So what other levers can you pull to close that gap this year while reducing leverage? And how do you balance between leverage buying back stock and growing that equity float?', 'John Albright', ""Yes. I mean, look, if the stock continues to trade at these massive discount to NAV and high implied cap rates and high dividend yield, clearly, we'll look to buy more stock because we're going to be accreting NAV and really giving shareholders a strong total return of basically a synopsis. And so if you look at kind of where we're trading versus the comps, which you know it better than we do. You know what we're trying to kind of give a value proposition to shareholder to say why would you take a higher basis risk and lower implied cap rate when you could have the same exposure to IG at much higher cap rate, lower valuation, higher dividend yield. So the value proposition is there. We'll be trying our best to communicate it, but the market has not taken it and then we'll look to buy back more shares and sell down assets to keep the leverage neutral. So it's pretty easy. It's not are not rocket science. We've been through this many times, and I feel like we have good opportunities out there. And so on so we'll DiskOnKey and working through."", 'Anthony Hau', ""It sounds like that's like attached to it, right? Because I think one of the main reasons why investors are not wanting those actions because the liquidity of the stock is free is pretty limited, right, compared to your other triple net. So how do you balance between like buying back stock and like keeping that liquidity for investors?"", 'John Albright', ""Yes. I mean, we can't we can't really, you know, we can't basically give investors everything. I mean, investors obviously want everything. But look, we're able to buy what almost 1 million shares with our buyback. And as you know, the buyback programs are very problematic. And then we have we can't we can't basically buy back at certain times of days. We can't buy back with certain percentage of volume in the shares are trading and we certainly are price sensitive. So even with all those parameters, we're able to buy a million shares relatively easy. So investors can buy the share. They just basically just they would probably have a hard fast rule that, hey, if we are trading below a certain amount of shares per day. We can't touch you kind of thing. So but you can buy the shares. And I think we've demonstrated that. So it for more of the value investors seem to seem to kind of latch on which show you a more long term holding sort of investors seem to understand the value proposition."", 'RJ Milligan', 'Thank you.', 'John Albright', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. And one moment as we move on to our next Quest.And our next question comes from the line of John Massocca, B. Riley. Your line is open, please.', 'Craig Kucera', 'Good morning. Morning, Dan. So quick question on the disposition guidance. I mean, should we assume that some repayment of some of these mortgage investments is in that guidance today? And maybe just kind of roughly what are you kind of expecting to get repaid from this year?', 'Matthew Partridge', ""Yes, good question, John morning. There's a limited amount of repayment related to the $24 million loan that we originated in the fourth quarter, starting really in the third quarter, but we're talking call it 10% over the balance of the back half of 2024. So not a meaningful amount. We think that will probably ramp up when we get into 2025 and hopefully into a different interest-rate environment in a more efficient transaction environment."", 'Craig Kucera', ""That's and I can tell you what are some of the variables out in the external world that could change that and the view or can cause that to be different than guidance? I mean, essentially as we think about kind of an uncertain rate world, does that impact that or is it all just based on execution in terms of selling down the assets in that collateral pool?"", 'Matthew Partridge', ""Yes, I think it's both. I mean for that specific collateral pool, I think it's a more active transaction environment with pricing that the borrower deems to be appropriate. But then on the other two loans. Those are the reserve development loans where once the tenant gets open and operating, I think it's either a refinancing opportunity from the borrower. So obviously, the interest rate environment would have an influence on that, or it's again, a more efficient transaction market where they feel like they can sell it at the appropriate price."", 'Craig Kucera', 'And then maybe bigger picture on on kind of guidance that the investments and dispositions at the midpoint, obviously kind of balance each other out. Is there any expectation in your mind of the difference in timing between deploying capital and kind of your capital recycling over the course of the year?', 'Matthew Partridge', ""I mean, certainly there will be we're assuming that all sort of balances itself out over the years. Sometimes we sell ahead of buying and sometimes we buy ahead of selling. But guidance assumes it's a relatively balanced approach."", 'Craig Kucera', ""Again, the balance sheet, no debt and the revolvers a little bit over the amount you have swapped, but it kind of seems like it matches the the amount and the loan pool, or is it kind of fair to assume that's free floating at least over the intermediate term?"", 'Matthew Partridge', ""Yes, I think you're going to assume that that's going to flow and that as these loans get repaid will allow, we'll evaluate what the redeployment options are in the market and that evaluation will include potentially paying down that floating rate guess."", 'Craig Kucera', ""That's it for me. Thank you very much, Sasha."", 'Operator', ""Thank you.This concludes today's question and answer session. This also concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

Motley Fool Money starts now. Welcome to Motley Fool money. I'm Deidre Woollard here with Motley analyst, Jason Moser. Jason, how's your Monday going so far?"", ""Jason Moser: Hey, so far so good it's nice weather out there. How about you, Deidre?"", ""Deidre Woollard: I'm loving our weather, but I'm thinking about our people in California who are having a bit of a tough weather time."", ""Jason Moser: Yeah. Cancel the final round of the Pebble Beach prom out there in California on Monterey. When the weather's that bad, you need to take note."", ""Deidre Woollard: Yeah, absolutely. Well, let's get into what's happening with the markets. Last week, big week, we had Meadow, we had Amazon, we had Apple, and mostly a pretty great week. This week we've got probably more earnings, but a wide variety of large company and maybe not your ones that are at the top of market moving, but really important to cover, one of them, McDonald's, you got to talk about McDonald's."", 'Jason Moser: Absolutely.', ""Deidre Woollard: Of course. I would say looking at the headlines versus look at the actual earnings sales, if you look at the headlines, it's going to be companies missing revenue targets. But I look at it., companies still able to deliver comparable sales, that increase every quarter at about a little over 4% in sales growth in the US in this quarter. Don't you think that sometimes McDonald's deserves a little more respect than it sometimes gets?"", ""Jason Moser: I absolutely do. One of the reasons why I feel that way Deidre is because in my early days here, when I first got here at the Fool, McDonald's was the company I looked at and didn't give it that credit that it deserved. I thought, you what? That's yesterday's news, and people don't want McDonald's, now they're going to Starbucks and they're going to Chipotle or whoever. No, McDonald's absolutely deserves a ton of credit."", ""I'm not a big McDonald's guy myself these days but it's impossible to ignore the success that this company has had over the course of its existence. It's easy I think to view it as perhaps an older or more challenged brand here domestically particularly, but I think when you look at the numbers, they say otherwise and this is a company that still has a ton of brand equity globally. Just having had the experience of traveling and living overseas for several years, I definitely, saw that, I've seen that. You brought up the comps numbers, I think it's absolutely worth mentioning, US comps this quarter were up 4.3%, international operated markets up 4.4%. Their developmental markets they saw under performance there. A lot of that, they said, reflected the impact of the war going on in the Middle East right now and that's very understandable and there's some second order impacts that come from that as well. You got to give them a little bit of a pass on that, that's just something that's completely out of their control, like the weather so to speak. But when you look at shareholders who've held onto these shares over the last decade, this stock has returned 300%. Well ahead of the markets performance there. You attribute it to that brand equity I think but also it's a franchise model that's tremendous. They've got 40,000 plus restaurants, 95% of those are franchised. That doesn't gin up a ton on the top line compared to something a company owned operation like Chipotle for example. But what it enables them to do is really bring some impressive profitability down to the bottom line. You put that all together and just it's not a surprise to me to see McDonald's perform so well, but, it's one of those companies I think that a lot of people just, they'll look at it and just just keep on walking."", ""Deidre Woollard: I think it's true and you mentioned the franchises. I love to mention that it's always that it's a stealth real estate company. They own all of that land and that's very valuable and a good part of the company. But I wanted to talk a little bit about what you said there about the US. I feel there is that perception that people don't go to McDonald's, but then you look at their loyalty program. You've got 150 million members that have been active in the last 90 days, so that's huge. Twenty billion in sales in 2023 and I the way that they're pivoting things, they're constantly tweaking things. We think of them as burgers, the Big Mac they're making, the double Big Mac now. But chicken is as big as a sales driver for them and they're seeing that globally and they're trying to figure out, more of the world is interested in eating a chicken sandwich versus a burger, so how do we make a better chicken sandwich?. Now they're taking on coffee. It started with, it's just a cheaper way to get coffee in the morning, you get it, with your breakfast, that's great. But they're tweaking this too in interesting ways. I don't know, I the way they use data a lot."", ""Jason Moser: I do too. In this age of AI, we talk a lot about AI and all of the potential that it offers. Really the lifeblood of AI ultimately it's data, and we've seen these companies from Chipotle to Starbucks and everywhere in between utilizing these loyalty programs to really take advantage of getting as much customer data as they possibly can. What that ultimately does, it enables these companies to keep their customers within that universe and then cater offering specifically to those individual customers. I think we've seen the investments in technology really pay off as well. It makes me think of companies like Domino's and Papa John's. No, maybe those are the pizza concepts that many might have at the top of their list, given some of the local choices that exist where they may live, but the bottom line is they're very convenient, they're wonderful options and I have to tell you the investments in technology, they make it so easy to order. They have loyalty programs that keep you coming back for more and McDonald's absolutely taking advantage of that same dynamic. To your point on the chicken, I think that's important. In this age, we've really seen Chick-Fill-A take off and I think a lot of companies are trying to figure out ways to compete with a Chick-Fill-A chicken. Absolutely, a ton of growth there and I was reading through the call and the investments in the time McDonald's was put into this McCrispy chicken sandwich, it's really resulted in some serious drives to the business. They're talking about this is scaled to a one billion dollar brands across 30 markets worldwide. But now they also mentioned that chicken category represents $25 billion in annual system wide sales, which essentially puts it on par with beef, their beef offerings and they're sitting there also making these investments in making their burgers better as well at the same time. It does feel like while there's a ton of brand equity and a lot that they could probably just hit cruise control and just keep on moving forward, they don't seem to want to rest on their laurels. It's refreshing, I think, to see a concept like McDonald's really trying to up its game and compete with a lot of these fast-casual competitors out there today."", ""Deidre Woollard: Well, and they've had some swings that have missed in the past. We talked a little bit about Starbucks. McDonald's has this new concept, the cosmic, it's this cold coffee drinks and they've just tested it out, I think in about ten locations. Traffic's been pretty strong so far. Then I was listening to the Starbucks call last week and they were talking about the need to try to get people there in the afternoons. It seems like this afternoon thing is interesting, but I'm wondering. McDonald's has the room to play with things like this, but what do you think about that concept? Would you be driving through the Cosmics to get yourself an afternoon drink?"", ""Jason Moser: If I was going by one, probably, I don't know that I'd go out of my way. But it also could be if I was going by one and I went by there once, maybe I would find it compelling and want to go out of my way for future trips. But I think it's important to note this Cosmic's offering. They identified. This $100 billion category. They quote across their top six markets that really focus on these beverages. It's not just beverages. If you look at the Cosmic menu, it is more than just beverages. Honestly, hey, listen, I could see those McPops doing pretty well. I don't know if you haven't seen them check that menu. The McPops look pretty good. But I absolutely love that they're trying this because again, I think in many cases, it's a matter of convenience. If they present a good offering and it's convenient, then people are going to give it a shot. If we look back through the history of something like a Starbucks, for example, that's a company that has started to recognize the benefits of convenience and incorporating more things like drive-throughs into their restaurants. McDonald's, I think has always been really known for, low prices convenience. This is something where they really specialize, and now they're starting to make that progress or that leap up into bringing a little bit more quality they're offering. Again, I think that menu with Cosmics, it's compelling, it's different, it's not just McDonald's. I think that will lead a lot of people to give it a shot. Then it's a matter of whether they find it compelling enough to keep going back."", ""Deidre Woollard: Well, and I think there's a whole new category emerging like Starbucks is trying to get people there for the drink and the snack. Other companies are starting to make these like later offerings that you come in for the drink in the snack option, especially in the afternoons. It reminds me a little bit of when they were trying to make, I think it was Taco Bell. They tried to make like a fourth meal. [LAUGHTER] I feel like they're trying to make another meal in here."", ""Jason Moser: It's the fourth or fifth meal, but it's at a different time of day. I think this is probably the time of day that more people can relate to. Because I think the fourth meal was probably geared toward people who have been out really late at night and have the munchies maybe on the way home. This seems like it's geared toward a little bit of a different audience and probably a bigger audience for that matter."", ""Deidre Woollard: Yeah, so thinking about Starbucks and McDonald's, the role of China is huge. Both of them are thinking about China. Late last year, McDonald's, they increased their minority stake in China to 48%. They opened 1,000 new restaurants, or actually a little over that last year in China all-time high. It's a pretty small percent of the business. But how are you thinking about companies that have this large consumer exposure in China right now? Because we've got geopolitical concerns there as well as some consumer weakness."", ""Jason Moser: Yeah, I think of the grand scheme of things, I view it ultimately as a positive, and I've said it before. When it comes to investing in China, I know what I don't know, investing in pure-play China just doesn't work for me. I've watched a play out over the last 15 years in how so much of this hype ends up sputtering out. With exceptions of course, but for the most part, it's just been a very difficult market to fully understand and I think really, honestly have faith in. But I think I view these multinationals, Starbucks, McDonald's, Apple, Coca-Cola, you name it. These are great ways to get satisfactory exposure to China without actually having to worry so much about the minutia. Not having to worry so much about what's going on over there. When you look at the state of the Chinese consumer today, I know things aren't all that great right now. I think there's reason to be hopeful though that the Chinese consumer will start seeing better days sooner rather than later. There's a lot of pessimism out there. Challenges from the COVID policies, and ongoing property crisis, that was a real 12 punch. High rates of youth unemployment, poor economic forecasts, you get the collapse of Evergreen. All of these things put together is there's just a ton of pessimism out there in regard to the Chinese consumer today. I think that's precisely when investors need to start looking because we know that things eventually will improve. Perhaps we're getting a little bit closer. For me, the ideal way to participate in an economy like that is going to be through the multinationals like your McDonald's and Starbucks of the world."", ""Deidre Woollard: Yeah. With McDonald's, you get a nice little dividend along the way."", ""Jason Moser: That's a very good point."", 'Deidre Woollard: Well, I want to pivot and talk about something else that is on my mind this morning. Did you watch the Grammys?', 'Jason Moser: I must admit I did not.', ""Deidre Woollard: Well, there was this commercial that caught my attention outside of the other controversies that may have caught my attention. It was this Snap commercial taking aim at TikTok and Instagram reels and basically saying social media is bad. Snapchat is good. It's this fun, happy place. We've got these like, oh look, I'm a broccoli face. It's interesting they had this big ads bend last night. They've got this new campaign. Then this morning they cut about 10% of their global workforce. They're reporting tomorrow. But I'm thinking about where they're taking their strategy. There was this leaked email last year that said that Evans Bagel sent out the CEO. Social media is dead, long live Snapchat. You talked about Meta on Friday on the show. Certainly, that is going nowhere from what I can see and from the earnings last week. But is there a case for the idea that social isn't quite as social anymore?"", ""Jason Moser: I think there is to an extent. I think social is going to be with us in one form or another going forward. At least I'm going to have to imagine for the rest of my life. I think it's ultimately just a matter of what people are looking to get out of it. I do understand if folks are pulling back on the rains a little bit and maybe not being quite as social or sharing quite as much, we've seen that that stuff can certainly be used against you. It is absolutely impossible for me to buy into the notion that Meta is on the win. The portfolio of that strategy for them has really paid off, and we just saw that in spades here in the most recent core. Snap I think is in a little bit of a bind because they still really are just Snapchat. Up and coming generation likely isn't looking at it with the same rose-colored glasses that the previous one did. When you look at the numbers, revenue growth has hit a wall. Again, like you said, Meta's report tells us there's still plenty of growth out there to be had. I was interested to look at Snap and compare it to Twitter at a certain point of time to get an idea of where these two businesses were. You look at Twitter, which was acquired in the back half of 2022. But if you look at Twitter's revenue in 2022, they generated a little bit better than $5 billion in revenue, and Snap still hasn't even gotten there, and that's Twitter. A company that I think many would argue myself included, left a ton of money on the table for just a number of various self-inflicted reasons. There are some lessons learned from Twitter to me, Snap rhymes. I think when you look at the overall opportunity out there, shoot, Amazon ad revenues up 27% of the quarter. That advertising revenue is definitely out there. It's companies like Snap I think are having a little bit of a more difficult time realizing it these days because social is such a difficult space when you're competing against Meta. But I think the question really for Snap investors at this point is, what are you ultimately expecting from this company? Do you think it's going to grow or is this something else? Do you feel like it's going to be acquired? Because I think the growth question is a very fair one, particularly given what we've just seen play out here in the early parts of emergencies."", 'Deidre Woollard: Well, thanks for breaking down with me today, Jason.', 'Jason Moser: Thank you.', ""Ricky Mulvey: Ricky Mulvey, co-host of Motley Fool Money Here.

But right now you want to focus on the footnotes. These are at the bottom of the page as we go through earning season, why are the footnotes even worth an investor's time to check out?"", ""Patrick Badolato: Sure, Ricky, I love that question and let me step back real quickly which is I'm going to refer to the footnotes as like all of the broad, qualitative, sometimes quantitative information that's in addition to the financial statements. Not what's on the financial statements, not the main core financial metrics, but I think they're massively informative because they give additional insight and flavor and sometimes really critical details about updates and changes that it's just we're going to be more informed walking into earning season or really any other assessment of a company if we've spent a little bit of time.

Most of it, so much of it is too much of it, if I can give my opinion is boilerplate where you're reading stuff and I'm not really changing anything. The challenge is though, the nuggets and the insights are there, they're just not easy to find and yes, I'm an accounting professor, I like reading these things and I'll put my time into reading the whole thing. But it's what I try to convey in a class and I want to use the Apple example is what I teach even at the Intro Financial Accounting level, is the footnotes are there and at times you want to grab them to think about it. The classic one I've done over time and this is not specifically recent news, but Apple's got a great footnote on its accounts receivable and that has nothing to do with what's reported on the balance sheet. It's just there's a footnote that talks about it. I think it's page 40 of their 2022,1K and they give a comment to the effect that what they're doing is they're requiring all smaller scale retailers to go out and get like third party insurance so that Apple will sell to them on account. But the reality is that the retailer has to go and get backing so that if the small retailer is not able to pay Apple, Apple is still going to collect effectively insurance proceeds so they're going to get their cash either way. The footnote shows us that, like Apple has virtually no risk of collection with its account receivable reported on the balance sheet, not on the balance sheet. There's nothing about that there. Read the footnote and you realize maybe that's something you would expect for a behemoth like Apple but really no risk of collection given the way they structure their deals with any smaller retailer."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Is that something that's rare among companies? I could imagine a lot of companies, they want to get the cash that they're entitled to on that account. But I don't know of any other companies that do that."", ""Patrick Badolato: Yes. Great question. I wish I had a better answer and I don't like how many use it, how many don't? I worry that the classic answer is just like, well Apple could do it at once because it's in such a position of strength. But I'll give you a personal finance example of this that I usually try to talk about in class which is, this is very similar to what we may face when we're getting a mortgage with PMI or private mortgage insurance. The bank's going to require us. We put less than 20% down to go pay for PMI insurance or private mortgage insurance. If that's so that the bank still collects its mortgage payments effectively, if we were to fall or miss a payment or something like that and it's crazy to think about it but it's similar, whether it's like you have one very powerful player, the bank giving us a mortgage and one far less powerful entity, us, the homeowner and the argument is you're going to basically make the smaller player pay the insurance to protect the larger player. That's what Apple's doing a version of that with its accounts receivable, ensuring it collects."", ""Ricky Mulvey: When you're one of the biggest companies on the planet, it's easy to know that other companies need you more than perhaps you need it. Uber is reporting tomorrow. This is a more recent example. Last year, the company changed how it treats discounts and promotions. We're talking about it. I think you said this was an important change, so what happened? What they do?"", ""Patrick Badolato: I think for this one, it's worth stepping back again and talking about the way they laid things out with their initial IPO filed in 2019 and there's a lot of layers and there was a lot of conversations but I want to just get to the point which is, they did not call. If you've taken Uber, you've got Uber eats delivered or you've taken a ride to go somewhere with Uber, I certainly have done that but we are not Uber's customer. In their IPO, we were not their customer. We were called riders or end users. Their customer, consistent with their IPO document was the driver, the driver driving the car providing transportation and that may seem weird, but that's the genesis of this whole idea. In their IPO, they had a bunch of promotions and discounts that were issued to the rider or the end user and they were actually booking that as both revenue and then offsetting it with sales and marketing expense. I think it was rounds to $3,000,000,000 in 2017 and 2018 combined in the two years preceding their IPO. But $3,000,000,000 and I'm not this is legal, there's a way that this works out it's because the riders were not their customers. But to simplify it, maybe over simplified. It's similar to saying that they were effectively buying their own services and that's what it works out to. If they gave a ride or $120 coupon, that $20 coupon was counting as revenue. It was removed via sales and marketing expense so no effect on like operating income but still an opportunity to increase revenue, to boost the revenue growth in the early stages of the company."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Now the revenue is not comparable and maybe you'll even see a slight revenue decline as they make this change. Why do you think Uber is making it?"", ""Patrick Badolato: Yes, and so let's just be specific about the change too but then I definitely want to offer some lens into what we can think about before the 2023 earnings come out. What they changed in the second quarter of 2023. I actually think based on the numbers, it was like toward the end of the second quarter, but I don't know the exact date. But they changed in the second quarter of 2023, is in many of their major markets, it looks like it's roughly two thirds using the third quarter numbers, but they now are classifying the rider effectively as a customer. As they're classifying the writer as a customer now, that actually means that if they give promotions and discounts, which they're continuing to do, it's not a removal of promotions and discounts, but now they're not counting the promotions and discounts as revenue and they're also not offsetting it as a marketing sales and marketing expense. Ricky you already alluded to this, and I just want to flesh it out a bit more. The challenge here is this change occurred mid year, roughly. It's going to be hard to compare anything coming out tomorrow with 2023's numbers, with anything that happened in 2022 or any prior years. Even within 2023 because the change didn't happen at the beginning, it might be hard to think about quarter to quarter comparisons or year over year comparisons. In this case to reiterate your point, revenue will actually be smaller because they're not including, and I think in quarter three it was $521 million. That just one quarter $521 million that would have been in revenue is not there and also is going to be removed from sales and marketing expense. The year over year revenue growth, all else held equal is going to be lower. It's just going to be harder to achieve any growth because stuff that was classified in revenue is no longer classified that way."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Maybe there's a tide to the story where Kashrashahi he comes in as the CEO of Uber, wanting a leaner, more focused company and maybe take away some of that noise in the S1. I know we've made fun of it on the show in the years past. The total addressable market was four billion people, or basically everybody in the 63 countries that it operated in at the time. Do you think that with this move in the footnotes, the way that Uber is changing the way it counts revenue, is that part of the story here with the company as it is today?"", ""Patrick Badolato: I love that question and I want to elaborate on it. But I think there's one more level and I hate to be nip picky about this too."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Go for it. You're the professor."", ""Patrick Badolato: That sales and marketing expense is also going to go down. I just caution, it's not a criticism of Uber in any way, but just preparing us for what we're going to see is that year over year sales and marketing expense should also decrease using the third quarter number alone by that 521 million. It'll be more than that because we don't have the fourth quarter information yet. But the sales and marketing expense will decrease as a dollar amount and also will decrease as a percent of revenue. I mentioned that we're going to see like margin improvement, where one expense decreases as a percent of revenue. It's not good nor bad. It's just a result of this reporting change. Worth being informed when we walk in there because we don't want to be saying is, wow, look at this great efficiency improvement with sales and marketing. They must be getting better at promotions and discounts or marketing. I'm not in any way saying they're getting worse. But no, the data just mathematically will lead to sales and marketing expense decreasing as a percent of revenue. That's like efficiency. That's worth understanding the reporting behind. But Ricky, I love your other question. I want to flush it out a bit more as well. I was pretty critical, looking at Uber in the pre IPO stage and we've done a bunch of classes and offering that there's a lot of questions and confusion and seem like distractions. Then COVID hits and just up ends everything. Which, you know, is tough for so many different companies."", ""But I think the Uber that emerge, it's really fascinating business model and I think they've figured out what they are, the phrase I use and I talk about them in classes, this is not a replacement for individual car ownership. This is not a target market of four billion people, but what they are is a platform of convenience. A company that can offer us rides when we need rides, can offer us goods. I applaud the fact that Uber eats has become so inclusive of not just fast food, restaurant meals, but you can get delivered groceries and florists and all these other things, which I think makes it more convenient for the customer. But also a better, driving opportunity, better utilization for the driver. I think that focus on the core and getting away from the autonomous and the replacement for individual car ownership is a massive step in the direction. Still questions, still stuff to figure out. But that core competency, the platform of convenience, we like convenience, we like stuff, we like getting places and getting things delivered to us. That may be a successful move in many ways for them. It seems like it is."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Maybe you're checking out the footnotes in a report. I think one piece of research you shared with me that is worth investors attention though, that they can track for the companies that they own and follow is the risk factors and an annual report. There are some researchers that found that how companies management changes the risk factors and changing their wording can often predict maybe future trouble for the company. And that section is worth a little bit more attention."", ""Patrick Badolato: I agree. I say that my thoughts on reading the literature and everything, it seems like reading the footnotes is still not that commonplace, full of information. But I love teaching it because, hey, that's your possible chance for differentiation. The change in the language, what's there. I agree, sometimes the risk can be informative. I love the way they were looking at it in that study, but I'll offer a few other areas I think are worth checking out. We gave the specific discounts and promotions and sales and marketing with Uber. But some other ones I strongly recommend is first and foremost actually owner rank this, the segments. Look at the segments of the business. Segments move in different directions. This is true for Uber. Their freight segment during 2023 has been going down year over year decline in revenue growth. Where deliveries and mobility, those are growing at different rates. Companies have segments that don't just do one thing, read as much as you can off the income statement or the financial statements to find out about segments. Another one, is MDNA management discussion and analysis. They don't always give you everything you need, but often there's that movement, Hey, here's factors that contributed to a trend. Factors that offset. Granular data that gives us a little bit more about like, let me know a bit about the story behind it. Revenue recognition, which I would argue is massively important for Uber and it's S1 are realizing wait, who's their customer? How do you do this? Then if you have companies with revenue recognized over time or have some discretion on are they the agent in the transaction or are they the main provider? There's more there as well. Risks looking at debt footnotes can be certainly informative in cases like Silicon Valley Bank and others. Taxes in certain cases. Really try to figure out what's valuable for the company and then use the footnotes is like, hopefully, you're thirsty for. I want to get more information. I want to get granular data on what's there."", 'Ricky Mulvey: Patrick Badolato is a Professor of accounting and finance at the McCombs School of Business at the University of Texas.

Following the approval, Bitcoin prices soared further, rallying past $47,000. However, Bitcoin, the world’s most popular cryptocurrency, has been on the decline since then.', 'By the end of January, Bitcoin price had fallen sharply and was hovering around $39,000. However, some of the loss has been pared, and Bitcoin traded just above $43,000 on Feb 7.', 'Nevertheless, Bitcoin still holds a lot of potential and the Federal Reserve’s upcoming rate cuts are likely to boost the cryptocurrency market. The Federal Reserve said that a rate cut in March is unlikely, but multiple rate cuts are happening this year for sure.

The dividend yield will be 7.5% based on this payment which is still above the industry average.', ' View our latest analysis for Western Union ', ""We like to see robust dividend yields, but that doesn't matter if the payment isn't sustainable. Based on the last payment, Western Union was quite comfortably earning enough to cover the dividend. This means that a large portion of its earnings are being retained to grow the business."", 'Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 11.0%. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 51%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.', 'The company has an extended history of paying stable dividends. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $0.50 in 2014, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $0.94. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 6.5% per annum over that time. The dividend has been growing very nicely for a number of years, and has given its shareholders some nice income in their portfolios.', ""Some investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. However, things aren't all that rosy. However, Western Union's EPS was effectively flat over the past five years, which could stop the company from paying more every year."", ""Overall, a consistent dividend is a good thing, and we think that Western Union has the ability to continue this into the future. While the payments look sustainable for now, earnings have been shrinking so the dividend could come under pressure in the future. The payment isn't stellar, but it could make a decent addition to a dividend portfolio."", 'Investors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one.

GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Sign with DOV.', ""On February 8, 2024, TransDigm Group Inc (NYSE:TDG), a leading manufacturer and servicer of aerospace components, released its 10-Q filing, revealing a comprehensive financial performance and strategic positioning. The company, known for its acquisitive growth strategy and focus on proprietary products with substantial aftermarket demand, reported a significant increase in net sales from $1,397 million in the previous year to $1,789 million. Net income also saw a substantial rise, from $229 million to $382 million, indicating a robust financial health. The earnings per share (EPS) improved from $3.33 to $4.87, reflecting the company's ability to generate shareholder value. With a strong balance sheet and strategic market focus, TransDigm is poised to leverage its strengths and navigate its weaknesses and threats while capitalizing on market opportunities."", ""Financial Performance and Market Positioning: TransDigm's financial results demonstrate a solid market positioning and an ability to generate revenue growth. The company's net sales increased by approximately 28% year-over-year, and net income saw a significant jump of 67%. This financial strength is a testament to TransDigm's successful strategy of focusing on proprietary aerospace components that have a high aftermarket demand, ensuring a steady stream of revenue post initial sale. The increase in EPS from $3.33 to $4.87 also indicates a strong return on equity for shareholders, which is a key strength in attracting and retaining investors."", ""Acquisitive Growth Strategy: TransDigm's growth has been partly fueled by its strategic acquisitions, such as the recent purchase of Calspan and Extant Aerospace product lines. These acquisitions not only expand the company's product offerings but also strengthen its foothold in niche markets. The expected tax-deductible goodwill and intangible assets from these acquisitions, amounting to millions, will provide financial benefits over the coming years. Furthermore, the company's ability to integrate these acquisitions effectively into its operations showcases its strong management capabilities."", ""High Leverage: Despite its strong earnings, TransDigm's aggressive use of financial leverage to amplify operating results is a potential weakness. The company's interest expense of $300 million, up from $286 million the previous year, reflects the high cost of servicing its debt. This high level of indebtedness could limit the company's financial flexibility and increase vulnerability to economic downturns or interest rate hikes. It is crucial for TransDigm to manage its debt levels carefully to maintain financial stability."", ""Dependence on Aerospace and Defense Industry: TransDigm's focus on the aerospace and defense industry, while a strength in terms of specialization, also poses a weakness due to the potential for market volatility. The industry is subject to cyclical demand, regulatory changes, and geopolitical risks that could impact the company's performance. Diversification into other sectors could mitigate this risk, but currently, TransDigm's heavy reliance on this single industry could be a potential weakness in times of industry downturn."", ""Market Recovery and Demand Increase: The ongoing recovery of the commercial aerospace market, particularly in domestic air travel, presents a significant opportunity for TransDigm. As air traffic approaches pre-pandemic levels, demand for aerospace components and aftermarket services is likely to increase. TransDigm's strong portfolio of proprietary products positions it well to capitalize on this market rebound and drive further revenue growth."", ""Expansion into New Markets: TransDigm's expertise in highly engineered aerospace components can be leveraged to expand into new markets and product lines. The company's recent acquisitions provide a platform for growth in both domestic and international markets. Additionally, the increasing focus on space exploration and satellite technology presents an opportunity for TransDigm to apply its engineering capabilities to new applications, potentially opening up additional revenue streams."", ""Regulatory Challenges: TransDigm operates in a highly regulated industry, and changes in government policies or defense spending could pose a threat to its business. The Department of Defense's scrutiny of pricing practices, as seen in the DOD OIG Audit, could lead to regulatory challenges and impact profitability. It is essential for TransDigm to maintain compliance and adapt to regulatory changes to mitigate this threat."", ""Economic Headwinds and Competition: Economic uncertainties, including inflation and potential recessions, could lead to reduced spending in the aerospace and defense sectors. Additionally, intense competition from other industry players could threaten TransDigm's market share. The company must continue to innovate and differentiate its product offerings to stay ahead of competitors and navigate economic challenges."", ""In conclusion, TransDigm Group Inc (NYSE:TDG) exhibits a strong financial performance and strategic positioning, with robust revenue growth and a solid market presence. The company's acquisitive growth strategy and focus on proprietary products with aftermarket demand are key strengths that drive its success. However, high levels of debt and dependence on the aerospace and defense industry are weaknesses that require careful management. Opportunities for growth are abundant, particularly with the market recovery and potential expansion into new markets. Nevertheless, regulatory challenges and economic headwinds pose threats that must be navigated strategically. Overall, TransDigm's strategic approach and financial acumen position it well for continued success in the competitive aerospace industry."", 'This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

Please see the tables and related footnotes in the earnings release for a presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP measures and applicable reconciliations. I will now turn the call over to Kevin.', ""Kevin Stein: Good morning. Thanks for joining us on the call today. First, I'll start off with the usual quick overview of our strategy, a few comments about the quarter, and discuss our fiscal 2024 outlook. Then Joel and Sarah will give additional color on the quarter. To reiterate, we believe we are unique in the industry in both the consistency of our strategy in good times and bad, as well as our steady focus on intrinsic shareholder value creation through all phases of the aerospace cycle. To summarize, here are some of the reasons why we believe this. About 90% of our net sales are generated by unique proprietary products. Most of our EBITDA comes from aftermarket revenues, which generally have significantly higher margins, and over any extended period, have typically provided relative stability in the downturns."", 'We follow a consistent long-term strategy, specifically; first, we own and operate proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content. Second, we utilize a simple, well-proven, value-based operating methodology. Third, we have a decentralized organizational structure and unique compensation system closely aligned with our shareholders. Fourth, we acquire businesses that fit this strategy and where we see a clear path to PE-like returns. And lastly, our capital structure and allocation are a key part of our value creation methodology. Our long-standing goal is to give our shareholders private equity-like returns with the liquidity of a public market. To do this, we stay focused on both the details of value creation as well as careful allocation of our capital.', 'As you saw from our earnings release, we had a strong quarter. Our Q1 results ran ahead of our expectations. And we have raised our sales and EBITDA as defined guidance for the year. Commercial aerospace market trends remain favorable as the industry continues to recover and progress towards normalization. Global air traffic is closing in on pre-pandemic levels and demand for travel remains high. Airline demand for new aircraft also remains high and the OEMs are working to increase aircraft production. However, total air travel demand remains slightly below pre-COVID levels and OEM aircraft production rates remain well below pre-pandemic levels. There is still progress to be made for the industry and our results continue to be adversely affected in comparison to pre-pandemic levels.', 'In our business, during the quarter, we saw a healthy growth in our revenues and bookings for all three of our major market channels; commercial OEM, commercial aftermarket, and defense. Our EBITDA as defined margin was 51% in the quarter, contributing to the strong Q1 margin and the continued recovery in our commercial aftermarket revenues, along with diligent focus on our operating strategy. Additionally, we had strong operating cash flow generation in Q1 of over $630 million and ended the quarter with over $4.1 billion of cash. We expect to steadily generate significant additional cash throughout the remainder of 2024. Next, an update on our capital allocation activities and priorities. As we discussed on our last earnings call, we agreed on November 9th to acquire the Electron Device Business of Communications & Power Industries, also known as CPI, for approximately $1.385 billion in cash.', ""CPI's Electron Device Business is a leading global manufacturer of electronic components and subsystems, primarily serving the aerospace and defense market. The products manufactured by this business are highly engineered proprietary components with significant aftermarket content and a strong presence across major aerospace and defense platforms. Our team is working diligently through the approval process in the US and UK, and the acquisition is expected to close this fiscal year. We remain very excited about adding this proprietary business as one of our TransDigm operating units. Regarding the current M&A pipeline, we continue to actively look for M&A opportunities that fit our model. As we look out over the next 12 months to 18 months, we continue to see a target-rich environment for our focused acquisition strategy."", 'As usual, the potential targets are mostly in the small and midsize range. I cannot predict or comment on possible closings, but we remain confident there is a long runway for acquisitions that fit our portfolio. The capital allocation priorities at TransDigm are unchanged. Our first priority is to reinvest in our business; second, do accretive disciplined M&A; and third, return capital to our shareholders via share buybacks or dividends. A fourth option paying down debt, seems unlikely at this time, though we do still take this into consideration. We are continually evaluating all of our capital allocation options, but both M&A and capital markets are difficult to predict. As always, we continue to closely monitor the capital markets and remain opportunistic.', 'As mentioned earlier, we ended the quarter with a sizable cash balance of over $4.1 billion, which includes the $2 billion of cash from the new debt issued during our first quarter. Sarah will comment on this in more detail later. We have significant liquidity and financial flexibility to meet any likely range of capital requirements or other opportunities in the readily foreseeable future. Moving to our outlook for fiscal 2024. As noted in our earnings release, we are increasing our full fiscal year 2024 sales and EBITDA as defined guidance to reflect our strong first quarter results and our current expectations for the remainder of the year. At the midpoint, sales guidance was raised $85 million and EBITDA as defined guidance was raised $45 million.', ""The guidance assumes no additional acquisitions or divestitures and is based on current expectations for a continued recovery in our primary commercial end markets throughout fiscal year 2024. Our current guidance for fiscal 2024 is as follows, and can also be found on slide 6 in the presentation. Note that, the pending acquisition of CPI's Electron Device Business is excluded from this guidance, until acquisition closed. The midpoint of our fiscal 2024 revenue guidance is now $7.665 billion, or up approximately 16%. In regards to the market channel growth rate assumptions that this revenue guidance is based on, for the defense market, we are updating the full year growth rate assumptions as a result of our strong first quarter results and current expectations for the remainder of the year."", 'For Defense, we now expect revenue growth in the high single-digit to low double-digit percentage range. This is an increase from our previous guidance of mid to high single-digit percentage range. We are not updating the full year market channel growth rate assumptions for commercial OEM and commercial aftermarket, as underlying market fundamentals have not meaningfully changed. Commercial OEM and commercial aftermarket revenue guidance is still based on our previously issued market channel growth rate assumptions. We expect commercial OEM revenue growth around 20% and commercial aftermarket revenue growth in the mid-teens percentage range. The midpoint of our EBITDA as defined guidance is now $3.985 billion, or up approximately 17% with an expected margin of around 52%.', ""This guidance includes about 100 basis points of margin dilution and from our recent Calspan acquisition. We anticipate EBITDA margins will move up throughout the remainder of the year. The midpoint of our adjusted EPS is decreasing versus our prior guide, primarily due to the higher interest expense associated with the incremental debt we took on to fund CPI. The midpoint of adjusted EPS is now expected to be $30.85 or up approximately 19% over prior year. Sarah will discuss in more detail shortly the factors impacting EPS, along with some other fiscal 2024 financial assumptions and updates. We believe we are well-positioned for the remainder of fiscal 2024. We'll likely continue to closely watch how the aerospace and capital markets continue to develop and react accordingly."", ""Let me conclude by stating that I am very pleased with the company's performance this quarter and throughout the recovery of the commercial aerospace industry. We remain focused on our value drivers, cost structure and operational excellence. Now, let me hand it over to Joel Reiss, our TransDigm, Group Co-COO, to review our recent performance and a few other items."", ""Joel Reiss: Good morning. I'll start with our typical review of results, by key market category. For the remainder of the call, I'll provide commentary on a pro forma basis compared to the prior year period in 2023 that is assuming we own the same mix of businesses in both periods. In the commercial market, which typically makes up close to 65% of our revenue, we will split our discussion into OEM and aftermarket. Our total commercial OEM revenue increased approximately 25% in Q1, compared with the prior year period. Bookings in the quarter were strong compared to the same prior year period. Our strong bookings continue to support the commercial OEM guidance of revenue growth around 20% for fiscal 2024. OEM supply chain and labor challenges persist, but appear to be progressing."", ""We continue to be encouraged by the steadily increasing commercial OEM production rates and strong airline demand for new aircraft. Supply chains remain the primary bottleneck in this OEM production ramp-up. The FAA's recently announced production rate freeze at 38 per month for the Boeing 737 MAX will likely slow the expected MAX ramp and time will tell how this plays out. The commercial OEM guidance given today takes into account an appropriate level of continued risk around Boeing's production build rate. While risks such as this and others remain towards achieving the ramp-up across the broader aerospace sector, we are optimistic that our operating units are well-positioned to support the higher production targets as they occur. Now moving on to our commercial aftermarket business discussion."", ""Total commercial aftermarket revenue increased by approximately 22% compared with the prior year period. Growth in commercial aftermarket revenue was primarily driven by the continued strength in our passenger submarket, which is by far our largest submarket. We also saw good growth in our interior submarket compared to prior year Q1 and biz jet was up slightly year-over-year as well. These increases were very minimally offset by a very slight decline in our freight submarket driven by the return of belly capacity and consistent with what we discussed on last quarter's earnings call. Commercial aftermarket bookings for this quarter were strong compared to the same prior year period. The strong booking levels in commercial aftermarket continue to support our commercial aftermarket guide for revenue growth in the mid-teens percent range for fiscal 2024."", 'As a reminder, when forecasting our commercial aftermarket, we always look at a rolling historical 12-month average booking trend, never just the most recent quarter, due to lumpiness that we often see in this end market. Turning to broader market dynamics and referencing the most recent IATA traffic data for December. Global revenue passenger miles still remain lower than pre-pandemic levels, but only slightly. December 2023 air traffic was about 2.5% below pre-pandemic and full 2023 traffic was about 6% below. Globally, a return to 2019 air traffic levels is expected in 2024 and IATA currently expects traffic to reach 104% of 2019 levels in 2024. Domestic travel continues to surpass pre-pandemic levels. In the most recently reported traffic data for December, global domestic air traffic was up 2% compared to pre-pandemic.', 'Domestic air travel in China also continues to improve and was up 8% in December compared to pre-pandemic levels. This is a significant improvement from China being down 55% a year ago in December 2022. Shifting over to the US, domestic air travel for December came in about flat with pre-pandemic traffic. International traffic has continued to make steady improvement over the past few months. A quarter ago, at the end of September, international travel globally was depressed about 7% compared to pre-pandemic levels, but in the most recently reported data for December, international travel was only down about 5%. This is a significant improvement over being down 25% a year ago in December 2022. In summary, for the commercial aftermarket, we continue to see strong growth in our passenger and interior submarkets, indicative of the continuing positive trends in the post-COVID passenger traffic recovery.', 'Our biz jet and freight submarkets are performing in line with their underlying markets and also in line with our expectations at this point in the year. Shifting to our defense market, which traditionally is at or below 35% of our total revenue. The defense market revenue, which includes both OEM and aftermarket revenues, grew by approximately 28% compared with the prior year period. Q1 defense revenue growth was well distributed across our businesses. However, bear in mind that the comparable prior year period was an easy comp. We would not expect to see defense revenue growth rates at this level continuing throughout the balance of the year. We expect some moderation here as you can tell from the guidance. Defense bookings are also up significantly this quarter compared to the same prior year period.', 'While the defense revenue growth this quarter was pretty broadly distributed across our customer base, we continue to see improvements in the US government defense spending outlays during Q1. We are hopeful we will continue to see steady improvement. But as we have said many times before, defense sales and bookings can be lumpy. We know the bookings and sales will come, but forecasting them with accuracy and precision is difficult. As Kevin mentioned earlier, we now expect our defense market revenue growth for this year to be in the high single-digit to low double-digit percentage range. This updated guidance for defense primarily reflects the stronger-than-expected Q1 defense sales as well as the good Q1 bookings. In closing, Q1 was a good start to the fiscal 2024 fiscal year and I was pleased with our operational performance.', 'We will remain focused on our consistent operating strategy and servicing the strong demand for our products as we continue throughout the balance of the year. With that, I would like to turn it over to our Chief Financial Officer, Sarah Wynne.', ""Sarah Wynne: Thanks, Joel, and good morning, everyone. I'll recap the financial highlights for the first quarter and then provide some more information on the guidance update. First, on organic growth and liquidity. In the first quarter, our organic growth rate was 23.5%, and all market channels contributed to this growth as Kevin and Joel have just discussed. On cash and liquidity, free cash flow, which we traditionally define as EBITDA less cash interest payments, CapEx and cash taxes, was roughly $660 million for the quarter. This is a higher than average free cash flow conversion for the quarter, primarily due to the timing of our interest and tax payments. Cash interest and tax payments will pick up again in the next quarter and for the full fiscal year, our free cash flow guidance is unchanged."", 'We expect to continue to generate free cash flow of close to $2 billion in fiscal 2024. Below that free cash flow line, net working capital consumed a smaller amount of cash than in prior years coming in close to flat. For the past few years, we saw a large influx of cash into our working capital as our primary commercial end markets experienced strong rebound post COVID. We were obviously very happy to support this increase. Going forward, we expect our annual dollars invested in net working capital to moderate from the elevated levels seen over the prior two years, but pinpointing the exact amount of investments for fiscal 2024 is difficult. As you know, the rebound of the OEM market channel does impact our accounts receivable as customers in that bucket typically have slightly longer payment terms.', ""We ended the quarter with approximately $4.1 billion of cash on the balance sheet, and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was five times, down from 5.4 at the end of last quarter when pro forma was $35 dividend. As a reminder, we are comfortable operating in the 5 to 7 net debt-EBITDA ratio range. And while we are currently sitting on the low end of this range, a go-forward strategy of capital deployment has not changed. Our EBITDA to interest expense coverage ratio ended the quarter at 3.3 times on a pro forma basis, which provides us with comfortable cushion versus our target range of two to three times. During the first quarter, we went to the market and proactively raised $2 billion of debt, the acquisition of CPI's Electron Device Business, which is still subject to regulatory approval with the rest going towards general corporate purposes."", ""As a result of the additional debt, our interest expense estimate for fiscal 2024 increased by $130 million, as you can see in today's updated interest expense guidance. Regarding our debt, we expect to continue both proactively and prudently managing our maturity deck stack, which for us means pushing out any near-term maturities well in advance of the final maturity date. Out near-term debt maturity is now 2026, and we remain appropriately 75% hedged on a total $22 billion gross debt balance through our fiscal 2026. This is achieved through a combination of fixed rate notes, interest rate caps, swaps and collars. This provides us adequate cushion against any rise in rates at least in the immediate term. With regard to guidance, as Kevin mentioned, we increased our midpoint sales and EBITDA by $85 million or $45 million, respectively, given the strong quarter and current expectations for the year."", ""Our EPS guidance is now $30.85 compared to prior guidance of $31.97. The reduction is due to additional interest expense. Without that, it would be $32.57. As we sit here today from an overall cash liquidity and balance sheet standpoint, we think we remain in good position with adequate flexibility to pursue M&A or return cash to our shareholders via dividends or share repurchases. With that, I'll turn it back to the operator to kick off the Q&A."", 'See also 15 States with the Cheapest Car Insurance In The US and 25 Best States for Job Seekers Right Now.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

The company on Wednesday reported $147 million in net income, a more than ninefold increase from $16 million the prior year, and operating income of $140 million, up 77% from $79 million a year ago.', 'The company’s full-year net sales of $5.4 billion were flat, with operating income at $561.7 million, down nearly 17%\xa0year over year. Net income for the year was $214 million, down nearly 46%, and included a non-cash charge of $161 million relating to tax asset-related changes.', 'Mattel is targeting $200 million in cost savings by 2026. Its board of directors also approved a multiyear $1 billion share repurchase program, after the company repurchased $203 million in shares in 2023.', 'Mattel CEO Ynon Kreiz described 2023 as “a milestone year” for the company, which is the home of dozens of iconic toy and game brands, including Barbie, Hot Wheels, Fisher-Price and Uno.', '“We extended our leadership in our key toy categories and gained significant share overall, achieved extraordinary success with the Barbie movie and further strengthened our financial position,” Kreiz said, according to an earnings call transcript from Seeking Alpha.', 'According to Kreiz, Barbie was the No. 1 doll property globally and the second-place toy property overall thanks to the “Barbie” movie, which was the highest-grossing movie at the box office in Warner Bros. history. Mattel continues to lean more into intellectual property partnerships. Mattel Films recently announced its first animated movie, “Bob the Builder.”', '“The breakout success of the award-winning Barbie movie was a showcase for our entertainment strategy and cultural relevance of our brands outside the toy aisle,” Kreiz said during the call. “Mattel is in the strongest financial position it has been in years, with significant free cash flow generation, an optimization program and a new share repurchase authorization.”', 'Two years ago, Kreiz said the company’s earlier multiyear turnaround efforts had succeeded. However, although the company ended 2023 “with the strongest balance sheet we have had in years,” Kreiz said Mattel remains focused on achieving cost savings. The company on Wednesday announced a new cost-savings initiative to drive efficiencies, cut costs in its global supply chain and improve profitability.', 'A new chief strategy officer will help identify profitability and growth opportunities.\xa0Mattel on Thursday announced that Christopher Farrell would take on that role, which also focuses on optimizing business performance.\xa0Farrell joins Mattel from Ahold Delhaize, where he was the global head of mergers and acquisitions. He also served as chief strategy officer at Authentic Brands Group.', 'Chief Financial Officer Anthony DiSilvestro said Mattel previously achieved total annualized savings of $343 million between 2021 and 2023. That exceeded its initial target of $250 million and a revised goal of $300 million.\xa0“We recognize the importance of managing our cost structure and continuing to expand margins as well as generating savings that can be reinvested in the business,” DiSilvestro said during the call.', ""This year is the Barbie brand’s 65th anniversary and Mattel plans product launches to celebrate that moment.\xa0Barbie saw 24% growth in Q4 across the brand, toys and movie-related benefits. The movie continues to play well and lifted the brand, said Kreiz, who added the brand’s strength extends beyond the movie.\xa0As a result of the “Barbie” movie’s success, Mattel will face tough performance-related comparisons this year, Bank of America Securities Research Analyst Jason Haas said in a Thursday note. However, “we believe in the company's ability to grow its IP-driven toy business and continue expanding its entertainment offering.”"", 'In contrast, segment rival Hasbro in December announced cuts of over 1,000 jobs\xa0in pursuit of $350 million to $400 million in cost savings by the end of 2025. That toy manufacturer’s brand portfolio includes GI Joe, Nerf, My Little Pony, and Transformers, which also had a related movie release last year.\xa0In Q3, Hasbro reported net revenue fell 10% to $1.5 billion, down from $1.7 billion year over year, and it posted a net loss of $171 million for the quarter.

First, I would like to recognize Susan McCoy on what will be her final earnings call. She's retired at the end of March after 38 years with the company, including 22 years in Investor Relations. Susan has made enormous contributions to Leggett, including developing an outstanding IR function that has benefited both Leggett and the investment community over the past two decades. Susan, thank you so much for your service and congratulations on your retirement. In what has been a long-planned succession, Cassie Branscum stepped into the lead role as Vice President of Investor Relations, effective the beginning of 2024. Cassie joined the IR team in 2018 after serving in various roles across the company since 2005."", 'She has tremendous financial skills and deep Leggett knowledge that will continue to serve us well as she leads the IR function going forward. 2023 was another challenging year, particularly within our residential end markets. Our employees, once again, persevered to accomplish some notable achievements, including preparing a restructuring plan for our Bedding Products and Furniture, Flooring & Textile Products segment. These efforts will drive improved operating efficiency and profitability while maintaining high quality products and services for our customers, driving strong cash flow with a continued focus on working capital management, and advancing our sustainability data collection efforts to establish baseline metrics and goals that we plan to share in our 2024 report.', ""Thank you for your continued dedication to each other in Leggett & Platt. We have made some difficult but necessary decisions to support the company's long-term success. I sincerely appreciate your ongoing support, and thank you for your efforts each and every day. Before we move on to our fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial results, I would like to walk through the restructuring plan we announced on January 16 that primarily impacts our Bedding Products segment. We're taking actions to create a more focused, agile organization with a portfolio of products that are most in demand and an operating footprint aligned with the markets we serve. These actions build upon work already underway to better position our bedding business for the future."", 'Optimizing the bedding manufacturing and distribution footprint will drive most of the one-time cost and future EBIT benefits from the plan. The majority of bedding actions will be within our U.S. Spring and specialty foam businesses. We will be winding down operations at our smaller U.S. Spring distribution locations over the next few months and expect to shift innerspring production to four higher output facilities over the course of 2024. Within Specialty Foam, we will be consolidating several manufacturing operations and driving more product synergies across specialty foam and innersprings, including private label and OEM hybrid mattress production over approximately the next 18 months. Few of the higher output manufacturing facilities, combined with an improved distribution network will allow us to manufacture and distribute our products more efficiently and serve our customers more effectively.', 'While we are reducing capacity in certain product categories to align with consumer preferences that have shifted over time, we are maintaining sufficient capacity to service our customers with the products they deserve most as market demand returns to more normalized levels in the future. Sales attrition from these initiatives is primarily due to discontinuing production of certain commodity bedding products in certain geographies. We are also consolidating a small number of production facilities in our home furniture and flooring products businesses within the Furniture, Flooring & Textile products segment. The home furniture consolidation activity is underway and is expected to be completed in the first half of 2024. The flooring products efforts are also underway, but will likely extend into 2025 as multiple product lines are being shipped among locations.', 'These actions are being taken to better align capacity with regional demand and drive operating efficiencies. In connection with the restructuring plan, we stepped away from our total shareholder return goal and financial targets, including revenue growth, EBIT margin and dividend payout ratio. We will issue revised financial targets in the future when our restructuring initiatives are implemented, and we have better visibility of further opportunities that could impact our long-term performance. Now moving on to fourth quarter and full year 2023 results. Fourth quarter sales were $1.1 billion, down 7% versus the fourth quarter of 2022. Continued weak demand in residential end markets was partially offset by demand strength in our automotive, aerospace and hydraulic cylinders businesses.', 'Fourth quarter EBIT was a loss of $367 million, resulting from a $444 million non-cash intangible asset impairment charge. This impairment was associated with the ECS and [indiscernible] acquisitions and primarily related to customer relationships, technology and trademark intangible assets. Prolonged weak demand and changing market dynamics have created disruption and financial instability for some of our customers. As such, recent efforts by certain customers to improve their financial position are expected to reduce our future sales and earnings. This triggered an evaluation of intangible assets and resulted in the impairment charge in the fourth quarter of 2023. Adjusted EBIT was $66 million in the quarter, down $25 million versus fourth quarter 2022, primarily due to lower metal margins in our Steel Rod business and lower volume in our residential end markets.', ""Fourth quarter earnings per share was a loss of $2.18 due to the items discussed in yesterday's press release. Excluding these items, adjusted fourth quarter EPS was $0.26, a 33% decrease from fourth quarter 2022 EPS of $0.39. For the full year, 2023 sales decreased 8% to $4.7 billion, primarily from weak residential end market demand and raw material related selling price decreases, partially offset by acquisitions and demand strength in industrial end markets. EBIT decreased $575 million, primarily from the $444 million intangible asset impairment. Adjusted EBIT decreased $151 million to $334 million, primarily for metal margin compression and lower volume in our residential end markets. Full year EPS was a loss of $1 and adjusted EPS was $1.39, a 39% decrease from 2022 EPS of $2.27."", 'Cash flow from operations was $497 million, a $56 million increase versus 2022. Moving on to the segments. The U.S. Bedding market continues to be in a deep recession with mattress consumption at levels comparable to 2016. We believe 2023 U.S. mattress consumption was down high-single digits versus 2022 and expect mattress demand in 2024 to be flat to down slightly versus last year. Imported finished mattresses are putting additional pressure on U.S. production in this low demand environment. Sales in our Bedding Products segment were down 14% versus fourth quarter of 2022 and decreased 17% for the full year. While volume in U.S. Spring was down 12% in 2023, ComfortCore performance was consistent with overall mattress market trends. We expect 2024 volume in U.S. Spring to be down modestly, primarily due to anticipated sales attrition from the restructuring plan and further declines in lower value Open Coil (ph) layer springs and wire grids.', ""These declines are expected to be partially offset by growth in ComfortCore innerspring units, including growth in our new combination pocket and eco based products. Metal margin declined slightly more than expected in 2023, primarily due to mix. We anticipate further modest declines in 2024. To stay competitive with global steel cost, both contract and non-contract innerspring pricing was adjusted in the back half of '23. Pricing impacts began in the fourth quarter, but will be fully realized in 2024. Specialty Foam volume in 2024 is expected to be down high-single to low-double digits, primarily as a result of customer actions that led to the impairment charge we discussed earlier. These impacts are anticipated to be realized as we move through the course of the year."", 'We expect 2024 adjusted segment EBIT to be modestly lower year-over-year from lower volume, pricing responses related to global steel cost differentials and modest metal margin compression, partially offset by approximately $45 million of lower amortization from the intangible asset impairment taken in the fourth quarter of 2023. Despite current challenging market dynamics, the actions we are taking aim to position our Bedding business for long-term success as we improve operating efficiencies and continue to drive valuable product solutions for our customers. Sales in our Specialized Products segment increased 5% versus fourth quarter of 2022 and were up 14% for the full year. In our automotive business, the UAW strike impact on fourth quarter sales was approximately $5 million, and we do not expect any follow-on impacts from the strike in 2024.', 'We continue to see volatility in certain regions due to geopolitical and supply chain impacts. We anticipate growth in 2024 and expect to outperform global automotive production, primarily due to new programs initiated production throughout the year. We expect continued strong demand in our aerospace business in 2024 with commercial aerospace backlogs at historic highs. 2024 industry production is anticipated to be modestly above pre-pandemic levels. In hydraulic cylinders, U.S. demand continues to be strong with backlogs driving growth through at least the first half of 2024. Domestic growth is expected to be mostly offset by softening demand in Europe. In 2024, we expect segment EBIT to be flat with 2023 as volume growth is anticipated to be offset by less benefit from a reduction to a contingent purchase price liability associated with the prior year acquisition.', 'Sales in our Furniture, Flooring & Textile Products segment were down 6% versus fourth quarter of 2022, and down 11% for the full year. Demand in home furniture continues to be soft. We expect 2024 to be similar to last year with improvements in low end market demand, offset by continued weakness in mid to high-end market demand. Work Furniture demand remains low in both contract and residential markets. We expect 2024 demand be in line with 2023. In Flooring Products, we are anticipating another year of lower residential demand due to low existing home sales and renovation activity. Hospitality demand continues to slowly improve, but remains well below pre-pandemic levels. After weaker than expected demand in 2023, we anticipate Geo Components demand to improve through the course of the year, infrastructure and commercial spending in civil construction markets, while retail sales are expected to be flat.', ""In 2024, we expect adjusted segment EBIT to be down modestly year-over-year from lower volume and moderate pricing pressure from deflation. The largest headwind to earnings continues to be low volume levels in our residential end markets. In the near term, we are focused on improving operating efficiency across our businesses, driving cash flow and executing our restructuring plan. Additionally, we believe the longer term benefits from our refocused bedding strategy will advance key product growth, improve profitability and drive enhanced value for our customers and shareholders. I'll now turn the call over to Ben."", 'Benjamin Burns: Thank you, Mitch, and good morning, everyone. In 2023, we generated cash from operations of $497 million, $56 million higher than the $441 million we generated in 2022. This increase reflects a continued focus on working capital management, partially offset by lower earnings. We ended the year with adjusted working capital as a percentage of annualized sales of 13.9%, a notable improvement from 2022. Consistent with our near-term priorities of managing cash and reducing debt, we did not complete any acquisitions and had minimal share repurchases in 2023. Major uses of cash in 2023 were $114 million of capital expenditures, reflecting a balance of investing for the future while controlling our spending. $239 million for dividend payments, extending our record of consecutive annual dividend increases to 52 years and $107 million to reduce debt.', 'We ended the year with total debt of $2 billion, including $186 million of commercial paper outstanding. Net debt to trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA was 3.16 times at year end, in line with the third quarter and consistent with our expectations. We monitor our debt leverage and liquidity closely. As a reminder, our covenant calculation is more favorable than our publicly reported leverage ratio, and we expect that favorable difference to expand in 2024. Total liquidity was $697 million at year end comprised of $365 million of cash on hand and $332 million in capacity remaining under our revolving credit facility. As we anticipate weak residential end market demand again this year, we are focused on maintaining our investment grade credit rating and managing debt leverage while balancing continued investment in our business for future growth and our dividend track record.', 'We continue to focus on managing working capital and identifying other opportunities to generate cash. In 2024, we expect pre-tax proceeds of $20 million to $30 million from real estate sales, consisting of idle real estate, we are actively marketing and to a lesser extent, real estate that we will be exiting as a result of our restructuring initiatives. We expect to predominantly use our commercial paper program to repay $300 million of 3.8%, 10-year notes maturing in November. Now moving to the 2024 full year guidance. 2024 sales are expected to be $4.35 billion to $4.65 billion were down 2% to 8% versus 2023, reflecting continued weak demand in our residential end markets, partially offset by growth in automotive and our industrial end markets.', 'Volume is expected to be down low to mid-single digits with volume at the midpoint, down high-single digits and bedding products, up low-single digits in Specialized Products and down low-single digits in Furniture, Flooring & Textile products. Deflation and currency combined is expected to reduce sales low-single digits. 2024 earnings per share expected to be in the range of $0.95 to $1.25, including approximately $0.20 to $0.25 per share of negative impact from restructuring costs and $0.10 to $0.15 per share gain from the sale of real estate. Full year adjusted earnings per share are expected to be $1.05 to $1.35 primarily reflecting lower volume, pricing responses related to global steel cost differentials, modest metal margin compression and several expense items that were abnormally low in 2023 and are expected to normalize in 2024, including bad debt expense, a reduction to a contingent purchase price liability associated with the prior year acquisition and incentive compensation.', 'These decreases are partially offset by lower amortization from the 2023 intangible asset impairment. Based upon this guidance framework, our 2024 full year adjusted EBIT margin range is expected to be 6.4% to 7.2%. EPS guidance assumes a full year effective tax rate of 25% versus an adjusted rate of 24% in 2023. Depreciation and amortization of approximately $135 million, which is approximately $45 million lower as a result of the impairment taken last year. Net interest expense of approximately $85 million and fully diluted shares of $138 million. Cash from operations is expected to be $325 million to $375 million in 2024, as we expect fewer opportunities for working capital improvement year-over-year. We will continue to closely manage all elements of working capital.', 'For the full year 2024, we assumed capital expenditures of $100 million to $120 million, dividends of approximately $245 million, indicating $1.84 annual dividend in 2024 versus $1.82 in 2023 and minimal spending for acquisitions and share repurchases as we focus on managing cash. In closing, I would like to thank our employees. Your continued efforts to drive value for our customers and shareholders while supporting and keeping each other safe is very much appreciated. With those comments, I’ll turn the call back over to Cassie.', ""Cassie Branscum: Thank you, Ben.

The U.S. Bedding market continues to be in a deep recession with mattress consumption at levels comparable to 2016. We believe 2023 U.S. mattress consumption was down high single digits versus 2022 and expect mattress demand in 2024 to be flat to down slightly versus last year. Imported finished mattresses are putting additional pressure on U.S. production in this low demand environment. Sales in our Bedding Products segment were down 14% versus fourth quarter of 2022 and decreased 17% for the full year.While volume in U.S. Spring was down 12% in 2023, Comfort Core performance was consistent with overall mattress market trends. We expect 2024 volume in U.S. Spring to be down modestly, primarily due to anticipated sales attrition from the restructuring plan and further declines in lower-value Open Coil innersprings and wire grids. These declines are expected to be partially offset by growth in Comfort Core innerspring units, including growth in our new combination pocket and eco based products.Metal margin declined slightly more than expected in 2023, primarily due to mix. We anticipate further modest declines in 2024. To stay competitive with global steel cost, both contract and noncontract innerspring pricing was adjusted in the back half of 2023. Pricing impacts began in the fourth quarter but will be fully realized in 2024. Specialty Foam volume in 2024 is expected to be down high single to low double digits, primarily as a result of customer actions that led to the impaired charge we discussed earlier. These impacts are anticipated to be realized as we move through the course of the year. We expect 2024 adjusted segment EBIT to be modestly lower year-over-year from lower volume pricing responses related to global steel cost differentials and modest metal margin compression, partially offset by approximately $45 million of lower amortization from the intangible asset impairment taken in the fourth quarter of 2023.Despite current challenging market dynamics, the actions we are taking aim to position our Bedding business for long-term success as we improve operating efficiencies and continue to drive valuable product solutions for our customers. Sales in our Specialized Products segment increased 5% versus fourth quarter of 2022 and were up 14% for the full year. In our automotive business, the UAW strike impact on fourth quarter sales was approximately $5 million, and we do not expect any follow-on impacts from the strike in 2024.We continue to see volatility in certain regions due to geopolitical and supply chain impacts. We anticipate growth in 2024 and expect to outperform global automotive production, primarily due to new programs-initiated production throughout the year. We expect continued strong demand in our Aerospace business in 2024 with commercial aerospace backlogs at historic highs. 2024 industry production is anticipated to be modestly above pre-pandemic levels.In Hydraulic Cylinders, U.S. demand continues to be strong with backlog driving growth through at least the first half of 2024. Domestic growth is expected to be mostly offset by softening demand in Europe. In 2024, we expect segment EBIT to be flat with 2023 as volume growth is anticipated to be offset by less benefit from a reduction to a contingent purchase price liability associated with the prior year acquisition. Sales in our Furniture, Flooring & Textile Products segment were down 6% versus fourth quarter of 2022, down 11% for the full year.Demand in Home Furniture continues to be soft. We expect 2024 to be similar to last year with improvements in low end market demand, offset by continued weakness in mid- to high-end market demand. Work Furniture demand remains low in both contract and residential markets. We expect 2024 demand be in line with 2023.In Flooring products, we are anticipating another year of lower residential demand due to low existing home sales and renovation activity. Hospitality demand continues to slowly improve but remains well below pre-pandemic levels. After weaker-than-expected demand in 2023, we anticipate Geo Components demand to improve through the course of the year, infrastructure and commercial spending in civil construction markets, while retail sales are expected to be flat.In 2024, we expect adjusted segment EBIT to be down modestly year-over-year from lower volume and moderate pricing pressure from deflation. The largest headwind to earnings continues to be low volume levels in our residential end markets. In the near term, we are focused on improving operating efficiency across our businesses, driving cash flow and executing our restructuring plan.Additionally, we believe the longer-term benefits from our refocused bedding strategy will advance key product growth, improve profitability and drive enhanced value for our customers and shareholders.I'll now turn the call over to Ben."", 'Benjamin M. Burns', ""Thank you, Mitch, and good morning, everyone. In 2023, we generated cash from operations of $497 million, $56 million higher than the $441 million we generated in 2022. This increase reflects a continued focus on working capital management, partially offset by lower earnings. We ended the year with adjusted working capital as a percentage of annualized sales of 13.9%, a notable improvement from 2022.Consistent with our near-term priorities of managing cash and reducing debt, we did not complete any acquisitions and had minimal share repurchases in 2023. Major uses of cash in 2023 were $114 million of capital expenditures, reflecting a balance of investing for the future while controlling our spending $239 million for dividend payments, extending our record of consecutive annual dividend increases to 52 years and $107 million to reduce debt.We ended the year with total debt of $2 billion, including $186 million of commercial paper outstanding. Net debt to trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA was 3.16x at year-end, in line with the third quarter and consistent with our expectations. We monitor our debt leverage and liquidity closely. As a reminder, our covenant calculation is more favorable than our publicly reported leverage ratio and we expect that favorable difference to expand in 2024.Total liquidity was $697 million at year-end comprised of $365 million of cash on hand and $332 million in capacity remaining under our revolving credit facility. As we anticipate weak residential end market demand again this year, we are focused on maintaining our investment-grade credit rating and managing debt leverage while balancing continued investment in our business for future growth and our dividend track record.We continue to focus on managing working capital and identifying other opportunities to generate cash. In 2024, we expect pretax proceeds of $20 million to $30 million from real estate sales, consisting of idle real estate, we are actively marketing and, to a lesser extent, real estate that we will be exiting as a result of our restructuring initiatives. We expect to predominantly use our commercial paper program to repay $300 million of 3.8%, 10-year notes maturing in November.Now moving to the 2024 full year guidance. 2024 sales are expected to be $4.35 billion to $4.65 billion, were down 2% to 8% versus 2023, reflecting continued weak demand in our residential end markets, partially offset by growth in automotive and our industrial end markets. Volume is expected to be down low to mid-single digits with volume at the midpoint, down high single digits in Bedding Products, up low single digits in Specialized Products and down low single digits in Furniture, Flooring & Textile products.Deflation and currency combined is expected to reduce sales low single digits. 2024 earnings per shares expected to be in the range of $0.95 to $1.25 including approximately $0.20 to $0.25 per share of negative impact from restructuring costs and $0.10 to $0.15 per share gain from the sale of real estate.Full year adjusted earnings per share are expected to be $1.05 to $1.35, primarily reflecting lower volume, pricing responses related to global steel cost differentials, modest metal margin compression and several expense items that were abnormally low in 2023, and are expected to normalize in 2024, including bad debt expense, a reduction to a contingent purchase price liability associated with the prior year acquisition and incentive compensation. These decreases are partially offset by lower amortization from the 2023 intangible asset impairment.Based upon this guidance framework, our 2024 full year adjusted EBIT margin range is expected to be 6.4% to 7.2%. The EPS guidance assumes a full year effective tax rate of 25% versus an adjusted rate of 24% in 2023. Depreciation and amortization of approximately $135 million, which is approximately $45 million lower as a result of the impairment taken last year. Net interest expense of approximately $85 million and fully diluted shares of $138 million. Cash from operations is expected to be $325 million to $375 million in 2024 as we expect fewer opportunities for working capital improvement year-over-year. We will continue to closely manage all elements of working capital.For the full year 2024, we assumed capital expenditures of $100 million to $120 million, dividends of approximately $245 million, indicating $1.84 annual dividend in 2024 versus $1.82 in 2023 and minimal spending for acquisitions and share repurchases as we focus on managing cash. In closing, I would like to thank our employees. Your continued efforts to drive value for our customers and shareholders while supporting and keeping each other safe is very much appreciated.With those comments, I'll turn the call back over to Cassie."", 'Cassie Branscum', ""Thank you, Ben. Operator, we're ready to begin Q&A."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Susan Maklari with Goldman Sachs.', 'Susan Marie Maklari', ""I first want to congratulate Susan. It's been great working with you all these years, and you are going to be very missed. So congrats and best of luck in your retirement."", 'Susan McCoy', ""Thanks, Susan. I appreciate that and we'll definitely stay in touch."", 'Susan Marie Maklari', ""Yes. So moving on to my questions. I've got a couple of them related to the restructuring that you've announced. And maybe to start with, can you talk a bit about how you think of the long-term dynamics of the Bedding industry? With all the different moves we've seen in the last 3 or 4 years or so, how did you determine the level of demand that you need to be sized to? How are those coming together? And what are the sort of nuances of what you keep versus what you restructure out of the business? And how do you think about the go forward, I guess, of that operation?"", 'J. Mitchell Dolloff', 'Thanks for the question. I think the big picture for me is the restructuring is more than just thinking about our capacity. But Tyson, let me turn it over to you to share your thoughts.', 'J. Tyson Hagale', ""Sure, sure thing. I'll start by saying, and I know this is pretty obvious but these are really difficult decisions, and we didn't take them lightly. And part of it is what Mitch said, too, it goes beyond just capacity. I mean really if you think about how our business has been changing over several years, we've been changing our product lineup with the acquisition of Specialty Foam, how we've been pivoting to more semifinished products, incorporating foam into our innerspring products as well, and a continued long-term shift on Open Coil to Comfort Core.So we've seen our product mix and what we're offering our customers change quite a lot over the last several years. So as we thought about the manufacturing part of the restructuring plan, also over the last several years, even during the pandemic. We've invested heavily in Comfort Core productive capacity and really efficient capacity. We've done the same thing at ECS after acquisition. We've been making investments there as well. So as we look at where the market is headed and what our customers really want and their products, we also still had some longer-term legacy capacity still in place from Open Coil in our innerspring business. So we've added the comfort core capacity and hadn't necessarily taken off as much of the (inaudible) capacity as we needed to.So looking at that, we're not looking at today's market environment. We're at a really, really low point for U.S. mattress manufacturing. So we're not looking at today as the long-term needs. We really are looking at what we think to be the long-term trajectory of the overall market and more of a move towards Comfort Core and semifinished products.So as we looked at just our overall footprint and our manufacturing capacity with what we've put into place, we saw an opportunity to go through the consolidations and still maintain our capacity and ability to flex up to whatever the market needs might be with our customers with just a smaller footprint, higher output facilities and then also adjusting our distribution network to have a fewer number of larger regional sites that will support our customers in a better way.So it's a long-winded answer but really taking a lot of things into account and not necessarily walking away from active capacity but more to where we think the market is headed."", 'Susan Marie Maklari', ""Okay. That's great color, Tyson. And then I know that with the release a couple of weeks ago, you walked away from the long-term margin guide. But I guess, as you think about coming through this restructuring and being on the other side of it. How do we think about what that could mean for the margins, both within Bedding and then within Leggett just as a total, relative to where we are today, anything that you can sort of give us in terms of a general path there?"", 'J. Mitchell Dolloff', ""Yes, I'll take that one, Susan. So great question. Yes, I think the restructuring is certainly important for us. I think it resets us for sort of the more forward-looking market environment. And I don't mean that from a capacity standpoint, as Tyson said, we're really looking at sort of the normalized growth that we would achieve in bedding over the longer term.But beyond that, I think we have other actions that we can take and that we are taking. The biggest one, of course, is volume. So in markets -- our residential end markets start to come back with volume, that has a huge, huge impact on the EBIT margins for the company overall. But beyond the restructuring, I think we have opportunities to continue to optimize our operating efficiency making sure that we are being as effective as we can and that we are producing products and even in certain lines that are value added to us.Continuing to recover cost impacts outside of just raw materials and whether that's through pricing actions or continuous improvement activities are just new product introductions that give us those opportunities as well. And then I think it's always been a priority for us to continue to closely manage our corporate costs, make sure that they're aligned with services that are providing value and improving efficiency. As we always say, continuing to drive innovation and providing solutions for our customers to enhance our partnership with those key customers as well. And then finally, continuing to assess our portfolio management.So we see that there's opportunity for us to continue to drive improvement for the longer term across the company beyond just the restructuring. There's restructuring is certainly important. It's near-term focus but (inaudible) these things. So I think we need to get to some visibility about the volume recovery, get more progress going on the restructuring and get some more insights into the benefits from some of these other items I mentioned, and then we'll get those targets back on the table. But certainly, we believe it's something that's important, and we're focused on it."", 'Susan Marie Maklari', ""Okay. Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe I'll sneak one last one in for Ben. Everyone will get one this morning, which is, Ben, can you walk us through the change, when we think about the $500 million of operating cash flows from '23 relative to the $325 million to $375 million that you guided us to -- for this year? And then I guess with that, too, when you think about the long-term cash generation of Leggett, where can that come together? And how do we think about, again, what these changes will mean for the cash flow of the business?"", 'Benjamin M. Burns', ""Yes, thanks for the question. I appreciate it. Yes. So our guidance for this year is $325 million to $375 million as compared to roughly $500 million in 2023. So I'd say the biggest drivers there are the contribution that we had from improvements in working capital in 2023, we're really outstanding. Our teams did a great job and we drove over $100 million of working capital improvements. So that will be a contributor to cash flow in 2024 but it will be a much lower contributor because we've done such a great job. And just those opportunities are still there. We still think we have some pockets but it will be a little bit more smaller in nature.And then the second thing I'd mention is just the lower earnings with the volumes continuing to be lower, that's going to be another contributor to the lower cash flow this year. And then the last thing is there's a little bit of a drag from the cash costs associated with our restructuring plan that will be a bit of a drag again on cash flow.If we think about from a longer-term perspective, I think it kind of goes back to the things Mitch and Tyson were just talking about with the actions that we're taking through, the restructuring and just other opportunities to drive operational efficiencies, those will really benefit us and especially as those volumes come back. I think Mitch just said it that it's such a huge benefit to us with those incremental margins when those volumes are back to just normal levels or somewhere close to normal levels. So those are the biggest drivers. But I'd mention, we'll continue to manage our working capital really tightly and look for those opportunities to drive out costs and lower value items as well. But over the long run, I think that's kind of how I think about it."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Bobby Griffin with Raymond James.', 'Robert Kenneth Griffin', ""Let me also echo a big thank you and congratulations to Susan on your retirement. It's been great working and getting to know you for the last 10 years."", 'Susan McCoy', 'Thanks, Bobby. I appreciate you too.', 'Robert Kenneth Griffin', ""I guess first, maybe let's start off in the Bedding segment. Obviously, a lot going on here to unpack with the restructuring stuff. I guess the first aspect I wanted to talk about is just the difference in the performance of Comfort Core, and I guess the Open Coil part of the business. And I'm asking more in kind of the context of by my math, it looks like Bedding innerspring volumes for Leggett versus 2019 are down, call it, mid- to high 30s. And the industry collectively is down maybe mid-20s to high 20s, right? So there's a fairly big gap there in Leggett volumes versus industry volumes.And so I'm asking, are the Open Coil customers going elsewhere, sourcing differently? Like what is driving that gap? And then kind of when we look at the go-forward, how do we think about this restructuring and how it impacts the business with your vertically integrated steel mill because I think volumes really need to run through that to make that profitable. So just kind of connecting all that aspect is the question."", 'J. Mitchell Dolloff', ""Tyson, I'll be happy to hand it over to you."", 'J. Tyson Hagale', ""Sure thing. Thanks for the question, Bobby. So I'll start just with the Open Coil part. We have seen just a long-term trend down in that category. Some of it has been just a shift from our customers from Open Coil to Comfort Core. So there has been -- some of that drag on Open Coil has just been a shift. There has been some different sourcing options, especially during the pandemic when things were short. And then there's also been some differences in U.S. steel costs versus Europe. So we have seen some growth in imported intersperse, especially on the lower end in Open Coil.The other part you didn't mention but does get wrapped up in our volume around innerspring is wire grids. And that's been a significant decline in overall volume. And that's more of just a shift in consumer preference in type of foundations. So that also is impactful in overall volume in our innerspring business.The other part of it back to our rod mill, you're absolutely right. I mean volume is a critical part. As we have seen the Open Coil decline in wire grids, a lot of our products that go into Comfort Core also consume more wire because we have products that go fully to the edge, replacing some foam components. So there is still a an offset, even with fewer units, we are still driving tons.And right now, it is a big drag because overall it's the market where we are, we do have open capacity at the rod mill. But between market recovery and some of our efforts just to diversify out and selling into some industrial markets, we still feel good about the overall capacity utilization at (inaudible)."", 'Robert Kenneth Griffin', ""I guess two follow-ups on that, Tyson. I mean the different sourcing options that are popping up, I've noticed as well kind of just checking the industry. Are those -- is there a way to compete better against those? Does -- do we need to have lower pricing? Or do we have some type of different product offering to compete against the different sourcing options to maintain those customer relations? And then just more of a financial question. Hypothetically, if the -- or I guess not hypothetically, if the rod mill goes back to full capacity, what does that benefit? What is the drag on segment profitability from the rod mill running at partial capacity today?"", 'J. Tyson Hagale', ""Sure. Yes. So to your first question. Yes, I mean, our biggest job is to help our customers succeed. And so we want to make sure that we're giving them options to compete with especially just low-priced goods. So we will help them with VA/VE opportunities even on the low end but also offering them different product options that help them compete there. I mean our restructuring effort is a big part of that as well. I mean us becoming more efficient utilizing our assets in a more efficient way in distribution is in a large part to serve our customer better and help them succeed.So all of those things factored in. I mean, definitely around the innovation, trying to do the VA/VE work and giving the different options is a way to help offset some of those low-price options. And then overall, I mean, not just in the rod mill, but running all the way through our vertically integrated (inaudible) Spring value chain and also at ECS, the volume has, by far, the most significant impact to our margin profile. So that would be the biggest driver of recovery overall for the vending segment."", 'J. Mitchell Dolloff', 'Tyson, maybe just to add on there. So a little bit in the -- what you talked about is refocusing our strategy and not just focusing on volumes. So if we talk about the Open Coil opportunities that are there and we could go chase pricing but that comes with our risk, right? In terms of some of the financial stability to participate in the market today and just what the margin profile of those products would look like.Do you agree with that?', 'Robert Kenneth Griffin', 'Perfect. And I guess, Mitch, switching gears here, and sorry just to kind of 0 on margins but I think that is the kind of the debate over the next couple of years. A lot of news in The bedding products and getting that restructured differently, specialized roughly a 10-ish percent EBIT margin versus historical high teens levels, auto production globally is coming back. What is the other aspects that need to happen there to rebuild the margin profile of that business over the next, call it, 1, 2 and 3 years?', 'J. Mitchell Dolloff', ""I think, Bobby. I think that we have been making progress as we've gone through the last couple of years. We've seen still a lot of dynamics in the automotive industry but we definitely see volume coming back and that's helping and we see improved margins in automotive. We still have work to do and room to make those improvements but we're definitely on the right path. Similarly, although it's smaller in Aerospace, very strong backlogs in the industry. So that volume will continue to come back, again, not as large of an impact as automotive but it certainly will help.And then we're seeing a little bit of a challenge in the year -- in this year on Hydraulics, where there's really strong backlogs, both in material handling and heavy construction markets. And we see the strong backlog at least through the first half in the U.S. on that part of the market. But the heavy construction side in Europe, particularly in Germany, it seems like it may be a little bit more challenged in demand. So we'll see some ups and downs. But I think that the progress that we've made over the last couple of years in specialized, I think, demonstrates our confidence in the ability to return back to a higher margin profile, certainly, maybe it doesn't go back to the peak margins that we had. But certainly back to the higher margin profile that will provide a lot of benefit to the company."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Peter Keith with Piper Sandler.', 'Alexia Morgan', ""This is Alexia Morgan on for Peter Keith. My question is on antidumping scenarios. I know we're expecting a decision later this month. Can you give us an update on antidumping legislation? And then what are the best and worst-case outcomes that you're thinking about once there's a ruling?"", 'J. Tyson Hagale', ""Sure. This is Tyson. I'll jump in and tackle that one. So yes, we're a party to that. And kind of what we said in past cases, the U.S. industry just needs a level playing field, and that's really what the industry is after. No matter which scenario we think might play out. We fully expect to see some level of imported mattress activity. It may move around to some different countries. There may be some shoring in the U.S. for foam importers. But we still see that dynamic playing out regardless of scenario.It really is difficult to say how much will come back to U.S. producers just given potential moves to other regions. Also right now, things are a little muddy just because ahead of a potential decision. We have seen a higher level of imports over the last couple of quarters, just I think with some of the importers attempting to get in ahead of any impose duties. So that will take some time to work through, especially in a really soft market. So we'll see what kind of overhang there is in kind of the near term. But overall, I think we would see just that kind of helps support the continued hub of the industry. So overall, I think we'd say it's still to be determined how much impact would come back to the U.S. producers."", 'Alexia Morgan', 'Okay. And then my next question is related to spring and foam pricing. Is there any deflation within those categories? And then any deflation baked into the sales outlook?', 'J. Tyson Hagale', ""Sure. I'll take that one as well. Yes, we've seen commodities at prices, both chemicals and steel moderate over the last year. So over the last year, we've seen pricing in our Specialty Foam business decline as we've been trying to compensate for those client declines given that back to our customers. In our Steel business, we've seen same, last year, we saw middle margins decline overall. We also mentioned in the prepared remarks that we've also adjusted innerspring pricing just relative to overall competitive global steel market.In the past, we've seen Europe and U.S. steel be in a pretty tight range but we've seen a divergence of that last year. So we have adjusted pricing just to fairly compensate for that with our customers. As far as 2024, there is -- since most of the steel impact came in the back part of 2023, the full year annualization of those price changes would be reflected in our guidance."", 'Operator', ""Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the floor back to Ms. Branscum for any final comments."", 'Cassie Branscum', 'Thank you for joining us this morning and your interest in Leggett, and have a great weekend.', 'Operator', ""Thank you.

On July 4, 2023, CNBC reported that 57 films were released in more than 2,000 theaters from January to June 2019 while only 45 films were released during the same period in 2023.

This doesn’t sit right with the fact that streaming services have become increasingly popular across the world.

While major technology firms continued to show strong gains at the year's end, the market rally expanded across different sectors that had underperformed in 2023, including small caps, biotech/healthcare, clean energy, and financials.

To skip the latest news and analysts’ sentiments around the current economic conditions, go directly to the 5 Best Big Company Stocks to Buy.', 'Despite the doubts, the market performed exceptionally in 2023. While several analysts believed it to be temporary, the new year isn’t showing many signs of weakness in the market. Although there have been a few hurdles, the overall prediction is that the Federal Reserve will manage to guide the US economy toward a soft landing rather than a recession, as was expected in the last two years. However, analysts still advise caution in the short term. Marko Kolanovic, Chief Global Markets Strategist and Global Co-Head of Research at J.P. Morgan, said:\xa0', '“As we approach 2024, we expect both inflation data and economic demand to soften, as the tailwinds for growth and risk markets are fading. Overall, we are cautious on the performance of risky assets and the broader macro outlook over the next 12 months, due to building monetary headwinds, geopolitical risks and expensive asset valuations.”', 'Nevertheless, the latest news suggests that the financial markets are heading in the right direction as the S&P 500 touched 5000 for the first time at the time of market opening on February 9 after December inflation data, which turned out to be even lower than initially reported. While the Fed recently revealed that it will take its time to review market data before making any decision to announce rate cuts, many analysts believe that the rate cuts can begin in the first half of 2024.', 'Despite the positive predictions around the market, the varying opinions of experts can lead to further confusion among novice investors, which is why the best big company stocks are some of the safest bets for such people. These big company stocks bring a sense of safety among investors as the losses are never permanent, even during bear market conditions. Additionally, the best company stocks are usually cash-rich with strong balance sheets and can easily weather any economic disasters. Furthermore, their wealth also allows them to pay steady dividends. For example, one of the giants in the energy sector, Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) has increased its dividends for the last 37 years, even though the last 10 years have seen some significant volatility in the energy sectors. Similarly, another blue-chip stock, PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) raised its dividend by 7% on February 9 despite year-over-year (YoY) revenue declines across major markets in the fourth quarter of 2023.', 'The big company stocks do not guarantee positive returns all the time but provide ample opportunities for investors when they fall. For example, earlier this month, we discussed the 10 blue-chip stocks at 52-week lows, which you should check out as these are also some of the best big company stocks that provide prime entry points for investors. However, our current list uses a different methodology, and some of our current best big company stocks include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). After an exceptional performance in 2023, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) declared its first-ever quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share on February 1 and increased its previous share buyback authorization by $50 billion. The company nearly gained 200% in the year and is up nearly 36% year-to-date (YTD) at the time of writing on February 9.', 'A large stock market board displaying the S&P 500 and S&P 500 Growth Index.', 'Our Methodology', 'To choose the best big company stocks, we used the FinViz stock screener to identify mega-cap stocks with an estimated 5-year EPS growth of over 15%.

The pandemic had pulled forward user growth, and the company then disclosed that there were over 100 million households that were using Netflix but not paying for it by borrowing a paid user’s account. After we assessed this information, better understood how the company could monetize shared passwords, and realized the win-win for Netflix and consumers from introducing an ad-supported subscription tier, we meaningfully added to our position in Netflix in the summer of 2022. We saw a clear path to much better monetization of an already robust and differentiated platform with a continued commitment to improved content spend efficiency and free cash flow growth.', 'Fast forward to today, Netflix has made meaningful progress on monetizing shared passwords and laying the foundation for consumer choice, although the ramp in advertising tier subscribers remains in the beginning stages. The low-hanging fruit may already have been picked on password sharing efforts, but our research shows there should be long tails of revenue and free cash flow growth. In our opinion, Netflix remains the most advantaged and profitable streaming service with opportunities to continue adding subscribers and raising prices as it demonstrates more value to consumers over time. Over the longer term, we also expect significant advertising revenue. That said, the market finally seems to have appreciated some of this.

Amgen paid out 68% of its earnings to investors last year, a normal payout level for most businesses. A useful secondary check can be to evaluate whether Amgen generated enough free cash flow to afford its dividend. Over the last year it paid out 63% of its free cash flow as dividends, within the usual range for most companies.', ""It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously."", ""Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends."", ""Stocks with flat earnings can still be attractive dividend payers, but it is important to be more conservative with your approach and demand a greater margin for safety when it comes to dividend sustainability. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. It's not encouraging to see that Amgen's earnings are effectively flat over the past five years. We'd take that over an earnings decline any day, but in the long run, the best dividend stocks all grow their earnings per share."", ""Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. Since the start of our data, 10 years ago, Amgen has lifted its dividend by approximately 17% a year on average."", ""Is Amgen an attractive dividend stock, or better left on the shelf? Amgen has been unable to generate earnings growth, but at least its dividend looks sustainable, with its profit and cashflow payout ratios within reasonable limits. It's not an attractive combination from a dividend perspective, and we're inclined to pass on this one for the time being."", ""Having said that, if you're looking at this stock without much concern for the dividend, you should still be familiar of the risks involved with Amgen. For instance, we've identified 2 warning signs for Amgen (1 can't be ignored) you should be aware of."", ""If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks."", 'Have feedback on this article?

If you want to skip our overview of the high technology aerospace and defense industry and how it's shaped the modern day world, you can take a look at the 5 Best Aerospace and Defense Stocks to Invest In. "", ""If there's one thing that can be said with certainty, it's that the defense and aerospace industry is one of the most important in the world when it comes to shaping power politics. Global geopolitics, and as the late Henry Kissinger would describe, 'realpolitik' is based on the cold, hard reality of military superiority. Traditionally, this superiority came in the form of strength in numbers - a concept that still holds true today."", ""However, along with this, another concept that has borne the test of time is the use of technology for warfare. Whether it's the Mongols who relied on brutal cavalry tactics, or the Ottoman use of gunpowder that made it a 'gunpowder empire', technology has shaped warfare and global power dynamics."", ""These days, the dominant and only superpower (some would even say a hyperpower) is the United States of America. The U.S., if you're unaware, has the most powerful military in the world, fueled by the greatest number of aircraft carriers for any military and an air force whose aircraft number in the thousands. Safe to say, aerospace plays a crucial role in maintaining American global military superiority, and by effect, it also shapes the global world order."", 'Powering the U.S. military behemoth, which also has the biggest defense budget in the world, are aerospace and defense stocks. These stocks are firms that either directly engage in providing the U.S. military, through the Department of Defense, with their combat or combat support equipment, or those that provide essential and tertiary capabilities such as the defense stock Planet Labs PBC (NYSE:PL) and Maxar Technologies whose advanced satellites carry the ability to remotely image any site in the world and provide military planners with invaluable information to inform their tactical and strategic decisions.', ""Technology sits at the heart of competing when it comes to defense and aerospace stocks, and a technological edge is precisely the reason that the U.S. is at the top of the global power food chain. American jets are envied by dictators and monarchs all over the world, and no matter what their public statements against the U.S. are, it wouldn't be imprudent to assume that they would give an arm and a leg (and then some) to get a taste of what American defense and aerospace stocks have to offer."", ""So what exactly do they offer? Well, let's start with one of the most well known defense and aerospace stocks in the world, the Bethesda, Maryland based aerospace firm Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT). Lockheed, if you're unaware, makes and sells fighter aircraft. While it also has other divisions, such as a space segment that aims to develop a colony on the Moon complete with a nuclear reactor in partnership with the National Aerospace and Space Administration (NASA), Lockheed Martin's bread and butter are airplanes. The firm in its current form came into being in the late 1990s as the U.S. defense industry consolidated (more on that later). Lockheed merged with Martin Marietta in 1995, after it acquired General Dynamics - perhaps one of the most consequential defense and aerospace stocks in the world."", ""That's a tall claim. So what made Martin Marietta so special? Well, the firm bought General Dynamics in 1993 -\xa0 a deal that also saw it acquire the rights to the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon. The F-16 is the most successful fighter aircraft in the world and is used by most of the world's leading air forces. Its success has defined modern day dog fighting - an art that bulky fighter jets such as the The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA)'s F-15 struggled with."", ""Lockheed has moved past dog fighting since then. For aerospace and defense stocks, the 21st century has been all about stealth. Lockheed's F-117 'Nighthawk' and the technologies used on it dominated the stealth debate for decades, and led to the development of the world's only operational fifth generation fighter aircraft, the F-22 'Raptor'. America's crown jewel, the Raptor is an air superiority fighter designed with the singular aim of ensuring that enemy fighters cannot contest the United States Air Force's control of an airspace."", 'So, as aerospace and defense stocks continue to make magic a reality, we decided to take a look at some top stocks.

They increase companies' borrowing costs. On top of that, these higher rates weighed on the valuations of companies that pay higher-yielding dividends. "", 'Higher rates make lower-risk income investments (think bonds and bank CDs) more attractive. As a result, dividend stock prices need to fall, pushing their yields higher. That higher yield compensates investors for their higher risk profiles. ', ""The sell-off in dividend stocks looks like a great time to double up on high-quality opportunities. That's because rates should fall this year, which should take some of the weight off dividend stock prices. NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE) and Brookfield Infrastructure (NYSE: BIPC)(NYSE: BIP) look like great stocks to double up on right now (if you have a low allocation) or buy if you don't own any shares yet."", ""Shares of NextEra Energy have lost about a quarter of their value over the past year. That has the utility selling at its most attractive level in years. It currently trades at a forward P/E of around 16.6 times.

That has pushed its dividend yield up to 4.5%.', ""The global infrastructure operator's sell-off comes even though it had another strong year in 2023.

The company completed $1 billion of new capital projects last year, while also benefiting from inflation-driven rate increases and volume growth across all its global infrastructure networks. That gave Brookfield the confidence to increase its dividend by another 6% for 2024, its 15th straight year of raising its payout. "", 'Brookfield Infrastructure enters 2024 with lots of momentum. It closed $2 billion of new investments (two data center platforms and a global intermodal logistics operation) during the second half of last year, which will help drive growth in 2024.

These catalysts put the company in a strong position to grow its FFO by another 10% this year."", ""Brookfield trades at an increasingly cheap valuation, given the decline in its share price and continued strong earnings growth. Its year-end FFO run rate was $3.16 per share. That puts its valuation at around 11.4 times FFO. That's dirt cheap compared to the broader market: The S&P 500 trades at 22 times earnings, while the Nasdaq 100 fetches 30 times earnings. "", 'NextEra Energy and Brookfield Infrastructure lost value last year even though their earnings grew sharply. Meanwhile, they expect to continue growing in 2024 and beyond.

If you want to skip our discussion on the energy industry, head directly to Top 5 Oil and Gas Stocks To Invest In According To Hedge Funds.\xa0', 'Over the past decade, energy transition efforts have intensified, but macroeconomic and geopolitical challenges since 2022 have tempered progress. Governments worldwide are now focusing on the development and use of renewable energy technologies. In 2024, energy and mining companies face numerous challenges amid a complex business environment and uncertain economic outlook, as per S&P Global’s latest report. Policy developments in 2022 and 2023 have created opportunities for the energy and mining sectors, particularly in the transition to renewable energy and critical minerals. However, 2024 is expected to bring significant headwinds due to elevated interest rates and slowing economic growth. Energy and utility companies, grappling with regulatory complexities and persistent inflation, face challenges in the rollout of both renewable and traditional energy infrastructure.', ""The energy landscape is influenced by four main disruptors – geopolitical factors, macroeconomic variables (like high interest rates and rising materials costs), evolving policies and regulations, and the emergence of new technologies. These factors significantly impact demand, supply, trade, and investment in the oil and gas industry. According to Deloitte, OPEC+'s output cuts and other disruptions have driven Brent oil prices above US$90/bbl, while US Henry Hub natural gas prices rebounded to US$3.50/mmBtu in November 2023. Despite these challenges, global oil demand is expected to grow by 2.3 mbpd in 2023, surpassing 100 mbpd for the first time. Electric vehicle sales increased by over 35% in 2023, with one in seven cars sold being an EV, highlighting regional differences in demand, infrastructure, technology adoption, regulatory policies, and socioeconomic factors. The industry is poised for a solid start in 2024, supported by its strong financial position and high oil prices, barring further macroeconomic deterioration. This strength is expected to facilitate investments, dividends, and a disciplined capital program, with the global upstream industry projected to maintain a 2023 hydrocarbon investment level of about US$580 billion and generate over US$800 billion in free cash flows in 2024."", ""As per Fitch Ratings, the performance of the global oil and gas sector in 2024 is expected to be consistent with 2023 and stronger than mid-cycle levels. Oil prices are anticipated to remain high and relatively stable year-on-year, attributed to OPEC+'s production cuts, geopolitical factors, and a slowdown in US crude production. Although demand growth is expected to decelerate, the spare capacity, primarily held by OPEC, is likely to be sufficient to absorb potential shocks. Looking ahead to 2025, a decline in oil prices is assumed as OPEC+'s control over supply may ease. Companies with strong cash flow and low leverage are projected to report robust earnings in 2024, supported by favorable prices and ongoing cost control measures. The cumulative EBITDA of Fitch-rated global O&G producers is expected to slightly decrease from 2023, approximately 25% lower than in 2022. Most companies are expected to maintain or reduce capital expenditures, with only about 25% increasing capex by more than 10%. Additionally, approximately 20% of companies are projected to raise dividends by more than 10%, while the rest will either maintain or decrease dividends."", 'To benefit from the growth potential in the energy sector, some of the best stocks to buy include Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY), and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM).\xa0', 'Our Methodology\xa0', 'We chose the top energy stocks based on overall hedge fund sentiment toward each stock.

Over the past few years, the company developed into a growth darling thanks to its strong track record in renewable energy development and tailwinds from the global energy transition and incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act. The problem for NextEra, and the transition broadly, is that this transformation is immensely capital intensive and many renewables projects offer lower returns on that capital. This requires high capital expenditures – often resulting in negative free cash flow – to meet the growth and financing needs of companies like NextEra. To help, the company leaned on financial engineering by using a publicly traded limited partnership called NextEra Energy Partners, providing further capacity for its parent to continue its development plans. NEP used layers of its own financial engineering to fund its own negative free cash flow and a large, growing dividend yield that we believe it could not sustain organically. Ultimately, the higher cost of debt from rising rates led NEP to lower its own growth ambitions, driving concerns about whether NextEra can execute on its extensive backlog.

Masco Corp's financial tables reveal a robust business with significant market presence, underscored by a diverse product portfolio that includes leading brands such as Delta and Hansgrohe in the plumbing segment, and Behr and Kilz in the decorative architectural segment. With a strong foothold in the $5.3 billion plumbing and $3.4 billion decorative architectural markets, Masco Corp's financial health is reflected in its substantial market capitalization of approximately $12.9 billion as of June 30, 2023.

This financial robustness is a cornerstone of Masco Corp's strength, ensuring it can weather economic cycles and invest in long-term growth."", ""Dependence on Key Customers: A notable weakness in Masco Corp's business model is its reliance on key customers. According to the 10-K filing, sales to one customer amounted to $3.07 billion in 2023, representing a significant portion of the company's revenue. This dependence on a limited number of customers could pose a risk if there are changes in purchasing patterns or if relationships with these customers deteriorate.

Economic downturns, rising interest rates, and other macroeconomic factors can adversely affect consumer confidence and spending, leading to reduced demand for Masco Corp's products. The company must remain agile and responsive to economic shifts to mitigate the impact of these external threats."", 'Competitive Pressure: The home improvement and building products industry is highly competitive, with numerous players vying for market share. Masco Corp faces competition from both established brands and private label offerings.

Failure to effectively compete could result in loss of market share and pressure on margins.', 'In conclusion, Masco Corp (NYSE:MAS) exhibits a strong competitive position with its robust brand portfolio, financial health, and strategic focus on innovation. However, the company must address its reliance on key customers and manage operational risks in its supply chain to maintain its market leadership.

Now onto our results. I’ll start this morning with some brief comments on our fourth quarter and full year results, and I’ll finish with our view on 2024 as well as our long term margin expectations.', 'Please turn to Slide 5. We delivered a strong finish to another dynamic and successful year. In the fourth quarter, our top line decreased 2% with volumes down across most categories, partially offset by favorable pricing, currency, and our acquisition of Sauna360. The smaller decline in volume relative to the first three quarters of the year supports our view that many of our markets appear to be stabilizing. Operating profit increased $38 million in the quarter due to a favorable price-commodity relationship as we continued to recover the significant inflation that we have experienced over the past two years and due to our continued efforts to drive efficiencies across our operations. Operating profit margin improved 230 basis points to 14.5%.', 'With our strong execution, our earnings per share for the quarter increased 28% to $0.83 per share. Turning to our segments, plumbing sales were in line with the prior year in local currency with lower volumes being offset by favorable pricing and our acquisition. Plumbing performance in the quarter was led by Delta Faucet’s mid-single digit sales growth driven by strong performance in the wholesale channel. International plumbing performed better than expected in the fourth quarter as demand in Europe and China, while still challenged, appears to be stabilizing. Investments in our leading global plumbing brands, innovative products and customer service are producing results, and we will continue to capitalize on these initiatives. Turning to our decorative architectural segment, sales declined 7% primarily due to a soft DIY paint market, with DIY paint sales declining high single digits.', 'While our propane business declined slightly in the quarter, we are very pleased with our three-year pro paint stacked comp of approximately 60%. This significant growth and share gain demonstrates the strength of our Behr brand and the quality of our products that continue to resonate with pro painters. We will continue to invest in this business to expand our services and build upon our successful collaboration with Home Depot to capitalize on the large opportunity in the pro paint market. Now let’s review our full year performance. Please turn to Slide 6. Masco executed extremely well in 2023 and improved nearly every operating metric for the full year. Gross margin improved 360 basis points to 35.2%. Operating margin expanded 120 basis points to 16.8%.', 'Plumbing margin expanded 210 basis points to 18%. Decorative margin expanded 10 basis points to 17.8%. Earnings per share grew 2% to $3.86 per share, up from $3.77 per share in 2022. We delivered a return on invested capital of 36% and our free cash flow conversion was approximately 122%, which allowed us to return $610 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases in 2023, and to complete the bolt-on acquisition of Sauna360 for approximately $136 million. Importantly, we have achieved compound annual earnings per share growth of 14% from 2019 to 2023, delivering on our commitment of double-digit EPS growth through cycles and demonstrating the power of our brands, innovation, and portfolio of lower ticket repair and remodel-oriented products.', 'I want to thank all our employees for their strong execution, focus on the customer, and their continuous improvement mindset that delivered this tremendous performance. Turning to Slide 7, as we look to the future, we are well positioned to achieve strong profitable growth over the next few years through top line growth, market share gains, margin expansion, and disciplined capital deployment. Our current market assumptions for 2024 are as follows. For the North American repair and remodel market, we expect the market to be flat to down low single digits. For our international markets, we expect the markets in aggregate to be down low to mid single digits. For the paint market, we expect the DIY paint market to be down low single digits and the pro paint market to increase low single digits.', 'We expect to outperform the market and for Masco’s overall sales to be approximately flat in 2024. Despite this flat top line assumption, we will continue to improve margins through disciplined pricing, selective cost reductions, innovative product introductions, and operational efficiencies across our business. This margin expansion will not be without its challenges as freight and shipping costs have recently increased, other commodity inputs remain elevated, and other costs such as people-related expenses and insurance are increasing. We are up for the challenge and have demonstrated our ability to execute in dynamic times. We expect to deliver increased plumbing margins of approximately 18.5% and decorative margins of approximately 18% in 2024, resulting in a Masco operating margin of approximately 17%.', 'Turning to capital allocation, our strategy remains unchanged. Firstly, we will reinvest in our business to maintain and grow our leadership positions and win in the marketplace. This includes continuing to invest in our growth initiatives such as growing our share in the domestic plumbing wholesale channel, continuing to expand our international plumbing share, and continuing to gain share in pro paint. It also includes investing in our facilities to ensure we have the capacity to support future growth by completing our European faucet and shower facility and our midwestern paint manufacturing and distribution center. Secondly, our capital allocation strategy is to maintain a strong investment-grade balance sheet with gross debt to EBITDA levels of below 2.5 times.', 'Our balance sheet remains extremely strong with gross debt to EBITDA of 2 times at year-end. Thirdly, we have a targeted dividend payout ratio of 30%. I’m pleased to share that our Board declared a 2% increase in our dividend for 2024, which will bring our annual dividend to $1.16 per share and marks the 11th consecutive annual increase. Fourth and finally, we expect strong free cash flow conversion in 2024 of approximately 90% and will deploy that free cash flow after dividends through share repurchases or acquisitions. Based on our projected free cash flow, we expect to deploy approximately $600 million through share repurchases or acquisitions in 2024. Our M&A strategy has not changed. We continue to review and selectively pursue opportunities that have the right strategic fit and the right return for Masco with the goal of adding 1% to 3% top line growth through acquisitions annually.', 'Based on our expected operating performance and capital deployment actions, we anticipate earnings per share for 2024 to be in the range of $4 to $4.25 per share. Now looking out over the next three years, we will continue our strong execution and deliver margin expansion through 2026. For our plumbing segment, with our industry-leading brands including Delta and Hansgrohe, we expect to expand margins to 20% in 2026, up from 18% in 2023. For our decorative segment, led by our industry-leading Behr brand, we expect to achieve margins of 19% to 20% in 2026, up from 17.8% in 2023. This would result in overall Masco operating profit margins of approximately 18.5% in 2026. We believe we can achieve these margins with normalized 3% to 5% repair and remodel industry growth in ’25 and ’26 through leveraging incremental volume, exercising pricing discipline, and executing operational improvements.', 'While 2023 clearly saw a reduction in demand, we believe that our markets will stabilize in 2024 and return to typical growth rates in 2025 and 2026. Structural factors are supportive of increased repair and remodel activity in several ways. Many homeowners have taken advantage of low mortgage rates and are likely to remain in their homes longer. 1.7 million more homes will reach the prime remodeling ages of 20 to 39 years old over the next three years, and home equity levels remain high. All of these structural forces provide tailwinds for our business and increase our confidence for a strong repair and remodel market. We will continue to invest in our brands, capabilities and people to outperform the competition in both the near and long term.', 'With favorable fundamentals and our continued focus on executing our growth strategy, together with our strong free cash flow and capital deployment, Masco is well positioned to continue to drive shareholder value over the long term. Now I’ll turn the call over to Rick to go over our fourth quarter, full year and 2024 outlook in more detail. Rick?', 'Richard Westenberg: Thank you Keith, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining. As many of you know, I joined Masco as the CFO in mid-October. I’m excited to be part of this strong performing company and team and I’m happy to be sharing our results with you this morning. As Renee mentioned, my comments today will focus on adjusted performance excluding the impact of rationalization charges and other one-time items. Turning to Slide 9, sales in the quarter decreased 2%, or 3% excluding favorable currency impacts. In local currency, North American sales decreased 3%, or 4% excluding acquisition. In local currency, international sales decreased 3%. We continued to drive operational efficiency and price-cost performance in the quarter, which helped lead to gross margin expansion of 560 basis points to 35.1%.', 'SG&A as a percent of sales was 20.6% and was impacted by higher employee-related costs such as incentive compensation. Our operating profit grew 16% in the quarter and margin expanded 230 basis points to 14.5%. This strong operating profit and margin performance was due to pricing actions, lower commodity and freight costs, and cost savings initiatives partially offset by lower volume and higher employee-related expenses. This resulted in EPS growth of 28% to $0.83 per share. Turning to the full year 2023, sales decreased 8% over the prior year, slightly better than our expectations given sales performance in our plumbing segment. FX and acquisitions did not have a material impact on full-year results. In local currency, North American sales decreased 9% and international sales decreased 6%.', 'SG&A as a percent of sales was 18.4%, in line with more normalized levels. Operating profit for the full year was $1.3 billion and operating margin expanded 120 basis points to 16.8%. Lastly, our EPS increased 2% year-over-year to $3.86. This figure assumes a tax rate of 24.5% versus the previously guided 24%, which unfavorably impacted full year EPS by $0.03. Turning to Slide 10, plumbing sales in the fourth quarter increased 1% and showed signs of stabilization. Lower volume and mix decreased sales by 4%. This was more than offset by favorable pricing of 2%, the impact of acquisitions of 2%, and FX of 1%. In local currency, North American plumbing sales increased 1%, however decreased 1% excluding acquisition. In local currency, international plumbing sales decreased 3% as demand continued to be soft in Europe and in China.', 'Segment operating profit in the fourth quarter was up $50 million or 34% year-over-year, and operating margin expanded 400 basis points to 16.4%. This operating profit improvement was driven by pricing actions, lower commodity and freight costs, and cost savings initiatives, partially offset by lower volume and higher employee-related expenses. Turning to the full year 2023, plumbing sales decreased 8%, slightly better than our expectations. Lower volume and mix decreased sales by 12%, partially offset by net pricing which favorably impacted sales by 4%. Acquisitions had a favorable impact of 1% and FX was immaterial for the full year. In local currency, North American plumbing sales decreased 8% net of the 1% impact from acquisitions, and international plumbing sales decreased 6%.', 'Full year operating profit increased 4% and margin expanded 210 basis points to 18%. Turning to Slide 11, decorative architectural sales decreased 7% for the fourth quarter. Paint sales declined mid-single digits with pro paint sales down slightly against a mid-single digit comp in the fourth quarter of 2022. Operating profit was $100 million, in line with 2022 performance, and operating margin expanded 90 basis points to 14.8%. Operating profit was impacted by lower volumes and pricing offset by cost savings initiatives and lower material costs. As expected, we did experience relief in certain paint input costs with modest low single digit deflation in the fourth quarter. Turning to the full year 2023, sales decreased 9% driven by high single-digit declines in our DIY paint business and a mid-single digit decline in our pro paint business.', 'This performance was in line with the expectations we set at the beginning of 2023 as we cycled over 25% pro paint growth in 2022. Additionally, over a three-year period, pro paint sales have grown by over 60%, demonstrating our ability to gain and retain share. Full year operating income was $557 million in the segment, and operating margin expanded 10 basis points to 17.8%. Turning to Slide 12, our year-end balance sheet was strong with gross debt to EBITDA at two times. We ended the quarter with $1.6 billion of liquidity, including cash and availability under our revolving credit facility. Working capital improved by six days to 59 days, or 16% of sales. With this improvement in working capital, our adjusted free cash flow for the year was $1.1 billion, an improvement of over $500 million compared to the prior year, driving our free cash flow conversion to 122%.', 'Given our strong cash performance, we were able to return $610 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, including the repurchase of $227 million of stock in the fourth quarter. Now let’s turn to Slide 13 and review our outlook for 2024. For Masco overall, we expect 2024 sales to be flat but with operating margin growing to approximately 17%. Currency is projected to have minimal impact in our 2024 results. We will continue to invest in our business for future growth while also maintaining cost discipline. As a result, we expect SG&A as a percent of sales to be in the range of 18% to 18.5% in 2024. As always, we will take appropriate actions to address our costs as the year develops, based on market conditions. As we think about the cadence for the year, we expect sales to be down slightly in the first half of the year with modest growth in the back half of the year.', 'Also as it relates to operating margin, with the softer sales outlook in the first half of the year, we anticipate Masco margins will be roughly flat in the first half of the year with expansion expected in the second half. In our plumbing segment, we expect 2024 full year sales to be plus or minus low single digits. We anticipate the full year plumbing margin will be approximately 18.5%, up from our 2023 margin of 18%. Margin expansion will primarily be driven by pricing discipline, operational efficiency, and continued cost savings initiatives. In our decorative architectural segment, we expect 2024 sales to also be plus or minus low single digits. Looking specifically at our paint business in 2024, we anticipate our DIY business to decrease low single digits and our pro paint business to increase low single digits.', 'We anticipate the full year decorative architectural margin to be approximately 18%, up from our 2023 margin of 17.8% driven by cost savings initiatives. With regards to capital allocation, we expect to reinvest approximately $200 million through capital expenditures, pay a dividend of $0.29 per share per quarter, and deploy approximately $600 million towards share repurchases or acquisitions in 2024. Finally, as Keith mentioned earlier, our 2024 EPS estimate is $4 to $4.25. This assumes a $221 million average diluted share count for the year and a 24.5% effective tax rate, which is consistent with our 2023 effective tax rate. Additional financial assumptions for 2024 can be found on Slide 16 of our earnings deck. With that, I’d like to open the call for questions.', 'Operator?', 'See also 25 Largest Economies in the World in 2024 and 10 Best Augmented Reality Stocks Under $5.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

Doug?', ""Doug Peterson: Thank you, Mark. 2023 was an exciting year for S&P Global a year of innovation and growth. Our results in 2023 serve as a testament to strong execution and S&P Global's unique position at the center of the global markets. Excluding Engineering Solutions which was divested in the second quarter of last year revenue increased 8% year-over-year. We expanded adjusted operating margins by almost 300 basis points year-over-year in the fourth quarter to finish the year with approximately 100 basis points of margin expansion and we surpassed our $600 million target for cost synergies by $19 million. We delivered adjusted EPS growth of 13% to come into the high end of our guidance range as we continue to benefit from strong revenue growth, disciplined expense management and a commitment to strong capital returns."", ""On the topic of capital returns, 2023 marked the 50th consecutive year that S&P Global has increased its cash dividend and we've already announced the Board approval to make 2024 the 51st. In 2023 we returned $4.4 billion to shareholders through dividends and buybacks, representing more than 100% of our adjusted free cash flow. In addition to strong financial performance, we created a formal artificial intelligence leadership team in 2023, which we'll discuss in more detail shortly. We also delivered double-digit growth and significant innovation in key strategic investment areas. Private market solutions and sustainability and energy transition both delivered double-digit growth in 2023 and we're well positioned to continue growing in these important areas in 2024."", 'Our Vitality Index which we target to remain at or above 10% of company revenue actually exceeded 11% in 2023 and also increased at a double-digit rate. In 2023, we delivered key wins in each of the five strategic pillars we introduced at the end of 2022. We look forward to accelerating that success in 2024 and continuing our track record of creating value for our customers and our shareholders. We know that our success depends on creating value for our customers and we delivered for them in 2023. We improved customer retention rates in several of our divisions last year while continuing to introduce new products and features more quickly and more frequently. Through deep engagement with customers around the world, tens of thousands of customer touch points, we saw continued adoption of enterprise contracts in Market Intelligence and acceleration of enterprise agreements in Commodity Insights.', ""We know that certain customer verticals, particularly Financial Services and regional base had unique challenges in 2023. While we discussed longer sales cycles through 2023, we were able to keep our sales pipeline moving and continue to demonstrate value for our customers even in challenging times. As we look to 2024, we continue to see macroeconomic market and geopolitical challenges. Our customers need unique and differentiated data sets and key insights for the markets they serve, which means our role as a trusted and strategic partner is more important than ever. Now nearly two years after the merger, we've put the work of operational integration behind us. And we have fully turned to the exciting work of growth, innovation and execution."", ""We remain committed to balancing margin expansion with strategic initiatives and long-term growth. We will also look for ways to optimize our portfolio of products and services. With the merger integration behind us, we plan to continue reviewing and optimizing our portfolio of assets to meet our customers' needs either through tuck-in acquisitions or potentially further divestitures as you've seen us do historically. Turning to the 2023 issuance environment. We saw strong growth in billed issuance in 2023, particularly in the second half. In the fourth quarter, we continued to see issuers returning to the market, with billed issuance growth driven primarily by strength in bank loans, structured finance and high yield. This contributed to a successful rebound for the full year 2023, with billed issuance increasing 8%."", ""Turning to Vitality. We're pleased to see the continued outperformance in our index to close out 2023. As we shared with you when we introduced this metric a little over a year ago, our goal is to make sure at least 10% of our revenue comes from new or enhanced products each year. As products mature, they'll naturally age out of the Vitality Index, even if they continue to grow rapidly. But we remain committed to that 10% target, as a steady stream of innovation takes the place of any products that graduate from the index. We view the Vitality Index as a direct measure of the value our customers are realizing from the improvements we're making in our products and services each year. With 18% growth in revenue from Vitality products in 2023, we ended the year with more than 11% of our total revenue coming from these new offerings."", ""This is an incredible achievement by our product development and commercial teams, as they not only build great products and features in 2023, but also make sure our customers were aware and equipped to benefit from the innovation we are bringing to the table. Across divisions, we've seen new products in 2023 that demonstrate our commitment to powering global markets in a world of rapidly evolving technology. First, in another compelling example of our cross-divisional development between Market Intelligence and Commodity Insights, we launched our Power Evaluator tool. It's already received great feedback from power utility market participants. Additionally, in Commodity Insights, we combined the most powerful features of two leading commodity platforms, Platts Dimensions Pro and IHS Connect to create Platts Connect, which we believe is the market's most holistic source of data insights and tools custom-built for commodity market participants."", ""In Market Intelligence, we also significantly enhanced Capital IQ Pro. June saw the release of one of the largest and most important updates in years. And we're thrilled with the preliminary release of our new generative AI solution ChatIQ to a set of pilot customers in December. We're excited for more customers to get access to these proprietary tools as 2024 progresses. We also launched powerful new tools with our new supplier risk indicator and Entity Insights offerings. In Ratings, we continue to deliver assessments and insights to help market participants evaluate different assets. And we leveraged our expertise in blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies to launch the first stablecoin stability assessment in late 2023. 2023 saw the launch of several new indices as well, including the S&P B3 corporate bond index in Brazil, multiple cross-asset indices and new sector, factor and thematic indices that we believe will contribute to strong growth in the years to come."", ""As we mentioned last quarter, we want to provide an update on our AI strategy. We've elevated the focus on artificial intelligence to make sure we have executive leadership, governance and sponsorship at the enterprise level. In late 2023, we announced internally that our former Chief Information Officer, Swamy Kocherlakota would take on the new role as Chief Digital Solutions Officer, including executive sponsorship of AI and Kensho. Bhavesh Dayalji, CEO of Kensho has expanded his role to now lead cross-divisional AI initiatives as our first Chief Artificial Intelligence Officer. These changes to our leadership structure around technology and especially around AI are the next logical steps in the commitment to AI that began with our initial investment in Kensho nearly seven years ago."", ""As part of this strategy, we've developed an AI accelerator to fast-track high-priority AI initiatives and build common capabilities that can be deployed and used by teams across the enterprise. There are four important ways that we expect our AI to impact our performance. First, through the development of new products and services; second, leveraging Kensho to accelerate and automate manual processes and data operations; third, amplifying the productivity of our internal experts, freeing up more capacity for higher order work; and fourth, embedding AI functionality in existing products to increase customer value and improve user experience. We're committed to keeping you informed about these initiatives. So we've launched a new AI page on our public website, spglobal.ai, which includes important research, our key thought leadership and insights into our developments."", ""At S&P Global, we have a strategic vision of the importance of AI to our industry and the world going forward as we believe that AI will quickly become embedded in everything we do. And we have a framework to deliver the best capabilities in as many products as we can and by extension into the hands of as many customers as we can as fast as we can. Fortunately S&P Global starts with some of the most powerful proprietary data sets in the world sourced from all five divisions. Our proprietary data layer is a key differentiator that we believe sets us apart. As we've outlined for you in the past we remain committed to sound governance, protecting this proprietary data and preventing third parties for monetizing or commercializing our data independently."", ""A challenge that even data-rich companies will face is that much of this data isn't ready to be ingested or used by large language models. The data requires traditional machine learning preprocessing, things like data cleaning, data transformation, data reduction and data integration, but it also requires tokenization and tagging, which can be very resource-intensive. This is the Kensho layer. The proprietary tools developed over the last several years by the teams at Kensho automate much of the preprocessing work for both structured data like financial reports, but also unstructured data like the transcript from this very earnings call. Tools like Scribe, NERD, Link, Extract and Classify do much of this heavy lifting and allow our proprietary data to be leveraged more easily and update it more quickly and frequently."", ""This leads to the third element of our framework; the open ecosystem. As we've shared with you before we aren't dependent on any individual technology partner. Having so much AI expertise in-house, means that we can leverage infrastructure and compute platforms from multiple hyperscale cloud providers, third-party LLMs, our own proprietary LLMs and a wide array of other vendors without having to lock ourselves in or cede economics to one ecosystem or another. Ultimately, the goal is to have generative and traditional AI capabilities embedded everywhere that makes sense. We'll track our progress through improving customer win rates, retention rates, price and ultimately growth. It should also show up in our own workflows to improve productivity and efficiency, improving our unit economics and our operating margins over time."", ""We're excited about the significant progress we've made in 2023 and even more excited about what this company will accomplish in 2024 and beyond. Our innovation also extends to the efforts we make to develop our people and improve our communities. In 2023, we held an internal event called Accelerate Progress Live to reinforce our commitment to our teams around the world and highlight our purpose and values as a global employer of choice. We provide dedicated time for our people to pursue volunteer opportunities. We saw an 89% increase in the number of S&P Global people who took advantage of these programs in 2023. And as more of our people return to our offices around the world our global people resource groups saw a nearly 50% increase in engagement."", ""We also demonstrated our commitment to continuously improve our reporting and transparency around our sustainability and related initiatives. In 2023, we published our 12th Annual Impact Report and our fifth Annual TCFD Report. We also published our first-ever Diversity Equity and Inclusion Report, taking much of the information that we've been reporting for years enhancing our disclosures, and making that information more accessible in a dedicated report. We're very pleased that our efforts have been recognized by many external organizations in the last year. S&P Global has iconic global brands and is well known as a desirable destination for highly skilled professionals around the world. We look forward to building upon that hard-won reputation in 2024."", ""Turning to our financial results. Ewout will walk through the fourth quarter results in more detail in a moment, but the headline numbers tell a strong story for 2023. We're pleased to see accelerating growth and margin expansion in almost every division in 2023. The 2023 results and the 2024 guidance, we're introducing today give us confidence in our trajectory towards the growth and margin targets we introduced at our 2022 Investor Day. As we approach the two-year anniversary of the merger, we can definitively say it has been a success. In the last two years, not only have we brought together two world-class organizations but we've delivered through a challenging period against our aspirational and ambitious targets. We integrated major software systems in record time and consolidated our offices around the world."", ""We're able to close many of our data centers due in part to a transformational partnership with AWS. We've maintained a disciplined approach to managing our product portfolio. And we demonstrated this commitment through the divestiture of Engineering Solutions and the aftersales business in our Mobility division and also through the decommissioning of a number of low-margin or slower-growth products. Lastly, since the merger closed we've returned $17.5 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We initially set a target of $480 million in cost synergies then raised that target to $600 million and have now exceeded that higher target by $19 million. We're ahead of schedule on our revenue synergies to date and we'll continue to report our progress there."", ""Lastly, we told you when the merger closed that we believed it would be accretive to adjusted EPS by 2023 and I'm pleased to confirm that we have delivered. Both our internal analysis and independent external analysis indicate that in 2023 we delivered higher adjusted EPS than we likely would have generated with S&P Global as a standalone company. I'm thrilled to be able to call the merger a success and to move forward to powering global markets as one company. Now, I'll turn to Ewout to review the financial results. Ewout?"", ""Ewout Steenbergen: Thank you, Doug. We closed the year with strong fourth quarter performance overall as we saw growth across all five of our divisions. Adjusted earnings per share increased 23% year-over-year. Reported revenue grew 7% in the fourth quarter, but excluding the impact of the Engineering Solutions divestiture, and the small tuck-ins done earlier this year revenue growth was 11%. We also expanded adjusted margins by nearly 300 basis points and reduced our fully diluted share count by 3%. Moving to our strategic investment areas. I'm pleased to report, we saw growth across all categories. Sustainability and energy transition revenue grew 17% to $84 million in the quarter driven by strong demand for our energy transition products and benchmark offerings."", ""Sustainability and energy transition's full year revenue grew 24% to approximately $301 million. As we introduce more products and continue to innovate in the space we remain committed to this important growth driver for the business. Moving to Private market solutions. We saw revenue increase by 18% year-over-year to $113 million driven by strong growth in Ratings private market revenue as improved market conditions increased bank loan issuance, private credit estimates and MI's software solutions. As we progress towards our goal of $600 million of private market solutions revenue by 2026, I'm pleased to report full year revenue grew 10% to $430 million for 2023. Vitality revenue, which is the revenue generated by innovation through new or enhanced products from across the organization was $380 million in the fourth quarter, representing a 19% increase compared to the prior year."", ""Importantly, Vitality revenue represented 12% of our total revenue in the quarter again surpassing our index target of at least 10%. Now turning to synergies. As Doug mentioned earlier, we have completed our cost synergy program associated with the merger and outperformed our stated targets. In the fourth quarter of 2023, we recognized $156 million of expense savings due to cost synergies. And our annualized run rate exiting the year was $619 million exceeding our goal of $600 million. For the full year, we recognized $581 million in cost savings from synergies. We had been targeting 85% of total cost synergies realized in 2023 and I'm pleased to see that we not only achieved that target but that we surpassed it by more than $70 million. We continue to make progress on our revenue synergies as well, with $40 million in synergies achieved in the fourth quarter and an annualized run rate of $152 million exiting the year."", 'Now turning to expenses. Our total expenses grew approximately 2% in the fourth quarter, primarily driven by increases in our core and investment growth areas and compensation expenses, which were partially offset by benefits associated with the Engineering Solutions divestiture and cost synergies. On core and investment growth, we continue to make the necessary investments in our strategic initiatives, which includes hiring the right people for key roles and investing in new and existing avenues of growth for our businesses. Within compensation there are two factors I would like to call out. First, our salary expenses remained elevated due to hiring activity and inflationary pressures throughout 2023. Second, our benefit costs were higher due to finalization of benefits realignment of IHS Markit employees in the fourth quarter.', ""As we go through the divisions you will see these factors impacting expenses and margins this quarter, particularly in Market Intelligence and Mobility. This drove slightly higher expense growth than we were expecting but total adjusted expenses still grew only 2% year-over-year in the fourth quarter while revenue increased 7%. Now let's turn to the division results. Market Intelligence revenue increased 9%, driven by strong growth in Data & Advisory Solutions and Enterprise Solutions. Desktop accelerated to 7% growth in the fourth quarter as continued product innovation, introduction of new content sets and improvements to speed and performance supported strong subscription growth. Data & Advisory Solutions and Enterprise Solutions grew 8% and 10% respectively."", 'Both benefited from double-digit growth in subscription-based offerings. Credit & Risk Solutions grew 10% in the fourth quarter supported by strong new sales and price realization. While renewal rates remain strong overall for MI, we did see slightly elevated cancellations in the fourth quarter, as customers particularly in the financial services vertical continue to see some budgetary constraints. Combined with the modest softness in non-recurring revenue, this resulted in total revenue for MI slightly below our expectations though we continue to see accelerating growth for the division in the fourth quarter. Adjusted expenses increased 4% year-over-year, primarily due to higher compensation expense an increase in royalties and data costs, partially offset by cost synergies.', 'Operating profit increased 18% and the operating margin increased 280 basis points to 34.2%. For full year 2023 margins improved by 120 basis points to 33%. The margin results are below our guidance range and are a result of a combination of an admittedly strong topline falling short of our expectations and expenses being slightly higher due to the reasons I mentioned. Now, turning to Ratings. In the fourth quarter we saw refinancing activity drive issuance as improving market conditions reduced borrowing costs and macroeconomic indicators gave issuers comfort coming to the market even in December, which is historically a very quiet month for debt issuance. Revenue increased 19% year-over-year exceeding our internal expectations. Transaction revenue grew 35% in the fourth quarter as heightened refinancing activity increased bank loan and high-yield issuance.', 'Non-transaction revenue increased 10% primarily due to an increase in annual and program fees and growth at CRISIL. Adjusted expenses increased 6% driven by higher compensation, which includes hiring associated with growth initiatives at CRISIL and higher incentives due to financial performance. This resulted in a 32% increase in operating profit and an impressive 540 basis point increase in operating margin to 53.4%. For the full year 2023 margins increased by 60 basis points to 56.5%. And now turning to Commodity Insights. Revenue growth increased 10% following a third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in both Price Assessments and Energy & Resources Data & Insights. Upstream Data & Insights revenue grew by approximately 3% year-over-year benefiting from strong demand for software product offerings as well as significant improvement in retention rates.', 'The business line continues to prioritize growth in its subscription base. Price Assessments and Energy & Resources Data & Insights grew 12% and 13% respectively. Growth was driven by continued strength in our benchmark data and insights products. Both business lines continue to see robust subscription sales driven by strong commercial momentum and enhanced value being delivered to customers. Advisory & Transactional Services revenue grew 8% driven by strong trading volumes across all sectors in Global Trading Services and strength in energy transition-related product offerings. These market-driven volumes helped GTS deliver its strongest quarter of 2023. Adjusted expenses increased 10%, primarily driven by higher compensation and continued investment in growth initiatives, partially offset by cost synergies.', ""Operating profit for Commodity Insights increased 10% and operating margin contracted 20 basis points to 44.4%. There are a few factors I would like to call out that contributed to CI's very modest margin contraction in the fourth quarter. In addition to the compensation drivers I mentioned earlier, we saw an increase in performance-related compensation due to the topline outperformance. We remain very confident in the growth opportunities for Commodity Insights and also wanted to make sure we continue to adequately invest to capture those opportunities. Trailing 12-month margin, which we believe is the best way to assess the performance of our divisions increased by 180 basis points to 46.1% in 2023. In our Mobility division, revenue increased 9% year-over-year."", 'The dealer segment marked its fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, while manufacturing and financials and other continued to deliver solid results. Dealer revenue increased 14% year-over-year driven by the continued benefit of price realization within the last year and new store growth particularly in CARFAX for Life as well as the addition of Market Scan. Manufacturing grew 2% year-over-year, driven by planning solutions and marketing solutions. Financials and other increased 5% as the business line benefited from strong underwriting volumes and price increases. Adjusted expenses increased 10% driven primarily by higher compensation due to the benefits alignment already mentioned and also due in part to higher commissions related to revenue outperformance in our OEM and dealer businesses.', 'We also incurred some inorganic expense growth on the Market Scan acquisition. In aggregate these drivers resulted in an 8% increase in adjusted operating profit and 30 basis points of operating margin contraction year-over-year in the fourth quarter. For full year 2023, margins contracted 20 basis points to 38.8%. Now turning to S&P Dow Jones Indices. Revenue increased 5% primarily due to strong growth in exchange-traded derivatives revenue and new business activities within Data & Custom Subscriptions. Revenue associated with asset-linked fees were relatively flat in the fourth quarter. This was driven by higher ETF AUM, which benefits from both market appreciation and net inflows leading to higher ETF fees and declines in OTC products. Exchange-traded derivatives revenue grew 22% primarily driven by strong volumes in SPX and fixed products and strong price realization.', ""Data & Custom Subscriptions increased 4% year-over-year, driven by continued strength in end-of-day contract growth. During the quarter, expenses decreased 6% year-over-year, primarily driven by lower outside services and incentive expenses. Operating profit in Indices increased 11% and the operating margin increased 390 basis points to 66.1%. For the full year 2023, margins expanded 50 basis points to 68.9%. As we reflect on 2023 as a whole, I'm incredibly proud about the many things we're able to accomplish. We returned more than 100% of adjusted free cash flow to shareholders. We also continue to make the right investments in our strategy, allocating approximately $140 million to the enterprise initiatives that we have discussed with you."", ""And we are encouraged by the fact that approximately 10% of the company's revenue growth came from those initiatives in 2023. On an inorganic basis, we executed a disciplined M&A strategy with tactical acquisitions immediately adding value to the enterprise. The optimization of our capital and liquidity structure completed earlier in the year provided $750 million of capital. Due to the prudent and strategic application of rate swaps we're able to execute that debt issuance in a rising rate environment, while avoiding an increase in our average cost of capital. With a team that can deliver impressive accomplishments like these in 2023, I'm confident this will continue under the leadership of the future CFO of S&P Global. Now, I'll turn it back to Doug to cover the 2024 outlook."", ""Doug Peterson: Thank you, Ewout. We're updating our outlook to reflect our economists' view of the most important economic and market factors that will impact 2024. While this isn't meant to be an exhaustive list, these are some of the key factors we'll be tracking this year. We're currently expecting a soft landing scenario with a base case assumption that we avoid a global recession. So we expect geopolitical uncertainty to persist. We also expect energy transition and higher interest rates to remain factors. For the equity markets, we expect the secular tailwind that flows from active to passive management to continue. Though changes to market volatility can impact our ETD business and Indices and fluctuations in asset prices will have a lagged, but potentially meaningful impact on our asset-linked fees revenue, early signs in 2024 indicate market optimism with the market currently pricing in multiple rate cuts in 2024."", ""The timing of these potential cuts is unpredictable, but we expect the issuance environment to be stronger in the first half of the year than the back half. We expect continued focus on energy transition in the commodity markets with volatility in the evolving regulatory landscape having the potential to impact our results this year. Our financial guidance assumes global GDP growth of 2.8%, US inflation of 2.4% at an average price for Brent crude of $83 per barrel. We're also forecasting billed issuance growth in the range of 3% to 7% in 2024, with stronger growth expected in the first half. While we've included a market issuance forecast in the past, we will only report on billed issuance going forward, when discussing our outlook for our financial performance, as it historically has been a better indicator of our revenue growth and aligns with our monthly disclosures."", ""Turning to our most recent refinancing study. When we compare these refinancing walls to last year's study, we see that current year maturities, meaning 2024 maturities now compared to 2023 maturities measured at this time last year are more than 10% higher than they were at this point last year. The maturities expected over the next two and three-year periods are more than 12% higher. While we can't be certain how the higher rate environment will impact these maturities or issuers' likelihood to delever, we're confident that this puts us in a strong position to achieve the Ratings revenue targets we're outlining today for 2024. Now, turning to our initial guidance for 2024. This slide illustrates our initial guidance for GAAP results. For our adjusted guidance, we're expecting revenue growth in the range of 5.5% to 7.5%, driven by strong growth in all five divisions."", ""We expect organic revenue growth excluding the impact of 2023 divestitures in the range of 7% to 9%. We expect to deliver at least 100 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion in 2024. This will require us to maintain discipline around expenses and productivity, while ensuring that we are making the necessary investments to drive growth and innovation in vital strategic areas like generative AI, sustainability, energy transition and private markets. We expect to deliver adjusted EPS for the full year in the range of $13.75 to $14, which represents double-digit growth at the midpoint. It's important to note that our expected adjusted tax rate is nearly two percentage points higher in 2024 than in 2023. If our tax rate were to remain unchanged from 2023, we would expect adjusted EPS growth approximately two to three percentage points higher, consistent with the low to mid-teens growth rate we pointed to for 2025, 2026 at our Investor Day."", ""As you saw in our supplemental materials earlier this morning, we also expect adjusted free cash flow excluding certain items of approximately $4.4 billion. We expect growth in adjusted free cash flow to be driven primarily by strong growth in revenue and profitability though free cash flow growth will be tempered somewhat by the timing of working capital items and the full year impact of the $750 million debt offering completed in the third quarter of 2023. With the geopolitical, macroeconomic and market risk and opportunities, we've discussed on this call we expect that the financial outlook we've provided today likely has more upside risk than downside. And you can count on our focus determination and discipline over the coming year. Our outlook for 2024 calls for further acceleration in revenue growth compared to 2023, and continued margin expansion even though we will no longer have the benefit of the vast majority of our cost synergy actions going forward."", 'Our financial outlook for 2024 illustrates our continued progress toward the targets we outlined at our Investor Day just over a year ago and we remain committed to those targets. Moving to our division outlook. For Market Intelligence, we expect revenue growth in the range of 6% to 7.5% with expected growth to be slightly higher in the back half than in the first half of the year. We expect adjusted operating margins in the range of 33.5% to 34.5%, as we continue to invest in key growth initiatives while maintaining rigorous discipline around expenses. For Ratings, we expect revenue growth in the range of 6% to 8% driven by billed issuance growth of 3% to 7%. We expect revenue growth rates to be stronger in the first half of the year than the second half as comparisons are easier in the first half.', 'We expect some level of pull forward given the uncertainty around the timing of any potential rate actions by central banks. We expect adjusted operating margins in the range of 57.5% to 58.5%. For Commodity Insights, we expect revenue growth in the range of 8% to 9.5% and adjusted operating margins of 46.5% to 47.5%. For Mobility, we expect revenue growth in the range of 8.5% to 10% and adjusted operating margins of 39% to 40%. Lastly for S&P Dow Jones Indices we expect revenue growth in the range of 7% to 9% and adjusted operating margins in the range of 68.5% to 69.5%. As you saw in the press release earlier this morning, our Board has authorized the repurchase of shares totaling up to $2.4 billion, which we expect to execute throughout the year.', ""And with that, I'd like to invite Adam Kansler, President of S&P Global Market Intelligence; and Martina Cheung, President of S&P Global Ratings and Executive Lead for Sustainable1 to join us.

It also trades at a lofty 90 times trailing earnings, which is higher than its five-year average of 79.', 'Of course, Nvidia can justify these expensive multiples by sustaining its solid growth in the future, but there are cheaper options to capitalize on the AI wave as well. Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) are two attractively valued stocks that you may consider buying right now.', ""Super Micro Computer is already in red-hot form on the stock market, surging a whopping 587% in the past year and crushing Nvidia's returns by a huge margin. However, shares of the company that's known for making AI server and storage solutions continue to trade at very attractive levels despite this huge jump."", 'You can buy Super Micro stock for just 3.3 times sales right now. Buying the stock at this valuation looks like a no-brainer, not only because it is way cheaper than Nvidia, but also because it is growing at a tremendous pace.', ""Super Micro released its fiscal 2024 second-quarter results (for the three months ended Dec. 31) on Jan. 29. The company's revenue more than doubled from the year-ago period to $3.66 billion last quarter. Its non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) net income shot up from $3.26 per share in the year-ago period to $5.59 per share."", ""The company's impressive revenue and earnings growth was driven by the rapid deployment of AI servers. Super Micro has optimized its server solutions according to the requirements of AI servers, helping data center operators reduce electricity and cooling costs. Its server rack solutions are used for deploying AI chips from multiple vendors such as Nvidia, Intel, and Advanced Micro Devices."", ""The good part is that the company is witnessing terrific demand for its offerings, which is why it has been focused on enhancing its production capacity. Charles Liang, CEO of Super Micro, pointed out on the company's latest earnings conference call:"", 'Today, our production utilization rate is about 65% across our USA, Netherlands, and Taiwan facilities, and they are quickly filling. To address this immediate capacity challenge, we are adding two new production facilities and warehouses near our Silicon Valley HQ, which will be operating in a few months. The new Malaysia facility will focus on expanding our building blocks with lower costs and increased volume, while other new sites will support our annual revenue capacity above $25 billion.', ""It won't be surprising to see Super Micro eventually hitting $25 billion in annual revenue thanks to its capacity expansion moves, as demand for AI servers is expected to grow fivefold between 2023 and 2027, generating an annual revenue of $150 billion at the end of the forecast period."", 'More importantly, Super Micro is already benefiting from this solid growth in AI server demand, as its latest guidance update tells us. The company now expects to end fiscal 2024 with revenue of $14.5 billion at the midpoint of its guidance range, which would be a 106% jump over the prior year. Super Micro was earlier expecting fiscal 2024 revenue to land at $10.5 billion.', 'Assuming Super Micro does hit its annual revenue guidance and maintains its sales multiple, its market capitalization could increase to $48 billion. That would be a 50% jump from current levels, which is why investors looking to add an AI stock to their portfolios should consider acting quickly before Super Micro heads higher.', ""Share of Qualcomm have underperformed the broader market over the past year with gains of just 5%, which is not surprising, considering the mobile chipmaker's tepid financial performance."", ""Qualcomm has been weighed down by poor smartphone sales in the past year. According to market research firm IDC, smartphone shipments were down 3.2% in 2023 to 1.17 billion units. Qualcomm gets more than two-thirds of its total revenue from selling chipsets used in smartphones, so the weakness in this segment was bound to have a negative impact on the company's performance."", 'The good news for Qualcomm is that the smartphone market is set for a solid turnaround from 2024. The turnaround is already underway, with smartphone shipments rising 8.5% in the fourth quarter of 2023, outpacing the 7.3% growth that analysts were looking for.', 'Morgan Stanley is anticipating the global smartphone market to grow by 4% in 2024 and 4.4% next year. However, the pace of growth in Q4 2023 points toward better smartphone sales growth this year, with AI expected to play a central role in driving a stronger performance.', 'Counterpoint Research estimates that shipments of generative AI-powered smartphones could hit 100 million units in 2024. Annual shipments of AI-enabled smartphones are expected to hit 522 million units in 2027, clocking an annual growth rate of 83%.', 'In all, a total of 1 billion AI-powered smartphones are expected to be shipped over the next four years. Qualcomm is already on its way to capitalizing on this opportunity, with its Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chip powering AI features on Samsung\'s latest Galaxy S24 Ultra smartphone. Qualcomm\'s management pointed out on the latest earnings conference call that Samsung\'s S24 family of devices includes ""on-device AI features such as live translate interpreter, chat assist, nightography, and more.""', 'Additionally, Qualcomm has ""extended a multi-year agreement with Samsung relating to Snapdragon platforms for flagship Galaxy smartphone launches starting in 2024."" This should pave the way for Qualcomm to take advantage of the nascent AI-enabled smartphone market in the long run, considering that Samsung is the world\'s second-largest smartphone manufacturer.', ""It is worth noting that analysts have already been raising Qualcomm's revenue growth estimates of late."", ""AI could give the company an additional lift and help Qualcomm outpace analysts' expectations in the future. But even if the company hits $44 billion in annual revenue over the next couple of years and maintains its current sales multiple of 5, its market capitalization could jump to $220 billion. That would be a 39% increase over current levels."", ""However, don't be surprised to see Qualcomm stock delivering stronger gains on the back of a faster jump in its revenue. Moreover, the market may reward it with a higher sales multiple based on its AI prospects, which is why savvy investors would do well to buy the stock now."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Super Micro Computer wasn’t one of them.

If you want to skip our overview of the high technology aerospace and defense industry and how it's shaped the modern day world, you can take a look at the 5 Best Aerospace and Defense Stocks to Invest In. "", ""If there's one thing that can be said with certainty, it's that the defense and aerospace industry is one of the most important in the world when it comes to shaping power politics. Global geopolitics, and as the late Henry Kissinger would describe, 'realpolitik' is based on the cold, hard reality of military superiority. Traditionally, this superiority came in the form of strength in numbers - a concept that still holds true today."", ""However, along with this, another concept that has borne the test of time is the use of technology for warfare. Whether it's the Mongols who relied on brutal cavalry tactics, or the Ottoman use of gunpowder that made it a 'gunpowder empire', technology has shaped warfare and global power dynamics."", ""These days, the dominant and only superpower (some would even say a hyperpower) is the United States of America. The U.S., if you're unaware, has the most powerful military in the world, fueled by the greatest number of aircraft carriers for any military and an air force whose aircraft number in the thousands. Safe to say, aerospace plays a crucial role in maintaining American global military superiority, and by effect, it also shapes the global world order."", 'Powering the U.S. military behemoth, which also has the biggest defense budget in the world, are aerospace and defense stocks. These stocks are firms that either directly engage in providing the U.S. military, through the Department of Defense, with their combat or combat support equipment, or those that provide essential and tertiary capabilities such as the defense stock Planet Labs PBC (NYSE:PL) and Maxar Technologies whose advanced satellites carry the ability to remotely image any site in the world and provide military planners with invaluable information to inform their tactical and strategic decisions.', ""Technology sits at the heart of competing when it comes to defense and aerospace stocks, and a technological edge is precisely the reason that the U.S. is at the top of the global power food chain. American jets are envied by dictators and monarchs all over the world, and no matter what their public statements against the U.S. are, it wouldn't be imprudent to assume that they would give an arm and a leg (and then some) to get a taste of what American defense and aerospace stocks have to offer."", ""So what exactly do they offer? Well, let's start with one of the most well known defense and aerospace stocks in the world, the Bethesda, Maryland based aerospace firm Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT). Lockheed, if you're unaware, makes and sells fighter aircraft. While it also has other divisions, such as a space segment that aims to develop a colony on the Moon complete with a nuclear reactor in partnership with the National Aerospace and Space Administration (NASA), Lockheed Martin's bread and butter are airplanes. The firm in its current form came into being in the late 1990s as the U.S. defense industry consolidated (more on that later). Lockheed merged with Martin Marietta in 1995, after it acquired General Dynamics - perhaps one of the most consequential defense and aerospace stocks in the world."", ""That's a tall claim. So what made Martin Marietta so special? Well, the firm bought General Dynamics in 1993 -\xa0 a deal that also saw it acquire the rights to the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon. The F-16 is the most successful fighter aircraft in the world and is used by most of the world's leading air forces. Its success has defined modern day dog fighting - an art that bulky fighter jets such as the The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA)'s F-15 struggled with."", ""Lockheed has moved past dog fighting since then. For aerospace and defense stocks, the 21st century has been all about stealth. Lockheed's F-117 'Nighthawk' and the technologies used on it dominated the stealth debate for decades, and led to the development of the world's only operational fifth generation fighter aircraft, the F-22 'Raptor'. America's crown jewel, the Raptor is an air superiority fighter designed with the singular aim of ensuring that enemy fighters cannot contest the United States Air Force's control of an airspace."", 'So, as aerospace and defense stocks continue to make magic a reality, we decided to take a look at some top stocks. Among these, the notable ones are The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), TransDigm Group Incorporated (NYSE:TDG), and RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX).', 'Andrey Khachatryan/Shutterstock.com', 'Our Methodology ', 'To make our list of the best aerospace and defense stocks, we ranked the 40 most valuable aerospace and defense stocks that trade in U.S. markets by the number of hedge funds that had bought their shares in Q3 2023. Out of these, the top stocks were chosen.', 'For these aerospace and defense stocks, we used hedge fund sentiment. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.', 'Number of Q3 2023 Hedge Fund Shareholders: 27 ', 'Textron Inc. (NYSE:TXT) is a diversified aviation defense stock that sells crewed and uncrewed aircraft for military use. The firm has been doing well on the financial front as of late since it has beaten analyst EPS estimates in all four of its latest quarters.', ""By the end of last year's third quarter, 27 out of the 910 hedge funds profiled by Insider Monkey were Textron Inc. (NYSE:TXT)'s shareholders. Mario Gabelli's GAMCO Investors is the firm's biggest hedge fund shareholder through its $131 million investment."", 'Textron Inc.

I would now like to turn the conference over to Sam Rubin, LightPath’s President and Chief Executive Officer."", 'Shmuel Rubin', ""Thank you, Al, and good afternoon to everyone, and welcome to LightPath Technologies' fiscal quarter 2024 financial results conference call. Our financial results press release was issued after the market closed today and posted on our corporate website. First, I’d like to apologize for any coughing or horsey sound. My throat is still recovering from COVID I had recently. Second quarter was underscored by a key first order in our partnership with Lockheed Martin for an imaging engineered solution. The ongoing integration of Visimid acquisition and progress with customers transitioning from the use of germanium to the use of our BlackDiamond material. All these developments continue to highlight our strategic shift from a components manufacturer to a value-added solutions provider. To recap for our investors, LightPath has been transitioning in the last few years from a pure components manufacturer focused on being the lowest cost provider to value-added partner for complete solutions based on optical technologies, whose differentiators are mostly technological. Along those lines, we have been focusing on three pillars of growth: imaging solutions, such as cameras; growth in new markets, such as automotive; and growth specifically of our market share in the defense business. All of which are driven by our unique technologies and materials. All three pillars of growth tie and support our transition from a components manufacturer to a provider of engineered solutions based on our proprietary technologies. This transition began a couple of years ago, starting from customized lens assemblies, which is all what we call LighPath 2.0 through cameras solutions. The first of which was our innovative Mantis broadband infrared camera, which enables both new applications and capabilities for our customers and significant growth in that direction coming from the Visimid acquisition. Visimid Technologies, a small engineering firm based out of Dallas, Texas, does to the back end of thermal cameras what LightPath has been doing for the front end of those cameras. LightPath has been tailoring and customizing the optics for cameras based on our best optical technologies, and Visimid customizes and tailors the video processing engine and support electronics for the same cameras. Like LightPath's business model for customizing optical assemblies to be used in infrared cameras, Visimid established itself as the go-to for customized for customizing the electronics and software part of uncooled infrared cameras. In fact, we estimate has customized for Lightbox electronics and software of our Mentor schedule together would resubmit. We now extend our offering to customize imaging solutions to include wholly integrated camera modules, increasing the offering to existing customers and providing us a bigger share of those customers spent. During the second quarter, we continued the integration of visit with a focus on new products in fire, safety and defense. This acquisition, added the capability to produce end-to-end custom imaging cores and a new engineering capabilities that allow us to be involved earlier with our customers' design cycle and increase our likelihood of servicing service designs through manufacturing. We are integrating visited customers in custom imaging cores into new camera products, several of which demonstrated at the recent SHOT Show in Las Vegas and some we're working to customers with customers to develop customized solutions. All these products are utilizing spins amid unique video engine in conjunction with our optics to develop low weight, high efficiency solutions for drones, UAVs as well as industrial applications such as gas leak sensing, process control and early fire detection. Shortly after the acquisition of estimated Lockheed Martin awarded with Summit and Lightpath a major project for the design development and later on the manufacturing of a complete imaging system for a new project in the midfield division, which the award came, what will be up to $7.5 million for the development money, 4.7 million of that was already in a formal purchase order and is now part of our backlog. Okay. Interest project, Lockheed Martin is competing against another prime defense contractor to develop a new missile system at first, the development portion of this project was expected to last until 2028, at which point the end customer would decide if the production is awarded to Lockheed Martin or its competitor. However, there is significant pressure now to shorten this time line as much as possible. And as such, the decision point has recently been pulled in, and we now expect that the decision regarding the production award will be as early as 2026 to 2 years ahead of the schedule we shared during the announcement of our initial award. If Lockheed Martin is selected for the production, we expect an initial production order for around 10,000 units. Our ASP per unit is between 5,000 to $10,000. That will put the initial expected production would have been north of 50 million. That is a production order to LightPath. Additionally, the volumes for follow up production have also increased with the potential now for tens of thousands of units of units. The demand and shorten timelines for the project are being impacted by recent geopolitical escalation results so far are very positive and our customers, in fact, very confident. And so confident about the solution that they're looking to begin investing in production of the units even before an official decision is made. As such, we expect that Lightpath might start building up the production line this year already the basic infrastructure from this production line has already been prepared and paid for as part of our recent expansion of our Orlando facility and the specific equipment that will be needed is expected to be paid for by Department of Defense. Once in production, we will be delivering this assembly in volume, estimated tens of thousands of assemblies over the program lifetime. And again, with ASPs for LightPath between 5,000 to $10,000 per system with thousands of dollars per unit and tens of thousands of units expected in that program. The ultimate selection of light of Lockheed Martin Bison military would likely result in a substantial revenue opportunity for us. This is exactly the direction we've been looking to transform the Company to which the new strategy and it is now happening, look, its decision to outsource the development of such an important part of this system is due to what's due to its technical capabilities yet the decision to then further engage with us at the scales are now engaging. And the potential manufacturing of this is due to the combination of LightPath and visit with our manufacturing capabilities, capacities and most important, the ability to integrate the entire system. And while our strategy for having three pillars of growth are designed, such that we don't put all our eggs in one basket or one product for that matter. This award by a major prime with the massive potential for revenue on the manufacturing side is seen by us as a big wind tower strategy and the execution of that Foods acquisition of bismuth and our own investment in expansion in the U.S. and development of camera technologies, I could probably spend this entire call only on the specific project and activity, given that we expected to lead to tens of millions of dollars in annual revenue. But this is only one of multiple projects and multiple opportunities we have going up, all of which are in similar scales. I will talk briefly about some of the rest of it. Turning to the automotive market, as previously mentioned, our lens assembly system has already been qualified by one of the largest car companies. Since then, we have shipped samples through qualification by another large Tier one and begins a qualification process that is expected to take a few months. Last call, we shared that the first company was reevaluating their time line in light of recent changes to the EV market. While our technology is not specific to EV. We found that most of our automotive Tier one customers were looking to roll out this technology in ENZREV.s and that was their main focus at the time with dynamics of the market now changing, we expect that some of our Tier one customers will begin rolling out this technology in more traditional vehicles. We are also seeing signs from the market that automotive companies are waiting for further development in the Department of Transportation's announcement from May on every intention of mandating emergency braking system and mandating improvement on that for that technology and nighttime operation. We don't expect any major developments in the very short term, but we're still confident that this technology is going to be implemented in the automotive space and that we are one of the leaders in this technology and use case. Therefore, we will still see we will still see this as something that would lead to the same volumes we spoke about before, which are over 1 million assemblies a year for each one of the car companies with ASPs up to $50 per vehicle for LightPath. Last thing I will update on inferred materials and replacing germanium. To recap. Litepoint has developed over the years and mainly over the last two years some exclusive unique materials that can be used instead of germanium in infrared imaging systems. China announced on July fourth, export restrictions on germanium and with China being the largest exporter of this material. This has become a big deal since then. And even prior to that, actually, we've been working diligently to come with customers to have the systems redesigned use our materials instead of germanium, we even took some steps a few months ago of proactively canceling some customer orders for germanium optics to free up our capacity for making optics from these new materials. So this has paid off well with customers now fully engaged in the process and focused on redesign of their systems testing of prototypes and starting to order systems with new optics to specific examples I'd like to share. One includes our largest customer, which makes imaging devices for supporting this customer began by evaluating the use of our material in only one of their products and has recently let us know that they would like to now work with us on all their product. Another customer who is in the defense business has announced in the recent SHOT Show a new gun sight product that is using only our Black Diamond glass unit with NoJo medium and say I've even gone as far as seeing publicly for that going forward, all new products are going to be designed only with Black Diamond materials, a major win for our directions. All of this, all of these have so far been using mainly our existing BD6 materials. In December, we finally took delivery of a piece of equipment called the refrac diameter and measurement system for optical glass. This will now enable us to speed up the manufacturing readiness of some of the new materials we license from anywhere. We expect the first material BD&L fall to be formally released later this month. Bd&l four is an example of a materials that not only replaces germanium. It actually offers advantages versus germanium by having a negative thermal optic coefficient. That is the change of the optical index as a function of temperature BD&L for enables optical designers to design optical systems that are optically and passively compensated for changes in temperature. This is a big deal for airborne systems. For example, where today changes in ambient temperature at different altitudes require refocusing the cameras to compensate for this BD&L four is expected to become an important material for thermal cameras. In drones and other airborne systems variants, a large range of temperature. To conclude our shift in strategic directions beginning to show the results we were looking for both in winning some major programs and in revenue growth in that area. At the same time, our three separate areas of growth solutions, defense and automotive continue to generate multiple independent opportunities that many of them have a potential for tens of billions of dollars of new revenue tail opportunity, resulting in a healthy pipeline of large scale opportunities that any of them alone can be transformative to our business. Last, I would like to welcome Kim Carter, who joined our Board of Directors last week as an independent director replacing Leesburg. So it had retired after 25 years with the Company, I would like to thank Mr. Lee Berkeley's, diligent work over the years, and welcome Mr. Peter Kim was formerly the Chief Technology Officer from the U.S. space. Force and has retired as a two star general. Having a person as Mr. on our Board of Directors is important as we continue to move forward with our focus on becoming a systems company with a strong focus on defense. And as always, I would like to focus our importance to thank our employees and stakeholders who have continued to work diligently through the various transitions and hurdles we have endured. We see a bright future and a growing company because of their dedication, patience and hard work. Now I will return the call to our CFO, Al Miranda, to review second quarter financial results. Al?"", 'Albert Miranda', 'Thank you, Sam. You can rest your voice for a little bit.', 'Shmuel Rubin', 'Thank you.', 'Albert Miranda', ""I'd like to remind everyone that much of the information we're discussing during this call is also included in our press release issued earlier today and will be included in the 10 Q for the period. I encourage everyone to visit our website at lightpath.com. To access these documents and to see some of our new products. I will discuss some of the primary financial performance metrics and provide additional color on them to better assist assist investors in analyzing the Company. On a consolidated basis, revenue for the fiscal second quarter were $7.3 million compared to $8.5 million in the year ago period. Sales of infrared components were $3.6 million or 49% of the Company's consolidated revenue in the fiscal second quarter. Revenue from visible components was $2.7 million or 37% of revenue. Revenue from assemblies and solutions were $1 million or 13% of total Company revenue. Revenue from engineering services was 0.1 million or 1% of total Company revenue. Infrared components sales increased approximately 283,000 or 9%, primarily due to an increase in shipments against an annual contract for an international military program. This contract was also renewed during the first quarter of fiscal 2024 for a higher dollar value than in the previous year. Visible component sales decreased approximately $1.2 million or 31%. All this is primarily due to the ongoing trend in China excuse me, in the telecom industry in general this quarter, we also experienced declines in Europe due to recessionary conditions, particularly in Germany and in the U.S. due to the timing of Defense contract deliveries. Assembly Solutions revenue decreased approximately 241,000 or 20%, and that's primarily due to timing of shipments against a multi-year contract with a defense customer that was partially offset by the addition of VisaNet revenue. Gross margin in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 was approximately $2.2 million, a decrease of 1.1 million or 33% as compared to the same quarter of the prior fiscal year. Total cost of sales was approximately $5.1 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to approximately $5.2 million for the same quarter of the prior fiscal year. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue was 30% for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to 38% for the same quarter of the prior fiscal year. And the decrease in gross margin as a percentage of revenue is due to the decrease in visible component sales, which typically have higher margins than our IR components product group, which comprised a greater portion of our sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Selling general administrative costs were approximately $2.9 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2024, a decrease of approximately $172,000 or 6% as compared to approximately $3 million for the same quarter the prior fiscal year. The decrease in SG&A costs was primarily due to a decrease in stock-based compensation, partially offset by an increase in wage. The net loss for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 was approximately 1.7 million or $0.05 basic and diluted loss per share compared to 0.7 million or $0.09 basic and diluted loss per share for the same quarter of the prior fiscal year. The increase in net loss of approximately $1 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 as compared to the same quarter of the prior fiscal year was primarily due to the decrease in revenue and gross margin, partially offset by other income of approximately 190,000 from our Chinese subsidiary for the return of funds previously misappropriated by our former Chinese management team as a result of the ongoing legal proceedings. This is the last bit of activity that we expect to have related. So that situation, our EBITDA for the quarter ended December 31st, 2023 was a loss of approximately 454,000 compared to an income of 207,000 for the same quarter of the prior fiscal year. The decrease in EBITDA in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 was primarily due to lower sales and gross margin, again, partially offset by the mentioned Chinese since October. Turning to the results for the first half of fiscal 2024, revenue was $15.4 million, only a 3% decrease from $15.8 million in the same period of the prior fiscal year. Sales of infrared components were $7.4 million or 48% of the Company's consolidated revenue for the first half of fiscal 2024, revenue from visible components was 5.4 million or 35% of consolidated revenue. Revenue from assemblies and solutions were $2.2 million or 15% of the total company revenue and revenue from engineering services was $0.4 million or 2% of total Company revenue in the first half of the fiscal year, infrared components sales increased almost 1 million or 14%, primarily due to increase in shipments against an annual contract for international military programs. Visible component revenue decreased approximately 1.8 million or 25%. Again, this is primarily due to the ongoing trend in China and the telecom industry in general. However, we also experienced declines in Europe due to recessionary conditions and in the U.S. due to timing of Defense contract shipments. Assembly Solutions revenue increased approximately 150,000 or 7%, primarily due to the addition of Visy made revenue, which was partially offset by a decrease in shipments against the multiyear contract that I mentioned regarding the quarter. If I take a step back and look at Red revenue. Our visible components are declining. However, in the first half, revenue increased in infrared components, assemblies and solutions and engineering services, which aligns well with our strategic plans. As of December 31st, 2023, we had working capital of approximately $9.1 million and total cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of approximately 5.9 million, of which greater than 25% of our cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries. Cash provided by operations was approximately 851,000 for the first half of fiscal 2024 compared to cash used in operations of approximately 751,000 for the same period of the prior fiscal year. Cash provided by operations for the first half of fiscal 2024 was largely driven by a decrease in accounts receivable as sales were higher in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 than in each of the first two quarters of fiscal 2024. Cash used in operations in the first half of fiscal 2023 reflected a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities during that period, resulting from the payment of certain expenses related to previously disclosed events that occurred at our Chinese subsidiaries. Capital expenditures were approximately 1.5 million for the first half of fiscal 2024 compared to approximately 412,000 in the same period of the prior fiscal year. The spending in the first half of fiscal 2024 is largely driven by the Orlando facility expansion in excuse me, where we constructed additional tenant improvements in our Orlando facility, subject to our continuing lease of which the landlord agreed to provide $2.4 million in tenant improvement allowances. The balance of the tenant improvement cost is estimated to be $3.7 million during the first half of fiscal 2024. We expended 994,000 towards this project with the remaining estimated 380,000 expected to be expended during the second half of fiscal 2024, pending the final construction invoices, we also expended approximately 722,000 net of cash acquired to acquire VISaer made during the first half of fiscal 2024. Our total backlog at December 31st, 2023, was approximately $21.2 million, a decrease of 28% as compared to $29.4 million as of December 31st, 2022 compared to the end of fiscal 2023. Our total backlog decreased by 2% during the first half of fiscal 2024. The decrease in backlog during the first half of fiscal 2024 is primarily due to shipments of several annual and multi-year contract renewals, which orders were added to the backlog in prior periods. In the second quarter of previous years, we have typically received a contract renewal from our largest cloud customer for infrared products made of germanium. However, as previously discussed, we have decided to reduce the amount of optics we produce from germanium, both to reduce real, do reduce our risk of supply chain disruption and more importantly, to work with customers to convert their systems to use the optics made of our own Black Diamond materials. As such, in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, we did not book our typical annual renewal order for germanium optics for this customer and said, we continue to work with this customer as well as other customers converter systems to use Black Diamond optics. With this review of our financial highlights and recent developments concluded, I'll now turn the call over to the operator to begin the question-and-answer session."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Jaeson Schmidt, Lake Street.', 'Jaeson Schmidt', ""Yes, thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to start with the Lockheed program. You mentioned unit production units might begin even before the decision date. Just curious if this is something you're hearing from the customer or is this industry chatter?"", 'Shmuel Rubin', ""I guess, a combination of both both, but as you know, but directly from the customer, this is the customer is actually extremely confident in this solution and the superiority of this solution and they want us to start setting up some production lines of physical production line in Orlando, where we're going to do production in the very near future to start gearing up to this expectation is that once the decision is made, the Army will want units as soon as possible and they're willing to make some bets in that direction."", 'Jaeson Schmidt', ""Yes, Chad, no, that's certainly good to hear. And that leads me to my next question. And I know it's going to be dependent on the program, but at a high level, how should we think about your total revenue capacity now with the expansion completed in Orlando?"", 'Albert Miranda', ""Yes, exactly. As you said that the very dependent on the program, if we were to continue with the current business mix, meaning not a lot of cameras in the and mainly growth coming from infrared assemblies, then revenue capacity in Orlando before altogether would probably go to could go to as much as EUR50 million, I think or even though even below the current expansion, I think we should do 60 to 70 million. Okay. But very, very dependent on where that comes from if it's individual components, but probably less the more complicated things, the less space per dollar of revenues that they take and the more we would grow the assembly of the Lockheed, for example, or any of the cameras actually doesn't require an enormous amount of space. A lot of it is very automated calibration systems and assembly processes. And so we can probably serve this entire Lockheed program from the clean room, extra clean room space."", 'Shmuel Rubin', ""We built in Orlando and still have room to expand in other programs as well in the multi-mission, Josh, that's really helpful."", 'Jaeson Schmidt', ""And then just the last one from me and I'll jump back into queue. I know China is becoming less of a focus for you guys but just curious if you think that business has bottomed yet."", 'Albert Miranda', ""Yes, I definitely think it has bottomed. I mean, in reality, you know, at least if you talk about China or Asia. Most of our revenue in what we call the China operation actually comes out of out of China and from Thailand from Vietnam customers that we call, we bundle it in the China part, but it's not really in China. Our revenue in China is very low, and we're not counting on that part really recovering if you would to anything near what it was I mean, just to recap the China operation, we're delivering about 12 million of revenue in 2020, and it is down to EUR3 million. And so all that EUR9 billion of revenues that vanished in China was really made up for in the US and Europe and which is why you have the growth in US and Europe or it's very strong even if the consolidated numbers structures."", 'Jaeson Schmidt', 'Okay. Understood. Okay. Thanks a lot, guys.', 'Shmuel Rubin', 'Thanks.', 'Operator', 'Scott Buck, H.C. Wainwright.', 'Scott Buck', ""Hi, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my questions for Dan. You mentioned in the release the I know on the call here the acceleration of reduction for the Lockheed project. I'm curious whether the geopolitical environment is causing you to see kind of similar uptick in demand or acceleration of interest in other parts of the business."", 'Shmuel Rubin', ""But yes, definitely, I mean, we've heard some uptake and in some areas of the business, for example, customers amidst well that builds some of the home and the systems for Vision Systems for the Israeli military and so on had had a big push on the orders to rebuild some systems that were destroyed the on October seventh from during the war. And of course, Ukraine continues indirectly to drive some demand for some of the optics, and that's just beginning to grow. I think the US is only now really starting to replenish. Some of the inventory is depleted some unfortunately, we don't make ammunition directly, which is from what I understand, one of the things that is the most shortage, but definitely the optics and the cameras that go on some of these the drones and loitering munition of growing demand and pipeline."", 'Scott Buck', ""And a follow-up to an earlier question is it sounds like you guys have the capacity to be able to handle, not just the Lucky project, but also perhaps one of these other potential deals you're working on as well, right?"", 'Albert Miranda', 'Yes, absolutely. I think when it comes to those kind of projects that all tens of millions of dollars in potential revenue. We probably with the capacity we have worldwide and balancing things worldwide can probably handle two, maybe even three of some great.', 'Scott Buck', ""And then last one for me. I'm curious, how are you thinking about the unrestricted cash balance here and how that it bridges you to 2026 and beyond when maybe some of these larger deals kick in, we also ventured into this quarter?"", 'Albert Miranda', ""Yes. Great. Great question. So baked into this quarter, we actually were or this first half of the year, we were operating cash flow positive and we'll continue to be operating cash flow positive. Cash has gone down in the first half. That's largely because of the Orlando facility. We're still still paying invoices still receiving and paying invoices there and the investment of another coating machine that we made in Riga. But the big chunks of that CapEx spend for this fiscal year's over. So in the second half of the fiscal year, we're just going to dribble out on the normal actually below average CapEx. So from a cash flow perspective, I feel pretty confident that we'll be. Okay."", 'Scott Buck', ""I mean that's it for me, guys. Thanks a lot."", 'Shmuel Rubin', 'Thank you, Scott.', 'Operator', 'Brian Kinstlinger, Alliance Global.', 'Brian Kinstlinger', ""Hi there. This is Trevor on for Brian. And my first question pertains to your backlog. Last, you mentioned that despite the lost revenue from annuals through your germanium contracts, that you're working on transitioning this IMiD to drive some meaningful backlog starting in 2Q. Did that happen this quarter? And if so, is there a sizable portion of the backlog that's attributable to some of that you quantified?"", 'Albert Miranda', ""Yes, definitely the Lockheed Martin, 4.7 million portion in the backlog and that entered during Q2 is purely visit as well as a few other smaller projects. But but right now, I'd say around 5 million of the backlog probably is felt because of it."", 'Brian Kinstlinger', ""Okay. Thank you. And then secondly, with the Lockheed partnership, just wanted to clarify, is Lightpath competing with anyone for the component that you're creating for Lockheed? Or is it guaranteed that if Lockheed selected that Lightpath will be in every delivered missile the latter, we will be the sole source and Lockheed part, and it's a very big deal."", 'Albert Miranda', ""That's why Lockheed actually was extremely supportive of our acquisition of estimate from their point of view, it's a significant bet that they made in that direction. And at the time they decided, oh, we're going to decide on it with them. It was a standalone nine people company. And so the acquisition of the visit by LightPath actually played a major role in this, and I sort of gave peace of mind to Lockheed in it, but we are definitely on the only one developing that part for Lucky."", 'Brian Kinstlinger', ""Great. That's great to hear. Last question. While I appreciate the strong demand from the defense industry, although we know it's like, you know, lumpy and can be unpredictable. Your products and Mantas specifically has really strong commercial applications like the flame detection recycling centers that you've mentioned in the past couple of quarters. So how do you go about building a healthy portion of a backlog that is more predictable? Like are you doing anything there like looking to hire more personnel, increased marketing spend, et cetera, just trying to get an idea. Thanks."", 'Albert Miranda', ""No, that's a great question. And really a lot of our focus now is around sales and soon will be on the marketing of those products. So far, if you look at myself as CEO, I tend to move around the business and focus my time on where it's needed. And right now, absolutely my time is focused on the sales of these new cameras, new product, and we're building up more in the sales team with tooling up to align ourselves to that."", 'Shmuel Rubin', ""And we're working very hard to lock in some strategic partnerships in some of those areas."", 'Albert Miranda', ""Again, we can't do everything. It's we're just we're not going to build a sales team now that will go off the 500 different camera companies company customers for cameras, and so strategic relationship and alliances with key players in some of those areas of firefighting of process control of drones, and they're going to be key for fast scaling up. And then in relation to the backlog and the fire detection for which we already have a running business for those cameras. They're not going to give us annual orders and they give us a forecast and we work off of that. So we'll never see that in the backlog."", 'Brian Kinstlinger', 'All right. Great. Makes sense. Thanks, guys. Thanks.', 'Operator', 'Glenn Mattson, Ladenburg.', 'Glenn Mattson', ""Hi. Thanks for taking the question. So it was about seven months ago that China made the announcement of the export ban for medium. So at the time, I thank you for standing by mentioned a timeframe of like how long it takes to your customers to design and get your alternatives through the kind of nine to 12 month timeframe. And so I guess I'm curious about how that's going and if there should be some expectation of of that to start to kick in kind of in the second calendar half of this year. And and that may also relate to the one customer didn't renew yet on the backlog side just to use them, as example, but just across the customers that in general, can you give us a sense of how that process has gone up so that that's a great question."", 'Albert Miranda', ""And frankly, it's going really well. I mentioned a couple of customers, an example. One of them is that largest customer for the sporting part, you know, typically our annual orders from that customer have been between 46 million as much as 6.5 million, I think, on one year and we haven't renewed that. Our expectation now is really four the entire product line of that customer to possibly convert to using Black Diamond materials. What we're seeing is that things have gone gotten even worse with germanium At first, I think many customers were still accessing germanium through inventories to Romania maybe was making its way out of China in different ways and different creative ways that play. But that is decreasing significantly. And as of now from what we know China has given zero export licenses to any germanium is at its final destination in the U.S. And so they're very very specific in sort of what they're going after there. And so we have two large customers for handheld devices, gun sights, binoculars and so on. They probably have around $10 million of potential revenue between the two of them, both of them. We're working very hard to convert over the next week. I think we're actually shipping some more samples to do to them. One of them already converted one product, I would say, which I mentioned it during the short term, they announced the new product and they also made it very clear at the SHOT Show to ourselves and anyone else that was asking that all new products are being designed only with Black Diamond now. So I think we're doing we're doing very well, I wish it could be faster than the time it takes. But the but unfortunately, doing some of those also require some of the capacity and capabilities that is used for day-to-day production and we can't disrupt it too much. So it's a balance we play. But I think I'm sorry, Glenn, it took some Chinese made the announcement in July, and I would say, and Sam, you can disagree, but it took until maybe November and December for the customers to start feeling."", 'Glenn Mattson', 'Yes, absolutely.', 'Albert Miranda', ""Of that announcement and start to scramble looking for a solution. And our conversations with those customers didn't give them confidence that they were going to continue to get dramatic, right? So when it was clear that we weren't going to solve weren't going to be able to solve their germanium problem that prompted them to take action."", 'Shmuel Rubin', ""But it took, I would say, a good six months before they realize that was real Yes, which is why our largest customer first wanted just one product we designed. But as we were working on that, they started realizing how difficult the situation is and immediately switched over to saying let's redefine everything. Right, right."", 'Glenn Mattson', ""Okay, great. That's very helpful on the backdrop and I don't know if you'd be pursuing morale, but could you give us a sense of as you look at your back half of your fiscal year, you know, you mentioned in the prepared remarks the view about European recessionary conditions and things like that. Can you just give us a sense of how you feel about and, you know, all the factors coming together with that potential of this or if there's any potential further disruption from the lack of supply or the supply drying up on the germanium side or and then maybe the new designs back in India or maybe there's some revenue coming through on the manpower side of things like that. Can you just give us a general sense of how you're feeling about the revenue top line and in 2H versus 1H? Yes."", 'Albert Miranda', ""So it's interesting that the situation, the softening in Europe is really more around the visible optics where there's a lot more competition globally and a lot of price pressure. But our production capacity and all that kind of good stuff. And those products tend to have industrial applications that sort of deliver next where, as you know, deliver more to consumer oriented products. And that's where we're seeing the softening the infrared side because the infrared components, even without the major the major contracts on the infrared side, we're still seeing growth in Europe and in the U.S. and demand in Europe, Europe and the U.S. for infrared components and the assemblies and solution type start of the business. But where we're seeing the sort of the the economics impact is on the visible component side. And again, they tend to lead towards a more direct path to a consumer product. So that's what we're seeing in Europe. And I don't I don't have a crystal ball and I don't say the recession word, if you Google, a Europeans are like we were a year ago, nobody wants to see the recession word, but there are economies or contracts."", 'Glenn Mattson', ""Right, right. That's helpful. So then when you factor that in plus all the other moving parts and when you think about the top line outlook, can you give us any DARRELL sense of directionally how you feel about the second half versus first half? And that's it for me."", 'Albert Miranda', ""So my gut tells me that this this past Q2 was the softest quarter, we're going to experience. So in Q3, we should see a little bit of an uptick in Q4 and a little bit of an uptick. Again, it's the visible components that sort of what we worry about and you kind of nailed it with that, but they're in decline regardless. So it's just happening a bit faster than we would have predicted six months or a year ago."", 'Glenn Mattson', 'Okay, great.', 'Operator', ""(Operator Instructions) Gene Inger, ingerletter.com. Mr. Inger, you're line is open? You had it muted on your end."", 'Gene Inger', 'Yeah, you hear me now.', 'Operator', 'Yes, we do. Thank you.', 'Gene Inger', ""I apologize. I muted that has occurred. And as Sam, I hope you're feeling better high now as well. And my first question, I'd like to start with something you haven't touched on, which is the annual meeting and the paperwork that was pending due to that problems from the previous management before you guys began an enormous task of turning around this small company. And I'm wondering if you can tell us if all of that is not of concern to shareholders."", 'Albert Miranda', ""Yes, absolutely. Thanks. I appreciate it. Definitely could have touched on that. I'm very, very glad to see that it's all completely resolved now. And to recap, it was pointed out by some external group that there were some problems in the registration of the company that went back all the way to 1995 when the 71 split of reverse split was done and was done incorrectly or so. And so we had to postpone the annual shareholder meeting to it filed with the Delaware Court of Chancery Court for a collection of the registration since we couldn't go back and locate all shareholders from 1995 to have them rebuild that. And all of that is behind us last week the day before the Annual Shareholder Meeting, the court ruled on that of fixed leverage inflation and well done. We're in very good standing now. And I think I can say that at this point, every single issue that we have found in the last three years since been fixed, just very briefly, let me ask you a couple of more questions."", 'Gene Inger', 'One, Scott Harris, Chairman of the Board, and I appreciate the new Board members by the way, the former major general as well as a business manager, I believe, brought over from Luminor. A are you bringing in more people intentionally from Luminor? And B, is there a any linkage between Lightpath and the private company that Scott is the CEO of called inflection book. And I mentioned that because the Pentagon is in the process of jump-starting at several key application. I wondered if some of that includes quantum computing photonics? And I wonder if this is or can involve Lightpath in the future.', 'Albert Miranda', ""Yes. Well, first of all, we're not the poaching specifically on luminal and and I don't think with targeting specifically, it doesn't happen to be that the luminal has recruited some great people over the years and there are some opportunities that have come up in which we recruited people that were in the past and moving out even the near past of the long-term past has some great people joined us from their end. Secondly, as it comes to Scott, the new venture, which is extremely interesting about did encourage everyone to take a look at that inflection and like many things that is extremely heavy on photonics and Quantum, all things, Quantum, Quantum sensors, quantum computing, Quantum communication. They are all very photonics oriented and driven. We have a very strong person species in free space, optical communication, primarily in space. And that ties very much directly into science at Quantum communication and also indirectly into some of the quantum of work that is being worked on by many companies in friction being one of them. And we'll always be very happy to see optics find finding more uses and more places to be. I get an extreme Joy out of even the simplest thing we're seeing is that the quantum engine might be replacing something as simple as the radio receivers."", 'Gene Inger', ""And it's mind-blowing to see optics play a role in something like radio communications and any of it relate as well to enemy submarines and to detection systems because I know you're doing spacecraft went down communication, you haven't really touched on that with anymore specificity. Can you can you elaborate?"", 'Albert Miranda', ""Yes, we have actually a couple of cameras systems that are one of them we're going to have any day now. I think a version of Mantas that we're going to release that are of extreme interest for this for threat detection and counter-UAS detection, Texor detection of cruise missiles as they come in and other things all of those. We have two cameras systems, two separate camera systems that we're working with customers on that show very, very promising results in that directly."", 'Gene Inger', ""Do these relate to the U.S. Navy licenses, we haven't heard much more about."", 'Albert Miranda', 'Yes, the U.S. leaving license enables a lot of that. And as I mentioned, we expect within the next two to three weeks to release the first material formally from the from the Navy license BD&L for. But in reality, the Mantas came about it has already been using those materials for over a year now we simply are now formally announcing yet the material made available to us.', 'Gene Inger', 'I think you have mentioned one that your 100 Mantos cameras likely produced or sold this year, does this year mean fiscal year or are you talking about this calendar year and this fiscal year?', 'Shmuel Rubin', 'Pretty much on track for that?', 'Albert Miranda', 'I think.', 'Gene Inger', ""Okay. Now I would like to ask you was just an overview. The military has been stunned by the Gaza war and by Ukraine because they see the swarming of drones and how that offsets not only jet fighter aircraft and maybe you're working on the F-35, maybe not of the improvements, but also there you don't want to fire a million dollar missile intercept, the $5,000 cheap drones that we've learned in the Red Sea. So I wonder whether Lightpath benefits or suffers from the prospect of fewer costly missile systems and that would intercept or work that Tom and I hope to have that in the future."", 'Albert Miranda', ""Yes. Yes. Well, once we are done with the development of the Lockheed missile and hopefully one Smith for such as awarded to Lockheed my my personal wishes and see if I have a mid-cycle and everything, they see a development or even a butterfly. And but realistically, I think what we're seeing is a very strong drive towards integrating more and more passive detection capabilities such as infrared cameras for detecting some of those drones today, you simply cannot use a radar for detecting the drones coming in for something the Ukraine has taught us and have learned. Unfortunately, it's very hard to wait as well doesn't suffer that because of fighting an adversary such as the Teva organization and not a state, but in Ukraine, Russia wall, for example, in what is called in and near of adversarial and adversaries that has capabilities close to yours. You suddenly realize you cannot use a radar to detecting drones because the moment you turn it on and mid-funnel is locked onto the V12 and we'll help you within minutes seconds and sort of the use of cameras is very important to have our camera that I mentioned for detecting threats from a distance one version of Mantas and one version of the different camera of extreme importance because they can do that in $10,000 as opposed to a CAD50,000 cameras that is often used today. So I think we have something very unique there that that will pay off really well."", 'Gene Inger', ""Sam, now that Thank you. I feel better, and I appreciate the aspirational goals that you have outlined in the presentations as well lately. And I know it takes time and I know how hard it is. So good luck, and we'll keep watching it."", 'Shmuel Rubin', 'Thank you, Jake, and thank you very well.', 'Operator', 'This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Sam Rubin for any closing remarks.', 'Shmuel Rubin', ""Thank you. I appreciate everyone's joining the call and the patience that our shareholders show that we are not only turning around the Company but also plotting the new direction. And now finally delivering on it big time, the Lockheed Martin, the automotive, the cameras each one of those are tens of millions of dollars in annual revenue that will be coming down the road, very big deal. The company is going to look completely different a few years from now, and I'm excited to continue along this path. Thank you, everyone."", 'Operator', ""The conference has now concluded.

(NYSE:BAX) Q4 2023 Earnings Call Transcript February 8, 2024', 'Baxter International Inc. beats earnings expectations. Reported EPS is $0.88, expectations were $0.86. Baxter International Inc. isn’t one of the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds at the end of the third quarter (see the details here).', 'Executives: Clare Trachtman - VP, IR Jose Almeida - Chairman, President and CEO Joel Grade - EVP and CFO', 'Analysts: Travis Steed - Bank of America Securities Matt Miksic - Barclays Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI Pito Chickering - Deutsche Bank Securities Matt Taylor - Jefferies Danielle Antalffy - UBS', 'Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Baxter International’s Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Your lines will remain in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer segment of today’s call. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this call will be recorded by Baxter and is copyrighted material. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Baxter’s permission. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Clare Trachtman, Senior Vice President, Chief Investor Relations Officer at Baxter International. Ms. Trachtman, you may begin.', 'Clare Trachtman: Good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Joe Almeida, Baxter’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Joel Grade, Baxter’s Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. On the call this morning, we will be discussing Baxter’s fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial results along with our financial outlook for 2024. With that, let me start our prepared remarks by reminding everyone that this presentation, including comments regarding our financial outlook for the first quarter and full year 2024, new product development including the impact and status of pending regulatory approvals, the status and potential impact of our ongoing strategic and recent pricing actions, business development, regulatory matters, and the macroeconomic environment, including commentary on improving supply chain conditions and evolving customer capital spending trends contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.', 'And of course, our actual results could differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to today’s press release and our SEC filings for more detail concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. In addition, on today’s call, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Baxter’s ongoing business performance. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures being discussed today to the comparable GAAP financial measures is included in the accompanying investor presentation, along with our earnings release issued this morning, which are both available on our website. Now I’d like to turn the call over to Joe. Joe?', 'Jose Almeida: Thank you, Clare, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you taking the time to join us. I will begin with a brief overview of Baxter’s performance for the quarter and the year. After this, I will review our progress against the transformational actions we laid out for you just over a year ago, including the planned separation of our Kidney Care business. I will then turn it over to Joel Grade, who will walk through our results and outlook in more detail. Finally, we will open it up for your questions. As you saw this morning, Baxter reported strong performance for the fourth quarter of 2023 with top line sales exceeding our projections and bottom line results coming in at the high end of our guidance range.', 'As a reminder, continuing operations exclude the impact of our biopharma solutions business, which we divested at the close of the third quarter. Sales from continuing operations rose 4% on a reported basis ahead of our outlook of 1% to 2% growth. On a constant currency basis, sales increased 3%, also ahead of our guidance, which projected growth of approximately 1%. Strength in the quarter was broad-based with year-over-year growth in the Healthcare Systems and Technologies, Medical Products and Therapies and Pharmaceuticals, which was slightly offset by an expected decline in Kidney Care. Relative to expectations, both of our chronic therapies and drug compounding divisions reported better-than-expected sales. On the bottom line, adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations came in at $0.88 at the top end of our prior guidance range of $0.85 to $0.88.', 'Our fourth quarter results further reinforce our building momentum. In 2023, we focused on consistently meeting and/or exceeding our financial outlook, particularly in light of the significant supply chain and macro environmental challenges we encountered during 2022. As a testament to this focus, over the course of 2023, we were able to deliver sequential improvement every quarter, and we believe this performance provides us with a solid foundation to build off in 2024. Turning to the full year sales from continuing operations of $14.8 billion advanced 2% on a reported basis and 3% on a constant currency basis, driven by sales growth for all of our segments at constant currency rates. First, looking at the constant currency sales growth in the segment set to comprise our future Baxter portfolio following the planned Kidney Care separation.', 'Sales in Healthcare Systems & Technologies were up 7% in the fourth quarter and 3% for the year. Medical Products and Therapies sales rose 4% in both the quarter and for the year, and sales in Pharmaceuticals were up 7% for both the quarter and the year. Performance in these segments was filled by strong execution across our commercial and manufacturing teams. New product launches increased the availability of electromechanical component and a more stable supply chain and macroeconomic environment relative to the significant volatility experienced last year. With respect to hospital capital spending, while we still believe there may be pockets of softer spending, we are encouraged by the sequential improvement we experienced every quarter in 2023 within our Care and Connectivity Solutions division.', 'Our Kidney Care segment, which will be called Vantive post separation, declined 1% in the quarter and grew 1% for the year at constant rates. Strong growth in acute therapies was offset by flat growth in chronic therapies, reflecting a difficult year-over-year comparison due to certain discrete items that benefited sales in the prior year as well as lower sales in China due to the impact of government-based procurement initiatives and the lower patient census due to the pandemic. The underlying state of the Kidney Care business continues to improve and the momentum we are building is evident. Among key indicators, we are seeing renewed growth in the peritoneal dialysis patient population following the earlier impact of pandemic-driven mortality issues.', 'Our strategic rationale and hypothesis for an independent Kidney Care business remains as strong as ever. Our team is executing and gearing up for a successful separation this year. Given overall business performance and environmental dynamics, I’m optimistic as we look ahead to the prospects for both Baxter and Vantive as separate entities. Our solid financial performance was achieved in parallel with meaningful progress against the strategic priorities we announced to open 2023. We kicked off the year with an urgency to rethink both the scope and velocity of our transformation. Since then, our team delivered executing on a range of goals to position a separated Baxter and Vantive for a new era of enhanced patient and shareholder impact, enabled by heightened strategic clarity, operational efficiency and innovation.', 'We realigned our businesses into newly streamlined simplified operating model based on globally integrated business segments. Each segment is led by a seasoned and knowledgeable executive who has profit and loss accountability, inclusive of dedicated commercial research and development, manufacturing, supply chain and functional teams. We are already seeing the benefits of improved line of sight to our customers and greater agility to recognize and capture growth opportunities. We completed the divestiture of our biopharma solutions business at the close of Q3, which further allowed us to streamline our strategic focus on our core businesses. We are in the process of utilizing the after-tax proceeds of approximately $3.7 billion to pay down debt in line with our stated capital allocation priorities, including $2.8 billion of repayments in the fourth quarter.', 'Finally, we continue to make progress towards separating Vantive out of Baxter. As we have consistently stated, we believe this separation will ultimately empower both companies to pursue their own unique strategic and investment priorities. Many of you had the opportunity to meet the designated Vantive CEO, Chris Toth at the JPMorgan conference last month. Chris has been hard at work building out his organization, meeting customers and setting near-term and long-term strategies. Among recent developments, Chris has onboarded Matt Harbaugh as designated Vantive CFO. Many of you may know Matt from his days as CFO at NuVasive. Meanwhile, we continue to hit key separation milestones across operational, legal, regulatory, supply chain IT domains.', 'In summary, 2023 was a year of rebuilding and renewing our momentum. We made significant progress on an ambitious slate of strategic initiatives coupled with solid financial performance, while never losing focus on our foundational commitments to our customers and patients. Additionally, we have created a new potential to embrace more exciting opportunities to come. I do not take the accomplishments of this past year for granted, I want to thank and recognize all of the employees who hard work and commitment helped us to achieve our objectives. I have never been more impressed by what a team could achieve in a single year and that is why I’m so energized by our potential to seize on opportunities we have created together. Now we turn it over to Joel for a closer look at our fourth quarter and full year 2023 performance as well as our 2024 outlook.', 'Joel Grade: Thanks, Joe and good morning, everyone. I’m happy to be joining the call this morning to provide some additional details on Baxter’s fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial performance as well as commentary on our financial outlook for 2024. As Joe mentioned, we are pleased with our fourth quarter results, which represented another step forward in our on-going business transformation. Fourth quarter 2023 global sales of $3.9 billion increased 4% on a reported basis and 3% on a constant currency basis and compared favorably to our previously issued guidance of 1% to 2% reported and approximately 1% constant currency. Outperformance in the quarter benefited from better than expected sales in many product categories and particularly in chronic therapies and drug compounding.', 'As compared to the prior year period, we reported solid quarterly growth in health care systems and technologies, pharmaceuticals and medical products and therapies. And collectively, sales for these three businesses, which will comprise Baxter post the separation, increased approximately 5%. As expected, Kidney Care sales declined slightly in the quarter due to the factors Joe mentioned earlier. On the bottom line, adjusted earnings totalled $0.88 per share, increasing 13% versus the prior year period. These results reflect the ongoing operational improvements we are recognizing both commercially, as well as within our supply chain network as that team successfully executes on its margin improvement programs. Lower interest expense and a benefit from foreign exchange also contributed favorably to the quarter, partially offset by the impact of a higher tax rate compared to the prior year.', 'Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter came in at the high end of our expected range of $0.85 to $0.88 per share, primarily driven by better sales and operational performance. Now I’ll walk through performance by our reportable segments. Commentary regarding sales growth will reflect growth at constant currency rates. Sales in our Medical Products and Therapies segments were $1.3 billion, increasing 4%. Full year 2023 sales totalled $5 billion also advancing 4%. Within Medical products and therapies, fourth quarter sales from our Infusion Therapies and Technologies division totalled $1 billion and increased 4%. Sales in the quarter benefited from strength in our IV Solutions portfolio, particularly outside the United States, as well as solid performance in our infusion system portfolio.', 'Sales from Advanced Surgery totalled $278 million and grew 6%, coming in ahead of expectations and reflecting strong growth internationally. For our Healthcare Systems & Technologies or HST segment, sales in the quarter were $795 million and increased 7%. Full year 2023 sales totalled $3 billion, advancing 3%, within the HST segment, sales in our Care & Connectivity Solutions, or CCS division or $492 million, increasing 11%. Performance in the quarter benefited from double-digit growth in all key product categories within the division, including our care communications, surgical solutions and Patient Support Systems product offerings. Growth in the quarter was partially offset by lower contribution from rental revenues. Fourth quarter United States orders within CCS continued to improve sequentially, but notably also grew on a year-over-year basis for the first time in 2023.', 'While we are encouraged by the improvement in capital spending we’ve seen from our U.S. hospital customers, we continue to believe there may still be select pockets of cautiousness in the marketplace. Front Line Care sales in the quarter were $303 million, increasing 2%, given the improvements in electromechanical component availability over the course of 2023, we’re able to successfully address our elevated backlog and exited the year at more normalized levels. Sales in our Pharmaceuticals segment were $596 million, increasing 7%. For the full year, sales were $2.2 billion, also advancing 7%. Performance in the quarter reflected double-digit growth in our U.S. injectables portfolio driven by new product launches, as well as continued strong demand for our services within our drug compounding portfolio internationally.', 'Other sales, which represent sales not allocated to a segment and primarily include sales of products and services provided directly through certain of our manufacturing facilities were $18 million and declined 58% during the quarter in line with our expectations. This lower level of sales reflects reduced demand for certain contract manufacturing volumes and the termination of a royalty arrangement. Moving on to Kidney Care, sales in the quarter were $1.2 billion and declined 1%. Full year 2023 sales totalled $4.5 billion and increased 1%. Within Kidney Care, global sales for chronic therapies were $950 million, declining 3%, though as mentioned earlier, came in better than expected. Sales growth in the quarter was impacted by a difficult comparison to the prior year period, which included certain discrete items in the U.S. that totalled approximately $25 million.', 'Finally, performance in chronic therapies continues to be impacted by lower sales in China due to certain government-based procurement initiatives and a lower patient census due to the pandemic. We estimate that collectively, these country-specific factors negatively impacted sales by approximately $35 million in the quarter. Sales in our Acute Therapies business were $206 million, representing growth of 6% with strength across most regions, including double-digit growth in the United States, where we’ve now rebased this business following the pandemic-related benefits we previously experienced. Now moving through the rest of the P&L. Our adjusted gross margin totalled 42% and represented an increase of 80 basis points over the prior year.', 'The year-over-year improvement in gross margin primarily reflects the stabilization of macroeconomic factors and inflationary pressures that previously contributed to higher cost for raw materials, overhead and labor that impacted our margins earlier in the year. Margin improvement in the quarter also benefited from pricing initiatives in select markets and on-going margin improvement programs in our integrated supply chain network. Performance for the quarter was inline with our expectations as topline outperformance in the quarter was driven by lower-margin divisions, which drove a slightly negative gross profit mix in the quarter. Adjusted SG&A totalled $829 million or 21.3% as a percentage of sales, an increase of 20 basis points versus the prior year period.', 'Performance in the quarter benefited from our on-going transformation initiatives to enhance operational efficiencies, offset by higher bonus accruals under our annual employee incentive compensation plans compared to the prior year and select investments in sales and marketing initiatives. Adjusted Research & Development spending in the quarter totalled $172 million and represented 4.4% as a percentage of sales, increasing 20 basis points versus the prior year. We have ramped up our R&D efforts, particularly increasing our investments in advancing new products across the portfolio and like SG&A, R&D expenses include the impact of higher employee incentive accruals as compared to the prior year period. These factors resulted in an adjusted operating margin of 16.2% and an increase of 30 basis points.', 'Overall, we are very pleased with the second half margin expansion we’re able to realize with operating margins improving approximately 300 basis points in the second half of the year as compared to the first half of 2023. Net interest expense totalled $73 million in the quarter, a decrease of $44 million versus the prior year and down $55 million sequentially, driven by debt repayment of approximately $2.8 billion associated with the utilization of the proceeds from our BPS divestiture. We plan to continue to repay debt in 2024, consistent with our stated capital allocation priorities. Adjusted other non-operating income, totalled $11 million in the quarter compared to an expense of $11 million in the prior year period. Year-over-year improvement was largely due to lower foreign exchange losses incurred as compared with the prior year period.', 'The adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 21.0% compared to 14.6% in the prior year period. The year-over-year increase is primarily driven by statute expirations on certain tax positions benefiting the prior year period. The tax rate in the quarter came in higher than expected, primarily driven by changes in geographic earnings mix. And as previously mentioned, adjusted earnings totalled $0.88 and increased 13% versus the prior year, primarily driven by better-than-expected sales and operational efficiencies, as well as lower interest expense, partially offset by the tax rate in the quarter. For the full year, Baxter’s adjusted earnings from continuing operations decreased 14% to $2.60 per diluted share, reflecting the impact of higher cost of goods sold, driven primarily by the macro environmental factors we previously discussed, greater annual employee bonus accruals, as well as increased non-operating expenses.', 'These factors were partially offset by our operational and supply chain savings initiatives. With respect to cash flow, we generated free cash flow for the year of over $1 billion from continuing operations compared to $411 million in the prior year period. Going forward, cash flow generation and in particular, improving our working capital metrics is a key priority both for me and the Baxter team. To close on our full year results, we are pleased with our operating performance through 2023, which reflected both consistent progress and building momentum. And it is important to note that our teams were able to achieve this performance, while also making meaningful progress against our strategic initiatives designed to enhance our future performance and drive incremental value for all stakeholders.', 'We look forward to building on that positive momentum as we enter 2024. Let me conclude my remarks by discussing our outlook for the first quarter and full year 2024, including some key assumptions underpinning the guidance. For full year 2024, Baxter expects total sales growth of 2% on both a reported and constant currency basis, as the impact from foreign exchange is currently expected to be minimal on a full year basis. Constant currency sales guidance for the full year by reportable segments is as follows; for Medical Products and Therapies, we expect sales growth of 3% to 4%; sales in our Healthcare Systems and Technology segments are expected to increase approximately 3%; we expect Pharmaceuticals sales growth of 4% to 5%. Collectively, sales for these remaining Baxter businesses are expected to increase 3% to 4% in 2024; for Kidney Care, we expect sales growth to decline 1% to 2% as compared to 2023.', 'Factors impacting year-over-year growth are primarily driven by select market and product exits in connection with our margin expansion initiatives for this segment which we estimate will negatively impact sales by approximately $150 million. Additionally, the incremental impact from the ongoing government procurement initiatives in China is expected to total approximately $70 million in 2024. Now turning to our outlook for other P&L line items. We expect adjusted operating margin to increase by at least 50 basis points in 2024. We expect our non-operating expenses, which include net interest expense and other income and expense to total approximately $350 million in aggregate during 2024. We anticipate a full year adjusted tax rate between 22.0% and 22.5%, which reflects an approximate 100 basis point impact to the 2024 tax rate from the implementation of Pillar 2 [ph].', 'We expect our diluted share count to increase slightly and average 510 million shares for the year. Based on all these factors, we anticipate full year adjusted earnings, excluding special items, of $2.85 to $2.95 per diluted share. Specific to the first quarter of 2024, we expect global sales growth of approximately 1% on a reported basis and 1% to 2% on a constant currency basis. And we expect adjusted earnings, excluding special items, of $0.59 to $0.62 per diluted share. With that, we can now open up the call for Q&A.', 'Operator: Thank you.

If you are not interested in learning about the global pharmaceutical market, head straight to the 5 Countries With Highest Pharmaceutical Spend Per Capita.', 'In the landscape of global healthcare expenditure, certain countries stand out for their significant investment in pharmaceuticals per capita. These nations allocate substantial resources to ensure access to essential medications and cutting-edge treatments for their populations. Analyzing the\xa0countries with the highest pharmaceutical spending per capita provides valuable insights into their healthcare priorities, economic strength, and commitment to advancing medical innovation.\xa0', 'The global pharmaceutical market is poised for substantial growth, projected to expand by 6.19% from 2024 to 2028, reaching a volume of US$1470.00 billion. New drug launches, increased utilization of existing drugs, and the influence of lower-cost alternatives fuel this growth. Moreover, total spending and global demand for medicines will soar to\xa0$1.9 trillion\xa0by 2027.\xa0', 'In the United States, which leads the global pharmaceutical market with a\xa048.9%\xa0share of total pharmaceutical revenue, the sector faces challenges such as underperformance in capital markets, rising business costs due to inflation and taxes, and an evolving threat landscape. Nevertheless, industry growth is anticipated, driven by initiatives like reduced taxes and decreased drug prices.\xa0', 'The economic impact of pharmaceutical spending is profound, as evidenced by the remarkable growth of the pharmaceutical industry in countries like China and India, where GDP growth exceeds 6%. Such spending not only stimulates economic activity by creating employment opportunities and generating tax revenue but also contributes to enhanced population health and heightened productivity. However, the relationship between pharmaceutical Spending and GDP is intricate and influenced by diverse factors such as healthcare system structure, economic development level, and governmental policies.\xa0', 'Research and development expenses, averaging $2.6 billion per drug, remain substantial. The dominance of the United States in the pharmaceutical realm, accounting for the maximum global pharmaceutical spending in 2021, is evident, with Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) emerging as key industry players. China emerges as a significant market player, capturing nearly 12%\xa0market share.\xa0', 'Worldwide innovation and research in the pharmaceutical sector play a pivotal role in advancing healthcare and addressing global health challenges. Investment in cutting-edge medical technologies and drug development remains a cornerstone of this endeavor, as reflected in recent financial statistics and reports.\xa0', 'The pharmaceutical industry stands out as one of the most research-intensive sectors, with significant investments in research and development (R&D) to discover and develop new drugs. However, the financial landscape for pharmaceutical R&D has become increasingly challenging, with a decline in the projected return on investment (ROI) to 1.2% in 2022, the lowest in the 13-year history of the report. The average cost of developing a new drug has risen to $2.3 billion in 2022, while average forecast peak sales per asset have decreased to $389 million.\xa0', 'Innovation in pharmaceuticals is more comprehensive than in developed countries, as highlighted by a\xa0study\xa0published in the Journal of Pharmaceutical Policy and Practice. Rising pharmaceutical innovation in the Global South, including countries like Bangladesh and Colombia, underscores a shift towards a more globally distributed innovation landscape. Investment in R&D in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) has increased over the past decade, indicating potential for more significant innovation in these regions.\xa0', 'Venture capital investment is crucial in fueling early-stage pharmaceutical innovation, with significant fluctuations observed worldwide. Notably, Asia-Pacific (APAC) pharmaceuticals have seen a notable increase in venture capital investments, with early-stage innovator drug venture funding for APAC biotech reaching\xa0$9.4 billion, a 78% increase. However, economic uncertainty in 2022 led to a decrease in total deal volume and value, reflecting challenges faced by the sector.\xa0', 'Moreover, the pharmaceutical industry is witnessing a growing demand for personalized medicine, driven by consumers seeking treatments tailored to their needs and genetic makeup. This trend is reshaping research and development strategies, with the global personalized medicine market valued at $2.12 trillion in 2021 and expected to reach $5.7 trillion by 2030. Additionally, the global precision medicine market size was estimated at\xa0$73.49 billion in 2022 and is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 11.5% from 2022 to 2030, reaching a value of $175.64 billion by the end of the forecast period.', ""Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), a multinational healthcare corporation founded in 1886, has a rich history of innovation spanning over a century.

To skip the latest news and analysts’ sentiments around the current economic conditions, go directly to the 5 Best Big Company Stocks to Buy.', 'Despite the doubts, the market performed exceptionally in 2023. While several analysts believed it to be temporary, the new year isn’t showing many signs of weakness in the market. Although there have been a few hurdles, the overall prediction is that the Federal Reserve will manage to guide the US economy toward a soft landing rather than a recession, as was expected in the last two years. However, analysts still advise caution in the short term. Marko Kolanovic, Chief Global Markets Strategist and Global Co-Head of Research at J.P. Morgan, said:\xa0', '“As we approach 2024, we expect both inflation data and economic demand to soften, as the tailwinds for growth and risk markets are fading. Overall, we are cautious on the performance of risky assets and the broader macro outlook over the next 12 months, due to building monetary headwinds, geopolitical risks and expensive asset valuations.”', 'Nevertheless, the latest news suggests that the financial markets are heading in the right direction as the S&P 500 touched 5000 for the first time at the time of market opening on February 9 after December inflation data, which turned out to be even lower than initially reported. While the Fed recently revealed that it will take its time to review market data before making any decision to announce rate cuts, many analysts believe that the rate cuts can begin in the first half of 2024.', 'Despite the positive predictions around the market, the varying opinions of experts can lead to further confusion among novice investors, which is why the best big company stocks are some of the safest bets for such people. These big company stocks bring a sense of safety among investors as the losses are never permanent, even during bear market conditions. Additionally, the best company stocks are usually cash-rich with strong balance sheets and can easily weather any economic disasters. Furthermore, their wealth also allows them to pay steady dividends. For example, one of the giants in the energy sector, Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) has increased its dividends for the last 37 years, even though the last 10 years have seen some significant volatility in the energy sectors. Similarly, another blue-chip stock, PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) raised its dividend by 7% on February 9 despite year-over-year (YoY) revenue declines across major markets in the fourth quarter of 2023.', 'The big company stocks do not guarantee positive returns all the time but provide ample opportunities for investors when they fall. For example, earlier this month, we discussed the 10 blue-chip stocks at 52-week lows, which you should check out as these are also some of the best big company stocks that provide prime entry points for investors. However, our current list uses a different methodology, and some of our current best big company stocks include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). After an exceptional performance in 2023, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) declared its first-ever quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share on February 1 and increased its previous share buyback authorization by $50 billion. The company nearly gained 200% in the year and is up nearly 36% year-to-date (YTD) at the time of writing on February 9.', 'A large stock market board displaying the S&P 500 and S&P 500 Growth Index.', 'Our Methodology', 'To choose the best big company stocks, we used the FinViz stock screener to identify mega-cap stocks with an estimated 5-year EPS growth of over 15%. These stocks were then listed according to the number of their hedge fund investors in the third quarter of 2023. The hedge fund sentiment was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 910 elite hedge funds. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).

(NASDAQ:ASML) and Tokyo Electron, which we consider enablers of AI, as well as enterprise software maker SAP and IT consultant Accenture, which we see as facilitators of AI adoption in new product lines and/or enhanced business models, rose strongly in the quarter.

(NASDAQ:NFLX), ServiceNow, and Salesforce.', 'During Netflix’s pandemic grow-over issues in 2022, the market seemed to believe there was little revenue or free cash flow growth left to be had for this business. The pandemic had pulled forward user growth, and the company then disclosed that there were over 100 million households that were using Netflix but not paying for it by borrowing a paid user’s account. After we assessed this information, better understood how the company could monetize shared passwords, and realized the win-win for Netflix and consumers from introducing an ad-supported subscription tier, we meaningfully added to our position in Netflix in the summer of 2022. We saw a clear path to much better monetization of an already robust and differentiated platform with a continued commitment to improved content spend efficiency and free cash flow growth.', 'Fast forward to today, Netflix has made meaningful progress on monetizing shared passwords and laying the foundation for consumer choice, although the ramp in advertising tier subscribers remains in the beginning stages. The low-hanging fruit may already have been picked on password sharing efforts, but our research shows there should be long tails of revenue and free cash flow growth. In our opinion, Netflix remains the most advantaged and profitable streaming service with opportunities to continue adding subscribers and raising prices as it demonstrates more value to consumers over time. Over the longer term, we also expect significant advertising revenue. That said, the market finally seems to have appreciated some of this. As a result, we trimmed our position from approximately 8% of the Portfolio to approximately 5% in the fourth quarter.”', 'Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is an Indiana-based company that discovers, develops, and markets human healthcare products.', 'On February 6, Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) posted its Q4 non-GAAP EPS of $2.49, which beat the estimates by $0.12.

(NASDAQ:AMD), Amazon, Docebo, NU, Rover – performed exceptionally well. In hindsight, the decision to allocate to technology stocks appears straightforward; but it actually demanded courage and conviction to buy and add to these stocks during the fear and uncertainty of the 2022 bear market.', 'The top 5 positions in the portfolio were: Precious Metals royalty basket, Nu Holdings, AMD Amazon.com and Converge Technology Services.

Even its most mature and largest offerings, Sales Cloud and Service Cloud, are still growing revenue at double-digit rates. In addition, management realized that their cost structure, especially in salespeople, had gotten too bloated. Over the past year and a half, the company has run a much more streamlined expense structure that has led to strong operating margin expansion and earnings growth.

But it’s worth taking a look at Williams’ previous-quarter results first.', 'In the last reported quarter, the energy infrastructure provider beat the consensus mark on the back of growth in its core infrastructure businesses. Williams had reported adjusted earnings per share of 45 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 40 cents. However, revenues of $2.6 billion generated by the firm came in $8 million below the consensus mark due to lower-than-expected gathering volumes in the Northeast G&P and the West segments.WMB beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the last four quarters, resulting in an earnings surprise of 13.7%, on average.

The number suggests a 5.6% increase from a profit of $700 million reported in the year-ago quarter.Additionally, the adjusted EBITDA consensus mark for Northeast G&P unit — engaged in natural gas gathering and processing along with the NGL fractionation business in Marcellus and Utica shale regions — suggests a 6.3% year-over-year gain. The bullish view is based on an estimated increase in service revenues.However, as a counter to these factors, lower earnings from the West segment are likely to have hurt Williams’ results due to lower natural gas prices and NGL margins. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for WMB’s West segment — comprising interstate natural gas pipeline and other gathering and processing assets in the Western region of the United States — is expected to have generated adjusted EBITDA of $313 million, down 4% from the year-earlier level.', 'The proven Zacks model does not conclusively show that The Williams Companies is likely to beat estimates in the fourth quarter.

If you want to skip our overview of the high technology aerospace and defense industry and how it's shaped the modern day world, you can take a look at the 5 Best Aerospace and Defense Stocks to Invest In. "", ""If there's one thing that can be said with certainty, it's that the defense and aerospace industry is one of the most important in the world when it comes to shaping power politics. Global geopolitics, and as the late Henry Kissinger would describe, 'realpolitik' is based on the cold, hard reality of military superiority. Traditionally, this superiority came in the form of strength in numbers - a concept that still holds true today."", ""However, along with this, another concept that has borne the test of time is the use of technology for warfare. Whether it's the Mongols who relied on brutal cavalry tactics, or the Ottoman use of gunpowder that made it a 'gunpowder empire', technology has shaped warfare and global power dynamics."", ""These days, the dominant and only superpower (some would even say a hyperpower) is the United States of America. The U.S., if you're unaware, has the most powerful military in the world, fueled by the greatest number of aircraft carriers for any military and an air force whose aircraft number in the thousands. Safe to say, aerospace plays a crucial role in maintaining American global military superiority, and by effect, it also shapes the global world order."", 'Powering the U.S. military behemoth, which also has the biggest defense budget in the world, are aerospace and defense stocks. These stocks are firms that either directly engage in providing the U.S. military, through the Department of Defense, with their combat or combat support equipment, or those that provide essential and tertiary capabilities such as the defense stock Planet Labs PBC (NYSE:PL) and Maxar Technologies whose advanced satellites carry the ability to remotely image any site in the world and provide military planners with invaluable information to inform their tactical and strategic decisions.', ""Technology sits at the heart of competing when it comes to defense and aerospace stocks, and a technological edge is precisely the reason that the U.S. is at the top of the global power food chain. American jets are envied by dictators and monarchs all over the world, and no matter what their public statements against the U.S. are, it wouldn't be imprudent to assume that they would give an arm and a leg (and then some) to get a taste of what American defense and aerospace stocks have to offer."", ""So what exactly do they offer? Well, let's start with one of the most well known defense and aerospace stocks in the world, the Bethesda, Maryland based aerospace firm Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT). Lockheed, if you're unaware, makes and sells fighter aircraft. While it also has other divisions, such as a space segment that aims to develop a colony on the Moon complete with a nuclear reactor in partnership with the National Aerospace and Space Administration (NASA), Lockheed Martin's bread and butter are airplanes. The firm in its current form came into being in the late 1990s as the U.S. defense industry consolidated (more on that later). Lockheed merged with Martin Marietta in 1995, after it acquired General Dynamics - perhaps one of the most consequential defense and aerospace stocks in the world."", ""That's a tall claim. So what made Martin Marietta so special? Well, the firm bought General Dynamics in 1993 -\xa0 a deal that also saw it acquire the rights to the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon. The F-16 is the most successful fighter aircraft in the world and is used by most of the world's leading air forces. Its success has defined modern day dog fighting - an art that bulky fighter jets such as the The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA)'s F-15 struggled with."", ""Lockheed has moved past dog fighting since then. For aerospace and defense stocks, the 21st century has been all about stealth. Lockheed's F-117 'Nighthawk' and the technologies used on it dominated the stealth debate for decades, and led to the development of the world's only operational fifth generation fighter aircraft, the F-22 'Raptor'. America's crown jewel, the Raptor is an air superiority fighter designed with the singular aim of ensuring that enemy fighters cannot contest the United States Air Force's control of an airspace."", 'So, as aerospace and defense stocks continue to make magic a reality, we decided to take a look at some top stocks. Among these, the notable ones are The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), TransDigm Group Incorporated (NYSE:TDG), and RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX).', 'Andrey Khachatryan/Shutterstock.com', 'Our Methodology ', 'To make our list of the best aerospace and defense stocks, we ranked the 40 most valuable aerospace and defense stocks that trade in U.S. markets by the number of hedge funds that had bought their shares in Q3 2023.

However, this comes as no surprise as countries tend to spend a significant portion of their GDP on their military to strengthen defenses and stay competitive in the world, every year. At the same time, there are also some countries with no army, navy, or air force (See: 15 Countries that have no Army, Navy, or Air Force) but continue to thrive, thanks to the agreements they have with strong countries like the US, France, and Australia to protect them against attacks of any sort.

But are they also the strongest when it comes to reserve military manpower?\xa0', 'Reserve military are soldiers who have serve some years in the military and then join the Army Reserves or National Guard. Reservists get military perks as they are part of the military without devoting themselves full-time to the military. Military benefits from reserve manpower in times of emergencies as they can call reservists anytime to duty when the country is in need. Some countries are facing a decline in their active and reserve manpower despite having a high-end military. ', ""For instance, according to Pew Research, 18% of the US population was serving in the military in 1980, but the percentage dropped to 6% in 2022. They've also forecasted that although around 18.3 million veterans in the US, the numbers will decline to 12.1 million in the next 25 years — by 2048.\xa0The gradual fall in military manpower is an area of concern for the United States.

In 2021, when some U.K. investors violated those regulations, Ryanair forced them to sell their shares via an independent broker.', 'That, in addition to the fact that executives have signaled they are open to using a portion of the company’s available cash for stock buybacks, raises governance concerns, according to Barclays analysts.', '“This would add further corporate governance complexity,” wrote Andrew Lobbenberg, the head of equity research for the European transportation sector at Barclays.', 'In November, Ryanair announced its first-ever dividend of roughly $430 million. The stock rose 8% on the back of that announcement.', 'In order for O’Leary to earn the bonus payment, Ryanair will also have to see net profits of €2.2 billion, which analysts expect to happen. Ryanair has cut its profit forecast for 2023, saying it had to lower prices to keep planes full for various reasons, including the Boeing disaster with Alaska Airlines.', 'O’Leary has been the chief executive of Ryanair since 1994 and is considered to be the executive that powered the budget airline to such a prominent status in Europe. To consumers, Ryanair is known for its cheap flights across the continent. For example, a flight from London to Berlin costs just $25 dollars. To shareholders, O’Leary is known for delivering meaningful gains as he’s driven the stock price up 28% over the past 12 months. He also successfully steered the company out of the pandemic-induced travel slump that plagued airlines in 2020 and early 2021. O’Leary has brought Ryanair’s stock up 137% since it plummeted to its low of €8.45 in May 2020.', 'The case for why Ryanair’s strong performance might not continue hinges on its relationship with Boeing. The aircraft manufacturer was slated to deliver 57 737 Max planes to Ryanair this summer. Ten of those planes were reportedly already going to be late. Now, the rest of the order could be in jeopardy as well, as Boeing contends with the fallout from its recent maintenance disaster when the door of a plane blew off mid-flight at roughly 16,000 feet. Shortly after that incident O’Leary reiterated his commitment to Boeing, saying he would be happy to purchase leftover aircraft if other airlines canceled their orders. That wasn’t without chastising Boeing publicly for ignoring what he said were repeated warnings over two years to address maintenance issues. O’Leary later said he wasn’t sure if the Federal Aviation Administration’s investigation into Boeing would delay Ryanair’s order.', 'This story was originally featured on Fortune.com']"

With that, I'll now turn the call over to Jacob."", ""Jacob Thaysen: Thank you, Salli. Good afternoon, everyone. As you know, I joined Illumina as CEO a little over four months ago. In this time, part of my focus has been on meeting with customers to understand their priorities, hear their feedback and develop more collaborative relationships. Our customer thinks highly of Illumina and our solutions. And they want to work-in strategic partnerships with us to move the whole MTS ecosystem forward. Now that we have announced that we will divest GRAIL, it has been easier for our customers to plan what the future looks like with Illumina. These meetings have been instructive and inspiring. During my recent trip to Europe, I was able to see first-hand how we're working with our customers, governments and the broader genomics community to accelerate whole-genome sequencing adoption safely and more effectively and to understand rare diseases in cancers as a part of the standard-of-care."", ""I've also learned about Germany's modern project that aims to fully integrate comprehensive genomic testing into the healthcare system there beginning in Q2 this year. Within the hallways of our headquarters and several global offices I have also been connecting with our talented employees, who are committed to driving innovation and continuing to build outer genomics ecosystem. I've also had an opportunity to engage with many of you at recent investor conferences. These conversations are informing my leadership agenda and importantly have reinforced my confidence in Illumina's core business. 2023 was a dynamic year for Illumina. NovaSeq X has been the most successful high-throughput product launch in our history. We ended the year with 352 NovaSeq X shipments above the 330 to 340 we expected."", ""Amid a challenging macroeconomic backdrop that we saw many of our customers remaining constrained in their purchasing decisions. In the fourth quarter, we delivered higher-than-expected consolidated revenue of approximately $1.12 billion. Americas' revenue, which is more than half of our business was flat year-on-year. Europe revenue was up 17% year-on-year on a relatively easy prior year comparable. EMEA revenue declined 1%, although that included a 10 percentage point impact from sanctions in Russia. Greater China revenue was down 13% year-over-year, reflecting continued geopolitical challenges and local competition and mid-throughput. As I've noted before, China and our customers there are important to Illumina. We've already taken certain pricing and other strategic actions that are beginning to yield results."", ""We will share more specifics on our progress there over time. Globally, we expect our customers will remain cautious. And for now, we continue to expect 2024 results to look very similar to 2023. While some macro headlines are encouraging, we haven't yet seen that translate to increased investment in our industry and therefore have not reflected in our guidance. Joydeep will take you through more details in our guidance in a few minutes. While we cannot control the external environment, the management team and I remain committed to accelerating value creations across the enterprise. As you are aware, I've laid out three key priorities that I believe will position Illumina for accelerated growth and profitability as market conditions improve."", 'My first priority, driving our top line is centered on continuing to grow our installed base and helping customers accelerate utilization of these instruments in new and existing applications. I discussed earlier, how pleased we are with the first year of NovaSeq X shipments. The high throughput more broadly across the NovaSeq X and NovaSeq 6000, we placed more than 400 instruments in 2023. In 2024, we will support this growing installed base as customers launched large projects and more sequencing intensive applications like multiomics liquid biopsy and minimal residual disease or MRD. We anticipate ongoing high throughput instrument orders throughout 2024, primarily coming from further conversion of NovaSeq 6000 customers to the X from customer fleet expansion and long-term from new to high throughput customers.', ""So, that said, given the significant number of placements in 2023, we believe we will ultimately ship fewer high throughput instruments in 2024. As you aware, XLEAP-SBS chemistry has been the engine for our X platform, delivering significant improvements in quality, turnaround time and cost. This quarter, we'll be making XLEAP available to our mid-throughput customers. On the existing NextSeq 1k/2k instruments without having to upgrade their instruments. This offering will further strengthen our leadership position around the world and drive progress in markets such as single cell, spatial and proteomics. As we grow installed base, we'll remain focused on supporting our customers as they launched new projects. This will build momentum for consumables demand this year and going forward."", ""Already our efforts to develop this demand is paying off. In Q4, we saw higher-than-expected growth in X consumables sales following the late October, launch of our much anticipated 25B reagent kit. More recently in January, we launched a 1.5B kit, which together with the 25B and 10B flow cells allows us to offer a full suite of products to the NovaSeq X customers. While we will continue to see customers reduce their inventories of NovaSeq 6000 consumables as they transition to the X building pull-through on the NovaSeq X will drive our overall high-throughput consumables growth this year. Turning to my second priority. I'm focused on delivering operational excellence, by applying greater rigor throughout our P&L while sustaining innovation and growth."", ""We've launched and multi-year effort, focusing on improving our margins through greater productivity and pursuing additional areas for cost-savings. In January, we took an additional action to further optimize our global workforce. Over the past year, we've made cumulative role reductions totaling approximately 12%. Our most recent actions included adjustment that we aligned with our late 2023, portfolio optimization efforts. You'll see us continue to take steps to not only manage our near-term cost, but also to build our agility to deliver more sustained growth and margins over time. Illumina is taking a highly disciplined approach to support our customers, employees and partners and to deliver shareholder returns. Throughout a range of macroeconomic environments."", ""Moving to my third priority, which is working to resolve GRAIL as quick as possible. Since joining Illumina, I've made an imperative to move with speed on GRAIL. In December, we announced that we would divest GRAIL, with a goal of finalizing the terms of the transactions by the end-of-the second-quarter this year. We'll continue to pursue parallel paths. The divestiture will be executed through a third-party sale or capital markets transaction, consistent with the European Commission divestiture order. To-date, we've been able to make swift progress GRAIL, From 10 has been confidentially filed with the SEC. Our advisors are actively moving the process forward on both sale and capital market path. The special committee of the Board, that we established in Q3 continues to help ensure this process move forward efficiently."", ""I'm encouraged by the momentum we've entered 2024 with and I'm committed to seeing our initiative through for now I will ask Joydeep to share more detail on our results for 2023 and our outlook for 2024."", ""Joydeep Goswami: Thank you, Jacob. I'll start by reviewing our consolidated financial results followed by segment results for Core Illumina and GRAIL and then conclude with my remarks on our current outlook for 2024, I'll be discussing non-GAAP results, which include stock-based compensation. I encourage you to review the GAAP reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures, which can be found in today's release, and in the supplementary data available on our website. In the fourth quarter, consolidated revenue of $1.12 billion was up 4% year-over-year, both on a reported and constant-currency basis. Consolidated revenue was flat from the third quarter of 2023. Non-GAAP net income was $22 million or $0.14 per diluted share, which included dilution from GRAIL's."", 'Non-GAAP operating loss of $152 million for the quarter. Non-GAAP EPS exceeded our expectations, driven by higher revenue and gross margin and lower operating expense for the quarter. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 55.4% for the quarter and 41.8% for full year 2023, compared to 29.3% in Q4 2022 and 26% for full year 2022. Although both periods reflect the impact of R&D capitalization requirements. The impact of our effective tax rate in 2023 was more significant due to our lower earnings. In addition, our non-GAAP tax-rate for both years include a meaningful impact from the consolidation of GRAIL losses. Absent the impact of GRAIL, our full year 2023 core tax rate was in the mid-20s. Our non-GAAP weighted-average diluted share count for the quarter was approximately $159 million.', 'Moving to segment results. Core Illumina fourth quarter revenue of $1.1 billion was up 3% year-over-year on both a reported and constant currency basis and included an anticipated reduction of approximately 5 percentage points from two primary categories. One, the decrease in COVID surveillance and the effect of sanctions in Russia that together represented approximately 3 percentage points. And two, the year-over-year reduction in China revenue that represented approximately 2 percentage points. Despite these impacts Core Illumina revenue exceeded expectations due to stronger than projected NovaSeq X placements and uptake in X consumables with strong early demand for the 25B flow cell that launched in Q4. Core Illumina sequencing consumables revenue of $687 million was flat year-over-year.', ""Stronger-than-expected NovaSeq X consumables purchases were largely offset by the anticipated reduction in NovaSeq 6,000 consumables and the impact of pricing transitions. As customers continue to adopt the NovaSeq X. Total sequencing consumables revenue was also impacted by COVID, Russia and China factors that I previously noted, as well as the continued impact of macroeconomic conditions on customer's purchasing behavior. COVID surveillance contributed approximately $4 million in total revenue in Q4 2023, compared to $20 million in Q4 2022. Turning to sequencing activity. Total activity on our connected high and mid-throughput instruments grew 46% year-over-year in the quarter. Following the 29% year-over-year growth we reported in Q3. Sequentially, Q4 sequencing activity grew 13% from Q3."", ""As a reminder, we believe this data is a useful reference that shows the general activity trends across our installed base and is directionally correlated with revenue over time. Sequencing instruments revenue for Core Illumina, of $161 million grew 10% year-over-year in Q4, driven primarily by NovaSeq X, which more than offset the decline in NovaSeq 6000 shipments. Growth in high-throughput instruments was partially offset by the expected decline in mid and low throughput shipments due to capital purchase and cash-flow constraints that continue to impact our customers' purchasing behaviors, as well as local competition in China. For NovaSeq X, we exited Q4 were 390 orders since launch. Our shipments of 79 NovaSeq X instruments in Q4 brought our total installed-base to 352 instruments."", ""While we expect most of our NovaSeq 6000 customers to transition to the NovaSeq X over time, we're still very early in this transition. As of the end of 2023, our net installed base for NovaSeq 6000 was approximately 1,770 instruments, which reflects approximately 110 instruments that have been deactivated, between 2017 and 2023. The majority of these were in 2023, due to customer transitions to NovaSeq X. We expect this to increase in 2024 as customers continue to ramp up utilization of NovaSeq X. Additionally, going forward, we will be reporting our annual instrument installed base figures on a net basis, which accounts for instruments that have been decommissioned or inactivated since launch. The information included on this slide includes additional details to help you with your modeling."", 'We will be posting this presentation to our Investor Relations website following our prepared remarks. Core Illumina sequencing service and other revenue of $152 million was up 16% year-over-year, driven primarily by an increase in revenue from strategic partnerships and higher instrument service contract revenue on a growing installed base. Moving to the rest of Core Illumina P&L. Core Illumina non-GAAP gross margin of 64.7% for the quarter decreased 260 basis points year-over-year, primarily driven by the mix of lower-margin strategic partnership revenue, lower instrument margins due to the NovaSeq X launch, which is typical with a new platform introduction and increased field services and installation costs, partially offset by lower freight costs.', 'Core Illumina, non-GAAP operating expenses of $507 million were down $21 million year-over-year, primarily due to continued expense reduction initiatives and lower performance-based stock-compensation expense year-over-year. As a result of these factors and higher revenue, Core Illumina Non-GAAP operating margin was 18.5% in Q4 2023 compared to 17.8% in Q4 2022. Transitioning to financial results for GRAIL. GRAIL revenue of $30 million for the quarter grew 30% year-over-year, driven primarily by adoption of Galleri. GRAIL non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $167 million and increased $1 million year-over-year. Moving to consolidated cash flow and balance sheet items for the quarter. Cash flow provided by operations was $224 million. Capital expenditures were $51 million and free-cash flow was $173 million.', ""We did not repurchase any common stock. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.05 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Moving now to 2024 guidance. As Illumina continues to move as quickly as possible to resolve GRAIL, given the uncertainty around the specific timing and impact of the GRAIL divestment, the company is focusing its 2024 financial outlook on Core Illumina. Our guidance does not assume any impact for the potential divestment of GRAIL in 2024. Upon the completion of the divestment, we will provide non-GAAP EPS guidance for the full year 2024. As Jacob mentioned, our outlook assumes the current challenging macroeconomic environment persist in 2024 and tighter funding and budget pressures continue to impact our customers' purchasing decisions."", 'We expect full-year 2024 core revenue to be approximately flat from 2023, reflecting the following offsetting factors. We expect Core Illumina sequencing instrument revenue to decline in the high-teens year-over-year, driven primarily by a decrease in NovaSeq X instrument placements. The reduction reflects the expected transition in our adoption curve, the early majority, customers from early adopters and the lower backlog entering 2024, compared to 2023. We also expect capital and cash flow constraints to continue to impact purchasing behavior and moderate instrument placements in 2024. We expect Core Illumina sequencing consumables revenue to grow in the low-single digits year-over-year, driven primarily by modest growth in high-throughput consumables as increased NovaSeq X consumables purchases and sequencing volume outpaced the expected decline in NovaSeq 6000 consumables and the impact of pricing transitions.', ""Moving to annual pull through. Going forward, we will be calculating and providing pull-through figures based on the instruments' net installed base. As I mentioned previously, supplemental information is included in our earnings presentation. To help with modeling, which will be posted to our Investor Relations website. Following our prepared remarks. Importantly, this does not change reported revenue in any way. We expect annual pull-through for NovaSeq 6000 approximately $700,000 to $800,000 per system in 2024 as customers continue to transition sequencing volume to NovaSeq X. We expect annual pull-through for NextSeq 1k/2k in the range of $80,000 to $130,000 per system in 2024, which primarily reflects the impact of customers transitioning to XLEAP chemistry as it becomes available on NextSeq 1k/2k."", 'We expect annual pull-through for MiSeq in the range of $30,000 to $40,000. We expect the remainder of our pull-through ranges to be in line with historical guidance. We expect Core Illumina total sequencing revenue to be approximately flat year-over-year. This includes intercompany sales to GRAIL of approximately $30 million, which are eliminated in consolidation. We expect Core Illumina Non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 20%. Our operating margin expectations reflect the benefit of our continued gross margin improvement and expense reduction initiatives, offset by normalization of our performance-based compensation, as well as the impacts from inflation and market-based merit increases. For the first quarter of 2024, we expect Core Illumina revenue in the range of $1.03 million to $1.04 billion, reflecting a Year-over-Year decrease of 3.5% to 4.5%, driven predominantly by the following factors.', 'We expect lower NovaSeq X instrument shipments year-over-year given that we are entering 2024 with a more modest backlog, compared to the significant pre-order book. We entered 2023, following the launch of NovaSeq X. We expect the increase in NovaSeq X consumables purchases year-over-year to be largely offset by the anticipated reduction in NovaSeq 6000 consumables and the impact of pricing transitions. Consistent with the trend we saw in Q4. We expect an increase in sequencing service and other revenue year-over-year, driven by strategic partnership initiatives and higher instrument service contract revenue on a growing installed base. For the first quarter, we expect Core Illumina non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 18%. Lastly, for the first quarter, we expect Core Illumina non-GAAP net other expense of approximately $12 million, with the year-over-year increase driven primarily by lower interest income on our lower cash balance following the repayment of our convertible notes in mid-2023.', 'I will now turn it back over to Jacob for his closing remarks. Thank you.', ""Jacob Thaysen: Thanks, Joydeep. Before we close and move to Q&A, I want to discuss what I believe success looks like, both this year and the years ahead. Illumina has the opportunity to truly drive the next-generation sequencing ecosystem forward. We will deepen our relationships with our customers and seek out greater ways to collaborate and partner with them to drive greater adoption of NGS. Our goal is to make our customers the heroes in their labs. And to support them as they expand their work in genomics and multiomics. In turn, this will help capitalize our market-leading innovation and continue to differentiate Illumina and maintain our industry-leading position across research and clinical markets. We will also continue to drive innovation that is focused on our customers' priorities."", ""This includes evolving our sequencing platform and delivering greater sample to answer solutions. There is an opportunity to further integrate customers' workflow to build our share of wallet as we create greater value for our customers. Our comprehensive strategy work is well underway, and we will share more with you later this year.

Actual results may differ materially from our projections. We encourage you to refer to the forward-looking statements section in yesterday's earnings release and our 34x filings with the SEC, which describe risk factors that may impact future results."", 'During this call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as well as reconciliations of the differences between non-GAAP and comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release and supplemental financial data. Our earnings release and supplements are currently available on the -- for Investors page of our website at www.maac.com. A copy of our prepared comments and audio recording of this call will also be available on our website later today. After some brief prepared comments the management team will be available to answer questions. I will now turn the call over to Eric.', 'Eric Bolton: Thanks Andrew and good morning. Core FFO results for the fourth quarter were ahead of our expectations. Higher non-same-store NOI performance and lower interest expense drove the outperformance. As expected during the fourth quarter, a combination of higher new supply and a seasonal slowdown in leasing traffic increasingly weighed on new resident lease pricing during the quarter. Encouragingly, we did see some of this pressure moderate in January with blended pricing improving 130 basis points from the fourth quarter performance led by improvement in new lease pricing. Stable employment conditions, continued positive migration trends, a higher propensity of new households to rent apartments and continued low resident turnover are all combining to support steady demand for apartment housing.', 'We continue to believe that late this year, new lease pricing performance will improve and we will begin to capture recovery in that component of our revenue performance. In addition, with the pressure surrounding higher new supply deliveries likely to moderate later this year, we continue to believe the conditions are coming together for overall pricing recovery to begin late this year and into 2025. As you may have seen last week, MAA crossed a significant milestone marking the 30-year anniversary since our IPO. Over the past 30 years, MAA has delivered an annual compounded investment return to shareholders of 12.6%, with about half of that return comprised of the cash dividends paid. Through numerous new supply cycles and various stresses associated with the broader economy, MAA has never suspended or reduced our quarterly dividend over the past 30 years, which, of course, is a key component of delivering superior long-term as returns to REIT shareholders.', ""Today, I'm more positive about our outlook than I was this time last year. Today, as compared to a year ago, we have more clarity about the outlook for interest rates with downward movement likely later in the year. More REITs associated with material economic slowdown or recession are dissipating. Inflation pressures on operating expenses are declining. The demand for apartment housing and absorption remained steady. And with clearly declining permits and new construction start, we have increasing visibility that competing new supply is poised to moderate. With a 30-year track record of focus on high growth markets, successfully working through several economic cycles, an experienced team and proven operating platform, a strong balance sheet and long-term shareholder performance among the top tier of all REITs, we're confident about our ability to execute on the growing opportunities in the coming year and beyond."", ""Before turning the call over to Brad, I do want to take a moment to say a big thank you to Al Campbell, who will be officially retiring effective March 31st. Al has been with our team for the past 26 years and has served as our Chief Financial Officer for the past 14 years. Al has been instrumental in the growth of our company, transitioning us to the investment grade debt capital markets and has built a strong finance, accounting, tax internal audit platform for MAA. Al leads our company and finance operation in strong hands with Clay and his team. Overall, grateful for Al's service and tremendous accomplishments. So thank you, Al, for all you've done for MAA. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Brad."", 'Brad Hill: Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. As mentioned in our earnings release, we successfully closed on 2 compelling acquisitions during the fourth quarter at pricing 15% below current replacement costs. Both properties fit the profile of the type of properties we expect to continue to emerge throughout 2024. Properties in their initial lease up, with sellers focused on certainty of execution with the need to transact prior to a definitive deadline. Our relationships with the sellers and our ability to move quickly and execute on the transactions utilizing the available capacity on our line of credit without a financing contingency were key components of MAA being chosen as the buyer for these properties. MAA Central Avenue a 323-unit mid-rise property in the Midtown area of Phoenix and MAA Optimist Park a 352-unit mid-rise property in the Optimist Park area of Charlotte are expected to deliver initial stabilized NOI yields of 5.5% and 5.9%, respectively.', ""We expect both properties to achieve further yield and margin expansion as a result of adopting MAA's more sophisticated revenue management, marketing and lead generation practices as well as our technology platform. Additionally, we expect to achieve operational synergies by combining certain functions with other area MAA properties as part of our new property potting initiative. Due to continued interest rate volatility and tight credit conditions, transaction volume remains tepid, down 50% year-over-year and 16% from the third quarter space. We continue to believe that transaction volumes will pick up later in 2024, providing visibility into cap rates and market values. For deals we tracked in the fourth quarter, we saw cap rates move up by roughly 35 basis points from third quarter."", 'Our transaction team is very active in evaluating additional acquisition opportunities across our footprint with our balance sheet in great position to be able to take advantage of more compelling opportunities as they continue to materialize later this year. Our forecast for the year includes $400 million of new acquisitions, likely in lease up and therefore, dilutive until stabilization is reached. Despite pressure from elevated new supply, our two stabilized new developments as well as our development projects currently leasing continue to deliver good performance, producing higher NOIs and earnings than forecasted in our original pro-formas, creating additional long-term value. New lease rates are facing more pressure at the moment, but these properties have captured asking rents on average approximately 20% above our original expectations.', ""Our four developments that are currently leasing are estimated to produce an average stabilized NOI yield of 6.5%. We continue to advance predevelopment work on several projects, but due to permitting and approval delays, as well as an expectation that construction costs are likely to come down. We have pushed the three projects that we plan to start in 2023 into 2024. We now expect to start between 3 to 4 projects this year, with 2 starts in the first half of the year and 2 starts late in the year. Encouragingly, we have seen some recent success in getting our construction costs down on new projects that we're currently repricing. As we have seen a meaningful decline in construction starts in our region, we're hopeful to see continued decline in construction costs as we progress through the year."", ""Our team has done a tremendous job building out our future development pipeline. And today, we own or control 13 well-located sites, representing a growth opportunity of nearly 3,700 units. We have optionality on when we start these projects, allowing us to remain patient and disciplined. Any project we start this year, we'll deliver first units in 2026, aligning with the likely stronger leasing environment supported by significantly lower supply. Our development team continues to evaluate land sites as well as additional prepurchase development opportunities. In this constrained liquidity environment, it's possible we could add additional development opportunities to our future pipeline. The team has our portfolio in good position. Our broad diversification provides support during times of higher supply with a number of our mid-tier markets outperforming."", ""As we ramp up activities in 2024, we're excited about the coming year. Beyond the new external growth opportunities just covered and as Tim will outline further, we continue to see solid demand and steady absorption of the new supply delivering across our markets and remain convinced that pricing trends will begin to improve late this year and into 2025. In addition, we continue to make progress on several new initiatives aimed at further enhancing our leasing platform to further position us to outperform local market leasing metrics during the supply cycle. Before I turn the call over to Tim to all of our associates at the properties and our corporate and regional offices. I want to say thank you for coming to work every day, focused on improving our business, serving our residents and exceeding the expectations of those that depend on us."", ""With that, I'll turn the call over to Tim."", ""Tim Argo : Thank you, Brad, and good morning, everyone. Same-store NOI growth for the quarter was right in line with our expectations with slightly lower operating expenses offsetting slightly lower blended lease over lease pricing growth. Expanding on Eric's earlier comment on new lease pricing, developers looking to gain occupancy ahead of the holiday season and the end of the year did put further pressure on new lease pricing, particularly in November and December. However, because traffic tends to decline in the fourth quarter, again, particularly in November and December, we intentionally repriced only 16% of our leases in the fourth quarter and only about 9% in November and December. This resulted in blended lease-over-lease pricing of minus 1.6% for the quarter comprised of new lease rates declining 7% and renewal rates increasing 4.8%."", 'Average physical occupancy was 95.5% and collections remained strong, with delinquency representing less than 0.5% of bill grants. These key components drove the resulting revenue growth of 2.1%. From a market perspective in the fourth quarter many of our mid-tier metros performed well. Being invested in a broad number of markets, submarkets, asset types and price points is a key part of our strategy to capture growth throughout the cycle. Savannah, Richmond, Charleston and Greenville are examples of markets that led the portfolio and lease-over-lease pricing performance. The Washington, D.C. metro area, Houston and to a lesser extent, Dallas/Fort Worth for larger metros that held up well. Austin and Jacksonville are 2 markets that continue to be more negatively impacted by the level of supply being delivered into those markets.', ""Touching on some other highlights during the quarter. We continued our various product upgrade and redevelopment initiatives in the fourth quarter. For the quarter, we completed nearly 1,400 interior unit upgrades, bringing our full year total to just under 6,900 units. We completed over 21,000 smart home upgrades in 2023 and now have over 93,000 units with this technology and we expect to complete the remaining few properties in 2024. For our repositioning program, we have 5 active projects that are in the repricing phase with expected yields in the 8% range. We have targeted an additional 6 projects began in 2024, with a plan to complete construction and begin repricing in 2025. Now looking forward to 2024, we're encouraged by the relative pricing trends we are seeing thus far."", 'As noted by Eric, blended pricing in January, it was 130 basis points better than the fourth quarter. This is comprised of new lease pricing of negative 6.2%, an 80 basis point improvement for the fourth quarter and notably a 150 basis point improvement from December and renewal pricing of 5.1%, an improvement of 30 basis points from the fourth quarter, while maintaining stable occupancy of 95.4%. Similarly, renewal increases achieved thus far in February and March average around 5%. As noted, new supply being delivered continues to be a headwind in many of our markets. While we do expect this new supply will continue to pressure pricing for much of 2024, we believe we have likely already seen the maximum impact to new lease pricing and that the outlook is better for late 2024 and into 2025.', 'It varies by market, but on average, new construction starts in our portfolio footprint peaked in the second quarter of 2022. Based on typical delivery time lines, this suggests peak deliveries likely in the middle of this year with some positive impact of pricing power soon thereafter. While increasing supply is impactful, strength of demand is more indicative of the pricing power in a particular market. Job growth is expected to moderate some in 2024 as compared to 2023, but growth is still expected to be strongest in the Sunbelt markets. Job growth combined with continued in-migration accelerates the key demand factor of household formation. Separately, the cost gap between owning and renting gapped out considerably in the back half of 2023, even before considering the impact of higher mortgage rates.', ""Move out to buy a home dropped 20% in the fourth quarter on a year-over-year basis, and we expect a continued low number of move-outs due to home buying to contribute to low turnover overall in 2024. That's all I have in the way of prepared comments. Now I'll turn the call over to Clay."", 'Clay Holder: Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. Reported core FFO for the quarter of $2.32 per share was $0.03 per share above the midpoint of our quarterly guidance and contributed core FFO for the full year of $9.17 per share, representing an approximate 8% increase over the prior year. The outperformance for the quarter was primarily driven by favorable interest and the performance of our recent acquisitions and lease-up during the quarter. Overall, same-store operating performance for the quarter was essentially in line with expectations. Same-store revenues were slightly below our expectations for the quarter as effective rent growth was impacted by lower lease pricing that Tim mentioned. Same-store operating expenses were slightly favorable to our fourth quarter guidance primarily from lower-than-expected personnel costs and property taxes.', 'During the quarter, we invested a total of $20.7 million of capital through our redevelopment, repositioning and smart brand installation programs, producing solid returns and adding to the quality of our portfolio. We also funded $48 million of development costs during the quarter toward the completion of the current $647 million pipeline, leaving nearly $256 million remaining to be funded on this pipeline over the next 2 years. As Brad mentioned, we also expect to start to 3 to 4 projects over the course of 2024, which would keep our development pipeline at a level consistent with where we ended 2023, in which our balance sheet remains well positioned to support. We ended the year with nearly $792 million in combined cash and borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility, providing significant opportunity to fund potential investment opportunities.', 'Our leverage remains low with debt to EBITDA at 3.6x. And at year-end, our outstanding debt was approximately 90% fixed with an average of 6.8 years at an effective rate of 3.6%. Shortly after year-end, we issued $350 million of 10-year public bonds at an effective rate of 5.1%, using the proceeds to pay down our outstanding commercial paper. Finally, we did provide initial earnings guidance for 2024 with our release, which is detailed in the supplemental information package. Core FFO for the year is projected to be $8.68 to $9.08 or $8.88 at the midpoint. The projected 2024 same-store revenue growth midpoint of 0.9% results from rental pricing earned in of 0.5% combined with blended rental pricing expectation of 1% for the year. We expect blended rental pricing as to be comprised of lower new lease processing impacted by elevated supply levels and renewal pricing in line with historical levels.', 'Effective rent growth for the year is projected to be approximately 0.9% at the midpoint of our range. We expect occupancy to average between 95.4% and 96% for the year and other revenue items, primarily reimbursement and fee income to grow in line with effective rent. Same-store operating expenses are projected to grow at a midpoint of 4.85% for the year, with real estate taxes and insurance producing most of the growth pressure. Combined, these 2 items are expected to grow almost 6% for 2024 with the remaining controllable operating items expected to grow just over 4%. These expense projections combined with the revenue growth of 0.9% results in a projected decline in same-store NOI of 1.3% at the midpoint. We have a recently completed development community in lease-up, along with an additional 3 development communities actively leasing.', 'As these 4 communities are not fully leased up and stabilized and given the interest carry associated with these projects, we anticipate our development pipeline being diluted to core FFO by about $0.05 in 2024 and turning accretive to core FFO on later stabilization. We are expecting continued external growth in 2024, both through acquisitions and development opportunities. We anticipate a range of $350 million to $450 million in acquisitions, all likely to be in lease-up and not yet stabilized and a range of $250 million to $350 million in development investments for the year. This growth will be partially funded by asset sales, which we expect dispositions of approximately $100 million, with the remainder to be funded by debt financing and internal cash flow.', 'This external growth is expected to be slightly dilutive to core FFO in 2024 and then again, turning to accretive to core FFO after stabilizing. We project total overhead expenses, a combination of property management expenses and G&A expenses to be $132.5 million at the midpoint, a 4.9% increase over 2023 results. We expect to refinance $400 million of bonds maturing in June 2024. These bonds currently have a rate of 4% and we forecast to refinance north of 5%. This expected refinance, coupled with the recently completed refinancing activities mentioned previously, results of $0.04 of dilution to core FFO as compared to prior year.

Before making this announcement, Cigna Group was easily earning enough to cover the dividend.

Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 24% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.', ""The company has an extended history of paying stable dividends. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $0.04 in 2014, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $5.60. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 64% per annum over that time. So, dividends have been growing pretty quickly, and even more impressively, they haven't experienced any notable falls during this period."", 'Investors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. Cigna Group has seen EPS rising for the last five years, at 11% per annum. Growth in EPS bodes well for the dividend, as does the low payout ratio that the company is currently reporting.', 'Overall, we think this could be an attractive income stock, and it is only getting better by paying a higher dividend this year. The company is easily earning enough to cover its dividend payments and it is great to see that these earnings are being translated into cash flow. Taking this all into consideration, this looks like it could be a good dividend opportunity.', ""Investors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company.

I mean, really likes it.', 'In December last year, the defense major\'s board of directors roughly tripled the amount of Northrop Grumman stock that the company was authorized to buy back, to $3.8 billion. Then, just last week, the company further announced that it will ""accelerate"" that buyback plan by buying a $1 billion slug of its shares all at one go.', ""Inquiring investors want to know: What's the hurry? Why the sudden inspiration to buy so many shares, and all at once?"", ""You don't have to look far for the answer. On Jan. 25, Northrop Grumman issued a Q4 earnings report that bludgeoned its stock, which fell more than 6% on Earnings Day. Despite growing its Q4 sales 6% year over year (and its full-year sales by 7%), Northrop flipped from earning $13.46 per share in Q4 2022 to losing $3.54 per share in Q4 2023. Full-year profits got cut more than in half, falling 57% to just $13.53 per share."", 'Northrop Grumman was quick to explain the loss as arising out of two big charges taken in Q4 2023: First, the company had to take a $7.68-per-share charge for cost overruns in its fixed-price contract to build B-21 stealth bombers for the U.S. Air Force. The company also took a charge of $2.08 per share to account for changes to the value of pension fund, which it described as a ""mark-to-market"" or MTM expense.', ""Together, that's $9.76 per share in profits foregone in the quarter. But even if the company hadn't taken those charges, its profit for the quarter would have been only $6.22 per share -- a year-over-year decline of more than half. So those earnings were still pretty lousy for Northrop. It's also worth pointing out that Northrop Grumman's historically high profit margins decline in two of its three business divisions that are not tied to the B-21 program (mission systems and space systems), and only increased in the company's smallest division, defense systems."", 'Yet despite all this, Northrop CEO Kathy Warden characterized her company\'s Q4 performance as ""a strong finish to the year"" -- and just a few days later began buying back shares hand over fist. Why was that?', 'Well, obviously, the bad news was that Northrop lost money in Q4. But the good news was that sales grew in the quarter -- and, in fact, grew even more strongly than management had forecast -- and that 2023 free cash flow (FCF) came in quite strong, and in fact toward ""the high end of our guidance range.""', 'After deducting capital spending from operating cash flow, Northrop Grumman generated positive FCF of $2.1 billion in 2023. Furthermore, management forecast that FCF will grow to at least $2.25 billion in 2024, and potentially as high as $2.65 billion, which would be 26% year-over-year growth. Earnings for the quarter, adjusted for pension fund contributions, could meanwhile bounce back 84% to as much as $24.85 per share.', 'That will be quite an accomplishment if it happens, given that Northrop is guiding for no more than 5% sales growth in 2024.', 'Given these expectations for a quick turnaround in 2024, it actually makes some sense that Northrop Grumman might want to buy back shares today, when sentiment is so negative and shares are relatively cheap, rather than later, when sentiment hopefully improves, and shares become more expensive.', ""But even so, I'm not sure it's a good idea."", 'Consider: Valued on trailing free cash flow, Northrop Grumman has an enterprise value-to-FCF ratio of about 40. Valued on projected 2024 FCF, this valuation drops a bit -- but only to about 30.2 in the best-case scenario.', 'Granted, taking everything management says at face value, Northrop may be able to achieve FCF at a sustained rate of 15% annually over the next three years. But even viewed most charitably, the best valuation I can get on this stock is an EV/FCF/growth ratio of 2.0, which is about twice what a value investor like me would consider a fair price for the company.', 'I\'m afraid that, on this one, I\'m going to have to side with the folks selling Northrop last week. Northrop Grumman is no value stock.

If you want to skip our overview of the high technology aerospace and defense industry and how it's shaped the modern day world, you can take a look at the 5 Best Aerospace and Defense Stocks to Invest In. "", ""If there's one thing that can be said with certainty, it's that the defense and aerospace industry is one of the most important in the world when it comes to shaping power politics. Global geopolitics, and as the late Henry Kissinger would describe, 'realpolitik' is based on the cold, hard reality of military superiority. Traditionally, this superiority came in the form of strength in numbers - a concept that still holds true today."", ""However, along with this, another concept that has borne the test of time is the use of technology for warfare. Whether it's the Mongols who relied on brutal cavalry tactics, or the Ottoman use of gunpowder that made it a 'gunpowder empire', technology has shaped warfare and global power dynamics."", ""These days, the dominant and only superpower (some would even say a hyperpower) is the United States of America. The U.S., if you're unaware, has the most powerful military in the world, fueled by the greatest number of aircraft carriers for any military and an air force whose aircraft number in the thousands. Safe to say, aerospace plays a crucial role in maintaining American global military superiority, and by effect, it also shapes the global world order."", 'Powering the U.S. military behemoth, which also has the biggest defense budget in the world, are aerospace and defense stocks. These stocks are firms that either directly engage in providing the U.S. military, through the Department of Defense, with their combat or combat support equipment, or those that provide essential and tertiary capabilities such as the defense stock Planet Labs PBC (NYSE:PL) and Maxar Technologies whose advanced satellites carry the ability to remotely image any site in the world and provide military planners with invaluable information to inform their tactical and strategic decisions.', ""Technology sits at the heart of competing when it comes to defense and aerospace stocks, and a technological edge is precisely the reason that the U.S. is at the top of the global power food chain. American jets are envied by dictators and monarchs all over the world, and no matter what their public statements against the U.S. are, it wouldn't be imprudent to assume that they would give an arm and a leg (and then some) to get a taste of what American defense and aerospace stocks have to offer."", ""So what exactly do they offer? Well, let's start with one of the most well known defense and aerospace stocks in the world, the Bethesda, Maryland based aerospace firm Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT). Lockheed, if you're unaware, makes and sells fighter aircraft. While it also has other divisions, such as a space segment that aims to develop a colony on the Moon complete with a nuclear reactor in partnership with the National Aerospace and Space Administration (NASA), Lockheed Martin's bread and butter are airplanes. The firm in its current form came into being in the late 1990s as the U.S. defense industry consolidated (more on that later). Lockheed merged with Martin Marietta in 1995, after it acquired General Dynamics - perhaps one of the most consequential defense and aerospace stocks in the world."", ""That's a tall claim. So what made Martin Marietta so special? Well, the firm bought General Dynamics in 1993 -\xa0 a deal that also saw it acquire the rights to the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon. The F-16 is the most successful fighter aircraft in the world and is used by most of the world's leading air forces. Its success has defined modern day dog fighting - an art that bulky fighter jets such as the The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA)'s F-15 struggled with."", ""Lockheed has moved past dog fighting since then. For aerospace and defense stocks, the 21st century has been all about stealth. Lockheed's F-117 'Nighthawk' and the technologies used on it dominated the stealth debate for decades, and led to the development of the world's only operational fifth generation fighter aircraft, the F-22 'Raptor'. America's crown jewel, the Raptor is an air superiority fighter designed with the singular aim of ensuring that enemy fighters cannot contest the United States Air Force's control of an airspace."", 'So, as aerospace and defense stocks continue to make magic a reality, we decided to take a look at some top stocks.

Even when growth stocks fall with the broader market, investors can always look at the company's performance and feel confident about where the stock is headed down the road."", ""On Holding (NYSE: ONON), Roblox (NYSE: RBLX), and Uber Technologies (NYSE: UBER) are showing strong business growth that could deliver significant upside in the years to come, according to these Motley Fool contributors. But here's why these stocks could take off this year."", ""Jennifer Saibil (On Holding): If you didn't get a chance to buy Nike stock in the 1980s or Lululemon Athletica stock 16 years ago, don't miss the opportunity to buy the next big name in activewear. It's not actually next, but more like present, because Switzerland-based shoe and athletic apparel maker On Holding is catching the athletic world by storm, gaining fans, and growing its business by leaps and bounds."", ""Sales increased 47% year over year in the 2023 third quarter and 57% for the trailing nine months. That's during a time period where most retailers have been feeling massive pressure due to inflation. On is building its direct-to-consumer channels, and it's developing loyalty and an incredible brand. Its footwear is developed with its signature CloudTec technology, and the company charges premium prices for what it claims is a better product. It also has a full line of athletic apparel."", ""This is resonating with an upscale and affluent market, which is resilient during this down economy. These customers have the extra income to pay the higher prices, and they're not interested in switching down from their favored sneakers."", ""The higher prices lead to increased sales and scale, and although On hasn't been reliably net profitable since it went public, it has reported positive net income for the past three consecutive quarters. As it continues to build its brand and following without cutting its prices, that's likely to become a sustained trend. Its gross margin exceeds both Nike's and Lululemon's."", ""Despite its strong performance, On stock is down 21% since its initial public offering. Investors might be nervous about a stock that's still relatively young and only recently profitable. However, even though there's risk, the story and opportunity look compelling, and performance should only improve from here. Expect On to report positive results in its upcoming quarters and for its stock to soar this year and in the future."", ""John Ballard (Roblox): Shares of Roblox are trading well off their previous peak, but the company's resurgence in recent quarters has provided a great deal of momentum. Roblox just issued another strong earnings report that shows accelerating growth as the video game market recovers. Since September, the stock has climbed 60%, but it still offers plenty of long-term upside."", ""Not only did the company's adjusted revenue, or bookings, accelerate from a year-over-year growth rate of 20% in Q3 to 25% in the fourth quarter, but Roblox's profitable business model is starting to shine again. Free cash flow reversed last year's loss to come in at $78 million in Q4. It peaked at $599 million on a trailing 12-month basis in 2021."", ""Roblox's strong Q4 performance follows recent efforts to continue expanding its user base. Monthly active payers on the platform grew by 18%, following a successful launch on Sony's PlayStation and Meta Platforms' Meta Quest virtual reality headset."", 'While the gaming market is projected to grow at a mid-single-digit rate over the next several years, Roblox expects to grow much faster. Management is targeting more than 20% annual growth in revenue. This gives the stock plenty of upside in the next decade.', 'Jeremy Bowman (Uber Technologies): Other stocks have gotten more attention in recent years, but few have experienced the kind of turnaround that Uber has.', ""The ride-sharing giant was weighed down by massive losses coming out of its 2019 IPO, and then it got crushed by the coronavirus pandemic. However, since then, the company has cut costs, exited unprofitable geographies, and ditched ill-advised acquisitions that were no longer adding value. In short, Uber has become much more disciplined. It's no longer chasing growth in multiple directions and is focused on its core strengths in ride-sharing and food delivery."", 'Those efforts are clearly paying off in the results. Uber just capped off its first year of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) profitability as its Q4 revenue rose 15% to $9.9 billion, and gross bookings were up 22% to $37.6 billion. Profit margins continued to surge as well, with operating income coming in at $652 million, flipping a loss of $142 million in the quarter a year ago.', 'Looking ahead to 2024, Uber should continue to gain leverage as it benefits from its marketplace business model and cost discipline. For the first quarter, management forecasts gross bookings of $37 billion to $38.5 billion, and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) of $1.26 billion to $1.34 billion.', 'The company has put distance between itself and its only competitor in the U.S., Lyft, and it dominates markets in much of the rest of the world. It should continue to benefit from growing demand for ride-sharing and food delivery, and it will generate expanding margins as revenue grows.', 'The stock was a big winner last year, gaining 149%, but more gains should be in store for 2024 and beyond.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in On Holding right now?', 'Before you buy stock in On Holding, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and On Holding wasn’t one of them.

New and innovative designs have been the key drivers for the industry participants. Players focused on product innovation, store expansion, digital investments and omni-channel growth are expected to gain.

The companies showcase their products through their branded outlets and websites. Some companies distribute products via other retail stores, such as national chains, online retailers, sporting goods stores, department stores, mass merchandisers, independent retailers and catalogs.', ""A Look at What's Shaping Shoes and Retail Apparel Industry's Future"", 'Cost Headwinds: Companies in the industry are witnessing elevated costs due to factors like commodity cost inflation and reinvestments. Supply-chain constraints and elevated logistic costs have been acting as deterrents. Many companies expect increased logistic costs to hurt margins in the near term. Elevated marketing expenses, higher operating overhead and demand-creating expenses, and increased investments to enhance store and digital operations have been raising SG&A costs. Also, industry participants are witnessing rising costs to support brand campaigns and digital investments. The exit from the Russia business due to the Ukraine-Russia conflict is likely to be the key concern for some players. A tough and competitive labor market is another headwind. These factors pose a threat to the industry players’ margins.Consumer Demand Trends: Players in the industry have been benefiting from strong consumer demand for activewear/athleisure products and footwear. The trend is expected to continue in 2024. Athletic goods and apparel companies offer products from footwear, sweatshirts, leggings, pants, jackets and tops to yoga wear and running clothes for men and women.

The companies continue to innovate styles, materials and colors, and incorporate functional designs to grab a large share of the fast-growing market. Multi-functional shoes, which cater to casual and formal looks, have been gaining popularity.E-Commerce Investments: E-commerce has been playing a crucial role in the athleisure market’s growth. The companies in the market segment are looking to build a customer base through websites, social media and other digital channels. As consumers continue to shop from home, growth of athletic-inspired apparel and digital sales are likely to continue. Companies focused on expanding their athletic-based apparel lines and building on e-commerce capabilities are expected to witness growth in the long run. Efforts to accelerate deliveries through investments in supply chains and order fulfillment avenues are likely to provide an edge to industry players. Simultaneously, companies are investing in renovations and improved checkouts, as well as mobile point-of-sale capabilities, to make stores attractive.

Corporation (NYSE:VFC) filed its quarterly result this time last week. The early response was not positive, with shares down 8.8% to US$15.35 in the past week. It was a pretty negative result overall, with revenues of US$3.0b missing analyst predictions by 8.9%. Worse, the business reported a statutory loss of US$0.11 per share, a substantial decline on analyst expectations of a profit. Earnings are an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance, look at what the analysts are forecasting for next year, and see if there's been a change in sentiment towards the company. We've gathered the most recent statutory forecasts to see whether the analysts have changed their earnings models, following these results."", ' Check out our latest analysis for V.F ', ""Following last week's earnings report, V.F's 23 analysts are forecasting 2025 revenues to be US$10.7b, approximately in line with the last 12 months. V.F is also expected to turn profitable, with statutory earnings of US$1.72 per share. Yet prior to the latest earnings, the analysts had been anticipated revenues of US$11.2b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$1.81 in 2025. The analysts are less bullish than they were before these results, given the reduced revenue forecasts and the minor downgrade to earnings per share expectations."", ""The consensus price target fell 6.5% to US$18.75, with the weaker earnings outlook clearly leading valuation estimates. It could also be instructive to look at the range of analyst estimates, to evaluate how different the outlier opinions are from the mean. There are some variant perceptions on V.F, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$57.00 and the most bearish at US$13.00 per share.

By contrast, our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in the same industry are forecast to see their revenue grow 7.1% annually for the foreseeable future. It's pretty clear that V.F's revenues are expected to perform substantially worse than the wider industry."", 'The biggest concern is that the analysts reduced their earnings per share estimates, suggesting business headwinds could lay ahead for V.F. Unfortunately, they also downgraded their revenue estimates, and our data indicates underperformance compared to the wider industry. Even so, earnings per share are more important to the intrinsic value of the business. Furthermore, the analysts also cut their price targets, suggesting that the latest news has led to greater pessimism about the intrinsic value of the business.', ""With that in mind, we wouldn't be too quick to come to a conclusion on V.F. Long-term earnings power is much more important than next year's profits.

Even though the dividend went up, the yield is still quite low at only 1.7%.', ' Check out our latest analysis for Fox ', ""The dividend yield is a little bit low, but sustainability of the payments is also an important part of evaluating an income stock. However, Fox's earnings easily cover the dividend. As a result, a large proportion of what it earned was being reinvested back into the business."", 'Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 120.7%. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 14%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.', ""It is great to see that Fox has been paying a stable dividend for a number of years now, however we want to be a bit cautious about whether this will remain true through a full economic cycle. Since 2019, the annual payment back then was $0.46, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $0.52. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 2.5% per annum over that time. Modest dividend growth is good to see, especially with the payments being relatively stable. However, the payment history is relatively short and we wouldn't want to rely on this dividend too much."", ""The company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. Unfortunately things aren't as good as they seem. In the last five years, Fox's earnings per share has shrunk at approximately 6.6% per annum. If earnings continue declining, the company may have to make the difficult choice of reducing the dividend or even stopping it completely - the opposite of dividend growth. It's not all bad news though, as the earnings are predicted to rise over the next 12 months - we would just be a bit cautious until this can turn into a longer term trend."", ""Overall, we always like to see the dividend being raised, but we don't think Fox will make a great income stock. In the past, the payments have been unstable, but over the short term the dividend could be reliable, with the company generating enough cash to cover it. This company is not in the top tier of income providing stocks."", ""Market movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable.

Now a big part of this conversation has been-- and if you look back in the past, a lot of these companies have relied on affiliate fees and advertising in order to drive their business."", ""But now, with streaming, that's sort of out the window. We've seen linear television essentially fall off the cliff. Linear Networks' revenue in that segment fell 12% year-over-year for Disney. We've also seen some serious advertising declines. But at the same time, Linear is bringing in the profits. It's still a profitable segment for Disney."", ""Streaming? Unprofitable. Losses continue to narrow. So it's this double-edged sword for Disney. And I was digging through some of these earnings, the conversations that analysts were having following Disney's results. And one stood out to me. This is from Morningstar analyst Matthew Dolgin."", ""He said that pricing is going to be a big conversation. Because right now, we don't know the prices here. The combo service, it's reportedly going to be upwards of $40 a month. We don't know what the ESPN over-the-top service is going to be. But if they're priced too low, that's going to speed up the demise of cable TV.

Linear, not so much the future, but it's still profitable."", 'SEANA SMITH: Yeah.', ""- And now, let me get your take on this headline, which we just saw crossing from the journal, which is that Amazon's Prime Video getting to exclusively stream an NFL playoff game next season. What do you make of that and what it means for competition?"", ""ALEXANDRA CANAL: I think this points to this [? ESPN-Warner Brothers Discovery-Fox ?] bundle that we saw come out earlier this week, because it's a defensive move against big tech. We've seen big tech really lean into sports more heavily. I mean, Amazon has that Thursday Night Football deal. That's over an 11-year period."", ""Google's YouTube has the rights to NFL Sunday Ticket. Apple has a deal with the MLS. So this is a way for these legacy cable operators to distribute and produce the content and not have that big tech competition. And to know, Comcast Peacock, they got an NFL play-off game this year. Now it's going to Amazon."", ""We don't have much details around it. But again, I think it points to how sports is the last frontier of streaming. You have big tech that has the big pockets, a lot of the money that they can support. How do these other players really compete against that? They're teaming up.

(NYSE:FI) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:', '“Turning to our new positions, we have been following Fiserv, Inc. (NYSE:FI) for a couple of years now and finally bought a position during the third quarter. Fiserv has two businesses that reinforce each other: it is a key technology provider to several thousand global banks and credit unions. Mid-sized financial institutions need to offer a full complement of digital banking services to compete with larger national banks, but they can’t afford to build out an internal tech capacity. It’s more cost effective to outsource to Fiserv.', 'Fiserv’s other business is, broadly, payment processing: when you tap and pay at your favorite restaurant or retailer, you may be using a Fiserv device. That device, in turn, may connect directly to the business owner’s bank – and Fiserv built out the bank’s tech stack. The synergy here is important. Fiserv can sell terminals to the restaurant itself, but banks may also sell Fiserv products as part of their customer relationships. There is terrific distribution synergy', 'For the next few years, Fiserv’s growth should be led by Clover, a payments acceptance system that offers merchants faster transaction times, better fraud protection and stronger operational controls than many existing acceptance networks. While Clover is a clear leader in acceptance, it has a small market share today and could grow at double digit rates for some years. In turn, that should drive solid earnings growth for Fiserv. I believe the stock trades for a low-teens multiple of likely 2024 earnings, an attractive price for a steady compounder.”', '\xa0', 'Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Fintech Stocks To Buy In 2024.\xa0', ' Suggested articles:', '15 Blue-Collar Jobs That Pay at Least $75,000 a Year', '25 Largest Economies in the World in 2024', '10 Best Augmented Reality Stocks Under $5', '\xa0', 'Disclosure: None.\xa010 Best Fintech Stocks To Buy In 2024\xa0is originally published on Insider Monkey.']"

(NASDAQ:PYPL) filed its annual result this time last week. The early response was not positive, with shares down 9.5% to US$56.13 in the past week. PayPal Holdings reported US$30b in revenue, roughly in line with analyst forecasts, although statutory earnings per share (EPS) of US$3.84 beat expectations, being 3.9% higher than what the analysts expected. The analysts typically update their forecasts at each earnings report, and we can judge from their estimates whether their view of the company has changed or if there are any new concerns to be aware of. We thought readers would find it interesting to see the analysts latest (statutory) post-earnings forecasts for next year.', ' View our latest analysis for PayPal Holdings ', ""Taking into account the latest results, the consensus forecast from PayPal Holdings' 40 analysts is for revenues of US$31.8b in 2024. This reflects a modest 6.9% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are forecast to shrink 8.8% to US$3.61 in the same period. Before this earnings report, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$32.0b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$4.02 in 2024. So there's definitely been a decline in sentiment after the latest results, noting the real cut to new EPS forecasts."", ""It might be a surprise to learn that the consensus price target was broadly unchanged at US$72.96, with the analysts clearly implying that the forecast decline in earnings is not expected to have much of an impact on valuation. Fixating on a single price target can be unwise though, since the consensus target is effectively the average of analyst price targets. As a result, some investors like to look at the range of estimates to see if there are any diverging opinions on the company's valuation. Currently, the most bullish analyst values PayPal Holdings at US$145 per share, while the most bearish prices it at US$56.00. We would probably assign less value to the analyst forecasts in this situation, because such a wide range of estimates could imply that the future of this business is difficult to value accurately. With this in mind, we wouldn't rely too heavily the consensus price target, as it is just an average and analysts clearly have some deeply divergent views on the business."", ""These estimates are interesting, but it can be useful to paint some more broad strokes when seeing how forecasts compare, both to the PayPal Holdings' past performance and to peers in the same industry. We would highlight that PayPal Holdings' revenue growth is expected to slow, with the forecast 6.9% annualised growth rate until the end of 2024 being well below the historical 13% p.a. growth over the last five years. By way of comparison, the other companies in this industry with analyst coverage are forecast to grow their revenue at 3.8% annually. Even after the forecast slowdown in growth, it seems obvious that PayPal Holdings is also expected to grow faster than the wider industry."", ""The most important thing to take away is that the analysts downgraded their earnings per share estimates, showing that there has been a clear decline in sentiment following these results. Fortunately, they also reconfirmed their revenue numbers, suggesting that it's tracking in line with expectations. Additionally, our data suggests that revenue is expected to grow faster than the wider industry. There was no real change to the consensus price target, suggesting that the intrinsic value of the business has not undergone any major changes with the latest estimates."", ""With that said, the long-term trajectory of the company's earnings is a lot more important than next year. We have forecasts for PayPal Holdings going out to 2026, and you can see them free on our platform here."", 'Another thing to consider is whether management and directors have been buying or selling stock recently.

Fast forward to the late 19th century, Herman Hollerith designed a punch-card system to help the government calculate the 1890 U.S. Census. According to Columbia University, the machine also saved approximately $5 million for the US taxpayer and several years of calculation for the government.

The benchmark crossed the major milestone of 5,000 for the first time ever in the latest trading session and is likely to move higher given the favorable market trends. The S&P 500 took almost three years to add 1,000 points after hitting 4,000 level on Apr 1, 2021.A solid earnings season, easing inflation data and a resilient economy are powering the rally, resulting in a gain of 4.8% so far this year.

The 4.4% earnings growth represents the best growth rate since the second quarter of 2022 (read: Should You Be Overwhelmed by Solid Q4 Earnings?

Factors such as robust retail sales, consumer sentiment and a cooling trend in the producer price index indicate the possibility of the Fed achieving a soft landing, bringing inflation back to target without triggering a recession.

That's sort of the barrier and more people don't want to buy them."", ""He thinks it's more of a price issue. We've got to have cheaper EVs to give to the masses. And the legacy OEMs like Farley at Ford and Mary Barra at GM are saying we can't necessarily afford to make cars that cheap. So we'll see. Maybe the gen two cars will be better and from a profitability point of view."", ""SEANA SMITH: And Pras, when it comes to the strategy that we're learning here, at least the companies that are most at risk when it comes to those legacy players out of what we have heard over the last two weeks in those at least short-term plans trying to navigate what is turning out to be an extremely challenging landscape, is there one that maybe is better positioned than the other just in terms of helping to stem some of those losses?"", ""PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: I would say there that's-- I would say Ford and GM are in the driver's seat because they have really strong truck businesses and that seems to not be going away. Stellantis will report next week. And they do have the RAM truck franchise, but it's not a big moneymaker as F-150, Silverado, GMC Sierra."", 'So I think if they have kind of a strong truck and SUV business, you can kind of lean on that for a little bit. But wait till oil prices go back high again, then consumers will shift over to cheaper cars. So right now, I would say those guys are in a better spot in America at least because of the fact that the trucks and SUVs.', 'SEANA SMITH: Yeah, giving them the ability to offset some of that weakness.']"

Happy Year of the Dragon! And a festive pre-Mardi Gras weekend! If you happen to be in Belgium on Tuesday, head for the Carnival in Binche. You won’t be sorry. The auto industry, however, appears to be cutting past Fat Tuesday and Lunar New Year parades and bracing for a season of belt-tightening. That sound you hear in the background as auto CEOs conduct earnings season calls with analysts is the sharpening of knives (and pencils) for more cost-cutting. The pandemic price bubble is deflating, huge EV investments aren’t paying off and China’s economy is going sideways. There are new signs that U.S. consumers – for so long the wind beneath the industry’s wings - are reaching the limits of the car loan debt they can carry. Tesla, Ford, GM – everyone’s talking about cutting the fat. It's not 2008 all over again. But it’s not 2019, either. We’ll take stock of the uncertain environment, and lots more. Have a great weekend! Laissez les bon temps rouler! Today –"", '* Tesla’s weight problem', '* The U.S. investigates Waymo', '* Nissan falls hard Tesla and the new season of austerity Elon Musk signaled to Tesla staffers this week that he’s looking into why the electric vehicle company has 140,000 employees – 31% more workers per dollar of revenue than General Motors. Tesla is structured differently from GM or Ford. Tesla produces more vehicle parts in house, it has energy and solar units, and it owns its dealer, service and charging networks. Legacy automakers outsourced sales and service to franchised dealers a century ago. Still – Tesla’s overhead costs (SG&A) were up 24% in the fourth quarter compared to a year earlier. Revenue increased by just 3.5%. And Musk warned that Tesla does not expect significant growth this year. Those are all leading indicators for a retrenchment – which is part of the cycle for companies that make cars, including Tesla, which likes to present itself as a technology company. Speaking of technology companies, they are laying off staff by the thousands as they reassess the wisdom of pandemic-era hiring sprees. Legacy automakers are squeezing budgets too. The EV capital investment and technology arms race of the past five years has given way to more sober assessments of how much “innovation” mainstream consumers are willing or able to buy.', 'Ford, for example, dug into the data streaming from connected vehicles and discovered that almost nobody was using an automated parking system that helped execute a parallel parking maneuver. That feature is now off the menu, saving $60 per vehicle – which rolls up to $10 million a year, Ford COO Kumar Galhotra told analysts. A bigger austerity driver for Ford and GM are demands from investors that the Detroit automakers hand them more of the cash being spun up by their combustion truck franchises.', ""Ford on Tuesday obliged with an 18 cents a share special dividend – a move that helped send the stock up 10% since the start of the week. Gone are the days when automakers boasted about rising “ATPs” – industry shorthand for average transaction prices. The industry is now bracing for prices to downshift. More U.S. consumers are defaulting on hefty car loans taken on during the pandemic years as car prices soared, the New York Fed reported. Read the NY Fed blog post on auto loan trouble here. In the fourth quarter, Tesla’s average revenue per vehicle delivered fell by 18% to $44,505, reflecting the impact of a year of price cutting to keep volumes from contracting. Tesla’s price chopping has had jolting knock-on effects for rival automakers, and big customers such as Hertz that relied on re-selling their used Tesla’s at yesterday's higher prices. No Mardi Gras for the auto business. It’s already Ash Wednesday in the World of Cars. Essential Reading"", '* A pinch of salt could upend the EV industry', '* Paris triples parking fees for SUVs', '* Bad climate news will make it hot for automakers Has EV hesitation hit China? Sales of “new energy vehicles” – EVs and hybrids – fell in China last month for the first time since last August. One month does not make for a reliable trend. The January slump could be payback for sales pulled in to December by automakers’ sales promotions. China’s economy overall is wobbly – prices are falling as consumers shut wallets. Still, China’s NEV sector – which includes Tesla - can ill afford a slowdown in growth, given its excess capacity. Beijing is urging Chinese automakers to invest in production abroad to counter trade barriers – copying a page from the playbook Japanese and South Korean automakers used to respond to U.S. protectionism. That makes sense – but what happens to existing NEV factories in China if electrified vehicle growth stalls out? Now Waymo has an accident problem A Waymo robo-taxi clipped a cyclist in San Francisco. The cyclist apparently suffered only scratches and left the scene. Such minor incidents between human-driven cars and cyclists happen every day. But when a robot car is involved, it’s a federal case. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is investigating the incident. Waymo reported the incident on the same day that the top lawyer for General Motors, now doubling as caretaker at the Cruise robo-taxi unit, was apologizing for Cruise’s mishandling of a much more serious incident in San Francisco last October. GM told an administrative law judge it was prepared to pay $112,500 to settle the California Public Utilities Commission’s investigation of the failure by Cruise operatives to fully disclose that a Cruise vehicle had dragged a pedestrian down a street after the victim was hit by another car. GM had initially offered to pay a $75,000 penalty. Either amount is trivial to GM. The CPUC’s suspension of Cruise’s license to operate in San Francisco and the resulting layoffs and losses at Cruise are not. Waymo is seeking approval from state regulators to expand its service in Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay area. The Cruise hearing and Waymo’s scrape illustrate the challenges facing widespread commercial deployment of automated vehicles – obstacles that last week led auto tech supplier Aptiv to throw in the towel on its investments in Motional, a would-be rival to Cruise and Waymo. Nissan takes a tumble Investors dumped shares in Nissan Friday after the company reported disappointing results, sending the automaker’s shares down by 12% - the biggest drop in two decades. The sell-off reflects the reality – obvious for some time – that Nissan is getting squeezed as Chinese automakers grab share in the world’s largest market, and South Korea’s Hyundai and Kia and other brands gain ground in the United States. In China, Nissan’s margins are crumbling as BYD and other domestic brands slash prices. In the United States, Hyundai and Kia last year accounted for 9.8% of U.S. car and light truck sales – solidifying their position as a leading alternative for customers who don’t want a Detroit brand truck or a crossover from Toyota or Honda. Nissan’s U.S. share slid to 4.7%, according to sales data compiled by Automotive News. Nissan and its now-estranged partner Renault are both hitting rough seas as they sail on separate strategic journeys. Renault, whose weakness is fueling merger rumors, closed the week on a positive note. The French champion is close to clinching a deal with China’s Geely to create a combustion engine joint venture. That news comes days after Renault scuttled plans for an IPO of its Ampere EV unit. Uber: Ride services are a business after all Uber turned a full-year profit for the first time since it went public in 2019. Surging demand for rides and delivery services boosted by the post-pandemic recovery in travel converged with stricter cost discipline. After years of effectively offering rides below cost, Uber is cashing in on its dominant scale in key markets, starting with the United States. CEO Dara Khosrowshahi and other executives have scheduled a more detailed strategy briefing for investors on Feb. 14 at 8 AM Eastern time. Uber did not announce plans to return cash to shareholders with a share buyback, which disappointed some investors. But Uber shares have gained 145% since hitting a 52-week low last April. Fast Laps Volkswagen isn’t giving up on plans to bring 25 electric vehicle models from its group of brands to the North American market by 2030, despite the uncertain near-term outlook for U.S. EV sales growth. VW is especially optimistic about the reception for its electric reincarnation of the 1960s micro-bus, the ID. Buzz, which lands in the United States late this year in numbers VW of America head Pablo Di Si expects to be insufficient to meet demand. Penske Automotive offered a revealing take on the health of competing automotive brands and the value of investing in automotive retail. Just 1% of the auto dealership operator’s stores represent Detroit brands, the company said in its Q4 investor presentation. Another point: In 2018, Penske spent $1.50 on capex for every dollar it returned to shareholders via dividends and buybacks. In 2023, that ratio flipped. Penske delivered $1.52 to shareholders for every dollar in capex. LG Chem said it agreed on a $19 billion, 10-year deal to supply EV battery cathodes to General Motors through 2035. The cathodes – enough for 5 million EVs - would come from a new U.S. factory LG plans in Tennessee. LG and GM want to capitalize on U.S. EV battery production subsidies tied to domestic production. Magna and BorgWarner warned investors of slowing growth for 2024 as demand for EV and other technology slows down, and automakers shift investment toward ramping up production of combustion vehicles. Hyundai has picked banks to run a $3 billion IPO for its Indian operations, Reuters reported.', 'Auto File is published on Tuesdays and Fridays. Think your friend or colleague should know about us?

That single transaction was for US$1.1m worth of shares at a price of US$42.59 each. That means that even when the share price was higher than US$42.33 (the recent price), an insider wanted to purchase shares. It's very possible they regret the purchase, but it's more likely they are bullish about the company. To us, it's very important to consider the price insiders pay for shares. It is generally more encouraging if they paid above the current price, as it suggests they saw value, even at higher levels."", 'Happily, we note that in the last year insiders paid US$1.3m for 31.00k shares.

Good to see you in person Paul, usually we talk remotely. So let's talk about your goodbye stock first of all. It's in the cruise industry, Royal Caribbean specifically. And like many of the cruise stocks, it's done pretty well over the past year because people are cruising and there's good forward bookings as well."", 'And you like the cruise industry but you say this company is really the best in class. Why is that?', ""PAUL GOLDING: Well, first off, they're making good on this margin expansion promise post COVID. They've changed the dynamics in which their ships are occupied and that allows for better efficiency per sailing. The other piece of it is that they manage the balance sheet best through COVID in our view and they're deleveraging quickly. So we like them for those reasons relative to the peers."", ""And we also like the fact that they have been very good at managing their fuel exposure and the fuel hedge portfolio. So it's a variety of things around revenue cost margin, just doing well in general in our view."", ""JULIE HYMAN: Yeah and the deleveraging is interesting in particular because it's expensive to have a lot of ships. And a lot of these companies are pretty debt laden. So that's an important piece of it. Now overall, you do like the cruise industry and the value proposition that they would argue that, it's an all in one deal to take a vacation on a ship."", ""PAUL GOLDING: That's right. So pre-COVID cruising was about a 15% to 20% discount to a land based alternative for the same for type of trip. Coming out of the pandemic, it got as bad as 42 to a 45% discount. Royal Caribbean has been driving price and making that back. So we like them for that as well. But we still see some runway ahead for them to continue to shrink that discount based on the value that they provide."", 'Maybe ICASS services and luxury relative to what you would spend for a similar trip on land.', ""JULIE HYMAN: Interesting, I didn't realize the discount was so big. And then also, you're talking about new ship formats. You mentioned margin expansion. What is it about these new ship formats that makes bigger opportunities to make margin?"", 'PAUL GOLDING: So as a lot of news has been generated around the launch of icon of the seas. This is the largest cruise ship in the world, but that also means the propulsion is more efficient. You can get more people on board, propelled by the same systems and the same hoteling outlay in terms of energy. But you also provide more opportunity for onboard spend.', ""Because the ship has more amenities, roller coasters and water slides, and various different amenities that make it so that the consumer wants on board can find more opportunities to spend money. And so that means that the margin profile for the business could expand over time as more ships with this format are put into service. And there's another ship coming Utopia of the seas this year, that is a large class ship."", ""JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, I was reading a little bit more about the icon of the seas today, on one of the water slides. In particular, there's an upcharge. Some of the restaurants, there's an upcharge. You can do quite a lot included in the price of the ship. But there's a lot of those opportunities as you talk about. We like to point out what the potential risks are to the bull case here."", ""And in this case, it could just be if there is a macro downturn. Let's talk about that first and then we'll get to the second point."", ""PAUL GOLDING: Sure. Macro headwinds, the consumer still needs to be interested in taking a trip and spending money on leisure services and consumer discretionary spend. So as we think about macro headwinds, the savings post pandemic have been strained, stimulus has run out. And we've seen other factors play on the consumer's propensity to spend, whether it be higher interest rates."", ""And maybe the delinquency data that we see coming out as a result of that. So over time as those things compound, there is the potential for these headwinds to subdue consumer's willingness to spend on travel."", 'JULIE HYMAN: And then what is the effect of these emission standards. I mean, speaking of icon of the seas for example, that is a ship but that because of its size, some environmental activists have been critical of it.', ""PAUL GOLDING: That's right. And in places like Europe, they've actually instituted a new emissions tax system. It's not new but the tax rate and the way that they Levy that tax is new for sailings within Europe. And so as more jurisdictions become more stringent around emissions from cruise ships or shipping in general, we could see that pose maybe a headwind to some sailings or pose a headwind to margin."", 'Not meaningful at the moment but could be more meaningful over time.', 'JULIE HYMAN: Something to watch.', 'PAUL GOLDING: Yeah.', 'JULIE HYMAN: And is this a stock that you own or the firm owns?', 'PAUL GOLDING: No.', ""JULIE HYMAN: OK, got you. OK. So let's get to the stock that you are avoiding and this is very resort. So from the seas to the mountains, we are going here with Vail. The first reason has gotten a lot of press recently and that is, there's no snow or there's less snow or it's difficult to predict how much snow is going to be. What effect is that having on Vail?"", 'PAUL GOLDING: Yeah, so in the most recent season to date update for mid 23, 24 ski season, we heard from the company that skier visits were down 16% year over year relative to the same period last year. So 16% decline on the basis of not being able to open some runs or some resorts on time because of weather. Is a significant driver of some of these risks to their business model.', ""This also is indicative of the extent to which snowmaking can't necessarily replace good weather and good snow from nature."", ""JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, that makes sense. And then also, we're talking about barriers to growth. And this has to do both with new skier acquisition, because it's expensive to ski, it's difficult to learn how to ski. And then also expansion in terms of actual physical properties. So talk us through both of those briefly."", ""PAUL GOLDING: Sure. Well, skiing requires skill. It can be dangerous if you're unskilled. It can be dangerous, even if you're skilled."", ""JULIE HYMAN: If you are skilled, it's true."", ""PAUL GOLDING: And skiing can also require that you purchase rent equipment, spend money on that, travel to a resort. Whether that's travel by car to a mountain or for destination resorts which are the bread and butter of Vail. You have to fly to a mountain at a destination. And so the cost ends up becoming a barrier to growth as well as the actual nature of the activity."", 'JULIE HYMAN: And what about growth in terms of growing properties?', ""PAUL GOLDING: Yeah. Well, it's been about a decade where Vail and its key competitor have been consolidating the industry. Acquiring resorts in North America and driving growth that way through an organic acquisition. And so as we look at Vail lately, it's been acquiring resorts in Europe to keep the acquisition momentum going. But the North American pipeline has run a bit dry."", ""JULIE HYMAN: It's limited. And we should mention, by the way, when we talk about cost of entry. I mean, an epic pass. That is all in for the Vail Resorts is more than $1,000. Which I guess if you're skiing a lot, maybe it's a bargain but that's still a high price ticket. And then lastly, congestion, the resorts that are open that do exist are crowded."", ""PAUL GOLDING: That's right. We're neutral rated on Vail and have a $225 target price and that came into effect around the time that the company was introducing epic, one day, two day, three day passes and filling in the gap between a window pass and the unlimited pass. And what that's done is, it's created congestion on the mountains. That's been noted in the press quite frequently in the prior season."", ""The companies said that they're looking to make improvements this season. But as pass penetration continues to rise, it creates the potential for more congestion.

The benchmark crossed the major milestone of 5,000 for the first time ever in the latest trading session and is likely to move higher given the favorable market trends. The S&P 500 took almost three years to add 1,000 points after hitting 4,000 level on Apr 1, 2021.A solid earnings season, easing inflation data and a resilient economy are powering the rally, resulting in a gain of 4.8% so far this year. SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY, the proxy version of the S&P 500 Index, has also risen 4.8% (read: S&P 500 Nears 5,000: Bet on High-Beta ETFs).With the S&P 500 hitting new milestones, valuations are also getting lofty, making investors wary about their investments. For those, we have highlighted five stocks in SPY that are undervalued, as reflected in their lower P/E ratio than industry peers. The constituent stocks have a strong Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and a VGM Score of B or better, suggesting their outperformance in the months to come.These include American Airlines Group Inc.

The 4.4% earnings growth represents the best growth rate since the second quarter of 2022 (read: Should You Be Overwhelmed by Solid Q4 Earnings? ETFs to Play).The resilience of the U.S. economy has played a crucial role in the S&P 500's ascent, though it has reduced the likelihood of a near-term rate cut. Factors such as robust retail sales, consumer sentiment and a cooling trend in the producer price index indicate the possibility of the Fed achieving a soft landing, bringing inflation back to target without triggering a recession. This economic resilience, coupled with surging shares of big technology companies and optimism over artificial intelligence, has been a significant driver of the market's upward trajectory."", ""According to LSEG Datastream, the forward price-to-earnings ratio for the S&P 500 rose to 20.4 times, a level last reached in February 2022, far above the index’s historical average of 15.7.

Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company's payout ratio; a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend.

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Sara Verbsky, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.', ""Sara Verbsky: Thank you, Gary, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today as we review Snap-on's fourth quarter and full year results which are detailed in our press release issued earlier this morning. We have on the call Nick Pinchuk, Snap-on's Chief Executive Officer; and Aldo Pagliari, Snap-on's Chief Financial Officer. Nick will kick off our call this morning with his perspective on our performance. Aldo will then provide a more detailed review of our financial results. After Nick provides some closing thoughts, we'll take your questions. As usual, we provided slides to supplement our discussion. These slides can be accessed under the Downloads tab in the webcast viewer as well as on our website, snapon.com, under the Investors section."", ""These slides will be archived on our website along with the transcript of today's call. Any statements made during this call relative to management's expectations, estimates or beliefs or that otherwise discuss management's or the company's outlook, plans or projections are forward-looking statements, and actual results to differ materially from those made in such statements.

Finally, this presentation includes non-GAAP measures of financial performance, which are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for their GAAP counterparts. Additional information regarding these measures is included in our earnings release issued today, which can be found on our website."", ""With that said, I'd now like to turn the call over to Nick Pinchuk. Nick?"", ""Nicholas Pinchuk: Thanks, Sara. Good morning, everybody. As usual, I'll start with the highlights of our quarter and our full year, and I'll provide my perspective on the results, on our markets and our path ahead. After that, Aldo will then give you a detailed review of the financials. The results for our fourth quarter represented that we believe, another period of forward progress. Again, we had opportunities and countered headwinds and the shape of the variated landscape changed as it regularly does. But in the end, we once again took advantage of the opportunities and overcame the turbulence. Sales in the quarter were $1,196,600 million or $1.2 billion, sounds better that way, up 3.5% as reported from last year, excluding $9.1 million of favorable foreign currency and $5.5 million from the recent Mount acquisition."", ""Organic sales increased 2.2%. The results represent a positive trend of some significance, demonstrating Snap-on's ability to adapt and to overcome market disruptions. From an earnings perspective, our OpCo operating income for the quarter was $257.9 million, and the OI margin for the quarter was $21.6 million up 10 basis points compared to last year. For Financial Services, operating earnings were $67.9 million, rising from the $63.9 million recorded last year. And the combination of the results from OpCo and from Financial Services offered an overall consolidated margin of 25.2%, also up 10 basis points. And the overall EPS was $4.75, a rise of 7.5% from the $4.42 that was registered a year ago. Now I talked about margins, let's turn to those markets and the trends we're seeing, based on our customer connections."", ""We're with customers all the time. We believe automotive repair continues to be clearly favorable. Vehicle OEMs continue to see the need for upgrading dealer repair shops and enabling the shops and servicing the blizzard of new miles and technologies making the way to the market. And preparing for that future, OEM continue, requiring dealership investments in new Under Car Equipment and essential tools to meet the challenge. It's a considerable opportunity at which Snap-on is clearly taking advantage. Activity in the independent shops is also robust. You can see it in the vehicle and repair macros, car parks. The car park is growing and getting older. Now over 12 years old on here, cars are getting more complex and more difficult to fix and reflecting all of that, service hours are up."", ""Household spending on repair is growing. Wages are rising. The number of technicians is moving upward fast and ship-owners keep shouting, they want more technicians, even louder than they have over the past years. So the underlying repair business is strong. It's prospering. It was a reality that kept the text positive, even as the financial was champing over the past years and months, the recession is coming, the recession is coming. But cash isn't everything. Cash is in everything for the people of work. Personal confidence is a balance between your current environment, the garage we see and the way you see the world evolving in sometime and sometime in the mid fall of last year, our franchisees sense that balance shifting negatively. In recent weeks, I've been around, I visited franchisees all over the country; in Nevada, South Carolina and Wisconsin, and they all said about the same thing."", ""The techs are cash rich, but because of the external bad news of getting for breakfast almost every day, the impact in the Ukraine, the war in the Middle East, the dysfunction at the border and the uncertainty of the upcoming election, the weight of it all appears to be turning the tech's, confidence poor. And when this happens, based on what we've seen in other times, we've seen it happen before, our customers keep purchasing, but they gravitate towards shorter payback items. And so it appeared to be as the quarter progressed. You saw that from mid to the end of the quarter. And so repair is strong, but the techs are worrying about the way forward, still cash rich, but they appear to be wavering in their confidence. This is a big change. Now let's move forward to critical industries."", ""That's, of course, a bit different color. Confidence seems to be abundance across that business. This is where our commercial and industrial group or C&I, plays. We continue to see progress. And again, the results in the quarter reflect that trend. It's a complex segment. A lot of you know this already, but I'm going to say the context, it's a complex segment embedded with essential techs where the penalty for failure is high. It's an arena that demands precision, functionality and repeatability, all under the most grueling environments, covering a vast range of applications from the sensitive micro world of chip manufacturing to giant rugged earthmoving equipment to performance critical aviation, things even up to spaceships. The underlying need for customization - but in that segment, the underlying need for customization and precision both, Snap-on strength is clearly growing all across those sectors."", ""C&I, is also the most geographically dispersed operations. And there's, significant variations from country-to-country and created by the uncertainties in the economic political policies. As such, we see mixed results in Europe and a continuing but slow recovery in Asia. We also see differences from sector-to-sector with education, aviation and the military, military and general industries, all showing nice improvements where natural resources and heavy-duty are off. But shining through all that variability is our expanding strength in those critical industries. The advantage Snap-on holds in product and brand and in people. And in the quarter, those drivers were on display. So across our corporation, I would characterize our markets as mixed, turbulent from period-to-period and from sector-to-sector, but filled with ongoing opportunity."", ""And we believe we're well positioned to face the challenges of today, though at the end of today and those that may arise in the future. We remain confident that we have the continuing potential along - we have continuing potential long-run run rates for growth, and we see significant power to overcome rooted in our Snap-on value creation processes of safety, quality, customer action innovation and rapid continuous improvement, especially customer connection. One of our substantial competitive advantages is being right where the actual paths are being pursued and in engineering the products to make the work easier by matching those insights, the insights gained with technology applied. We've seen that over time, we've seen that innovative offerings create the path to advance and to overcome any turbulence."", ""And in the quarter and in the year, our product line continued to advance, just kept getting stronger. And we continue to invest in Snap-on value creation to make that possible. We believe, in fact, that our product line has never been stronger. And despite the turbulence, we had more million dollar hit products in 2023 than ever before, and we believe we'll move higher again in 2023 than ever before, and we believe we'll move higher again in 2024. Now, let's talk about the full year, the 2023 performance. Sales of $4.7302 billion represented an increase of 5.3% as reported and arrived at 5.6% organically. Opco alone exceeded $1 billion. I'd say that again, $1 billion for the first time, reaching $1.399 billion and our Opco on margin of 22%, 22% represented an average increase, an increase of 110 basis points at gangbusters."", ""We've never been at 22 and 110 is a great increase. And when we include financial services earnings of $270.5 million, the consolidated operating margin for the corporation year was 25.7%, up 80 basis points. Earnings per share with the year were $18.76, rising $1.94 or 11.5%. We believe these are good numbers. Now for an individual - for the individual operation. Now for the individual operating group. So let's start with C&I. Reported sales for the C&I group in the quarter were $363.9 million, up $20.7 million or 6%. That includes $5.5 million from the recent Mountz acquisition, $3.6 million of favorable foreign currency and our organic sales increase of $11.6 million or 3.3%. They all reflecting the strength in critical industries, partially offset by a slide in automotive power tools."", ""C&I's operating income for the period was $54.1 million. It was up 12.9% and the OI margin was 14.9%, rising 90 basis points and overcoming 50 basis points of headwind associated with negative currency. Again in this case, the advance was driven by strong expansion in critical industries. And our increased kitting capacity for complex orders continue to play a large role in that progress, but significant advances also spur as a regular is by new product. Innovations like our recently launched automated tool control or ATC portal, it's the latest addition to our unique Snap-On ATC tool control product lineup. It's manufactured at our AutoCrib operation that was recently acquired in California, and the portal significantly extends the reach of our ATC systems."", ""It enables efficient control over a much wider range of device shapes and sizes. In effect, this portal's a doorway, in line with radio frequency identification or RFID antenna, it's typically a place that enters to tool. Significant assets like hydraulic pumps, portable generators and valuable diagnostic equipment are often stored in common areas in factories or other places and enter a catalog by fixing an RFID tag. As technicians scan the badge is entering with the portal, the system documents the devices will be in and out of the secured stores, keeping close track of these critical items, just like the base ATC system keeps track of hand and power tools moving in and out of the tool storage box, but over a much wider set of areas. We anticipate that the new portal will be a big boost and a great opportunity for C&I in the growing area of tool control, a very important area for us."", 'And in the fourth quarter, we saw some of that potential come to bear. So C&I, mixed progress, challenged with headwinds but clear and overall advancement, great momentum enabled by capacity expansion and by growing product power. Now to the Tools Group. The Tools Group quarter, not at our standard. But we do see a path forward adjusting to the changing environment. As you may remember, this is where we sell to the text. Those who toil the wrenches, punch the touchscreen and those who appear to be wavering in macro confidence and those customers who under these conditions shift to lower payback or quicker payback items. While the fourth quarter reflects our franchisees and the Tools Group pivoting to match that movement, that customer movement.', 'Sales in the quarter were $513.3 million included in our - and they included an organic decrease of 5.7% compared to last year. Now more to our standard, group OI margins were 21.6%, up 20 basis points, overcoming 10 basis points of negative currency and the gross margin percentage rose 200 basis points, nice gains. As the quarter played out, the franchisee sense the change and redirected their ordering and selling focus to match the customer shifts to lower - to faster payback items. And Snap-On is doing the same, defining a way forward, redirecting factory capacity, adopting smaller ticket marketing focus and launching innovative or quicker payback products that fit the environment. State-of-the-art designs, like our new ratchet for a manufacturer to Elizabeth, Tennessee factory.', ""This next evolution in our ratchet line is 102 design, we've named the Synergy series. We believe it's a game changer for technicians, a significant improvement that helps make repair work much easier. The Synergy is a short payback item that will make a clear difference right away, a 15% thinner head, an inch longer handle a 3.5-inch degree swing area, 20% more compact, all for easier access and quicker work in tight corners that they also come up like chassis areas in modern vehicles. Synergy's internal mechanisms were reengineered to engage the primary drag with 10 contact points versus the seventh in the previous design, greatly reducing the chance of slippage, improving the tools reliability and quality even while under maximum loads. Technicians may be uncertain about the way forward, but they're confident about the synergies."", ""They know with the Synergy. They know it will provide a quick payback. It's thinner, longer, stronger. And going forward, we'll expand that new technology - the new 102 technology throughout the Snap-on lineup, and we believe it will quickly become a must-have all across the industry. Also in the quarter, our Algona, Iowa manufacturing facility to reach the new quick payback, KRSC2430, a 36-inch deluxe shop cart with its with smooth mobility and a substantial payload. It offers a technician economic an attractive way to start the tools but it also allows them to position their instruments adjacent to the workplace, increasing productivity, eliminating the time walking to and from the job. As a particularly special feature, the versal lid on this cart serves as a durable workbench when open separates into 2 sections, showing full and easy - allowing full and easy access to the deep 8-inch top compartment that's underneath."", ""The unit also includes a complete power strip where technicians charge their cordless tools, diagnostic platforms, lights and other electronic devices. The innovative cards also configured with two additional jaws. There's kind of two additional drawers underneath the sliding top, providing quick accessibility for essential and small items preventing lost times from treasure hunting and large drawers or small-scale items. And it's a common problem with other units. And so this will really save time for the text. And like our top-of-the-line tool storage boxes, technicians can customize their cart, selecting from an array of colors and trims and so they can project their own personal identity throughout the shop. The KRSC2430 economical storage, attractive features convenient mobility, we expect it will have strong and continuing to appeal in this uncertain environment."", ""And shifting the product focus also requires some repositioning in the factory. Expanding the capacity to match customer preference, we're doing just that, moving to currently popular items, more dedication to short payback to products like our plexin swivel sockets and the new long nose pliers in Milwaukee, additional cart welding, breaking bottlenecks for our economical storage cart options in Algona and doubling down on synergy production in Elizabeth, Tennessee. Finally, our sales teams are being deployed to help franchisees, giving them added energy and more time in selling shorter payback items off their truck. Well, that's the Tools Group. Shifting tech preferences, pivoting operations to ensure the way forward, adapting products, capacity and sales focus, making the most of our strengths in the turbulence."", ""Now for RS&I. The group results confirmed what we've been saying all along, Snap-on is well positioned to support repair shops, dealers and independents and keeping pace with the growing complexity of the car park. RS&I sales in the quarter were $450.8 million, up $12.9 million versus last year, including an organic sales rise of $8.8 million that was authored by volume with vehicle OEM programs for new models and platforms and by strong progress in undercar for both dealerships and independent shops, gains that served to offset the decrease in the big-ticket diagnostic items. RS&I operating earnings for the quarter were $113.3 million, and the operating margin was a still strong 25.1%, but down 20 basis points, reflecting the mix shift to lower-margin under car and OEM facing and the OEM-facing activities."", 'But just like other segments, RS&I advances are driven by new products. And even the aging car park is filled with diverse and ever-changing models. Light-duty trucks and full-size SUVs are bigger than ever requiring a range of wheel configurations and sizes somewhere over 100 pounds. And at the recent repair industry, SEMA show in Las Vegas, we had one of our answers to that challenge on prominent display. Our new automated armored wheeler series wheel balancers, specifically designed for high-volume shops that require precision and reliability made from robust steel for enhanced and rugged durability. Even a small compact footprint, the balancers intelligent operating system uses sonar technologies to automatically measure both the wheel and RIM, eliminating the need for manual intervention, a great time saver in the shop.', ""And for improved safety, the unit also includes heavy-duty pneumatic for us that physicians cumbersome tires on the spindle, making it unnecessary, protects and physically lift or manipulate the heavy assembly, substantially avoiding is the strain. The balancer also includes the high resolution touch screen and an intuitive interface and an effective ergonomic design. It's a powerful combination of accuracy, speed, durability and safety and the SEMA crowd clearly noticed. So that's RS&I. Shop repair remains robust. Vehicle complexity continues to advance abundant opportunities for a great future. The group has abundant opportunities for a great future and our RSI team has the products to take advantage. Well, that's our quarter and our year."", 'For the quarter, sales up 3.5% as reported, 2.2% organically. OI margin reached 21.6%, up 10 basis points, and the EPS was $4.75, rising 7.5% and against the turbulence. The period was marked by extraordinary positives in the critical industry - in the critical industries that are C&I. The Tools Group not reaching our standard, but displaying margin gains and pivoting to match the technician shifting focus and RS&I, enabling both dealerships and independent shops to meet the challenges of higher complexity in new technologies and the full year 2023 sales of $4.7302 billion, up 5.6% organically, an OI of over $1 billion rising 10.5% and OI margin of 22%, an increase of 110 basis points, 110 basis points like that and EPS of $18.76, up $1.94 or 11.5%.', ""It was another encouraging year. Now, I'll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo?"", ""Aldo Pagliari: Thanks, Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $1196.6 billion in the quarter represented an increase of 3.5% from 2022 levels, reflecting a 2.2% organic sales gain, $9.1 million of favorable foreign currency translation and $5.5 million of acquisition-related sales. Sales were strong in our businesses serving critical industries this quarter while activity in our automotive repair market was mixed. Consolidated gross margin of 48.3%, including 20 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects compared to 48.5% last year. Benefits from lower material and other costs and savings from the company's RCI initiatives were offset by the effects of a higher mix of lower sales and lower gross margin businesses."", 'Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales improved 30 basis points to 26.7% from 27% last year, primarily due to lower corporate expenses and benefits from higher sales volumes, partially offset by increased investment in personnel and other costs. Operating earnings before financial services of $257.9 million in the quarter, compared to $248 million in 2022. As a percentage of net sales, operating margin before financial services of 21.6%, including 20 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects, compared to 21.5% last year. Financial services revenue of $97.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $88.3 million last year, while operating earnings of $67.9 million compared to $63.9 million in 2022. Consolidated operating earnings of $325.8 million in the quarter compared to $311.9 million last year.', ""As a percentage of revenues, the operating earnings margin of 25.2% compared to 25.1% in 2022. Our fourth quarter effective income tax rate of 21.4% compared to 22% last year, while our full year 2023 tax rate of 22.5% compared to 22.8% last year. Net earnings of $255.3 million or $4.75 per diluted share, reflected an increase of $16.4 million or $0.33 per share from 2022 levels and represented a 7.5% year-over-year improvement in diluted earnings per share. Now let's turn to our segment results for the quarter. Starting with the C&I group on Slide 7. Sales of $363.9 million increased from $343.2 million last year, reflecting an $11.6 million or 3.3% and organic sales gain, $5.5 million of acquisition-related sales and $3.6 million of favorable foreign currency translation."", ""Organic growth includes a double-digit gain in sales to customers in critical industries, partially offset by a double-digit decline in sales of power tools. With respect to critical industries, sales to the military were robust as was activity in the aviation sector. As previously announced, during the quarter, Snap-on acquired Mountz Inc., a leading developer, manufacturer and marketer of high-precision torque tools. The acquisition complements and expands Snap-on's torque offering for a variety of critical industry applications. The operating results of Mountz are reported within the C&I group. Gross margin improved 150 basis points to 39.2% in the fourth quarter from 37.7% in 2022. This was largely due to increased sales volumes and the higher gross margin critical industry sector pricing actions, savings from RCI initiatives and the 30 basis points of benefits from acquisitions."", 'These improvements were partially offset by 60 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales rose 60 basis points to 24.3% in the quarter from 23.7% in 2022, primarily due to a 30 basis point impact from acquisitions, as well as from investments in personnel and other costs. Operating earnings for the C&I segment of $54.1 million, including $1.4 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects compared to $47.9 million last year. The operating margin of 14.9%, including 50 basis points of unfavorable currency effects compared to 14% in 2022, reflecting an improvement of 90 basis points. Turning now to Slide 8. Sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $513.3 million compared to $542.7 million a year ago, reflecting a 5.7% organic sales decline partially offset by $1.6 million of favorable foreign currency translation.', 'The organic decrease reflects a high single-digit decline in the U.S. business, partially offset by a mid-single digit gain in our international operations. Gross margin improved 200 basis points to 45.2% in the quarter from 43.2% last year. This improvement primarily reflects decreased sales of lower gross margin products, which includes lower sales of items where the Snap-on Tools Group serves as a distributor for products made by our C&I and RS&I groups. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales rose 180 basis points to 23.6% in the quarter from 21.8% in 2022, largely due to the lower sales volume. Operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $111 million compared to $116.1 million last year. The operating margin of 21.6% compared to 21.4% in 2022.', 'Turning to the RS&I Group shown on Slide 9. Sales of $450.8 million, compared to $437.9 million in 2022, reflecting a 2% organic sales gain and $4.1 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic increase includes a high single-digit increase in activity with OEM dealerships and a mid-single-digit gain in sales of undercar equipment. These gains were partially offset by a high single-digit decline in sales of diagnostic and repair information products to independent shop owners and managers. Gross margin was unchanged from last year with benefits from lower material and other costs and savings from RCI initiatives, offset by increased sales and lower gross margin businesses. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales rose 20 basis points to 19.9% from 19.7% last year, primarily reflecting increased personnel and other costs.', 'Operating earnings for the RS&I group of $113.3 million compared to $10.6 million last year. The operating margin of 25.1% compared to 25.3% reported last year. Now turning to Slide 10. Revenue from financial services increased $8.9 million to $97.2 million from $88.3 million last year, primarily reflecting the growth of the loan portfolio. Financial services and operating earnings of $67.9 million compared to $63.9 million in 2022. Financial services expenses were up $4.9 million from 2022 levels, including $3.9 million of higher provisions for credit losses. The year-over-year increase in provision reflects both the growth of the portfolio, as well as a return to what we believe to be a more normal pre-pandemic rate of provision. For reference, our gross worldwide extended credit or finance receivable portfolio has increased 8.5% year-over-year, and we believe the delinquency and portfolio performance trends currently remain stable.', 'In the fourth quarters of 2023 and 2022, the respective average yield on finance receivables were 17.8% and 17.6%. In the fourth quarters of 2023 and 2022, the average yield on contract receivables were 8.9% and 8.6%, respectively. Total loan originations of $33.1 million in the fourth quarter represented an increase of $3.4 million or 1.1% from 2022 levels. Moving to Slide 11. Our quarter-end balance sheet includes approximately $2.5 billion of gross financing receivables with $2.2 billion from our U.S. operation. The 60-day plus delinquency rate of 1.8% for U.S. extended credit was up from 1.6% in 2022, but was the same as in the pre-pandemic period of 2019. On a sequential basis, the rate is up 30 basis points, reflecting the seasonal uptick we typically experience between the third and fourth quarters.', 'As it relates to extended credit or finance receivables, trailing 12-month net losses of $50.4 million, represented 2.59% of outstandings at quarter end, which compares to 2.51% as reported at the end of last quarter. Now turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operating activities of $296.9 million in the quarter, represented 114% of net earnings and compared to $210.6 million last year. The improvement as compared to the fourth quarter of 2022, largely reflects lower year-over-year increases in working investment, which included a reduction in inventory in 2023 as well as higher net earnings. Net cash used by investing activities of $104.6 million included $42.6 million for acquisitions, net additions to finance receivables of $42.2 million and capital expenditures of $21.1 million.', 'Net cash used by financing activities of $149 million included cash dividends of $98 million, and the repurchase of 217,000 shares of common stock for $60.9 million under our existing share repurchase program. As of year-end, we had approximately $22.9 million of common stock under our existing authorizations available for repurchase. Turning to Slide 13. Trade and other accounts receivable increased $29.6 million from 2022 year-end. Days sales outstanding of 60 days compared to 61 days as of 2022 year-end. Inventories decreased $27.2 million from 2022 year-end. And on a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 2.3% compared to 2.5% at year-end 2022. Our year-end cash position of $1.15 billion compared to $757.2 million a year in 2022. Our net debt to capital ratio of 3.8% compared to 9% at year-end 2022.', ""In addition to cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $900 million available under our credit facilities. As of year-end, there were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility, and there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. That concludes my remarks on our fourth quarter performance, and I'll briefly review a few outlook items for 2024. We expect that capital expenditures will be in the range of $100 million to $110 million. In addition, we currently anticipate that our full year 2024 effective income tax rate will be in a range of 22% to 23%. I'll now turn the call back to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?"", ""Nicholas Pinchuk: Thanks, Al. The Snap-on fourth quarter and full year. Geographic variation, shifting customer perspective, growing macro uncertainties, all overcome by Snap-on's ability to wield disadvantages making the most of opportunities, continuing its positive and upward trend now demonstrated over multiple quarters and a significant number of years. The quarter did see the change in technicians perspective. And in pivoting with just the Tools Group volume did not meet our standards, but the tools team did blunt the difficulty with favorable mix and RCI driving improvement of OI margins up 20 basis points with the gross margin rising 200 basis points. The story with repair shop owners and managers was somewhat different."", ""They recognize the need to upgrade and RS&I increase this rise in participation in OEM programs and extended its gains in undercar equipment, particularly in the expanding collision space. And finally, we saw C&I register another quarter of increasing importance to the corporation with the critical industries rising double digits and achieving another leap in margin reaching new margins, reaching new and significant levels.

We're growing 4.2% as reported 5% organically with an OI margin of 15.5%, up 140 basis points against 50 basis points of negative currency.

It owns high-quality retail, industrial, gaming, and other properties that are leased to tenants under triple net (NNN) leases. Those agreements supply it with predictable rental income because the tenants cover the variable expenses associated with the properties they occupy (real estate taxes, building insurance, and maintenance). It pays out about three-quarters of that stable income in dividends. ', 'The REIT retains the rest of its cash flow to help fund the acquisition of additional income-producing properties. Realty Income believes it has the financial resources to grow its cash flow by 4% to 5% each year. That should enable it to continue increasing its dividend. It has done that 123 times since its public market listing in 1994, growing its payout at a 4.3% compound annual rate.

It operates pipelines, processing plants, and storage terminals that generate stable income backed by long-term contracts and government-regulated rate structures.', ""Last year, MPLX produced nearly $5.4 billion in cash, more than 7% above 2022's level. That gave it the money to cover its monster cash distribution by a comfy 1.6 times, even though it increased its payout by 10% for the second straight year. It used the cash it retained to invest in expansion projects and maintain its fortress-like balance sheet. The company has several projects slated to come online over the next two years. Meanwhile, it recently made a small acquisition. These growth-related investments will increase its cash flow, giving MPLX more fuel to increase its already hefty payouts.

It sells the electricity these assets produce to utilities and large corporate buyers under long-term power purchase agreements that supply it with the predictable cash flows it uses to pay its generous dividend. ', 'The company has set a target of increasing its already sizable payouts by 5% to 8% each year, and management expects its hikes will come in toward the upper end of that range through 2026. Powering that growth are its investments in expanding its renewable energy portfolio. Clearway sold its thermal assets a couple of years ago and is recycling the proceeds from that transaction into higher-returning renewable energy investments. It has already signed deals to invest the proceeds into new projects that should close over the next few years as they go into commercial service. Those new investments give it lots of visibility into its future earnings and dividend growth.

That geographic concentration enables MAA to benefit from strong demand, which keeps occupancy levels high while driving healthy rental growth rates. Its durable and growing rental income supports the REIT's attractive dividend. "", ""After paying dividends and ensuring it's maintaining a strong balance sheet, the apartment landlord invests its remaining cash in enhancing its portfolio. It routinely redevelops older properties by renovating units to capture higher rental rates. It will also invest in new developments and acquire additional properties. For example, MAA in October spent $102 million to buy a recently completed apartment community in Phoenix. Meanwhile, it's investing nearly $650 million to develop five new communities it expects to complete over the next two years. These investments help grow its cash flow, enabling the REIT to steadily increase its dividend. It gave investors a 5% raise at the end of last year.

That gives it the money to invest in enhancing its network, paying dividends, and strengthening its balance sheet.', 'The telecom giant has increased its dividend annually for 17 straight years, the longest current streak in the U.S. telecom sector. Verizon is in an excellent position to continue increasing its payouts. Its investments in 5G should contribute to growing cash flow over time. Meanwhile, it expects its capital spending to decline in 2024 after it completed a major capital outlay early last year. That growing free cash flow will enable Verizon to pay down its debt faster, saving it money on interest expenses. It should also allow the telecom to continue increasing its big-time dividend.

GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Sign with VZ.', ""On February 9, 2024, Verizon Communications Inc (NYSE:VZ) filed its annual 10-K report, providing a detailed account of its financial performance and strategic positioning. As the leading U.S. wireless carrier, VZ continues to dominate with approximately 93 million postpaid and 21 million prepaid phone customers. The company's wireless services contribute to around 70% of its total service revenue, underscoring the segment's significance. In the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, VZ's financials reflect its strong market position, with an aggregate market value of approximately $156.3 billion as of June 30, 2023. The company's strategic focus on 5G and fiber-optic networks has bolstered its service offerings, although it faces stiff competition and must navigate a rapidly evolving technological landscape. This SWOT analysis delves into the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats as revealed by the latest SEC filing, providing investors with a comprehensive understanding of VZ's prospects."", ""Market Leadership and Brand Recognition: Verizon Communications Inc (NYSE:VZ) stands as the largest U.S. wireless carrier, a position that reflects its extensive network coverage and strong brand equity. The company's market leadership is fortified by its approximately 93 million postpaid and 21 million prepaid phone customers, which contribute significantly to its revenue stream. VZ's brand is synonymous with reliability and quality, factors that have helped it maintain a loyal customer base despite the highly competitive telecommunications landscape. The brand's strength is further evidenced by its ability to command premium pricing for its services, which translates into robust financial performance."", ""Technological Advancements and Infrastructure: VZ's commitment to technological innovation is a key strength, particularly its strategic investments in 5G technology and fiber-optic networks. The deployment of 5G networks positions VZ at the forefront of the next generation of wireless technology, offering faster speeds and lower latency. This technological edge is expected to unlock new revenue streams and enhance customer experiences. Additionally, VZ's fiber-optic network, which serves millions of homes and businesses, provides a competitive advantage in delivering high-speed internet and supports the company's fixed wireless access (FWA) broadband services."", ""High Levels of Debt: Despite its strong market position, Verizon Communications Inc (NYSE:VZ) carries a significant amount of debt on its balance sheet. The company's high level of indebtedness could limit its financial flexibility and ability to respond to market changes or invest in new opportunities. The cost of servicing this debt, especially in an environment of rising interest rates, could impact VZ's profitability and constrain its growth potential."", ""Dependence on Wireless Segment: VZ's reliance on its wireless services segment for the majority of its revenue and operating income is a potential weakness. While this segment has been a source of strength, it also exposes the company to risks associated with market saturation, technological disruptions, and shifts in consumer preferences. Diversification of revenue streams could mitigate this risk, but currently, the wireless segment's performance is critical to VZ's overall success."", 'Expansion of 5G Services: The ongoing rollout of 5G technology presents significant opportunities for Verizon Communications Inc (NYSE:VZ). As one of the leaders in 5G deployment, VZ is well-positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for high-speed, low-latency wireless services. The expansion of 5G networks is expected to drive new use cases, such as enhanced mobile broadband, IoT applications, and smart city initiatives, which could lead to increased customer acquisition and higher revenue per user.', ""Strategic Partnerships and Acquisitions: VZ has the opportunity to pursue strategic partnerships and acquisitions to enhance its service offerings and expand its market reach. Collaborations with technology companies, content providers, and other carriers could enrich VZ's portfolio and address gaps in its capabilities. Acquisitions, such as the recent purchase of Tracfone, can provide access to new customer segments and distribution channels, further solidifying VZ's market dominance."", ""Intense Competition: Verizon Communications Inc (NYSE:VZ) operates in a highly competitive market, with pressure from other telecommunications companies, cable providers, and emerging technologies. Competitors are constantly innovating and offering aggressive pricing and promotional incentives, which could erode VZ's market share and margins. The company must continuously invest in its network and services to maintain its competitive edge, which could strain its financial resources."", ""Regulatory and Technological Changes: The telecommunications industry is subject to stringent regulatory oversight, and changes in regulations could impact VZ's operations and profitability. Additionally, rapid technological advancements could render existing services obsolete or require significant investment to keep pace. VZ must navigate these challenges while ensuring compliance and adapting to new technologies to avoid falling behind in the market."", 'In conclusion, Verizon Communications Inc (NYSE:VZ) exhibits a strong market presence and technological prowess, which are central to its competitive advantage. However, the company must address its high debt levels and dependence on the wireless segment to ensure long-term stability. Opportunities in 5G expansion and strategic partnerships are promising avenues for growth, but VZ must remain vigilant against the threats posed by intense competition and a dynamic regulatory and technological environment. By leveraging its strengths and addressing its weaknesses, VZ can capitalize on emerging opportunities while mitigating potential threats, positioning itself for continued success in the telecommunications industry', 'This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

Importantly, we advanced our strategic agenda, driving consistent progress through the power of brand building, customer centricity and disciplined execution. I want to recognize our talented global teams whose creativity, passion and agility continue to fuel consumer engagement and our standout financial results. Touching on the highlights for the quarter. First, we powered global growth to achieve a 3% sales gain, demonstrating the benefits of our diversified business model. This increase was driven by 12% growth at constant currency internationally, which included 19% growth in Greater China, consistent with our expectations.', ""Further, sales to Chinese consumers globally grew at a mid-teens rate, which included continued growth with Chinese tourists. Looking ahead, we remain committed to investing in our brands, leveraging Tapestry's established platform in the region to build our business not only in China, but with this important cohort worldwide. Turning to Japan. Revenue rose 6%. And in Other Asia and Europe, sales increased 9% and 11%, respectively with each delivering strong growth against last year's double-digit gains. Finally, in North America, we delivered revenue in line with last year and better than our expectations. We are continuing to drive a healthy business, underscored by significant growth and operating margin expansion compared to last year and plan."", 'Second, we remain focused on building customer engagement across our brands. In the quarter, we acquired approximately 2.5 million new customers in North America alone, of which roughly half were Gen Z and Millennials, consistent with our strategy to recruit younger consumers to our brands. And we continue to see new customers transact at higher AUR than the balance of our customer base. At the same time, we improved lapsed customer reactivation in North America, demonstrating our ability to engage with our existing customer base while bringing new customers to our brands. Third, we delivered unique and seamless omni-channel experiences, reinforcing the benefits of our data-rich direct-to-consumer operating model. To this end, we drove mid-single-digit growth on a constant currency basis, both in stores and online as we continue to meet our customers where they choose to shop.', 'Our exceptional retail teams welcome more customers to our stores around the world, while we maintained our strong positioning in digital, which represented one-third of revenue. During the quarter, we were proud to open a new multi-brand fulfillment center in Las Vegas as we continue to invest in our omni-channel capabilities, supporting speed, sustainability and growth. Fourth, we fueled fashion innovation and product excellence by delivering compelling newness and value to consumers, which supported overall handbag AUR gains globally. At the same time, we drove growth in our small leather goods and lifestyle offerings, important for the holiday gifting season. Overall, we generated record second quarter EPS, which exceeded expectations and increased significantly compared to the prior year, highlighting the power of brand building and disciplined execution.', 'We achieved these strong results while making strategic investments in our brands to accelerate future growth. Now turning to the highlights across each of our brands, starting with Coach. We delivered another standout quarter as our team continues to fuel brand desire by bringing expressive luxury to life, a positioning that is relevant and unique to Coach. Our strategy supported by consistent execution are driving strong innovation, consumer connections and financial results, highlighted by revenue growth across geographies and significant margin expansion. Now touching on some details of the second quarter. We achieved growth in our leather goods offering fueled by our iconic platforms. Tabby again, outperformed expectations, nearly doubling versus last year and over-indexing with new and younger consumers at above-average AUR.', ""We're continuing to bring newness to this iconic family across bags and small leather goods, including the recently launched Quilted Tabby with further runway ahead. At the same time, we drove growth across the balance of the assortment anchored by our Willow and Rogue families, which remain foundational volume drivers. We also drove momentum with the recently introduced Idle Family, expanding the offering with new sizes. Overall, our creative and innovative products supported a mid-single-digit gain in global handbag AUR including growth in North America. Looking forward, we see continued opportunity for pricing improvements given our innovation pipeline and brand heat. At the same time, we fueled gains in lifestyle as we focus on building the brand's reach with consumers with the goal of powering customer recruitment, purchase frequency and ultimately, customer lifetime value."", ""In ready-to-wear, we advanced our strategy to build a core assortment of key styles that represent compelling value. Growth in the quarter was driven by outerwear. In footwear, the Leah Loafer continued to outperform. And in men's leather goods, growth was driven by success in the key Gotham, Charter, Hitch and Relay families. Next, we created purpose-led storytelling, building meaningful emotional connections with the brand. We continue to lean into the strength of the Wear your Shine campaign, which inspires consumers to use fashion as a means for personal expression and empowerment. The Shine collection included a range of gold and metallic bags, ready-to-wear and accessories, allowing customers to own their shine with confidence. We also delivered emotional content through our More than a Gift campaign, which celebrates the gifts that give us the confidence to be ourselves."", ""Overall, the success of these campaigns helped to support the acquisition of approximately 1.5 million new customers in North America, including a growing number of Gen Z and Millennials. And according to US brand tracking work fielded during the quarter, Coach saw a lift in unaided awareness versus prior year led by gains with Gen Z consumers, underscoring that our investments in brand building are working. And finally, we continue to build momentum in our sub-brand Coachtopia, a re-imagination of the product creation process to evolve our vision of circularity. During the quarter, Coachtopia's Ergo shoulder bag made with either repurposed leather or leather scraps was the top-selling style. While Coachtopia remains a small portion of the assortment, we are excited by the significant consumer attention it's receiving specifically with younger audiences."", ""In closing, Coach continues to build strength on strength, with a clear strategy, unique purpose and commitment to investing behind sustainable growth. The power of expressive luxury rooted in deep consumer insights and consistent execution is bringing new innovation, new customers and new potential to this iconic brand, and we're confident in the tremendous runway ahead. Now moving to Kate Spade. During the quarter, we continued to advance our long-term priorities, reinforcing our strategic direction. Profits were ahead of both expectations and the prior year, led by gross margin expansion, demonstrating our agility and discipline. Having said that, top line trends remain challenged. In order to realize the ambition we have for the brand, we need to accelerate our progress through improved execution."", ""To this end, we see an opportunity in three key areas. First, strengthening Kate Spade's core bag offering. Second, powering the omni-channel experience and third, driving more emotional marketing that fuels brand relevance and heat. Now I'll touch on our quarterly results in each of these focus areas in more detail. First, we are reimagining and broadening the brand's core handbag assortment across channels, creating the foundation to be a larger and more profitable brand consistent with our strategic intent. And where we've provided more newness, innovation and emotion, our customers have responded. However, the traction we've seen with new products was offset by declines in carryover families, which underperformed our expectation. This reinforces the need to move faster to build a more innovative core assortment that's required to win in today's dynamic consumer backdrop."", ""Moving forward, we are laser-focused on improving the execution of our handbag offering, bringing more relevancy to the assortment. The pipeline for the back half of the year and into fiscal year '25 will increase the penetration of newness across channels with the launch of bags featuring new materials, silhouettes and distinctive branding elements. This innovation builds on the green shoots we're seeing today, while incorporating consumer feedback and insights, which help to inform our product strategies and investments. At the same time, we'll maintain the strength of our novelty and lifestyle offerings, differentiators for the Kate Spade brand. To this point, footwear rose double-digits in the quarter, while jewelry remains an important acquisition vehicle consistent with our strategy and focus on enhancing customer lifetime value."", ""Second, the execution of a cohesive omni-channel strategy is a key opportunity to drive stronger customer engagement. During the quarter, we launched a dedicated katespadeoutlet.com site, replacing the brand' surprise site and providing a more seamless way for outlet consumers to discover and shop the brand online. Overall, by bringing a more focused and unified experience to consumers across all brand touch points, we can more efficiently scale our marketing and merchandising efforts, supporting our goal of driving sustainable direct-to-consumer growth. Third, we are focused on creating emotional marketing that fuels brand relevance and heat on a global scale. During the quarter, our marketing investments supported the acquisition of approximately 950,000 new customers to the brand in North America."", ""In keeping with our strategy to become a more global brand, we launched a series of physical activations from London to Shanghai that brought the brand's codes to life and helped to grow brand awareness internationally Moving forward, we recognize the need to distort our marketing efforts to brand building to enhance our impact. Unique storytelling has been a strength of the brand over time. And as we move into spring, we will focus on creating marketing to drive fashion credibility and customer engagement by shifting our investment to top-of-funnel marketing through the launch of our campaign anchored in the brand codes of joy, color and New York City. Finally, as we fuel enhanced innovation, we will maintain a commitment to operational excellence, positioning the brand for long-term success."", ""This focus has supported the brand's meaningful gross margin and profit expansion thus far this year and is embedded in our strategies and ways of working for the future. Overall, while we're continuing to advance our long-term strategies at Kate Spade, we're leaning in with intention to accelerate our progress. Our path forward is clear and our vision for the brand and its potential is unchanged. Turning to Stuart Weitzman. Top line results in the quarter were pressured, reflecting in part the on-going strategic reduction and off-price wholesale shipments. These headwinds were partially offset by growth in China against last year's COVID-impacted compare and continued positive wholesale POS trends. Further, we grew AUR, expanded gross margin and improved profitability versus prior year."", ""That said, we remain unsatisfied with the brand's pace of recovery, and we continue to focus on prioritizing brand health and delivering innovation for consumers. Touching on key elements of the brand's strategic growth pillars from the quarter. First, we curated a relevant offering of emotional product. We delivered growth in our core boot classification, fueled by gains in the SoHo and 5050 families. Further, we continued to build out our assortment with more seasonless casual styles, including loafers and belle flats. During the quarter, we also launched a new sneaker assortment featuring a range of innovative designs, engineered to combine fashion and function. At the same time, our handbag collection, while still a small portion of the assortment, drove growth at high AUR."", ""As we move forward, we will deliver more newness into the core assortment in keeping with rapidly evolving consumer trends. Next, we created engaging marketing to fuel brand heat and consideration. In celebration of the brand's 30th anniversary, we employed a multipronged approach to our marketing, including utilizing an array of influencers to organically engage with consumers from He Kong to Kim Kardashian to Sofia Richie Grainge. As a result, we saw brand awareness improve in the US per YouGov and drove increased customer engagement across our social channels. Similarly, in China, brand exposure rose significantly following the launch of this campaign. Overall, the Stuart Weitzman team is focused on executing against its strategic priorities, fueling brand heat and deepening customer engagement through a stronger, more diversified foundation of differentiated product and emotional purpose-led storytelling to drive enhanced growth and profitability long term."", ""In closing, Tapestry delivered a strong second quarter, positioning us to raise our earnings per share outlook for the fiscal year. Importantly, this reflects the progress we're making to advance our strategic agenda and power our iconic brands to move at the speed of the consumer in an ever-changing environment while investing in our future. We remain confident in our vision and in our ability to bring that vision to life, putting the customer at the center of everything we do to drive sustainable organic top and bottom line gains. Further, through the planned acquisition of Capri, we see a significant opportunity to accelerate our strategies while driving accretion to our strong stand-alone financial plan. Overall, we remain excited by the opportunity to expand our house of powerful brands, positioning Tapestry as a leader in innovation, talent development and shareholder returns for years to come."", ""We continue to make progress towards closing the transaction and look forward to sharing more detailed growth strategies for the future at an appropriate time. With that, I'll turn it over to Scott, who will discuss financial results, capital priorities and fiscal '24 outlook. Scott?"", ""Scott Roe: Thanks, Joanne, and good morning, everyone. As Joanne mentioned, our fiscal Q2 results exceeded expectations. We delivered top line growth, significantly expanded gross margin and drove record revenue and EPS for the key holiday quarter while generating over $800 million in free cash flow. Our strong and consistent performance demonstrates the benefit of our globally diversified direct-to-consumer business model as well as our financial discipline and agility. It's this discipline that allows us to continue to invest in long-term brand growth while delivering record earnings. Now moving to the details of the quarter, beginning with revenue trends on a constant currency basis. Sales increased 3% compared to the prior year, fueled by strong international growth of 12%."", ""In Greater China, revenue rose 19% as we anniversaried last year's COVID impacted results. At the same time, we've continued to see an uptick in travel spend from Mainland China tourist with increases across Asia and Europe. While these trends have been encouraging, sales to Chinese tourists globally remain well below pre-pandemic levels, representing further opportunity ahead. Outside of China, we drove growth in our key international regions, anniversarying strong gains in the prior year. In Japan, sales grew 6% due to increased tourist demand, and in Other Asia, revenue grew 9%, including strength in Korea, Singapore, Australia and New Zealand. In Europe, momentum continued with revenue 11% above last year. And in North America, sales were in line with the prior year and above expectations on stronger margins, supporting brand health and not chasing sales."", 'Now touching on revenue by channel for the quarter. Our direct-to-consumer business grew 4%, fueled by mid-single-digit growth in both stores and digital. And in wholesale, which represents about 10% of sales globally, revenue declined 4%, reflecting wholesale market pressure in North America, partially offset by growth in international accounts. Moving down to P&L. We delivered our strongest second quarter gross margin in over a decade, which was ahead of our expectations and 300 basis points above last year. This year-over-year expansion was driven by a benefit of 170 basis points due to lower freight expense as well as operational outperformance, fueled by geographic mix tailwinds and net pricing improvements. SG&A rose 5%, which was favorable to our forecast on both a dollar and a rate basis, reflecting operational savings compared to plan.', ""Importantly, we're continuing to tightly control costs while making ongoing strategic investments in our brands, people and business platforms. So taken together, operating margin expanded 220 basis points and operating income rose 14% compared to the prior year, both ahead of our expectations. And our record second quarter EPS of $1.63 was ahead of guidance and represented growth of 20%. Now turning to our balance sheet and cash flows. We ended the quarter with $7.5 billion in cash and investments and total borrowings of $7.7 billion, which reflects the bond financing related to the planned acquisition of Capri, which I'll touch on momentarily. Free cash flow for the quarter was an inflow of $804 million. CapEx and implementation costs related to cloud computing were $30 million."", ""And inventory levels at quarter end were 15% below prior year, reflecting our focus on disciplined inventory management and driving inventory turn. Before moving on, I did want to touch on the disruption related to the Red Sea conflict. We're closely monitoring this situation and currently estimate a modest increase in lead times and freight costs in the back half of the fiscal year, which has been incorporated in the outlook provided today. Importantly, we currently anticipate minimal impact to our operating results and customer experience given our well-positioned inventory. Turning to our dividend program. Our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.35 per common share, representing $81 million in dividend payments for the quarter."", ""For the fiscal year, we continue to expect to return approximately $325 million to shareholders through the dividend at an annual rate of $1.40 per share, a 17% increase compared to last year. Now moving to our guidance for fiscal '24, which is provided on non-GAAP basis and does not include any potential impact from the planned acquisition of Capri. Our strong second quarter results position us to raise our EPS outlook for the fiscal year, while taking a prudent approach to our second half planning. On revenue, we're maintaining our outlook on a reported basis as we reflect Coach's outperformance in the second quarter as well as moderating headwinds from FX, offset by lower expectations at Kate Spade and Stuart Weitzman. At the same time, we're raising our EPS estimate for the year, given our stronger margin results and commitment to being disciplined stewards of our brands."", 'Our guidance also reflects the strategic decision to invest a portion of our Q2 profit be back into our brands and business to support our long-term strategies. Moving to the fiscal year in further detail. We expect revenue of approximately $6.7 billion, representing an increase in the area of 1% versus prior year on a reported basis. Excluding an FX headwind of roughly 100 basis points, we anticipate constant currency sales growth of 2%. Turning to sales details by region at constant currency, which are unchanged from the ranges previously provided. In North America, we expect revenue to be in line with to slightly above prior year. This forecast contemplates our commitment to maintaining higher margins as we manage our brands and business for the long term.', 'In Greater China, we expect mid-single-digit sales growth. In Japan, revenue is forecasted to grow mid-single digits, while Other Asia is expected to increase at a low double-digit rate. And in Europe, we anticipate high single-digit growth. In addition, our outlook assumes operating margin expansion of approximately 100 basis points. We anticipate gross margin gains in the area of 200 basis points, which includes a benefit from moderating freight costs of roughly 120 basis points. On SG&A expenses, we expect deleverage of roughly 100 basis points, reflecting reinvestments in our brands, people and business in supportive growth initiatives. Moving to the below-the-line expectations for the year. Net interest expense is anticipated to be approximately $20 million.', ""The tax rate is expected to be approximately 20%, and our weighted average diluted share count is forecasted to be in the area of 233 million shares. So taken together, we're now projecting EPS of $4.20 to $4.25, representing 8% to 9% growth versus last year. Finally, before contemplating any deal-related costs, we still anticipate free cash flow of approximately $1.1 billion, and we expect CapEx and cloud computing costs to be in the area of $190 million. This forecast includes roughly half of the spend to be related to store openings, renovations and relocations mostly in Asia, with the balance primarily related to our ongoing digital and IT investments. Now let me take you through the shaping of the year. We continue to expect relatively consistent constant currency top line growth between the first half and second half at around 2%."", ""This includes the expectation for stronger growth in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter, helped by the anniversary of easier comparisons in North America. On operating income, as noted, we're utilizing a portion of our outperformance in the second quarter to reinvest in our people, brands and business. Therefore, our outlook now contemplates second half operating income to be roughly in line with the prior year. By quarter, we expect gross margin expansion in both the third and fourth quarters, with modestly higher SG&A dollar growth in Q3 versus Q4 based on the pace of our investments versus the prior year. For the third quarter specifically, we anticipate revenue to be in line with to slightly above prior year in constant currency and down slightly on a reported basis, including roughly 120 basis points of FX pressure."", 'In aggregate, we expect EPS for the third quarter to be in the area of $0.65, with growth anticipated for Q4. Now to outline our capital allocation priorities looking forward, which are unchanged. First, we will invest in our brands and businesses to support sustainable growth. Second, we will utilize our strong free cash flow for rapid debt repayment. We are committed to maintaining a solid investment-grade rating. To this end, we initiated a long-term leverage target of less than 2.5 times on a gross debt to adjusted EBITDA basis and expect to achieve that within with years of the Capri transaction close. Finally, we will return capital to shareholders through our dividend. Importantly, we believe our strong cash flow profile provides us with further opportunity for investment and capital return.', ""Following the achievement of our leverage target, over time, we expect to increase our dividend with the goal of achieving our stated target payout ratio of 35% to 40% and see the opportunity to resume share repurchases in the future. Before closing, I want to touch more holistically on the planned acquisition of Capri. We believe the acquisition will drive significant value creation with immediate accretion to adjusted earnings, enhanced cash flow and strong financial returns, underpinned by a compelling industrial logic that is consistent with our commitment to being disciplined financial operators. To this end, it's important to highlight that we continue to expect Capri to generate double-digit EPS accretion on an adjusted basis and compelling ROIC."", ""Embedded in these expectations is the assumption that the stand-alone Capri business will generate free cash flow in the area of $500 million on a non-GAAP unsynergized basis. And as noted, we've made further progress towards transaction close. In November, we issued $6.1 billion in USD and euro bonds, achieving an all-in debt interest rate of 6.5%, inclusive of Tapestry's existing debt and consistent with our expectations. Our financing strategy supports rapid debt pay-down in order to achieve our stated leverage target within 24 months post close, given the combined company's strong free cash flow generation. We're moving forward with integration planning efforts and continue to gain confidence in our ability to achieve run rate cost synergies of over $200 million within three years of closing."", ""And finally, we're continuing to work towards receiving all required regulatory approvals, and as publicly announced by the Chinese Regulatory Authority, the transaction received clearance in China. In terms of timing, we remain confident in our ability to complete the transaction with a close expected in calendar 2024, consistent with our original expectations. In closing, for the quarter, we drove strong results, highlighted by revenue gains, significant margin expansion, earnings growth and cash flow generation while continuing to invest in the long-term growth of our business. This outperformance demonstrates the power of our strategies, operating model and talented global teams. Looking forward, we will remain disciplined stewards of our brands and business with an unwavering commitment to drive sustainable, profitable growth and shareholder returns for years to come."", ""With that, I'll turn it back to the operator and take your questions."", 'Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bob Drbul of Guggenheim.', 'See also 20 Highest Quality Beers in the US and 12 Best American Bank Stocks To Buy According to Analysts.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

I've pinpointed four that will be massive winners over the coming years."", 'A microchip is at the core of every computer used to create an AI model. These components require highly specialized machinery to make them, and one of the key suppliers in this realm is ASML (NASDAQ: ASML). The company makes lithography machines, which make the conductive traces on chips.', 'Semiconductors have reached the point where the distance between these traces is as small as 3 nanometers (nm). For reference, the human hair is about 80,000 to 100,000 nanometers wide. With smaller distances between traces, these chips become more powerful and efficient -- a key need for any device.', ""ASML currently holds a technological monopoly in this space, as no other companies make EUV (extreme ultraviolet) lithography machines. If you're making cutting-edge chips, you must work with ASML. As a result, ASML will be a huge winner in this space."", ""Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM) is a huge user of these machines.

', ""But there are other ways to bet on the opportunity. Let's look at two of them and explore why Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) could also have places in your investment portfolio. "", ""While less well known than Nvidia, Super Micro Computer has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the AI opportunity. Shares have already risen 133% in 2024, capping off a gain of almost 700% over the last 12 months. And the company's stellar earnings suggest it isn't too late for investors to bet on its continued success."", ""Super Micro's second-quarter revenue roughly doubled year over year to $3.66 billion amid surging demand for its enterprise-level computers, used for data centers, websites, and, most importantly, hosting AI algorithms. "", 'The company is hugely optimistic about the sustainability of this new core growth driver, with CEO Charles Liang claiming AI could have a bigger impact than the Industrial Revolution as it spreads to more industries like autonomous driving, education, and healthcare.', ""The future of AI tech remain to be seen. But Super Micro is a particularly good way to bet on the industry because of the company's focus on hardware, which shields it from some of the competition and risks involved in creating consumer-focused software in an increasingly crowded market. "", ""Meta Platforms is a much larger company than Super Micro, but it is also capable of impressive growth, with shares already up around 30% year to date. While the social media giant has pivoted away from metaverse development to focus on AI, investors shouldn't lose sight of how the two opportunities could synergize over the long term. "", ""Meta's approach to AI development has been somewhat unconventional. The company is working on Llama, a large language model (LLM) similar to the technology behind OpenAI's ChatGPT, which will be capable of creating chatbots and other generative AI applications. However, unlike competitors, Meta has made its software open source and free for developers to use and modify to build their own programs. "", ""Meta's open-source AI strategy undermines the market for rival software from Alphabet and Microsoft and could help its Llama LLM rapidly gain market share as a way to create the next generation of AI apps. "", ""To be fair, it is still unclear how Meta plans to monetize its AI investments. However, the technology could have uses in the company's other core growth initiative: the metaverse. Generative AI is already capable of creating realistic dialogue and images. And as the technology improves, AI could be used to create practically limitless amounts of immersive content for the company's virtual reality (VR) experiences. "", 'As time goes on, AI-related hype will probably die down, and companies that benefited from the surge of investment capital will have to demonstrate sustainable operational improvements to justify their stock gains. For Super Micro, this task looks easier because it focuses on the less risky ""picks and shovels"" side of the AI industry, supplying the tools other enterprises need to build and run their applications. ', 'Meta Platforms will likely face more risk as it develops generative AI software in an incredibly competitive field. That said, the new tech could synergize with its metaverse development, giving the company an edge.

Most estimates start at the $1 trillion range and go up from there.', 'An opportunity of this magnitude has businesses and investors alike scrambling to get their piece of the pie.

In an interview with Bloomberg Technology, the chief executive said: ""AI is not in any way, shape, or form a hype cycle.

If Haas is right -- and I believe he is -- there's one AI stock I will continue buying hand over fist: Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA)."", ""It's worth taking a moment to step back and look at how Nvidia got to be one of the dominant forces in technology today. The company pioneered the modern graphics processing unit (GPU), rendering lifelike images in video games."", 'The technology that made that all possible is parallel processing, which can tackle complex mathematical processing jobs by breaking them down into manageable bits and running them simultaneously. Nvidia quickly realized that this technology had far broader applications, pivoting to apply it to earlier versions of AI, cloud computing, data centers, self-driving technology, and more.', 'The company gained an early lead in machine learning -- an earlier branch of AI -- and boasts roughly 95% of that market, according to New Street Research. So when generative AI came calling, Nvidia was ready.', ""Much of the current demand for AI comes from cloud infrastructure providers, which make generative AI available to their customers. A look at Nvidia's cloud computing customer list reads like a who's who of technology: Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Alphabet's Google Cloud, and IBM Cloud all employ Nvidia processors in their cloud operations, as do Oracle Cloud, Baidu AI Cloud, Alibaba Cloud, and Tencent Cloud."", 'Nvidia is the gold standard for speeding data through the ether, controlling an estimated 95% of the GPUs used in the data center market, according to CFRA analyst Angelo Zino. Yet the opportunity is largely untapped. Rosenblatt analyst Hans Mosesmann posits that AI has ignited an upgrade cycle in the data center industry in order to handle the computational demands of generative AI. With an installed base worth roughly $1 trillion, the runway ahead is long.', ""The speed at which Nvidia innovates makes it difficult for its rivals to gain ground. As soon as a competitor comes out with a processor that's even close to Nvidia's capabilities, the company is ready to introduce the next generation of its lightning-fast chips. The reason? Nvidia boasts an ever-growing research and development (R&D) budget that could run a small country."", ""For example, in Nvidia's fiscal 2023 (ended Jan. 29, 2023), the company spent 27% of its total revenue -- $7.34 billion in all -- on R&D, creating the next generation of its cutting-edge technology. Nvidia has already spent $6.2 billion through the first three quarters of fiscal 2024, and that number will no doubt be higher when Nvidia issues its full-year report later this month."", ""This heavy spending has kept the GPU pioneer ahead of the AI curve, which is clear in its recent results. In its fiscal 2024 third quarter (ended Oct. 29), Nvidia generated record revenue of $18.1 billion, up 206% year over year. This resulted in diluted earnings per share of $3.71, which soared 1,274%. Despite easy comps from last year's market slump, the results were nonetheless remarkable."", ""Some investors cite Nvidia's lofty valuation as a reason to avoid the stock -- an understandable but myopic view, in my opinion. The stock is selling for 92 times earnings and 39 times sales, which seems outrageous at first glance but fails to take into account the company's triple-digit growth, which management expects will continue. However, using the more appropriate price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio reveals a valuation of less than 1 -- the standard for an undervalued stock."", 'Given the company\'s industry-leading position, track record of growth, and surprisingly modest valuation, Nvidia is the one stock I plan to continue buying if AI is, indeed, ""the most profound opportunity of our lifetimes.""', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

Even though the dividend went up, the yield is still quite low at only 1.7%.', ' Check out our latest analysis for Fox ', ""The dividend yield is a little bit low, but sustainability of the payments is also an important part of evaluating an income stock. However, Fox's earnings easily cover the dividend. As a result, a large proportion of what it earned was being reinvested back into the business."", 'Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 120.7%. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 14%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.', ""It is great to see that Fox has been paying a stable dividend for a number of years now, however we want to be a bit cautious about whether this will remain true through a full economic cycle. Since 2019, the annual payment back then was $0.46, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $0.52. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 2.5% per annum over that time. Modest dividend growth is good to see, especially with the payments being relatively stable. However, the payment history is relatively short and we wouldn't want to rely on this dividend too much."", ""The company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. Unfortunately things aren't as good as they seem. In the last five years, Fox's earnings per share has shrunk at approximately 6.6% per annum. If earnings continue declining, the company may have to make the difficult choice of reducing the dividend or even stopping it completely - the opposite of dividend growth.

Discovery (WBD), and Fox (FOX, FOXA), set to launch in fall 2024, while ESPN will offer its own -over-the-top (OTT) service in fall 2025.', 'With consumers moving away from linear TV and more into streaming, will these moves help or hurt the media giant?', 'Yahoo Finance Entertainment Reporter Alexandra Canal reports on this and weighs in on the decline of cable TV consumption.', 'For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.', ""Editor's note: This article was written by Eyek Ntekim"", ""SEANA SMITH: Disney is going all in with streaming sports. The media giant announcing this week to power moves with its ESPN segment that may spell trouble for the cable bundle. Here with the details, Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal. So how--"", 'ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yes.', 'SEANA SMITH: --should we frame this and all the news that we got this week?', 'ALEXANDRA CANAL: Well, two important pieces of news. One, the ESPN over-the-top streaming service, that is going to be coming sometime in fall 2025. Separately, ESPN is also teaming up with Warner Brothers Discovery and Fox for its own sports streaming combo service that is going to debut sometime this fall.', ""But these come at a very critical time for Disney, which like many other companies within the world of media are struggling with when it comes to consumers' pivot to streaming from linear TV. Now a big part of this conversation has been-- and if you look back in the past, a lot of these companies have relied on affiliate fees and advertising in order to drive their business."", ""But now, with streaming, that's sort of out the window. We've seen linear television essentially fall off the cliff. Linear Networks' revenue in that segment fell 12% year-over-year for Disney. We've also seen some serious advertising declines. But at the same time, Linear is bringing in the profits. It's still a profitable segment for Disney."", ""Streaming? Unprofitable. Losses continue to narrow. So it's this double-edged sword for Disney. And I was digging through some of these earnings, the conversations that analysts were having following Disney's results. And one stood out to me. This is from Morningstar analyst Matthew Dolgin."", ""He said that pricing is going to be a big conversation. Because right now, we don't know the prices here. The combo service, it's reportedly going to be upwards of $40 a month. We don't know what the ESPN over-the-top service is going to be. But if they're priced too low, that's going to speed up the demise of cable TV. And if it's priced too high, it's going to hinder demand there."", ""So when we're at this critical juncture for a lot of these media companies when it comes to weighing how linear TV can offset some of the subscriber declines monetarily, I just don't know how these companies are going to get to that point, because it's clear, that chicken and egg situation where you have, this is the future streaming, but you're losing money. Linear, not so much the future, but it's still profitable."", 'SEANA SMITH: Yeah.', ""- And now, let me get your take on this headline, which we just saw crossing from the journal, which is that Amazon's Prime Video getting to exclusively stream an NFL playoff game next season. What do you make of that and what it means for competition?"", ""ALEXANDRA CANAL: I think this points to this [? ESPN-Warner Brothers Discovery-Fox ?] bundle that we saw come out earlier this week, because it's a defensive move against big tech. We've seen big tech really lean into sports more heavily. I mean, Amazon has that Thursday Night Football deal. That's over an 11-year period."", ""Google's YouTube has the rights to NFL Sunday Ticket. Apple has a deal with the MLS. So this is a way for these legacy cable operators to distribute and produce the content and not have that big tech competition. And to know, Comcast Peacock, they got an NFL play-off game this year. Now it's going to Amazon."", ""We don't have much details around it. But again, I think it points to how sports is the last frontier of streaming. You have big tech that has the big pockets, a lot of the money that they can support. How do these other players really compete against that? They're teaming up. So I think we're going to see more of that down the line. And that could lead to consolidation in the future."", ""- All right, we'll keep watching.

However, these sales were almost 21% lower than the pre-pandemic levels. The number of releases in 2023 also seemed to be discouraging. On July 4, 2023, CNBC reported that 57 films were released in more than 2,000 theaters from January to June 2019 while only 45 films were released during the same period in 2023. Many of the blockbusters during 2023's first half such as “The Flash”, “Shazam! Fury of the Gods”, and “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” performed lower than expected. On the other side of the spectrum, films that performed well included “Guardians of the Galaxy: Vol. 3″, “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse”, and “M3gan.”. The summer movie season of 2023 failed to catch up with 2022 in terms of gross. This is evident from the fact that the highest-grossing movie during the summer of 2022, “Top Gun: Maverick”, generated $555.4 million while “Guardians of the Galaxy: Vol. 3” from 2023’s summer could only make $354.9 million in gross.

This doesn’t sit right with the fact that streaming services have become increasingly popular across the world. Another concern pertained to an inconsistent source of income for the writers as modern series tend to be shorter than broadcast shows. The Writers Guild of America strike also impacted the late-night shows since hosts were reluctant to pursue the shows without their respective writers.', 'Although the underperforming summer films and the writer strike in 2023 placed pressure on the film industry in the second half of 2023, the two much-anticipated films “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” emerged as game changers and were even cited to stimulate the US economy. On July 7, 2023, CNN reported that Bank of America cardholders cut their spending on categories such as online electronics, furniture, and home improvement and spent 13.2% more on the entertainment category in the latter part of July 2023, as compared to 2022. Bank of America has also reported that the aggressive spending on entertainment was driven by films such as Barbie and Oppenheimer to some extent. Barbie witnessed the biggest opening for a female director ultimately crossing “Captain Marvel”, a film that was co-directed by Anna Boden. Simultaneously, Oppenheimer was reported to generate $80.5 million in the United States and Canada, exceeding expectations made before the film’s release.

Disney (NYSE: DIS), Warner Bros. Discovery (NASDAQ: WBD), and Fox (NASDAQ: FOX), three of the top players in linear TV, are teaming up to launch a new sports streaming service."", 'In a press release after hours on Tuesday, the media companies said they reached an understanding on principal terms to form a new joint venture for a streaming sports service, combining content from all major professional sports leagues and college sports.', ""It's unclear how much the new service would cost, but it would also offer subscribers to Disney+, Hulu, and Max the ability to bundle it with their existing subscriptions. The service would include content from networks such as ESPN and other ESPN channels, college sports networks such as SECN, ACCN, and BTN, as well as ABC, Fox, FS1, FS2, TNT, TBS, TruTV, and even ESPN+."", ""It's understandable why the three media companies are joining forces. Sports has long presented a quandary in the transition to streaming. Sports events bring in high ratings and strong ad revenue for these companies, but the cable audience is rapidly declining, and 40 million U.S. households now have high-speed internet but not pay TV."", 'The move is likely to hasten the decline of the traditional pay-TV ecosystem. A combined sports service makes sense, as a viewer interested in watching content from ESPN is also probably interested in watching sports content from Fox or TNT. Subscribing to multiple sports streaming services would be frustrating and more costly, and offering everything in one place makes it easier for the customer. It also allows the media industry to bring in more revenue than it would from individual services.', ""CBS and Paramount+ and Comcast's NBC and Peacock have been left out of the deal, but it's possible to see them joining the new venture. In many ways, the deal looks like the combination that created Hulu, which was initially a joint venture involving Disney, Fox, and Comcast before WarnerMedia took a small stake in it."", 'While the move is likely to benefit all three media companies by creating another revenue stream and tapping into an underserved audience in streaming, the real winner is probably a streaming-based company, and the most likely candidate looks like Roku (NASDAQ: ROKU).', ""The streaming distribution platform should benefit in multiple ways from the new streaming service. First, by accelerating the transition from linear TV to streaming, it's likely to create more customers for Roku, which has roughly 75 million active accounts right now."", ""More importantly, it will lead to more viewing time, especially for content that has traditionally come with a large amount of advertising. That's especially good news for Roku, as the platform typically takes 30% of advertising inventory from its streaming partners."", ""The new streaming service will almost certainly depend on Roku for viewership, as its sports audience will probably be limited to the U.S., and Roku is the country's leading streaming platform.

Now a big part of this conversation has been-- and if you look back in the past, a lot of these companies have relied on affiliate fees and advertising in order to drive their business."", ""But now, with streaming, that's sort of out the window. We've seen linear television essentially fall off the cliff. Linear Networks' revenue in that segment fell 12% year-over-year for Disney. We've also seen some serious advertising declines.

What do you make of that and what it means for competition?"", ""ALEXANDRA CANAL: I think this points to this [? ESPN-Warner Brothers Discovery-Fox ?] bundle that we saw come out earlier this week, because it's a defensive move against big tech. We've seen big tech really lean into sports more heavily. I mean, Amazon has that Thursday Night Football deal. That's over an 11-year period."", ""Google's YouTube has the rights to NFL Sunday Ticket. Apple has a deal with the MLS.

Currently, the most bullish analyst values Under Armour at US$15.50 per share, while the most bearish prices it at US$8.00. Note the wide gap in analyst price targets? This implies to us that there is a fairly broad range of possible scenarios for the underlying business."", ""Taking a look at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can understand these forecasts is to see how they compare to both past performance and industry growth estimates. It's pretty clear that there is an expectation that Under Armour's revenue growth will slow down substantially, with revenues to the end of 2025 expected to display 1.1% growth on an annualised basis. This is compared to a historical growth rate of 3.6% over the past five years. By way of comparison, the other companies in this industry with analyst coverage are forecast to grow their revenue at 7.1% per year. So it's pretty clear that, while revenue growth is expected to slow down, the wider industry is also expected to grow faster than Under Armour."", ""The most important thing to take away is that there's been no major change in sentiment, with the analysts reconfirming that the business is performing in line with their previous earnings per share estimates. On the negative side, they also downgraded their revenue estimates, and forecasts imply they will perform worse than the wider industry. Even so, earnings are more important to the intrinsic value of the business. The consensus price target held steady at US$10.01, with the latest estimates not enough to have an impact on their price targets."", ""Following on from that line of thought, we think that the long-term prospects of the business are much more relevant than next year's earnings. We have forecasts for Under Armour going out to 2026, and you can see them free on our platform here."", ""You can also see our  analysis of Under Armour's Board and CEO remuneration and experience, and whether company insiders have been buying stock."", 'Have feedback on this article?

In the \'long\' context, investors will essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher.""

The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.', 'Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.', 'Below, we take a look at F5 Networks (FFIV), a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of B. We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions, two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score.', ""It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance.

On the other hand, the S&P 500 has only moved 14.46% and 23.05%, respectively.', ""Investors should also take note of FFIV's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. Right now, FFIV is averaging 549,127 shares for the last 20 days."", 'Earnings Outlook', ""The Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things, including estimate revisions and a stock's price movement. Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank, and a nice path here can be promising. We have recently been noticing this with FFIV."", ""Over the past two months, 7 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost FFIV's consensus estimate, increasing from $12.36 to $12.58 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 6 estimates have moved upwards while there have been 2 downward revisions in the same time period."", 'Bottom Line', ""Taking into account all of these elements, it should come as no surprise that FFIV is a #2 (Buy) stock with a Momentum Score of B.

Experts predict a rebound in remote work trends in 2024 as companies navigate hybrid models. Currently, 38% of firms mandate full-time office work, down from 49% at the start of 2023.

ETFs to Play).The resilience of the U.S. economy has played a crucial role in the S&P 500's ascent, though it has reduced the likelihood of a near-term rate cut. Factors such as robust retail sales, consumer sentiment and a cooling trend in the producer price index indicate the possibility of the Fed achieving a soft landing, bringing inflation back to target without triggering a recession.

If you want to skip our discussion on the energy industry, head directly to Top 5 Oil and Gas Stocks To Invest In According To Hedge Funds.\xa0', 'Over the past decade, energy transition efforts have intensified, but macroeconomic and geopolitical challenges since 2022 have tempered progress. Governments worldwide are now focusing on the development and use of renewable energy technologies. In 2024, energy and mining companies face numerous challenges amid a complex business environment and uncertain economic outlook, as per S&P Global’s latest report. Policy developments in 2022 and 2023 have created opportunities for the energy and mining sectors, particularly in the transition to renewable energy and critical minerals. However, 2024 is expected to bring significant headwinds due to elevated interest rates and slowing economic growth. Energy and utility companies, grappling with regulatory complexities and persistent inflation, face challenges in the rollout of both renewable and traditional energy infrastructure.', ""The energy landscape is influenced by four main disruptors – geopolitical factors, macroeconomic variables (like high interest rates and rising materials costs), evolving policies and regulations, and the emergence of new technologies. These factors significantly impact demand, supply, trade, and investment in the oil and gas industry. According to Deloitte, OPEC+'s output cuts and other disruptions have driven Brent oil prices above US$90/bbl, while US Henry Hub natural gas prices rebounded to US$3.50/mmBtu in November 2023. Despite these challenges, global oil demand is expected to grow by 2.3 mbpd in 2023, surpassing 100 mbpd for the first time. Electric vehicle sales increased by over 35% in 2023, with one in seven cars sold being an EV, highlighting regional differences in demand, infrastructure, technology adoption, regulatory policies, and socioeconomic factors. The industry is poised for a solid start in 2024, supported by its strong financial position and high oil prices, barring further macroeconomic deterioration. This strength is expected to facilitate investments, dividends, and a disciplined capital program, with the global upstream industry projected to maintain a 2023 hydrocarbon investment level of about US$580 billion and generate over US$800 billion in free cash flows in 2024."", ""As per Fitch Ratings, the performance of the global oil and gas sector in 2024 is expected to be consistent with 2023 and stronger than mid-cycle levels. Oil prices are anticipated to remain high and relatively stable year-on-year, attributed to OPEC+'s production cuts, geopolitical factors, and a slowdown in US crude production. Although demand growth is expected to decelerate, the spare capacity, primarily held by OPEC, is likely to be sufficient to absorb potential shocks. Looking ahead to 2025, a decline in oil prices is assumed as OPEC+'s control over supply may ease. Companies with strong cash flow and low leverage are projected to report robust earnings in 2024, supported by favorable prices and ongoing cost control measures. The cumulative EBITDA of Fitch-rated global O&G producers is expected to slightly decrease from 2023, approximately 25% lower than in 2022. Most companies are expected to maintain or reduce capital expenditures, with only about 25% increasing capex by more than 10%. Additionally, approximately 20% of companies are projected to raise dividends by more than 10%, while the rest will either maintain or decrease dividends."", 'To benefit from the growth potential in the energy sector, some of the best stocks to buy include Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY), and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM).\xa0', 'Our Methodology\xa0', 'We chose the top energy stocks based on overall hedge fund sentiment toward each stock.

Over the past few years, the company developed into a growth darling thanks to its strong track record in renewable energy development and tailwinds from the global energy transition and incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act. The problem for NextEra, and the transition broadly, is that this transformation is immensely capital intensive and many renewables projects offer lower returns on that capital. This requires high capital expenditures – often resulting in negative free cash flow – to meet the growth and financing needs of companies like NextEra. To help, the company leaned on financial engineering by using a publicly traded limited partnership called NextEra Energy Partners, providing further capacity for its parent to continue its development plans. NEP used layers of its own financial engineering to fund its own negative free cash flow and a large, growing dividend yield that we believe it could not sustain organically. Ultimately, the higher cost of debt from rising rates led NEP to lower its own growth ambitions, driving concerns about whether NextEra can execute on its extensive backlog.

While major technology firms continued to show strong gains at the year's end, the market rally expanded across different sectors that had underperformed in 2023, including small caps, biotech/healthcare, clean energy, and financials.

Good. Then you also believe in semiconductor memory stocks. You just don’t know it yet.', 'Given the stratospheric rise of generative AI, people sing the praises of Nvidia and its peers. Specifically, their graphics processing units (GPUs) help undergird the intense processing demands of AI protocols. And since Bloomberg Intelligence believes the sector could expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 42% to hit a $1.3 trillion valuation by 2032, it’s no wonder why AI-related enterprises dominate.', 'But betting exclusively on GPUs is like asking a carpenter to renovate your home without tools. The talent and capabilities may be there but without the necessary equipment, nothing will get done. It’s same thing with memory, which is why semiconductor memory stocks are so vital.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'True, the memory market – particularly the NAND ecosystem – suffered due to various headwinds related to global supply chain, inflation and geopolitical issues.

For example, in the past 52 weeks, QCOM only gained just under 4%. Still, the market performance appears to heavily discount the company’s consistent profitability as well as its bottom-line strengths, such as excellent margins across the board. Enticingly, QCOM trades at only 15.37X forward earnings, below the sector median of 22.08X.', 'Plus, the SoC market size should expand at a CAGR of 8% to reach $253.8 billion by 2029.

The company's financial tables indicate a steadfast performance, with laboratory instruments and related services accounting for a significant portion of net sales, which have shown consistent growth over the past three years.

Motley Fool Money starts now. Welcome to Motley Fool money. I'm Deidre Woollard here with Motley analyst, Jason Moser. Jason, how's your Monday going so far?"", ""Jason Moser: Hey, so far so good it's nice weather out there. How about you, Deidre?"", ""Deidre Woollard: I'm loving our weather, but I'm thinking about our people in California who are having a bit of a tough weather time."", ""Jason Moser: Yeah. Cancel the final round of the Pebble Beach prom out there in California on Monterey. When the weather's that bad, you need to take note."", ""Deidre Woollard: Yeah, absolutely. Well, let's get into what's happening with the markets. Last week, big week, we had Meadow, we had Amazon, we had Apple, and mostly a pretty great week. This week we've got probably more earnings, but a wide variety of large company and maybe not your ones that are at the top of market moving, but really important to cover, one of them, McDonald's, you got to talk about McDonald's."", 'Jason Moser: Absolutely.', ""Deidre Woollard: Of course. I would say looking at the headlines versus look at the actual earnings sales, if you look at the headlines, it's going to be companies missing revenue targets. But I look at it., companies still able to deliver comparable sales, that increase every quarter at about a little over 4% in sales growth in the US in this quarter. Don't you think that sometimes McDonald's deserves a little more respect than it sometimes gets?"", ""Jason Moser: I absolutely do. One of the reasons why I feel that way Deidre is because in my early days here, when I first got here at the Fool, McDonald's was the company I looked at and didn't give it that credit that it deserved. I thought, you what? That's yesterday's news, and people don't want McDonald's, now they're going to Starbucks and they're going to Chipotle or whoever. No, McDonald's absolutely deserves a ton of credit."", ""I'm not a big McDonald's guy myself these days but it's impossible to ignore the success that this company has had over the course of its existence. It's easy I think to view it as perhaps an older or more challenged brand here domestically particularly, but I think when you look at the numbers, they say otherwise and this is a company that still has a ton of brand equity globally. Just having had the experience of traveling and living overseas for several years, I definitely, saw that, I've seen that. You brought up the comps numbers, I think it's absolutely worth mentioning, US comps this quarter were up 4.3%, international operated markets up 4.4%. Their developmental markets they saw under performance there. A lot of that, they said, reflected the impact of the war going on in the Middle East right now and that's very understandable and there's some second order impacts that come from that as well. You got to give them a little bit of a pass on that, that's just something that's completely out of their control, like the weather so to speak. But when you look at shareholders who've held onto these shares over the last decade, this stock has returned 300%. Well ahead of the markets performance there. You attribute it to that brand equity I think but also it's a franchise model that's tremendous. They've got 40,000 plus restaurants, 95% of those are franchised. That doesn't gin up a ton on the top line compared to something a company owned operation like Chipotle for example. But what it enables them to do is really bring some impressive profitability down to the bottom line. You put that all together and just it's not a surprise to me to see McDonald's perform so well, but, it's one of those companies I think that a lot of people just, they'll look at it and just just keep on walking."", ""Deidre Woollard: I think it's true and you mentioned the franchises. I love to mention that it's always that it's a stealth real estate company. They own all of that land and that's very valuable and a good part of the company. But I wanted to talk a little bit about what you said there about the US. I feel there is that perception that people don't go to McDonald's, but then you look at their loyalty program. You've got 150 million members that have been active in the last 90 days, so that's huge. Twenty billion in sales in 2023 and I the way that they're pivoting things, they're constantly tweaking things. We think of them as burgers, the Big Mac they're making, the double Big Mac now. But chicken is as big as a sales driver for them and they're seeing that globally and they're trying to figure out, more of the world is interested in eating a chicken sandwich versus a burger, so how do we make a better chicken sandwich?. Now they're taking on coffee. It started with, it's just a cheaper way to get coffee in the morning, you get it, with your breakfast, that's great. But they're tweaking this too in interesting ways. I don't know, I the way they use data a lot."", ""Jason Moser: I do too. In this age of AI, we talk a lot about AI and all of the potential that it offers. Really the lifeblood of AI ultimately it's data, and we've seen these companies from Chipotle to Starbucks and everywhere in between utilizing these loyalty programs to really take advantage of getting as much customer data as they possibly can. What that ultimately does, it enables these companies to keep their customers within that universe and then cater offering specifically to those individual customers. I think we've seen the investments in technology really pay off as well. It makes me think of companies like Domino's and Papa John's. No, maybe those are the pizza concepts that many might have at the top of their list, given some of the local choices that exist where they may live, but the bottom line is they're very convenient, they're wonderful options and I have to tell you the investments in technology, they make it so easy to order. They have loyalty programs that keep you coming back for more and McDonald's absolutely taking advantage of that same dynamic. To your point on the chicken, I think that's important. In this age, we've really seen Chick-Fill-A take off and I think a lot of companies are trying to figure out ways to compete with a Chick-Fill-A chicken. Absolutely, a ton of growth there and I was reading through the call and the investments in the time McDonald's was put into this McCrispy chicken sandwich, it's really resulted in some serious drives to the business. They're talking about this is scaled to a one billion dollar brands across 30 markets worldwide. But now they also mentioned that chicken category represents $25 billion in annual system wide sales, which essentially puts it on par with beef, their beef offerings and they're sitting there also making these investments in making their burgers better as well at the same time. It does feel like while there's a ton of brand equity and a lot that they could probably just hit cruise control and just keep on moving forward, they don't seem to want to rest on their laurels. It's refreshing, I think, to see a concept like McDonald's really trying to up its game and compete with a lot of these fast-casual competitors out there today."", ""Deidre Woollard: Well, and they've had some swings that have missed in the past. We talked a little bit about Starbucks. McDonald's has this new concept, the cosmic, it's this cold coffee drinks and they've just tested it out, I think in about ten locations. Traffic's been pretty strong so far. Then I was listening to the Starbucks call last week and they were talking about the need to try to get people there in the afternoons. It seems like this afternoon thing is interesting, but I'm wondering. McDonald's has the room to play with things like this, but what do you think about that concept? Would you be driving through the Cosmics to get yourself an afternoon drink?"", ""Jason Moser: If I was going by one, probably, I don't know that I'd go out of my way. But it also could be if I was going by one and I went by there once, maybe I would find it compelling and want to go out of my way for future trips. But I think it's important to note this Cosmic's offering. They identified. This $100 billion category. They quote across their top six markets that really focus on these beverages. It's not just beverages. If you look at the Cosmic menu, it is more than just beverages. Honestly, hey, listen, I could see those McPops doing pretty well. I don't know if you haven't seen them check that menu. The McPops look pretty good. But I absolutely love that they're trying this because again, I think in many cases, it's a matter of convenience. If they present a good offering and it's convenient, then people are going to give it a shot. If we look back through the history of something like a Starbucks, for example, that's a company that has started to recognize the benefits of convenience and incorporating more things like drive-throughs into their restaurants. McDonald's, I think has always been really known for, low prices convenience. This is something where they really specialize, and now they're starting to make that progress or that leap up into bringing a little bit more quality they're offering. Again, I think that menu with Cosmics, it's compelling, it's different, it's not just McDonald's. I think that will lead a lot of people to give it a shot. Then it's a matter of whether they find it compelling enough to keep going back."", ""Deidre Woollard: Well, and I think there's a whole new category emerging like Starbucks is trying to get people there for the drink and the snack. Other companies are starting to make these like later offerings that you come in for the drink in the snack option, especially in the afternoons. It reminds me a little bit of when they were trying to make, I think it was Taco Bell. They tried to make like a fourth meal. [LAUGHTER] I feel like they're trying to make another meal in here."", ""Jason Moser: It's the fourth or fifth meal, but it's at a different time of day. I think this is probably the time of day that more people can relate to. Because I think the fourth meal was probably geared toward people who have been out really late at night and have the munchies maybe on the way home. This seems like it's geared toward a little bit of a different audience and probably a bigger audience for that matter."", ""Deidre Woollard: Yeah, so thinking about Starbucks and McDonald's, the role of China is huge. Both of them are thinking about China. Late last year, McDonald's, they increased their minority stake in China to 48%. They opened 1,000 new restaurants, or actually a little over that last year in China all-time high. It's a pretty small percent of the business. But how are you thinking about companies that have this large consumer exposure in China right now? Because we've got geopolitical concerns there as well as some consumer weakness."", ""Jason Moser: Yeah, I think of the grand scheme of things, I view it ultimately as a positive, and I've said it before. When it comes to investing in China, I know what I don't know, investing in pure-play China just doesn't work for me. I've watched a play out over the last 15 years in how so much of this hype ends up sputtering out. With exceptions of course, but for the most part, it's just been a very difficult market to fully understand and I think really, honestly have faith in. But I think I view these multinationals, Starbucks, McDonald's, Apple, Coca-Cola, you name it. These are great ways to get satisfactory exposure to China without actually having to worry so much about the minutia. Not having to worry so much about what's going on over there. When you look at the state of the Chinese consumer today, I know things aren't all that great right now. I think there's reason to be hopeful though that the Chinese consumer will start seeing better days sooner rather than later. There's a lot of pessimism out there. Challenges from the COVID policies, and ongoing property crisis, that was a real 12 punch. High rates of youth unemployment, poor economic forecasts, you get the collapse of Evergreen. All of these things put together is there's just a ton of pessimism out there in regard to the Chinese consumer today. I think that's precisely when investors need to start looking because we know that things eventually will improve. Perhaps we're getting a little bit closer. For me, the ideal way to participate in an economy like that is going to be through the multinationals like your McDonald's and Starbucks of the world."", ""Deidre Woollard: Yeah. With McDonald's, you get a nice little dividend along the way."", ""Jason Moser: That's a very good point."", 'Deidre Woollard: Well, I want to pivot and talk about something else that is on my mind this morning. Did you watch the Grammys?', 'Jason Moser: I must admit I did not.', ""Deidre Woollard: Well, there was this commercial that caught my attention outside of the other controversies that may have caught my attention. It was this Snap commercial taking aim at TikTok and Instagram reels and basically saying social media is bad. Snapchat is good. It's this fun, happy place. We've got these like, oh look, I'm a broccoli face. It's interesting they had this big ads bend last night. They've got this new campaign. Then this morning they cut about 10% of their global workforce. They're reporting tomorrow. But I'm thinking about where they're taking their strategy. There was this leaked email last year that said that Evans Bagel sent out the CEO. Social media is dead, long live Snapchat. You talked about Meta on Friday on the show. Certainly, that is going nowhere from what I can see and from the earnings last week. But is there a case for the idea that social isn't quite as social anymore?"", ""Jason Moser: I think there is to an extent. I think social is going to be with us in one form or another going forward. At least I'm going to have to imagine for the rest of my life. I think it's ultimately just a matter of what people are looking to get out of it. I do understand if folks are pulling back on the rains a little bit and maybe not being quite as social or sharing quite as much, we've seen that that stuff can certainly be used against you. It is absolutely impossible for me to buy into the notion that Meta is on the win. The portfolio of that strategy for them has really paid off, and we just saw that in spades here in the most recent core. Snap I think is in a little bit of a bind because they still really are just Snapchat. Up and coming generation likely isn't looking at it with the same rose-colored glasses that the previous one did. When you look at the numbers, revenue growth has hit a wall. Again, like you said, Meta's report tells us there's still plenty of growth out there to be had. I was interested to look at Snap and compare it to Twitter at a certain point of time to get an idea of where these two businesses were. You look at Twitter, which was acquired in the back half of 2022. But if you look at Twitter's revenue in 2022, they generated a little bit better than $5 billion in revenue, and Snap still hasn't even gotten there, and that's Twitter. A company that I think many would argue myself included, left a ton of money on the table for just a number of various self-inflicted reasons. There are some lessons learned from Twitter to me, Snap rhymes. I think when you look at the overall opportunity out there, shoot, Amazon ad revenues up 27% of the quarter. That advertising revenue is definitely out there. It's companies like Snap I think are having a little bit of a more difficult time realizing it these days because social is such a difficult space when you're competing against Meta. But I think the question really for Snap investors at this point is, what are you ultimately expecting from this company? Do you think it's going to grow or is this something else? Do you feel like it's going to be acquired? Because I think the growth question is a very fair one, particularly given what we've just seen play out here in the early parts of emergencies."", 'Deidre Woollard: Well, thanks for breaking down with me today, Jason.', 'Jason Moser: Thank you.', ""Ricky Mulvey: Ricky Mulvey, co-host of Motley Fool Money Here.

Ricky Mulvey caught up with Patrick Badolato, an Associate Professor of Instruction at the University of Texas at Austin McCombs School of Business, to discover what investors can find out beyond the headlines and in the footnotes.', ""Ricky Mulvey: We talk a lot about headlines coming out of earnings, the big reporting numbers. But right now you want to focus on the footnotes. These are at the bottom of the page as we go through earning season, why are the footnotes even worth an investor's time to check out?"", ""Patrick Badolato: Sure, Ricky, I love that question and let me step back real quickly which is I'm going to refer to the footnotes as like all of the broad, qualitative, sometimes quantitative information that's in addition to the financial statements. Not what's on the financial statements, not the main core financial metrics, but I think they're massively informative because they give additional insight and flavor and sometimes really critical details about updates and changes that it's just we're going to be more informed walking into earning season or really any other assessment of a company if we've spent a little bit of time. My class, I used the phrase, read good but spend the time to avail yourself to the footnotes, the other information outside of the financial statements because it's packed full of useful Tibbets of information."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Sometimes they can be hard to parse through if you're not an accounting professor. Sometimes there's some gold in there. We're trading emails before this and you said there was a classic example from Apple."", ""Patrick Badolato: Yes, let your first point I want to address and I want to give the Apple example but that's the big challenge which is like, 10K is what, 120 pages long, and that's one pre IPO filing something the same. Most of it, so much of it is too much of it, if I can give my opinion is boilerplate where you're reading stuff and I'm not really changing anything. The challenge is though, the nuggets and the insights are there, they're just not easy to find and yes, I'm an accounting professor, I like reading these things and I'll put my time into reading the whole thing. But it's what I try to convey in a class and I want to use the Apple example is what I teach even at the Intro Financial Accounting level, is the footnotes are there and at times you want to grab them to think about it. The classic one I've done over time and this is not specifically recent news, but Apple's got a great footnote on its accounts receivable and that has nothing to do with what's reported on the balance sheet. It's just there's a footnote that talks about it. I think it's page 40 of their 2022,1K and they give a comment to the effect that what they're doing is they're requiring all smaller scale retailers to go out and get like third party insurance so that Apple will sell to them on account. But the reality is that the retailer has to go and get backing so that if the small retailer is not able to pay Apple, Apple is still going to collect effectively insurance proceeds so they're going to get their cash either way. The footnote shows us that, like Apple has virtually no risk of collection with its account receivable reported on the balance sheet, not on the balance sheet. There's nothing about that there. Read the footnote and you realize maybe that's something you would expect for a behemoth like Apple but really no risk of collection given the way they structure their deals with any smaller retailer."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Is that something that's rare among companies? I could imagine a lot of companies, they want to get the cash that they're entitled to on that account. But I don't know of any other companies that do that."", ""Patrick Badolato: Yes. Great question. I wish I had a better answer and I don't like how many use it, how many don't? I worry that the classic answer is just like, well Apple could do it at once because it's in such a position of strength. But I'll give you a personal finance example of this that I usually try to talk about in class which is, this is very similar to what we may face when we're getting a mortgage with PMI or private mortgage insurance. The bank's going to require us. We put less than 20% down to go pay for PMI insurance or private mortgage insurance. If that's so that the bank still collects its mortgage payments effectively, if we were to fall or miss a payment or something like that and it's crazy to think about it but it's similar, whether it's like you have one very powerful player, the bank giving us a mortgage and one far less powerful entity, us, the homeowner and the argument is you're going to basically make the smaller player pay the insurance to protect the larger player. That's what Apple's doing a version of that with its accounts receivable, ensuring it collects."", ""Ricky Mulvey: When you're one of the biggest companies on the planet, it's easy to know that other companies need you more than perhaps you need it. Uber is reporting tomorrow. This is a more recent example. Last year, the company changed how it treats discounts and promotions. We're talking about it. I think you said this was an important change, so what happened? What they do?"", ""Patrick Badolato: I think for this one, it's worth stepping back again and talking about the way they laid things out with their initial IPO filed in 2019 and there's a lot of layers and there was a lot of conversations but I want to just get to the point which is, they did not call. If you've taken Uber, you've got Uber eats delivered or you've taken a ride to go somewhere with Uber, I certainly have done that but we are not Uber's customer. In their IPO, we were not their customer. We were called riders or end users. Their customer, consistent with their IPO document was the driver, the driver driving the car providing transportation and that may seem weird, but that's the genesis of this whole idea. In their IPO, they had a bunch of promotions and discounts that were issued to the rider or the end user and they were actually booking that as both revenue and then offsetting it with sales and marketing expense. I think it was rounds to $3,000,000,000 in 2017 and 2018 combined in the two years preceding their IPO. But $3,000,000,000 and I'm not this is legal, there's a way that this works out it's because the riders were not their customers. But to simplify it, maybe over simplified. It's similar to saying that they were effectively buying their own services and that's what it works out to. If they gave a ride or $120 coupon, that $20 coupon was counting as revenue. It was removed via sales and marketing expense so no effect on like operating income but still an opportunity to increase revenue, to boost the revenue growth in the early stages of the company."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Now the revenue is not comparable and maybe you'll even see a slight revenue decline as they make this change. Why do you think Uber is making it?"", ""Patrick Badolato: Yes, and so let's just be specific about the change too but then I definitely want to offer some lens into what we can think about before the 2023 earnings come out. What they changed in the second quarter of 2023. I actually think based on the numbers, it was like toward the end of the second quarter, but I don't know the exact date. But they changed in the second quarter of 2023, is in many of their major markets, it looks like it's roughly two thirds using the third quarter numbers, but they now are classifying the rider effectively as a customer. As they're classifying the writer as a customer now, that actually means that if they give promotions and discounts, which they're continuing to do, it's not a removal of promotions and discounts, but now they're not counting the promotions and discounts as revenue and they're also not offsetting it as a marketing sales and marketing expense. Ricky you already alluded to this, and I just want to flesh it out a bit more. The challenge here is this change occurred mid year, roughly. It's going to be hard to compare anything coming out tomorrow with 2023's numbers, with anything that happened in 2022 or any prior years. Even within 2023 because the change didn't happen at the beginning, it might be hard to think about quarter to quarter comparisons or year over year comparisons. In this case to reiterate your point, revenue will actually be smaller because they're not including, and I think in quarter three it was $521 million. That just one quarter $521 million that would have been in revenue is not there and also is going to be removed from sales and marketing expense. The year over year revenue growth, all else held equal is going to be lower. It's just going to be harder to achieve any growth because stuff that was classified in revenue is no longer classified that way."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Maybe there's a tide to the story where Kashrashahi he comes in as the CEO of Uber, wanting a leaner, more focused company and maybe take away some of that noise in the S1. I know we've made fun of it on the show in the years past. The total addressable market was four billion people, or basically everybody in the 63 countries that it operated in at the time. Do you think that with this move in the footnotes, the way that Uber is changing the way it counts revenue, is that part of the story here with the company as it is today?"", ""Patrick Badolato: I love that question and I want to elaborate on it. But I think there's one more level and I hate to be nip picky about this too."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Go for it. You're the professor."", ""Patrick Badolato: That sales and marketing expense is also going to go down. I just caution, it's not a criticism of Uber in any way, but just preparing us for what we're going to see is that year over year sales and marketing expense should also decrease using the third quarter number alone by that 521 million. It'll be more than that because we don't have the fourth quarter information yet. But the sales and marketing expense will decrease as a dollar amount and also will decrease as a percent of revenue. I mentioned that we're going to see like margin improvement, where one expense decreases as a percent of revenue. It's not good nor bad. It's just a result of this reporting change. Worth being informed when we walk in there because we don't want to be saying is, wow, look at this great efficiency improvement with sales and marketing. They must be getting better at promotions and discounts or marketing. I'm not in any way saying they're getting worse. But no, the data just mathematically will lead to sales and marketing expense decreasing as a percent of revenue. That's like efficiency. That's worth understanding the reporting behind. But Ricky, I love your other question. I want to flush it out a bit more as well. I was pretty critical, looking at Uber in the pre IPO stage and we've done a bunch of classes and offering that there's a lot of questions and confusion and seem like distractions. Then COVID hits and just up ends everything. Which, you know, is tough for so many different companies."", ""But I think the Uber that emerge, it's really fascinating business model and I think they've figured out what they are, the phrase I use and I talk about them in classes, this is not a replacement for individual car ownership. This is not a target market of four billion people, but what they are is a platform of convenience. A company that can offer us rides when we need rides, can offer us goods. I applaud the fact that Uber eats has become so inclusive of not just fast food, restaurant meals, but you can get delivered groceries and florists and all these other things, which I think makes it more convenient for the customer. But also a better, driving opportunity, better utilization for the driver. I think that focus on the core and getting away from the autonomous and the replacement for individual car ownership is a massive step in the direction. Still questions, still stuff to figure out. But that core competency, the platform of convenience, we like convenience, we like stuff, we like getting places and getting things delivered to us. That may be a successful move in many ways for them. It seems like it is."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Maybe you're checking out the footnotes in a report. I think one piece of research you shared with me that is worth investors attention though, that they can track for the companies that they own and follow is the risk factors and an annual report. There are some researchers that found that how companies management changes the risk factors and changing their wording can often predict maybe future trouble for the company. And that section is worth a little bit more attention."", ""Patrick Badolato: I agree. I say that my thoughts on reading the literature and everything, it seems like reading the footnotes is still not that commonplace, full of information. But I love teaching it because, hey, that's your possible chance for differentiation. The change in the language, what's there. I agree, sometimes the risk can be informative. I love the way they were looking at it in that study, but I'll offer a few other areas I think are worth checking out. We gave the specific discounts and promotions and sales and marketing with Uber. But some other ones I strongly recommend is first and foremost actually owner rank this, the segments. Look at the segments of the business. Segments move in different directions. This is true for Uber. Their freight segment during 2023 has been going down year over year decline in revenue growth. Where deliveries and mobility, those are growing at different rates. Companies have segments that don't just do one thing, read as much as you can off the income statement or the financial statements to find out about segments. Another one, is MDNA management discussion and analysis. They don't always give you everything you need, but often there's that movement, Hey, here's factors that contributed to a trend. Factors that offset. Granular data that gives us a little bit more about like, let me know a bit about the story behind it. Revenue recognition, which I would argue is massively important for Uber and it's S1 are realizing wait, who's their customer? How do you do this? Then if you have companies with revenue recognized over time or have some discretion on are they the agent in the transaction or are they the main provider? There's more there as well. Risks looking at debt footnotes can be certainly informative in cases like Silicon Valley Bank and others. Taxes in certain cases. Really try to figure out what's valuable for the company and then use the footnotes is like, hopefully, you're thirsty for. I want to get more information. I want to get granular data on what's there."", 'Ricky Mulvey: Patrick Badolato is a Professor of accounting and finance at the McCombs School of Business at the University of Texas.

With Google Cloud and its AI solutions, McDonald’s aims to have the most tech sophisticated and productive restaurant platform in the industry.

And avoiding traps is one of the keys to good long-term investing success.', 'People will argue about what these terms mean. But for me, a value stock is one that trades at a good discount to what the business will be worth in the not-so-distant future. A value trap, on the other hand, is one that looks cheap on the surface, but whose business is becoming less valuable with time.', ""Here's why I believe Academy Sports and Outdoors (NASDAQ: ASO), Boot Barn (NYSE: BOOT), and Tripadvisor (NASDAQ: TRIP) are all in the value stock category."", ""With 282 locations at the end of 2023, Academy Sports is one the faster-growing sporting goods retailers in the country. It's grown its store count by about 10% over the last three years. But management intends to pick up the pace by opening 100 or more new locations over the next four years or so."", ""Any company can open new stores. What impresses me most with Academy has been its profit margin improvement. For the fiscal year that mostly overlapped with calendar 2018, the company's net profit margin was less than 1%. Management laid out a plan to boost its margin to 5% by 2023. As the chart below shows, it exceeded this goal by a mile."", ""Academy's new goal is a 10% profit margin in 2027. Given its track record of operational success, I wouldn't bet against it. And in growing revenue by opening new stores, this could mean $1 billion in annual net income."", ""Academy's management is using its soaring profits to do things that create shareholder value. In its fiscal 2023's third quarter (which ended in October) its long-term debt was down almost 15% year over year. Through share repurchases, it's reduced its share count by 21% in just the last three years. And it's paying a modest quarterly dividend."", ""Consumer spending could wane in the coming year due to macroeconomic pressures and this could be a temporary headwind for Academy Sports, impacting the timing of accomplishing its business goals. But trading at less than 10 times its trailing earnings, Academy stock is squarely in value territory right now and is worth investors' attention."", ""Boot Barn's story is similar to that of Academy Sports: The company is opening new stores at a fast pace and its profit margins are improving. The Western-style apparel company finished its fiscal 2024's third quarter with 382 locations, which is a 44% increase from the same quarter three years ago. Moreover, its profit margin was 9.2% through the first three quarters of its fiscal 2024, up from a margin of just 5.5% in the same period of its fiscal 2021."", 'Whereas Academy boosted its margins by focusing on being a better operator, Boot Barn has improved in large part thanks to a more favorable sales mix. Its portfolio of exclusive brands has better margins. In fiscal 2024, sales from these brands are expected to hit an all-time high of almost 38% of its total sales. Just five years ago, exclusive brands accounted for just 16% of sales.', ""Boot Barn stock trades at 15 times its trailing earnings, which is a little higher than some value stocks. And the company's guidance implies a pullback in sales in the coming quarter, leading to lower profits as well. Therefore, its forward price-to-earnings ratio is even higher."", ""Like Academy Sports, Boot Barn stock might be in for a tougher year this year. That said, this company has a strong track record. And it's planning to expand to 900 locations by the end of the decade, which can fuel plenty of long-term, market-beating upside even if results in the coming year are somewhat muted."", ""Finally, trading at 161 times earnings, Tripadvisor isn't what one would typically call a value stock. But of course, there's more than one metric that can be used to measure a company's value, one of which is sales. Tripadvisor's price-to-sales valuation is less than 2, meaning this stock has almost never been cheaper in its long history as a publicly traded company."", ""To its credit, Tripadvisor's gross profit margin is consistently over 90% -- that's an exceptionally high and rare number. But the company spends most of its gross profit on selling and marketing, leaving it with little on the bottom line in the end."", 'For this to be a good long-term investment, Tripadvisor needs to show some operating leverage eventually. This might make Tripadvisor the riskiest bet of these three stocks.', ""That said, Tripadvisor does have a very promising growth engine. The company owns a travel platform called Viator for booking experiences. In its third quarter of 2023, revenue from Viator accounted for 46% of Tripadvisor's total revenue and it was growing at a 41% year-over-year rate. As its adoption continues picking up steam, I would expect financial results from Viator to lift the entire company."", ""For a lot of people, $5,000 is a lot of money and so investing a sum of this size is a decision that shouldn't be taken lightly. I've presented Academy Sports, Boot Barn, and Tripadvisor because I believe these three stocks offer relatively low downside. All three are already inexpensive and their growth prospects are good."", ""However, don't forget the importance of diversification. As a general investing principle, it's good to have a portfolio of at least 25 stocks. This means that if things are evenly spread around, no stock would account for more than 4% of the portfolio. If it's more, you may wish to adjust your investment size accordingly. As always, keep overly optimistic emotions in check and diversify appropriately."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Academy Sports And Outdoors right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Academy Sports And Outdoors, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Academy Sports And Outdoors wasn’t one of them.

And now I'll turn the call over to Chris."", 'Christopher H. Peterson', ""Thank you, Sofya. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our year-end call. I want to start with a brief recap of the significant progress we have made during 2023 on the turnaround agenda. In June, we introduced and deployed a comprehensive new corporate strategy, which focuses on disproportionately investing in innovation, brand building and go-to-market excellence in our top 25 brands and top 10 markets as part of a clear set of where to play and how to win choices. These choices were informed by a thorough and brutally honest company-wide capability assessment we conducted earlier in 2023, which unveiled gaps in Newell's front-end commercial capabilities. Following deployment of the new corporate strategy, we proceeded to fully cascade and integrated into business, region, brand and functional strategies to ensure clarity and consistency of direction across all areas of the company. Last month, we announced additional changes to our operating model, designed to accelerate progress in key capability areas such as innovation, brand building and go-to-market excellence while driving even further standardization and scale efficiencies across the supply chain and back-office functions. As part of this evolution, we have now stood up a cross-functional brand management organization and for our top 25 brands established multifunctional brand teams, spanning brand management, consumer and shopper insights as well as finance, customer strategy and planning and supply chain functions. This move allows holistic support for each brand, keeps consumers at the heart of all we do and ensures appropriate financial and operational rigor is in place to drive on our ambitions. Building on the success of the One Newell approach with Newell's top 4 customers as part of the organizational realignment, we centralized domestic retail sales teams under our Chief Customer Officer, further reinforcing our partnerships, simplifying interactions and allowing for additional joint business plans. We also created a new business development team focused on driving distribution with new customers and expanding categories with existing customers. We expect these changes will enable our teams to better leverage Newell's portfolio of leading brands and critical selling capabilities to accelerate both category growth and Newell's market share while serving as best-in-class partners to our customers. Over an 8-month period, key members of the leadership team and I visited 8 of Newell's top 10 countries across North America, Europe and Latin America. These visits reinforced our view that international markets, which accounted for about 37% of Newell's sales in 2023 represent an attractive growth opportunity, particularly if we fully harness the scale benefits and embrace the One Newell go-to-market model. As a result, we are further simplifying and standardizing Newell's regional organizations, which will pivot their focus to commercial delivery, with the goal of accelerating speed, agility, effectiveness and ownership. We've made significant progress upgrading talent across the organization to close skill gaps and accelerate capability build-out. We have now filled the majority of critical leadership positions across the company. The 2 latest hires to the executive team include a new Chief HR Officer; as well as a new CEO of the Outdoor & Recreation business, who both bring a wealth of relevant experience and knowledge. We are excited to have them on board. We've made significant progress on each of the 18 breakthrough capability projects we chartered as part of the new corporate strategy. For example, we completely reinvented the consumer insights function under a new leader that we brought in last year. We believe this will unlock actionable insights as well as proprietary understanding of consumers and customers, so that we can enable superior innovations with stronger claims.We have also overhauled Newell's innovation approach around the biannual review process and put in place a project tiering system that helps identify big bets. Our goal is to launch fewer, bigger and longer lasting innovations that are gross margin accretive. While the health of the funnel is not yet where I'd like it to be, we have made considerable progress, not just on cutting the tail, but also identifying Tier 1 and 2 innovations for the coming years. I'll talk more about these as they come to market. To strengthen our market-leading brands with consistent brand building and compelling brand communications, we've put considerable effort into building brand management into a foundational capability for Newell. In addition to upgrading brand manager talent, we put exceptional performance standards in place with clear KPI-driven expectations for all brand managers. We also rolled out a pillar of competitive advantage framework so that we can evaluate our brands relative to competition, on product performance, brand communications, packaging, omnichannel execution and value. Finally, we implemented a new set of corporate values focused on better serving consumers, increasing accountability, driving a sense of urgency and returning the company to winning in the marketplace. We have been and will continue to move with speed and agility to action our strategy while developing and strengthening the capabilities required to win. Turning to financial results. Full year numbers were either in line with or ahead of our latest outlook across all key metrics. Sales came in ahead of our expectations, driven by stronger-than-expected U.S. demand. Normalized gross margin improved sequentially each quarter and inflected positively in the back half, driven by record-setting productivity performance and the July pricing action to proactively address situations where unit economics were untenable. Operating cash flow increased $1.2 billion versus 2022, ahead of our forecast as we took out about $700 million in inventory. We continue to drive out complexity ending 2023 with approximately 21,000 SKUs down about 25% year-over-year. We unlocked over $150 million of pretax savings through Project Phoenix, which helped mitigate inflationary pressure on overheads, and we reduced net debt by about $500 million, driven by strong cash flow. While we are pleased with the significant progress in 2023, we are not satisfied with the 12% core sales decline for the business, even as we estimate that close to 80% of it stemmed from category contraction and retailer inventory actions. We are laser-focused on returning the company to sustainable and profitable growth and more broad-based share gains and that is precisely why we have been moving at pace in implementing our strategy. Turning to 2024. We expect the macroeconomic backdrop to remain challenging as consumers remain under pressure and geopolitical uncertainty creates a dynamic operating environment. Our outlook assumes that Newell's categories continue to contract, albeit not as much as last year. We also believe retailers will continue to manage inventory tightly in durable and discretionary categories. Within this context, we plan to drive continued strong progress on the turnaround agenda and have established 5 major priorities for 2024. First, continue to operationalize our new strategy and operating model, unlocking the full potential of the organization and our portfolio of leading brands. This includes fortifying organization, talent and cultural capabilities to better enable meaningful innovation, stronger brand building and operational excellence. Second, improved top line and market share performance on a sequential basis as the capability work starts to yield tangible results in the marketplace. Third, drive strong gross margin and operating margin improvement, building on the progress made in the second half of 2023 by realizing benefits from a scaled and advantaged supply chain via productivity and other efficiency projects while also delivering the anticipated savings from Project Phoenix and organization realignment initiatives. Fourth, continue to delever the balance sheet and improve the cash conversion cycle by driving strong operating cash flow. Within this, we are planning to fully fund all the necessary high-return capability improvement and restructuring projects to build a multiyear productivity improvement runway. And lastly, continue to reduce complexity through business process redesign with a focus on simplification and accountability, technology standardization enablement and continued SKU count reduction across the organization. Amidst the challenging operating environment during 2023, we drove record productivity across the supply chain, significantly improved cash flow by rightsizing inventory, further reduced Newell's SKU count and took decisive actions to strengthen the company's front-end commercial capabilities. On behalf of the entire leadership team, I would like to express our gratitude to all of our employees who have embraced the new strategy and have shown tremendous resilience, commitment and grit despite a bold change agenda. The tangible progress on our strategy and turnaround agenda more broadly bolster our confidence that we are taking appropriate actions to strengthen the organization, improve its financial performance and create value for our stakeholders. I'll now turn the call over to Mark."", 'Mark J. Erceg', ""Thanks, Chris. Good morning, everyone. While core and net sales were better than expected at down 9%. We believe the most important financial story of the fourth quarter is the dramatic improvement achieved in the underlying structural economics of the business as evidenced by a 570 basis point improvement in normalized gross margin versus a year ago. Simply put, the targeted interventions we have made to improve the underlying structural economics of the business, such as the July 2023 high single to low double-digit pricing action on roughly 30% of our U.S. business, primarily in the Home & Commercial segment as well as the reduction in the manufacturing labor force across selected sites are clearly showing up in the financials. The company's fourth quarter normalized gross margin of 32.3% represented a 100 basis point improvement sequentially and the second consecutive quarter of year-over-year expansion despite sustained pressures on volumes. Remember, as Chris mentioned earlier, approximately 80% of our reduction in core sales this year was due to retailer inventory actions and category contraction. The resulting lower volumes when combined with nearly $700 million of inventory reduction, which we unilaterally removed from the system throughout the course of the year had a significant impact on capacity utilization and makes the over 500 basis points of productivity delivered in the fourth quarter by our exceptionally talented supply chain organization even more impressive. On the SG&A front, meaningful savings were also realized with Project Phoenix providing $53 million of benefit in the fourth quarter, which helped partially offset higher incentive compensation and the deleveraging impact on SG&A from a weaker top line. Fourth quarter normalized operating margin increased 280 basis points to 7.7%. Encouragingly, this is the first time normalized operating margin has expanded since the second quarter of 2022, which we believe is another proof point that the right strategy is now in place. During the fourth quarter, net interest expense increased $6 million versus last year to $70 million due to higher interest rates and discrete tax benefits yielded a normalized tax benefit of $10 million, all of which brought normalized diluted earnings per share in at $0.22. Importantly, this was considerably better than the $0.15 to $0.20 outlook we previously provided. Turning to operating cash flow. $251 million was generated in the fourth quarter, bringing full year operating cash flow to $930 million, an increase of $1.2 billion versus 2022. You will recall that at the start of 2023, improving cash flow was our #1 financial priority. So we are very pleased that the team over-delivered on this critical metric despite greater than originally anticipated macro headwinds. Strong cash flow allowed us to reduce gross debt by about $500 million during the year with over $200 million of that reduction occurring between the third and the fourth quarter. which helped lower our leverage ratio from 6.1x at the end of Q3 to 5.6x at the end of Q4. Turning to 2024. Expectations have not changed since our last earnings call. We said fiscal 2024 core sales were expected to be down year-over-year and below our evergreen target of up low single digits, with operating margin expansion ahead of the evergreen target of 50 basis points. Consistent with this, we expect the following for 2024. Core sales and net sales are expected to decline 3% to 6% and 5% to 8%, respectively, for 2 primary reasons. First, we expect our categories on average to contract low single digits in 2024. While we wish this wasn't the case, we nonetheless view this as a source of optimism since this is considerably better than the high single-digit contraction experienced in 2023. Second, we expect distribution losses and product line exits to exceed distribution gains by about 2 points due to our business decision to exit some structurally unprofitable businesses. Finally, please note that the 2-point difference in expected core versus net sales is driven primarily by unfavorable foreign exchange and to a lesser extent, category exits. We expect normalized operating margin between 7.8% and 8.2%, which at the midpoint represents a 100 basis point improvement, which is 2x our evergreen target, which calls for a 50 basis point improvement each year. The increase in normalized operating margin should be driven by strong gross margin improvement as another year of world-class productivity gains and the annualization of the July 1, 2023 pricing action more than offset an expected low single-digit headwind from inflation. Having just touched on pricing, it bears mentioning that given the degradation in the company's gross margin level in prior years, we are fully committed to restoring Newell's gross margins to provide the necessary fuel for reinvestment behind the business going forward. However, our guidance does not reflect any significant incremental positive pricing actions during 2024. Within SG&A, we expect overhead costs will be down meaningfully in absolute dollar terms, which should stay close to flat as a percentage of sales. The combined savings from Project Phoenix and our more recent organizational realignment should more than offset professional wage and benefit inflation and a series of incremental investments being made to enhance several critical core capabilities required to support our new corporate segment, regional brand and functional strategies. Despite robust cost control, the anticipated contraction in top line sales we expect to incur in 2024 will keep overhead costs as a percentage of sales elevated in the short term. Outside of overhead expense, advertising and promotion represents the balance of SG&A. We are planning to spend more in both absolute dollar terms and as a percentage of sales as we are beginning to see improvement in our innovation funnel and brand building activity and therefore, have more investable opportunities at our disposal. For 2024, we are assuming that interest expense steps up by $15 million to $20 million and that our tax rate is in the mid-teens. Importantly, this compares to a tax benefit of $68 million in 2023. All in, we expect normalized diluted earnings per share in the range of $0.52 to $0.62. Now we'll be the first to admit that at first glance, this does not compare favorably to the $0.79 per share just recorded. However, once a $0.26 year-over-year tax differential is accounted for, the midpoint of this range represents high single-digit growth versus last year, which we believe represents good progress in our corporate turnaround. For the year, we expect to generate operating cash flow of $400 million to $500 million. This range assumes another meaningful improvement in our cash conversion cycle, just not at the record level achieved during 2023 when nearly $700 million of excess inventory was removed and Newell's cash conversion cycle dropped by 24 days. Our operating cash flow range also includes about $150 million to $200 million in cash restructuring and related charges. Frankly, we briefly considered slowing down some restructuring efforts, but the rates of return associated with Project Phoenix, the network optimization project, the organizational realignment and other initiatives are all so compelling, the decision was taken to aggressively but thoughtfully move forward with a multifront transformation of Newell Brands. During fiscal 2024, we plan to invest about $300 million in capital expenditures, most of which will be spent on high-return cost-saving projects to further improve the structural economics of the business and accelerate the turnaround. While fully funding numerous high-return internal projects, we also plan to reduce our leverage ratio and strengthen our balance sheet with an expected return to a more typical seasonal cash flow pattern, characterized by a use of cash in the first half of the year, followed by meaningful cash generation in the second half. Newell's leverage ratio will likely increase as we move towards the midpoint of the year before dropping to about 5x by the end of Q4. Long term, we remain committed to achieving investment-grade status and continue to target a leverage ratio of about 2.5x. But in the meantime, we wanted to create additional financial flexibility. So we proactively amended the terms of Newell's revolver, even though we were fully compliant with all covenants at the end of the fourth quarter. As a result of the amendment, which was finalized earlier this week, the revolving facility was converted to a $1 billion secured facility, which we believe provides us with ample liquidity going forward. Free cash flow productivity is expected to significantly exceed our 90% evergreen target during 2024. As it relates to the first quarter of 2024, we expect a core sales decline of 6% to 8%, with net sales down 8% to 10% versus last year. Please note that the 2- to 3-point difference between our full year and first quarter core sales assumptions can be largely attributed to a greater impact from net distribution losses due to our decision to exit some structurally unattractive businesses, as well as weaker market share performance at the start of the year as the benefits from the capability build-out should improve sequentially going forward. As with the full year, the 2-point difference in expected core versus net sales is driven primarily by unfavorable foreign exchange and to a lesser extent, category exits. For the first quarter of 2024, we expect normalized operating margin of 2.4% to 3.2%, which at the midpoint would represent a 40 basis point improvement versus 2023. We expect gross margin to continue to expand versus last year, although not nearly as much as in the fourth quarter, largely due to FX impacts and less favorable capitalized variance adjustments. Total SG&A dollars should be down versus a year ago despite spending more on A&P, but because of the anticipated sales decline, SG&A as a percentage of sales should be up by less than the amount gross margin should expand. After incorporating slightly higher interest expense and a modest tax help, we were looking for a normalized diluted loss per share in the range of $0.05 to $0.09. That said, Q1 is typically Newell's smallest quarter of the year due to seasonality. As a result, it is not indicative of full year margin trends. In closing, we believe a great deal was accomplished during 2023, which has laid the groundwork frame much stronger 2024 as part of our multiyear journey to put the organization and the business with the right set of core capabilities, inclusive of sound business processes and cultural attributes required to fully operationalize Newell's new corporate strategy and in doing so, dramatically strengthened the company's financial performance going forward. Operator, if you could, please open the call for questions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Filippo Falorni of Citi.', 'Filippo Falorni', ""So clearly, like there's been a lot of external challenges in your business. I guess on the top line front, can you give us a sense of what confidence you have or what visibility you have in the top line trajectory here, particularly as you start cycling some of the inventory reduction last year?"", 'Christopher H. Peterson', ""Yes. Thanks, Filippo. Let me take that. I think as Mark alluded to in the prepared remarks, we are expecting a sequential improvement in top line performance in '24 versus '23. And if you look at the sales guidance, there's really 3 things that are in the sales guidance. We're expecting the market growth rate to be down low single digits, which is an improvement versus 2023 where the market growth was down high single digits. We're expecting about 2 points of headwind from proactive decisions we've made to exit unprofitable businesses, which we believe is a good business decision. And then we've got about 2 points of headwind from FX and category exits, the majority of which is FX related. I think if you go underneath that view, I would say that there's some very positive green shoots that we're expecting next year. So if you look at 2023, we grew market share on about 8 of our top 25 brands. We're expecting that number to increase as we go into 2024 into the low teens, driven by the capability improvements that we put in place. If I just take innovation as an example, now that we've established a tiering system of Tier 1, Tier 2 initiatives, which are the largest initiative categories. In 2023, we had 0 Tier 1 and 2 initiatives that were launched in the marketplace. In 2024, we have 8. The first one we started shipping a few weeks ago is Sharpie Creative Markers, which we're very excited about. It's a new category entry for us acrylic markers that really pop on light and dark surfaces. You can go to sharpie.com and see more about it. But this is the first of what will be a series of innovations that are starting to come to the market. 8 Tier 1 and 2 in 2024 is much better than 0 last year, and we are still working on populating the pipeline and I expect the pipeline to get even stronger as we head into '25. We also started to make real progress on the new business development capability that we put in the market focused on top line growth. Last year in '23. Part of the reason for the over delivery on the core sales line in Q4 is the new business development team actually secured incremental distribution with new customers already that helped the over delivery. And we've got a very strong pipeline as we head into '24 on that front. We also, as part of the operating model redesign have simplified the interaction with the international teams, and we believe that as we head into next year, our international business is poised for a significant acceleration in top line growth based on the process simplification and the structure change that we've made. So, we are very excited and optimistic about the capability work that we've been progressing on. I think I mentioned previously, we had 18 breakthrough capability initiatives that we kicked off as part of the new strategy that was launched in June of last year. Those capability improvement actions are starting to bear fruit, and we believe are going to start to show up increasingly in the top line results going forward."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from Peter Grom of UBS.', 'Peter K. Grom', ""Maybe 2 quick ones for me. Just first on the credit or the amendment of the credit agreement. Can you maybe provide some background on the changes in the covenants? Is there anything to read on why the metrics themselves are changing? I know you mentioned they weren't at risk in Q4, but could they have been an issue as you were looking ahead? Just given the commentary on kind of the cadence of cash flow? And then, I guess just second, turning to the business, obviously, some good progress given here on the gross margin line. But can you maybe frame how we should think about the opportunity from here? I think you mentioned less robust improvement versus 4Q, but just longer term, is that kind of high 30% target still achievable? And if so, can you maybe provide some guardrails around when you could achieve that?"", 'Mark J. Erceg', ""I'll just say a few words about the new facility that we put in place. But I think it's important to take a step back and understand that it's all predicated upon the work that we've been doing with respect to cash, generally speaking, right? This past year, we increased our cash flow by $1.2 billion year-over-year. We paid down $500 million worth of debt. We feel very good about the way we've been managing the company's balance sheet as we were looking to see what we needed in the way of financial flexibility for fiscal '24, we looked at our current facility and decided that we'd be better served by having a secured facility in place that, yes, did bring with it some additional covenants to replace the existing ones that were out there. If you want to get more specific on that, we can let Sofya follow up with you individually on that.But I think the bigger message here is that cash flow was strong -- exceedingly strong in the year just ended. We have really great plans in place to continue to extract and drive out our cash conversion cycle so that our working capital continues to improve year-over-year. And by the end of the year, we'll have reduced our leverage ratio even further than where it currently sits."", 'Christopher H. Peterson', ""On the gross margin side, what I would say is we still believe that the right long-term target for the company is sort of the high 30s gross margin. I think we had talked previously about a number of 37% or 38%. We ended 2023 with gross margin flat versus 2022 at about 30%. If you look at the guidance for next year of 100 basis points of improvement in op margin, we're expecting gross margin to be up more than that. And the reason is because we've proactively chosen to exit structurally unattractive parts of the business, number one. Number two, we continue to drive record productivity savings across the initiative across the portfolio. And number three, we are innovating in terms of gross margin accretive innovation. So for example, if you look at the 8 Tier 1 and 2 initiatives, that we have planned to launch this year, every 1 of the 8 initiatives is a significant improvement to gross margin versus the business that it's in. And so we expect to start driving mix benefit as the innovation portfolio ramps up as well. And we think those 3 things, when you put them together will drive gross margin higher than the 100 basis points that we're guiding on operating margin. We are choosing to take advertising and marketing expense higher as a percent of sales in '24 because we have an innovation pipeline to actually spend money behind and get a good return on.So, as we've talked previously, as the capability investments and the capability work ramps up, you're going to see us try to drive gross margin faster than operating margin and invest some of the money back, both in dollar terms and as a percent of sales in increasing our A&P ratio, and that is part of the plan for '24."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from Olivia Tong of Raymond James.', 'Olivia Tong Cheang', 'My first question is just around if you could just sort of talk a little bit more about the different initiatives you discussed earlier to drive better sales mix, in particular, some higher advertising behind the new innovation. Could you talk about when these things hit the P&L to give us a view on sort of the quarterly cadence of the organic sales improvement as the year progresses going from that down 8% to 6% to finishing the year down 6% to 3%? Because obviously, there are a lot of initiatives, but timing would be helpful.', 'Christopher H. Peterson', ""Yes. So what I would say is that the 8 breakthrough initiatives our Tier 1, Tier 2 initiatives that we're launching this year will build during the year. The other thing that's important to note about these 8, Tier 1 and 2 initiatives is they're not just a one-and-done thing. These are multiyear platforms that will begin to build and drive growth, not just this year, but for the next several years. If you look at what we're guiding to in Q1, we're guiding to a 6% to 8% core sales decline, and we're expecting the year to be 3% to 6%. So I do think you're going to see Q1 be the weakest quarter during the year. And the balance of the year, we expect better core sales performance. I mentioned that one of the top, or the Tier 1, 2 innovations, the Sharpie Creative Markers, we started shipping a few weeks ago. That will show up in stores in March, we'll turn on advertising, and we've got a full marketing campaign behind it that will start in March as well. The balance of the innovation is really sequenced more in Q2, Q3. And so you'll see those start to build as we go through the year. Likewise, the new business development, where we've had some significant wins will build as we go throughout the year. And I think, so we're pretty excited about the rate of improvement that we're driving on the capability improvements on the innovation funnel. And I think you'll begin to see that show up in the top line as we move through the year."", 'Mark J. Erceg', ""The other thing I'd like to add, if I could, because I don't think we talked about our international business enough is the fact that our international business has been performing better than the U.S. market over the past year, and we actually are really excited because as we look at our '24 planning process, the international business is expected to actually be up year-over-year. So we have, at this point, about 40% of our business outside the U.S., and there's a really good story there to tell."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from Bill Chappell of Truist Securities.', 'William Bates Chappell', ""Chris, help us understand how these businesses get back to growth? And I guess, [a lot of] the fears of that you've done so much cutting or you're doing so much cutting and exiting and stuff like that, that it's years before we can really see total company growth. And I guess first question is, what's your outlook for the actual categories to do this year? I mean, are you expecting the key be it Outdoor, be it Writing, be it Baby, be it Kitchen to be down as a category this year? Or is it more just your exits? And then the second question is do you see on the horizon kind of total top company growth? Or is there any concern that you're going too far?"", 'Christopher H. Peterson', ""Yes. Thanks, Bill. I think the thing, if you sort of parse out what we're saying on the guidance, we're planning the category growth rate or the market growth rate to be down low single digits. We've made proactive choices to exit about 2 points of business, and that effectively are the 2 drivers of the core sales growth guidance. If you back up from that, what that means is that from a market share standpoint, excluding the choiceful exits, we're effectively guiding that our market share is going to be flat this year, excluding the choiceful exits that we're making. And that's because the capability improvement actions are coming online, and we expect that to begin to show up in tangible financial results. So we don't like to give guidance beyond a year.But if you look at that trajectory that we're on, if you go into '25, the choiceful exits that we're making should be behind us by the time we get into '25. And so that is unlikely to be a headwind for '25. At the same time, it's hard to predict what's happening in the categories, but I think a lot of the outside experts would suggest that the category growth rate may turn more positive in '25, and we expect our capabilities to be even stronger heading into '25 versus where they are today. And so I mentioned that in '23, we grew market share on 8 of our top 25 brands. We think we've got line of sight to do that on about half of our market -- of our top 25 brands in '24, and I expect we're going to grow market share on more than half of our of our top brands in '25. And so we see a path for significant financial improvement. We see a path back to sustainable and profitable growth. We said when we unveiled the new strategy that this was going to be a multiyear journey because of the capabilities that needed to be built on the front end.But I can tell you inside the company that the capabilities we're building on innovation, on brand building, on new business development on go-to-market, on international, the changes that we're making in the operating model, the talent upgrade, the clarity of the strategy, all of those things are in place and starting to contribute. And we think we're on that trajectory. The thing that is a little bit more uncertain is what happens to the rate of market growth. We've tried to be prudent in our forecast in our guidance by saying it's going to be down low single digits is our assumption for this year. I will say it's early days, but just looking at the January results, we're running a little bit ahead of our plan in the month of January, but we're not going to get ahead of ourselves based on 1 month and January is a light month."", 'William Bates Chappell', ""And I guess just to follow up, I mean, how do you take something like Baby that was down double digits probably as a category last year and you're kind of probably forecasting in mid-single digits this year? I mean, I don't think the birth rate has changed that much. I don't think your market share has changed that much. I mean, how do you look at these -- your core categories, should they be normalizing and getting back to kind of pre-pandemic trends in '24? Or is it just, we're taking as we see it. And until that happens, we're just going to assume it looks more like 2023?"", 'Christopher H. Peterson', ""Yes. I think they're going to normalize a little bit in '24, but our view from an overall macro standpoint is that the consumer remains under pressure because of inflation. And you have to -- although in the headlines, you see a lot of commentary about consumer spending holding up very well, which is true. A lot of that consumer spending is being directed to either services spending or essentials, which is food and essential categories. And most of the forward-looking people that we get data from would suggest that durable and discretionary categories although the market growth rate is projected to improve versus '23, it's still likely to remain under pressure in '24.I will say that if you talk to those same external people, which we do a lot, most of them are predicting that, that's going to change when we get into '25 and even more so into '26, although it's hard to predict that far out. And so we're trying to be prudent. We're trying to take the things that are in our control. You mentioned the Baby category, which was particularly negatively impacted in '23 because of the Bed Bath & Beyond and buybuy Baby bankruptcy. One of the things that we're doing with our new business development team is we are expanding and opening up new retail customers into that Baby channel with Graco as the lead brand. And so we're pretty excited about what you're going to see going forward. We can't say too much about it right now, but there are things that we are doing to try to get the category back to growth that I think are going to help market growth and help Newell's market share at the same time. We also have an opportunity in that business to expand a little bit more internationally, because we're very U.S. centric, and there's a lot of babies outside the U.S., a lot more outside the U.S. than there are inside the U.S. And so we have a couple of exciting country launches planned in that business already for '24."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from Lauren Lieberman of Barclays.', 'Lauren Rae Lieberman', ""Was just curious to talk a little bit about general merchandise trends in the U.S. We've had retailers call out some deflationary trends in the category, which, of course, would be a very broad category, so I know it's difficult to generalize. So just curious kind of what you're seeing and how you're thinking about pricing dynamics? Whether it's a step-up in promotional activity that may be encouraged by retailers to kind of drive a little bit more activity this year in the U.S.?"", 'Christopher H. Peterson', ""Yes. Thanks, Lauren. So we are having active discussions with retailers on this topic. As we said in our prepared remarks today, our input costs, we are expecting to go up in '24, not down. So we are not seeing broadly deflation in terms of our input costs. That being said, what we have baked into our guidance is a low single-digit inflation rate. That's really driven by 3 things, which is labor cost, a little bit of transportation inflation and a little bit of resin inflation. It's a more normalized inflationary input cost inflationary period. And so as we've had discussions with retailers on this topic, I think they understand that our businesses are not ones that we're seeing deflation. And so we're not planning any significant price reductions or rollbacks as we go forward. And we're not seeing that really in the competitive environment of what we compete in either. I think there are other parts of general merchandise where that may be the case, but not in the categories in which we compete."", 'Lauren Rae Lieberman', ""Okay. Great. And then I know you said that you mentioned there's just new leadership for Outdoor, but it might be a wait and see might be the answer, I guess. But just curious kind of what's been going on there? The sales have been very weak. Just curious kind of anything you can articulate about steps being taken to turn the business around, kind of (inaudible) sight there. But again, I understand if it's a wait and see, because we just announced management change, too."", 'Christopher H. Peterson', ""Yes. So the Outdoor & Rec business is our -- is the business that's the most in need of a turnaround of any of our segments. So when we did the capability assessment, it became very clear that because each of our businesses in the past were not managed consistently, and we're putting in those consistent processes now. They all started from different starting points. And so if you look at where the businesses are on the journey, Outdoor & Rec has the furthest to go with regard to improving its ability to innovate, brand build, brands communicate and drive retail excellence. The additional thing I would say on that business is that, that was the business that had more of their business, particularly in the U.S., and opening price point categories that were structurally challenged. And so we have taken significant action in Outdoor & Rec. I'm very excited about the category in the long term, because I believe that it is a category that we can drive significant growth. It's responsive to innovation and all of the capabilities we are building should be applicable in that business. In order to drive that, we haven't just brought in a new leader of Outdoor & Recreation, but we've effectively brought in a completely new marketing team, a new sales leader, a new CFO, and we've announced we're moving the business from Chicago to Atlanta. And so we are making a significant intervention to upgrade that business. I do think if you look within the segments, and obviously, we don't provide guidance at the segment level, I would expect the Outdoor & Rec turnaround from core sales decline to core sales growth to take longer than what you're going to see in Learning & Development or in Home & Commercial. And so -- but I do expect already some improvement in '24 relative to the growth rate versus '23 in Outdoor & Rec but it will likely be a laggard relative to the other 2 segments because of the amount of capability improvement work that we have going on in that segment."", 'Operator', 'And our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan.', 'Andrea Faria Teixeira', 'I was hoping if you can comment in terms of how conservative you have been. I understand as you start up this guide, right, and how understandably what has happened every quarter last year, you had to reduce guidance? But also thinking about the category, you just spoke about some of the Outdoor, but maybe what are your expectations of the core categories going forward? Be it obviously Writing & Appliances, some of that and also some of the Commercial segments where there is some resilience there? I understand, anything that you can share as far as you look through more of the top line now that kind of the cost section of it seems to be more under control. In particular, as you were saying, we are benchmarking market share performance new leadership in terms of getting this category sorted out in market share. If you can kind of give us the state of the union for these other key categories that will be wonderful.', 'Christopher H. Peterson', ""Yes. Thanks, Andrea. I think we're trying to be prudent in the guidance is the way I would describe it. It is a volatile time period. It's hard to predict exactly what's going to happen in the macroeconomic environment, and we certainly don't have a crystal ball that is unique or better than anybody else. I think probably the biggest assumption that we're making is that the markets are going to be down low single digits, which is an improvement in '24 versus what we saw in '23 where it was high single digits. As I said, so far, in the month of January, we're running slightly ahead of plan, but it's too early to declare victory after 1 month. If you look at the business units, I feel very good about our Writing plan heading into this year. We have strong innovation. I mentioned the first of the 8 Tier 1 and Tier 2 innovations, the Sharpie Creative Markers that are launching this year, which is a new category for Sharpie that we have high hopes for. I also have high hopes for Baby this year. I think we have a bounce-back plan in place in that category. And I think that category has normalized significantly last year from the buybuy Baby bankruptcy. On the Home & Commercial business, we've done, which would include Kitchen, Home Fragrance and Commercial. We've done a lot of work to reset the margin structure in that business, particularly in Kitchen, and you can see that coming through in the gross margin and operating margin results in the back half of last year. And I think that business, particularly the Kitchen business has some exciting innovation that's coming this year. The Commercial business is a more stable business that we are going sort of from strength to strength. We expect that business to be more flattish this year versus last year. And then I mentioned the Outdoor & Rec business is probably the business that is going to be the most challenged this year because of the time it's going to take us to fully get the capability build in place and have that show through in terms of financial results."", 'Mark J. Erceg', ""The other thing I would add, if I could, because we recognize the need to have better forecasting capabilities is, this is part of the capability set that we've brought to bear. So for example, the sales force is now using Anaplan in order to really discretely have sales walks that build up on discrete building blocks quarter-to-quarter, brand by brand. We've taken the best-in-class practices from different business units and applied those broadly. So the capability set that we're putting in place leverages scale, but it also allows us to get much more granular on our buildups."", 'Andrea Faria Teixeira', ""That is super helpful. And how about R&D, is there any indication of putting more money behind R&D this year and getting -- I understand in Kitchen, of course you mentioned more innovation, but across the board, given that you're coming off of a moment where you were focusing on improving profitability, is there any indication of that?"", 'Christopher H. Peterson', ""Yes. We -- that is baked into our plan. So, and perhaps I should have spent a little more time on that. But the organization realignment that we announced in January, where we announced that we were changing the operating model to better enable brand management, U.S. selling, new business development, international, et cetera. Also R&D is part of that effort. So, as part of that realignment, we announced a net head count reduction of 7%. But if you look within that, we actually reduced head count by more than that, and invested back resources in areas where we needed to invest back from a capability standpoint. And one of those areas was R&D and is R&D. And so within R&D, we are investing more resources in terms of headcount. We are focusing that head count on platform technologies that can span across Newell. And these are things like material technology that spans across multiple business units. We're not going to disclose all of them here, because some of them are competitively sensitive. But we do have a plan to upgrade the contribution and the investment in R&D specifically, and that is part and parcel to improving the innovation pipeline, and it's baked into our guidance and our operating model change that we announced earlier this month -- earlier this year."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Brian McNamara of Canaccord Genuity.', 'Brian Christopher McNamara', ""Maybe one for Chris. We're about 8 months into this new strategy and these turnarounds typically take more time than investors want. I'm curious your view on the progress made so far relative to your initial expectations? What's been better than expected or easier and what's been more challenging?"", 'Christopher H. Peterson', ""Yes. Thanks, Brian. I think we're very excited about the progress made. We've moved at incredibly rapid pace to do the capability assessment to launch the strategy to cascade the strategy. We've changed the operating model. We've upgraded talent. All of those things have gone, frankly, incredibly well and incredibly quick. I think the piece that is still ahead of us that I wake up every morning thinking about is how do we operationalize this and build it into the culture of the company, because -- and that's the work that I referenced when I talked about the top priority heading into '24 of operationalizing the new strategy and the operating model, because I think we now have an outstanding executive committee, which is my set of direct reports, that is driving the change, driving urgency in implementing the strategy.What we need to do now is embed that throughout the entire 25,000 people that are working at Newell, so that we are all operating in a consistent direction and we make the culture change to a performance-oriented, outcome-based organization structure. We're seeing good signs of that. I just want to see it more broadly across the company. And I think that's what we're trying to do as we head into this year."", 'Brian Christopher McNamara', ""And just a quick follow-up. Are there any categories you're seeing shelf space increase at retail? And if not, what are you guys bringing to the table today relative to the competitors you have to displace?"", 'Christopher H. Peterson', ""Yes. We are seeing shelf space increases in a number of our businesses. And we, because the line reviews for 2024 have largely been completed, we have pretty good visibility to that. So as an example, and I keep coming back to the Sharpie Creative Marker example. But the retailer acceptance behind that initiative has been very strong. We expect to gain incremental shelf space as a result of that initiative. We're also working with a number of retailers on category reinvention that we believe can trigger not only market growth, but market share growth for Newell at the same time. The new business development program, I mentioned is coming online, and we've got some good examples of gaining incremental distribution. One that comes to mind, for example, is we have a terrific product on Rubbermaid Brilliance, which is a food storage product. Well, the new business development team went and sold that product into The Container Store. So we're now listed at The Container Store. We were not doing business with The Container Store previously as an example. And I could go through 15 or 20 of those types of examples where we're starting to get on the field with a broader set of retailers and gaining shelf space, and we think that trend is going to accelerate as our new business development capability improves, as our category management capability improves, as our innovation pipeline improves and as our brand-building capabilities continue to accelerate. So that's the goal. And I think we'll talk more about those examples as we go forward here."", 'Operator', 'Our last question today comes from Steve Powers of Deutsche Bank.', 'Stephen Robert R. Powers', ""Two questions. Mark, just one for you, just to clarify. You mentioned international, the expectation in international will be up this year, I guess. Was that just a core sales comment? Or is it -- is there a prospect of U.S. dollar growth being positive to kind of offsetting FX, number one? And then Chris, maybe for you. Just, you talked about the sequential improvements relative to the starting point in the first quarter through the year. I guess, I'm trying to figure out how steep that curve is and what you contemplate as an exit rate on the year, at least at the high end of guidance, is there a prospect of you exiting in positive territory exiting the year? Or are we more expecting declines all the way through the year and therefore, exiting at a lower rate as we go into '25?"", 'Mark J. Erceg', ""So real quickly, as it relates to the international business for fiscal '24, yes, we expect core sales to be up mid-single digits, and we would expect net sales to also be up when all is said and done. One quick thing before Chris takes the back half of your question that I think is important, because we are as impatient for progress as the investment community is. But we really believe that meaningful progress was made during the course of '23. If you go back and look at our gross margin and our op margin in '22, they're both down 180 and 160 basis points, respectively. During '23, our gross margin inflected in the third quarter and during '23 our op margin inflected in the fourth quarter. And during '24, both gross margin and Op margin are going to be up strong despite the fact that the remaining sales compression on the top line. So we are working through this process deliberately as we indicated we would with fiscal year '23 to being a year in which we had to put some basic fundamental stuff in place. We have now put those capabilities in place. We've upgraded the talent across the organization and changed the ways of working and you're going to start seeing real signs of that because the growth rate, while still down in '24, it's going to be appreciably better than it was in the prior period. And the financials are going to continue to improve structurally. And so by the time we get out to '25, we should be hitting on all cylinders, and we're actually quite excited about it."", 'Christopher H. Peterson', ""Yes. I think relative to the guidance question, the base periods remain a little bit choppy because of retailer inventory destocking timing, shipment timing, et cetera. And so what I would say relative to the guidance is that we expect core sales growth to be better after Q1 in the balance of the year than we expected in Q1, as we've said. I think it's premature for us to talk about guidance by quarter between Q2, Q3 and Q4 at this point. And it will be a little bit choppy, but we certainly expect Q1 to be the weakest quarter of the year from a core sales growth perspective, core sales to improve after Q1. And I think we'll stop there, and we'll continue our normal guidance pace of updating on the quarterly guidance at the beginning of the quarter. But because our focus is really on driving, as Mark said, the sequential improvement in core sales growth from negative 12% in '23 to down 3% to 6%. And remember, within that 3% to 6%, there's 2 points of stuff we proactively chosen to exit. And so if you were to exclude that, which we haven't not done from core, we're really guiding sort of down 1 to 4 in the areas that we're focused on for '24. And I think that's what gets us excited about the trajectory as we move through the year and think about where we're going to be over the course of the year as we head into '25. So thanks, everybody. And we'll follow up with anybody as always, after the call."", 'Operator', ""This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. A replay of today's call will be available later today on the company's website at ir.newellbrands.com. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.""]"

But investors didn't balk, either. Warren Buffett's owned plenty of energy stocks in the past, after all, and there's no denying the world remains dependent on crude oil."", ""Buffett and his acolytes' decision to reopen an Occidental Petroleum trade -- and add to it in the meantime -- is looking increasingly brilliant. Demand for oil continues to grow despite the advent of alternative energy sources, and the global supply of crude is facing a potential crunch that could keep oil prices elevated into the distant future."", ""That's the take from Occidental CEO Vicki Hollub, and she would arguably know as well as anyone could.Her company also stands to greatly benefit from this brewing supply/demand dynamic."", ""This doesn't quite seem to be the case right now. Crude oil prices are down from a mid-2022 peak near $120 per barrel to roughly $73 per barrel, still trading within sight of new multiyear lows. War in Ukraine and now unrest in the Middle East (and in the Red Sea and Mediterranean Sea in particular) hasn't proven nearly as disruptive as initially feared."", 'Just wait, though. A day of reckoning is coming.', ""Hollub most recently voiced her concern in an interview with CNBC's Tyler Mathisen, explaining that known crude reserves are being found and developed at a much slower pace than they've been in the past. Specifically, she said the world has only newly identified less than half the amount of crude it's consumed over the course of the past 10 years. Given the current trends, this means demand will exceed supply before the end of 2025."", ""Were it the only time she's shared this outlook it might be dismissible -- but it's not the only time she's done so. Speaking at the World Economic Forum's annual meeting held in Davos, Switzerland last month, Hollub also expressed concern that a lack of exploration in recent years has set the stage for a supply strain, in turn setting the stage for sustained crude oil prices of between $80 and $85 per barrel come 2025."", 'She\'s not alone in her concern. Late last year, JPMorgan Chase published research suggesting the same. JPMorgan\'s global head of energy strategy Christyan Malek said, ""We are turning bullish now as we envisage an emerging supply demand gap beyond 2025, coupled with strengthening bottom-up sector fundamentals."" The investment bank further fears, however, the gap between supply and demand will only continue widening through 2030 without new investments in exploration and development. Its long-term price outlook also estimates oil prices above $80 per barrel for a long, long while.', 'Research outfit Wood Mackenzie seems to agree, arguing early last year that ""known fields alone cannot meet oil and gas demand to 2050,"" requiring serious upstream investments in the meantime.', ""And no, renewable energy alternatives can't make up the difference. The United States Energy Information Agency says less than 10% of the nation's energy production comes from renewable sources, mirroring most of the rest of the developed world. There's just not enough time to build more green-energy production capacity to make up for the oil and gas that's soon going to be decreasingly available and considerably more expensive."", ""All of a sudden, many of Occidental Petroleum's recent and not-so-recent decisions to invest in more supply and output make even more sense."", ""Take its plans to acquire CrownRock as an example. The $12 billion deal will plug Occidental into a Permian Basin property that's not only producing, but already generating free cash flow. Better still, the 94,000-acre property offers on the order of 1,700 yet-to-be-developed spots that could be drilled in the future."", ""That acquisition isn't nearly as big as 2019's $55 billion purchase of Anadarko Petroleum, however, which brought several different active wells into the fold. Some of them have since been divested. Others haven't, if they were a good strategic fit. Like the deal to buy CrownRock, the Anadarko acquisition ultimately positions the parent company to make the most of an opportunity few saw coming five years back...when crude oil prices were struggling just to hold above $60 per barrel."", 'The company has also made significant investments in enhanced oil recovery technology that uses carbon dioxide (CO2) gas to extract more crude from an existing well. In 2022 it inked deals with EnLink Midstream, Enterprise Products Partners, and Natural Resource Partners to establish an effective means of sourcing and using industrial CO2, which not only improves well extraction by 10% to 25%, but does so with lower greenhouse gas emissions than alternative approaches produce.', ""In this vein, Occidental Petroleum's top brass isn't unaware the energy environment is changing -- even if sweeping change remains many years down the road. In November the company announced a $550 million investment from BlackRock in Occidental's direct air capture (DAC) facility in Ector County, Texas. Called STRATOS, once completed this project will be the world's largest direct air capture facility, capable of removing up to 500,000 tons of carbon dioxide out of the air every year. Not only can this CO2 be used to help the company produce more oil, but it may even be possible to use this simple gas as a means of synthesizing environmentally friendly jet fuel."", 'Such solutions are not yet mandated. New laws aimed at protecting the environment are increasingly common, though. Occidental Petroleum is prepared for whatever the future may hold.', ""Occidental Petroleum isn't the only way to play the impending oil shortage, of course. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway holds a sizable stake in Chevron (NYSE: CVX) too, which will also benefit from crude's global supply reaching an important tipping point in 2025."", ""If there's room in your portfolio for only one or two of Warren Buffett's current energy holdings, Occidental is a strong candidate. Hollub appears to have a firm grasp on the current supply/demand situation and is likely better preparing for the future than rivals not taking the matter quite as seriously."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Occidental Petroleum right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Occidental Petroleum, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Occidental Petroleum wasn’t one of them.

Governments worldwide are now focusing on the development and use of renewable energy technologies. In 2024, energy and mining companies face numerous challenges amid a complex business environment and uncertain economic outlook, as per S&P Global’s latest report. Policy developments in 2022 and 2023 have created opportunities for the energy and mining sectors, particularly in the transition to renewable energy and critical minerals. However, 2024 is expected to bring significant headwinds due to elevated interest rates and slowing economic growth. Energy and utility companies, grappling with regulatory complexities and persistent inflation, face challenges in the rollout of both renewable and traditional energy infrastructure.', ""The energy landscape is influenced by four main disruptors – geopolitical factors, macroeconomic variables (like high interest rates and rising materials costs), evolving policies and regulations, and the emergence of new technologies. These factors significantly impact demand, supply, trade, and investment in the oil and gas industry. According to Deloitte, OPEC+'s output cuts and other disruptions have driven Brent oil prices above US$90/bbl, while US Henry Hub natural gas prices rebounded to US$3.50/mmBtu in November 2023. Despite these challenges, global oil demand is expected to grow by 2.3 mbpd in 2023, surpassing 100 mbpd for the first time. Electric vehicle sales increased by over 35% in 2023, with one in seven cars sold being an EV, highlighting regional differences in demand, infrastructure, technology adoption, regulatory policies, and socioeconomic factors. The industry is poised for a solid start in 2024, supported by its strong financial position and high oil prices, barring further macroeconomic deterioration. This strength is expected to facilitate investments, dividends, and a disciplined capital program, with the global upstream industry projected to maintain a 2023 hydrocarbon investment level of about US$580 billion and generate over US$800 billion in free cash flows in 2024."", ""As per Fitch Ratings, the performance of the global oil and gas sector in 2024 is expected to be consistent with 2023 and stronger than mid-cycle levels. Oil prices are anticipated to remain high and relatively stable year-on-year, attributed to OPEC+'s production cuts, geopolitical factors, and a slowdown in US crude production. Although demand growth is expected to decelerate, the spare capacity, primarily held by OPEC, is likely to be sufficient to absorb potential shocks. Looking ahead to 2025, a decline in oil prices is assumed as OPEC+'s control over supply may ease. Companies with strong cash flow and low leverage are projected to report robust earnings in 2024, supported by favorable prices and ongoing cost control measures. The cumulative EBITDA of Fitch-rated global O&G producers is expected to slightly decrease from 2023, approximately 25% lower than in 2022. Most companies are expected to maintain or reduce capital expenditures, with only about 25% increasing capex by more than 10%. Additionally, approximately 20% of companies are projected to raise dividends by more than 10%, while the rest will either maintain or decrease dividends."", 'To benefit from the growth potential in the energy sector, some of the best stocks to buy include Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY), and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM).\xa0', 'Our Methodology\xa0', 'We chose the top energy stocks based on overall hedge fund sentiment toward each stock.

We are sitting on a material (unrealized) gain from our cost and are now receiving material dividends thanks to Devon’s thoughtful fixed/variable dividend policy. Energy is now a hot sector for investors but we have had a material exposure for a long time.

Our desire to have our biggest portfolio exposures be high return, growing, reasonably predictable and moderately levered companies lead us to reduce our Devon exposure in the past. When the recent facts and circumstances for the industry changed and appeared supportive of healthy oil prices, we decided to maintain a sizable holding and more recently added to the position. At Devon’s Q1 dividend rate, which is mostly variable in nature, the shares now yield approximately 10% and our yield on our average cost is materially higher.

(NYSE:NEE). Over the past few years, the company developed into a growth darling thanks to its strong track record in renewable energy development and tailwinds from the global energy transition and incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act. The problem for NextEra, and the transition broadly, is that this transformation is immensely capital intensive and many renewables projects offer lower returns on that capital. This requires high capital expenditures – often resulting in negative free cash flow – to meet the growth and financing needs of companies like NextEra. To help, the company leaned on financial engineering by using a publicly traded limited partnership called NextEra Energy Partners, providing further capacity for its parent to continue its development plans. NEP used layers of its own financial engineering to fund its own negative free cash flow and a large, growing dividend yield that we believe it could not sustain organically. Ultimately, the higher cost of debt from rising rates led NEP to lower its own growth ambitions, driving concerns about whether NextEra can execute on its extensive backlog.

No stock is a 100% guaranteed winner, and investing is not a perfect science.', 'However, if you put your money into quality businesses with sustainable paths to growth ahead, with strong leadership and compelling financials, you can build a portfolio that compounds meaningful returns with time.', 'On that note, here are two healthcare stocks to consider for your portfolio right now.', 'DexCom (NASDAQ: DXCM) is one of the major players in diabetes care with a lineup of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices used by diabetics around the world. A significant needle-mover for this business over the last year has been the launch of its latest generation CGM, the G7.', 'The G7 is marketed as having the fastest warm-up time of any CGM on the market. DexCom also says it is the most accurate of any such commercialized device, according to internal data, with a size that is 60% smaller than its predecessor, the G6. The G7 is also the most reimbursed of these devices on the market, thanks to vigilant efforts by DexCom to partner with public and private payers. As a result, the average DexCom user pays just $20 a month to use this potentially life-saving device, which has a 10-day wear time per sensor.', 'The market for CGM wearers is massive and growing. There are use cases for these devices for both type 1 and type 2 diabetics, but adoption among the latter population has historically been much slower. These trends are changing, a reality that DexCom is capitalizing on with its current lineup of products as well as a new CGM called Stelo that it plans to launch in 2024. The Stelo is designed specifically for type 2 wearers who do not use insulin.', ""There are roughly 40 million individuals with diabetes in the U.S. alone. However, it's estimated that only about 2.4 million Americans use a CGM. DexCom isn't the only big player in this space, but with the rising incidence of diabetes and continued adoption of these devices among patients, there's plenty of room for multiple parties to snag market share. Moreover, there is growing interest in the use of CGMs for pre-diabetics, as there are an estimated 75 million individuals in the U.S. alone who fit into this category."", ""DexCom has raked in revenue of $3.4 billion over the trailing 12 months, while profits for that period have totaled $377 million. And looking at trailing-12-month operating cash flow, DexCom has accumulated just shy of $750 million on that front. Investing doesn't have to be complicated, and mainstay businesses that serve an essential consumer need can prove highly resilient. DexCom is certainly worth a second look for the long-term investor searching for a steadily growing healthcare business with a considerable runway ahead."", ""Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: VRTX) has had a banner year, fueled by its flagship portfolio of cystic fibrosis therapies, approval for the world's first CRISPR-based therapy, and promising results from multiple studies of upcoming potential blockbuster drugs. The biopharmaceutical company is the only maker of drugs that treat the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis (CF), a genetic disease that is characterized by a mutation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene."", ""Cystic fibrosis can be life-threatening, but the introduction of a class of drugs called CFTR modulators has changed the outlook for both quality and length\xa0of life for patients. All of Vertex's CF drugs are CFTR modulators. Despite having a significant footprint in the CF treatment market, its total addressable market is growing as more therapeutic options become available to patients and it garners label expansions for younger cohorts of patients."", 'Vertex is currently working on additional CF drugs, including a new triple-combination therapy that it expects to file regulatory paperwork for in mid-2024. The company is also on track to submit regulatory filings for VX-548, its non-opioid drug candidate for moderate to severe acute pain ailments around the same time. Both of these drugs have blockbuster potential for the business.', 'In 2023, Vertex reported revenue of $9.9 billion, up 11% from 2022. It also brought in profits of $3.6 billion for the 12-month period, a 9% increase from the prior year. The company had a considerable stash of cash and investments on its balance sheet at the end of the year, to the tune of approximately $14 billion.', ""Late last year, the first wave of approvals began for Vertex's gene-editing therapy Casgevy, which it co-developed with CRISPR Therapeutics and is a one-time functional cure for sickle cell disease (SCD) and transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia (TDT). Casgevy is now approved in the U.S., Great Britain, Bahrain, and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for SCD and TDT. While gene-editing therapies take considerable time to administer for each patient, some analysts think Casgevy's revenue potential will help it achieve blockbuster status for Vertex before the end of the decade."", ""There's a lot for investors to like about this stock, and the years ahead could bring even more enviable growth."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in DexCom right now?', 'Before you buy stock in DexCom, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and DexCom wasn’t one of them.

Here's why."", ""Prosper Junior Bakiny (Eli Lilly): It's difficult to find many biotech stocks that have garnered more attention than Eli Lilly over the past year. It is a leader in the weight-loss drug market thanks to its highly popular treatment, Zepbound. Wall Street analysts have exceptionally high expectations for the drug, generically known as tirzepatide, which helped drive Eli Lilly's stock price higher. And there is more where that came from."", ""The drugmaker is expecting data readouts from several phase 3 trials, as well as regulatory submissions for its new crown jewel this year, including as a treatment for sleep apnea. Considering how important tirzepatide is for Eli Lilly's future, the market will be closely monitoring its clinical and regulatory progress. Positive results should help Eli Lilly's stock move in the right direction."", ""The biotech could also earn approval for donanemab as a treatment for Alzheimer's disease. It's been hard to develop effective Alzheimer's therapies, and the need for them is on course to get significantly greater in the years ahead as the population of seniors globally grows. Donanemab delivered excellent results in late-stage studies, meaningfully slowing cognitive decline, so it should have a great shot at approval."", ""Lastly, Eli Lilly's revenue growth should be even stronger than it was last year. The company earned several new approvals that will contribute to the top line, and it will no longer have to deal with the challenging year-over-year comparisons that resulted from its COVID-19 antibody sales, which completely evaporated last year. That could all lead to superior returns this year for Eli Lilly."", ""This biotech's long-term prospects continue to get brighter. Investors won't want to miss out on this top stock."", ""David Jagielski (Novo Nordisk): It wouldn't be surprising to see Novo Nordisk have another strong year in 2024. The company still has a long way to go before it's close to capping out its growth opportunities. Ozempic and Wegovy -- its two blockbuster versions of semaglutide -- are going to be strong revenue drivers for the business for the foreseeable future."", ""Last year, the company's revenue grew by 31% to 232 billion Danish kroner ($34.8 billion). Leading the charge was its diabetes medication, Ozempic (which many people have been using off-label for weight loss), with its sales rising by 60% from a year ago. But what may be most promising is that the version of semaglutide approved for weight loss, Wegovy, reported five times more revenue than a year ago."", 'And as impressive as those numbers are, they could get even better for Novo Nordisk. Its parent company, Novo Holdings, recently announced plans to acquire Catalent, which is a manufacturing subcontractor that produces (among other medications) Wegovy. The move will help Novo Nordisk increase the supply of the drug, which has been a problem for the company as demand has been through the roof.', 'That demand could grow even higher if the Food and Drug Administration grants a label expansion for Wegovy as a treatment to help reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. A decision on that application could come within the first half of this year. If the regulator gives it approval, there would be more of a reason for doctors to prescribe the drug to patients, and more of an incentive for insurance companies to provide coverage.', ""Trading at 35 times its estimated earnings, Novo Nordisk's stock might look expensive at first glance. However, much more growth could be coming for the business, and with that potential factored in, the stock's valuation is attractive."", ""Keith Speights (Vertex Pharmaceuticals): What's the most important requirement for a stock to trounce the market? My answer is that investors have to expect that significant earnings growth is on the way. And I think that Vertex Pharmaceuticals is poised to deliver significant earnings growth."", ""Some of that growth will come from the company's cystic fibrosis\xa0 drugs. Vertex is working hard to expand their labels and secure more reimbursement deals for its currently approved therapies. It will also soon file for regulatory approvals of its vanzacaftor triple-drug combo. Not only will this combo be the most powerful and convenient cystic fibrosis therapy yet for Vertex if approved, but it would also almost certainly become the most profitable due to lower royalty payments."", 'Recently approved Casgevy will contribute additional earnings growth. I expect that 2024 will primarily be a ramp-up year for the gene-editing therapy. However, Casgevy could reach peak annual sales in the ballpark of $3.9 billion, according to Goldman Sachs.', 'We can add VX-548 to the list of growth drivers as well. Vertex plans to file for U.S. approval of the non-opioid pain drug by mid-2024. COO Stuart Arbuckle said on the Q4 conference call that the company thinks there\'s a ""multibillion-dollar opportunity for VX-548 in acute pain alone."" Vertex is also evaluating the drug in treating peripheral neuropathic pain.', 'In addition, Vertex expects to advance inaxaplin into phase 3 testing in the current quarter. The drug targets APOL1-mediated kidney disease, which impacts more patients than cystic fibrosis does.', ""Vertex's shares might seem expensive by some valuation metrics. However, I think the most important one to consider for the stock is its price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of 0.58. This low PEG ratio underscores just how much earnings growth Vertex could deliver over the next few years."", 'Where to invest $1,000 right now', 'When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The company already has been a giant in the area of cystic fibrosis (CF) treatment for years, bringing in billions of dollars in earnings. But now Vertex is proving it could expand beyond that specialty area to excel elsewhere, too.', ""Investors bet on Vertex's ability to develop a gene editing treatment for blood disorders -- and they won that bet in recent weeks as Vertex gained regulatory approval for Casgevy. On top of this, Vertex aims to file regulatory requests for two more potential blockbusters this year, meaning catalysts for share performance could be on the horizon. Today, Vertex shares trade for about $423 after rising to a record of $446 last month. Could they climb to $500 this year?"", ""First, a bit of background on Vertex. The company is the market leader in CF treatment, specializing in CFTR modulators, or therapies that correct the function of a key protein. This protein regulates the flow of water and chloride in cells lining various organs -- when it doesn't do the job, a layer of mucus builds up, resulting in the devastating symptoms of CF."", ""Vertex's CFTR treatments have been game changers, increasing life expectancy and quality of life for patients. The latest, Trikafta, even has the ability to address 90% of those with CF thanks to its efficacy in cases involving the most common CF genetic mutation."", ""Vertex CFTR modulators, led by Trikafta, brought in more than $9.8 billion in revenue last year, an 11% increase. Trikafta's dominance could continue -- or it may be unseated by an up-and-coming treatment. But don't worry: Vertex's new candidate may be even better than its biggest blockbuster."", 'Called ""the vanza triple,"" this combination of vanzacaftor, tezacaftor, and deutivacaftor showed it\'s just as good as Trikafta in improving lung function and even better than Trikafta when it comes to lowering levels of sweat chloride. These levels are high in CF because the body has trouble clearing chloride from the cells, so it\'s often used as a measure of disease.', 'The vanza triple is also a once-daily pill compared with the twice-daily Trikafta, which should appeal to patients from a practical point of view.', ""Vertex aims to file a regulatory request for the vanza triple by the middle of this year. Clinical trial data are strong so there's reason to be optimistic about the outcome, and considering Trikafta's revenue, it's clear this potentially better treatment could become a blockbuster, too."", ""The company also aims to file by the middle of this year for the regulatory review of its non-opioid pain candidate, VX-548. Today, treatment options are limited for the very common problem of moderate to severe acute pain. Over-the-counter products often aren't efficacious, and prescription opioids come with the risk of addiction. VX-548, which has delivered strong clinical trial results, could offer an excellent alternative and bring in more than $5 billion in peak sales or more annually, analysts predict."", ""Meanwhile, Vertex's Casgevy for blood disorders sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia will start generating revenue this year, expanding the company's revenue sources beyond the CF specialty."", ""Now, let's get back to our question: Could Vertex's shares reach $500 this year? It's possible. This would represent an 18% gain from today's level, which isn't a huge distance to travel if Vertex continues to report high single-digit or double-digit revenue growth -- and if the company makes progress with Casgevy sales and its regulatory submissions."", ""All of these elements represent important catalysts for the company's long-term earnings, so any positive news could significantly lift the shares. On top of this, it's important to remember that even though Vertex shares have climbed recently, they still remain very reasonably priced. In fact, trading at only 25x forward earnings estimates, they actually look dirt cheap considering the company's long-term earnings potential across treatment areas."", ""This means it wouldn't be surprising to see Vertex stock rise to $500 this year, and even if it doesn't, this top biotech company still has what it takes to gain considerably over time, making it a terrific long-term buy."", 'Where to invest $1,000 right now', 'When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

If you want to skip our overview of the high technology aerospace and defense industry and how it's shaped the modern day world, you can take a look at the 5 Best Aerospace and Defense Stocks to Invest In. "", ""If there's one thing that can be said with certainty, it's that the defense and aerospace industry is one of the most important in the world when it comes to shaping power politics. Global geopolitics, and as the late Henry Kissinger would describe, 'realpolitik' is based on the cold, hard reality of military superiority. Traditionally, this superiority came in the form of strength in numbers - a concept that still holds true today."", ""However, along with this, another concept that has borne the test of time is the use of technology for warfare. Whether it's the Mongols who relied on brutal cavalry tactics, or the Ottoman use of gunpowder that made it a 'gunpowder empire', technology has shaped warfare and global power dynamics."", ""These days, the dominant and only superpower (some would even say a hyperpower) is the United States of America. The U.S., if you're unaware, has the most powerful military in the world, fueled by the greatest number of aircraft carriers for any military and an air force whose aircraft number in the thousands. Safe to say, aerospace plays a crucial role in maintaining American global military superiority, and by effect, it also shapes the global world order."", 'Powering the U.S. military behemoth, which also has the biggest defense budget in the world, are aerospace and defense stocks. These stocks are firms that either directly engage in providing the U.S. military, through the Department of Defense, with their combat or combat support equipment, or those that provide essential and tertiary capabilities such as the defense stock Planet Labs PBC (NYSE:PL) and Maxar Technologies whose advanced satellites carry the ability to remotely image any site in the world and provide military planners with invaluable information to inform their tactical and strategic decisions.', ""Technology sits at the heart of competing when it comes to defense and aerospace stocks, and a technological edge is precisely the reason that the U.S. is at the top of the global power food chain. American jets are envied by dictators and monarchs all over the world, and no matter what their public statements against the U.S. are, it wouldn't be imprudent to assume that they would give an arm and a leg (and then some) to get a taste of what American defense and aerospace stocks have to offer."", ""So what exactly do they offer? Well, let's start with one of the most well known defense and aerospace stocks in the world, the Bethesda, Maryland based aerospace firm Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT). Lockheed, if you're unaware, makes and sells fighter aircraft. While it also has other divisions, such as a space segment that aims to develop a colony on the Moon complete with a nuclear reactor in partnership with the National Aerospace and Space Administration (NASA), Lockheed Martin's bread and butter are airplanes. The firm in its current form came into being in the late 1990s as the U.S. defense industry consolidated (more on that later). Lockheed merged with Martin Marietta in 1995, after it acquired General Dynamics - perhaps one of the most consequential defense and aerospace stocks in the world."", ""That's a tall claim. So what made Martin Marietta so special? Well, the firm bought General Dynamics in 1993 -\xa0 a deal that also saw it acquire the rights to the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon. The F-16 is the most successful fighter aircraft in the world and is used by most of the world's leading air forces. Its success has defined modern day dog fighting - an art that bulky fighter jets such as the The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA)'s F-15 struggled with."", ""Lockheed has moved past dog fighting since then. For aerospace and defense stocks, the 21st century has been all about stealth. Lockheed's F-117 'Nighthawk' and the technologies used on it dominated the stealth debate for decades, and led to the development of the world's only operational fifth generation fighter aircraft, the F-22 'Raptor'. America's crown jewel, the Raptor is an air superiority fighter designed with the singular aim of ensuring that enemy fighters cannot contest the United States Air Force's control of an airspace."", 'So, as aerospace and defense stocks continue to make magic a reality, we decided to take a look at some top stocks. Among these, the notable ones are The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), TransDigm Group Incorporated (NYSE:TDG), and RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX).', 'Andrey Khachatryan/Shutterstock.com', 'Our Methodology ', 'To make our list of the best aerospace and defense stocks, we ranked the 40 most valuable aerospace and defense stocks that trade in U.S. markets by the number of hedge funds that had bought their shares in Q3 2023.

You can skip our detailed talk on the Pro-business South and head over to 10\xa0Fastest-Growing Cities in the South.', 'The American South, long celebrated for its rich history, vibrant culture, and warm hospitality, is now emerging as a powerhouse of economic growth and innovation. Across the region, from the toasty shores of Miami to the bustling streets of Atlanta, opportunities, for both businesses and individuals seeking prosperity and success, are in abundance. From thriving tech hubs to rapidly growing cultural centers, the South is not only experiencing rapid population growth but also fostering an environment ripe for investment, creativity, and advancement.', 'The South of the United States stands as a vibrant hub of economic activity, possessing a diverse array of businesses from multiple industries that enrich the fabric of its cities and communities. The job market in the South is thriving, fueled by a mix of established corporations, innovative startups, and rapidly growing industries such as technology, healthcare, and finance. Companies like The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in Atlanta, FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) in Memphis, and HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA) in Nashville are just a few examples of the prominent businesses that call the South home, providing employment opportunities across various sectors.', 'Southern states are known to have business-friendly policies, including lower corporate taxes, fewer regulations, and incentives for investment and job creation. The location of Atlanta, Georgia has proven to be a great source of enabling international distribution opportunities for The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO). The company’s rapid expansion around the world can be attributed to its unique franchise distribution system that they have operated since 1889. Coca-Cola produces syrup concentrate which is then sold to various bottlers around the world. This helps the company maintain control over its top-secret recipe without the burden of having to run many of the independent bottling facilities. As a major transportation hub, Atlanta benefits from its strategic location, with Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport serving as one of the busiest airports in the world and facilitating global connectivity allowing businesses like The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) to smoothly expand across the globe.', 'Besides that, settling in the South brings some other perks for both individuals and businesses looking to settle here. For example, Texas and Florida are known for their lack of state income tax. The South generally offers a lower cost of living and cost of operations when doing business compared to other regions of the country. This translates into lower expenses for businesses, including labor wages, real estate, and utilities. According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the cost of living in Southern states like Alabama and Mississippi is significantly lower than the national average.', ""These are the same reasons because of which there's a migration underway from California to Texas, of both individuals and businesses. According to the American Community Survey of 2021, the number of individuals that moved out of California and relocated to Texas went up by 36% during the period of 2016-2021."", 'The strategic positioning of the South in the Americas serves as a leverage for businesses looking to access markets both domestically and internationally. With well-developed transportation infrastructure, including major airports, seaports, and interstate highways, the region offers efficient connectivity for the movement of goods and services - like the Port of Houston in Texas is one of the busiest ports in the United States, facilitating trade with Latin America and beyond. Besides that, because the South is home to various industries, ranging from aerospace and automotive manufacturing to energy and healthcare, this diversity creates a robust ecosystem of suppliers, customers, and partners, fostering collaboration and innovation within key industry clusters. For example, the Research Triangle Park in North Carolina is renowned for its concentration of high-tech companies and research institutions, driving innovation and economic growth in the region.', 'Beyond job prospects, the desirability of cities in the South extends far beyond economic considerations. With its warm climate, diverse culture, and rich heritage, the region offers a high quality of life that attracts residents from across the country and around the globe. Cities like Austin, Texas, and Nashville, Tennessee, have garnered reputations as vibrant cultural hubs that have thriving music scenes, world-class dining options, and a lively arts community. Meanwhile, coastal cities like Charleston, South Carolina, and Savannah, Georgia, offer picturesque landscapes, historic charm, and a relaxed pace of life that appeals to residents seeking a peaceful escape from the hustle and bustle of urban living.', 'Choosing to move to cities in the South not only offers a wealth of career opportunities and cultural experiences but also brings with it a host of tangible benefits for overall well-being and quality of life. Having said that, let’s look at the list of 25 fastest-growing cities in the South.', 'To compile the list of the 25 fastest growing cities in the South of the US, we picked 25 southern cities with the highest GDP growth rates as of 2022 which we sourced from The American Growth Project. The list is presented in ascending order of high growth rates.', 'By the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds.

Whether you are a beginner investor or a professional one looking for the best stocks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.', 'GDP Growth Rate: -0.4%', ""Memphis, Tennessee, while not always ranked among the fastest-growing cities in the South in terms of population, exhibits significant growth and economic development driven by its strategic location as a transportation and logistics hub along the Mississippi River, anchored by the FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX), and its strong presence in healthcare and biotechnology with institutions like St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. The city's manufacturing and distribution sectors, supported by its logistical infrastructure, contribute to its economic vitality, alongside cultural attractions such as Graceland and Beale Street, fostering growth in tourism. Recent revitalization efforts aimed at redevelopment, infrastructure improvement, and support for small businesses further contribute to Memphis' overall growth and importance in the region."", 'GDP Growth Rate: -0.4%', ""As a coastal city, Virginia Beach benefits from its scenic beaches, recreational amenities, and tourism industry, drawing visitors and residents alike. The city's diverse economy encompasses sectors such as tourism, military, healthcare, and technology, providing a wide range of employment opportunities. Additionally, Virginia Beach's location is positioned within the Hampton Roads metropolitan area, along with its strong educational institutions and infrastructure investments, which further contribute to its growth and desirability as a place to live and work in the South."", 'GDP Growth Rate: 0.3%', ""Historically known for its iron and steel industry, Birmingham has evolved into a modern metropolis with a booming healthcare, finance, and technology sector. The city's central position within the Southeast region makes it an attractive destination for businesses seeking logistical advantages and access to markets. Moreover, ongoing revitalization initiatives, including downtown redevelopment projects and investments in infrastructure, contribute to Birmingham's appeal as a vibrant and dynamic place for both residents and businesses in the South."", 'GDP Growth Rate: 0.6%', ""Richmond, Virginia, secures its position among the fastest-growing cities in the South due to its diverse economy, cultural vibrancy, and strategic location. As the capital of Virginia, Richmond serves as a key economic and cultural center. Moreover, Richmond's proximity to major metropolitan areas on the East Coast and its robust transportation infrastructure further aid its appeal as a prime location for investment, growth, and opportunity in the South."", 'GDP Growth Rate: 0.8%', 'Huntsville distinguishes itself as one of the fastest-growing cities in the South due to its robust aerospace and technology industries, coupled with a strong emphasis on innovation and research. Known as the ""Rocket City,"" Huntsville is home to NASA\'s Marshall Space Flight Center and numerous defense contractors, driving advancements in aerospace, defense, and engineering. The city\'s thriving tech sector, fueled by the presence of Cummings Research Park, the second-largest research park in the United States, attracts top talent and fosters entrepreneurship and innovation.\xa0', 'GDP Growth Rate: 1.3%', ""Little Rock benefits from its status as the state capital, with a concentration of government institutions, administrative offices, and associated services driving economic activity. The city's cultural attractions, including museums, theaters, and festivals, add to its appeal as a vibrant and dynamic urban center. Moreover, Little Rock's commitment to education is evident through its numerous colleges and universities, such as the University of Arkansas at Little Rock, providing a skilled workforce and fostering innovation and research.

Our fourth quarter results were ahead of our expectations with net sales for the quarter of approximately $2.6 billion, down 1.4% as reported or 4.1% on a constant and legacy basis. Lower demand in residential remodeling and new construction continued to impact our results. Our adjusted EPS for the quarter was $1.96 with benefits from cost containment, productivity and lower input cost.Pricing and product mix declined, offset by lower raw material and energy costs during the quarter, foreign exchange had an impact of approximately $22 million on operating income or $0.27 on EPS. Turning to our full year results. Mohawk's net sales were approximately $11.1 billion, down approximately 5% as reported or 7.7% on a constant basis with adjusted EPS of $9.19. Last year, interest rates increased, creating challenges for our industry, which is highly sensitive to rate fluctuation. Even though we have a diversified geographic footprint, all of our markets were impacted by similar conditions. During '23, existing home sales declined substantially, remodeling projects were postponed and consumers traded down. New home construction was also constrained as rising interest rates in a weak housing market reduced home starts. Throughout the year, the commercial sector remains stronger than residential, though investments began to slow as interest rates increased and lending [cut]. These factors reduced industry demand across our business, creating unabsorbed overhead and shutdown costs. As a result, our industry reduced selling prices, and we passed through declining cost in energy and materials. Under these conditions, we focused on optimizing our revenues and lowering our costs through restructuring actions and manufacturing enhancements.We aggressively managed inventory levels, which reduced our working capital by over $300 million, excluding acquisitions. We've also invested in sales resources, merchandising and new products with innovative features to inspire consumers to purchase Flooring. As we integrate our recent acquisitions around the world, we're investing to improve their operations and product offering. In 2023, we completed 2 acquisitions in Latin America that extended our position as the world's largest ceramic tile producer and solidified our leadership in the region. In the year, we focused our capital expenditures on product innovation and cost reduction as well as product categories that should have the highest growth as the economy improves. In Europe, our porcelain slab and installation expansions are now fully operational. While in North America, our premium laminate LVT projects are progressing. During the second half of this year, we anticipate completing the expansion of laminate in Europe and quartz countertops in the United States.We closed the year with debt leverage of 1.5x, free cash flow of $716 million and available liquidity of $1.9 billion. We are retiring a term loan of approximately $900 million in quarter 1, which has a higher interest rate. We are well positioned to manage current conditions and emerge stronger from this economic cycle when the rebound occurs.Finally, in January, Newsweek recognized Mohawk as one of America's greatest workplaces for diversity. Our talented people are our most valuable asset, and we are proud that our teams mirror the communities in which we operate. And now Jim will provide an overview of our fourth quarter financials."", 'James F. Brunk', ""Thank you, Jeff. Sales for the quarter were just over $2.6 billion. That's a 1.4% decrease as reported and 4.1% on a constant basis as price and mix pressures and unfavorable FX offset limited year-over-year volume improvement. Gross margin on an adjusted basis was 24.7% versus 22.4% in the prior year. The improvement is due to lower inflation, offsetting unfavorable price and mix, along with increased productivity, partially offset by the impact of FX.SG&A expense as a percentage of sales was 18% on an adjusted basis, which was in line with the prior year. That gives us an operating income as reported of 6.4%. On an adjusted basis, 6.7% versus 4.5% in the prior year as lower inflation of $156 million offset unfavorable price and mix of $127 million as well as productivity gains of $57 million only were partially offset by unfavorable FX of $22 million.Interest expense for the quarter was $17 million. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 21.3% in the current year. We expect Q1 2024 tax rate to be approximately 21% to 22%, and the full year 2024 to be between 18.5% and 20.5%. That gives us an earnings per share on an adjusted basis for the quarter of $1.96.Turning to the segments. Global Ceramic had sales of just under $1 billion. That's a 0.6% increase as reported or 4.7% decrease on a constant legacy basis with all geographies seeing increased pressure in price and mix, driven by lower demand and decreases in energy costs. Operating margin on an adjusted basis was 4.8% versus 7% in the prior year. Due to unfavorable price/mix of $41 million, only partially offset by lower energy and material costs of $29 million. Unfavorable FX of $13 million and reduced sales volume of $10 million accounted for the balance of the decrease into the year-over-year margins and were only partially offset by productivity gains of $17 million.Flooring North America had sales of just over $900 million. That's a 3.6% decrease as reported as demand levels and tight budgets continued to pressure pricing and mix. Our commercial category outperformed residential led by the hospitality channel. In this environment, we are focused on new innovative products, which are being well received and position us to take advantage of the pent-up demand.Operating margin on an adjusted basis was 6.9% and significantly ahead of the breakeven margin in the prior year, due to lower inflation of $73 million, especially in material cost, offsetting the weakness in price and mix of $37 million, also benefiting our results for gains in productivity of $29 million. And Flooring Rest of the World, sales were just over $700 million for the quarter. That's a 1.5% decrease as reported and 4% on a legacy constant basis. Stronger volume in insulation, resilient and laminate were offset by continued price and mix pressures in all product categories.Consumer sentiment in Europe continues to be impacted by geopolitical events, combined with higher interest rates, which is limiting remodeling activity and increasing the competitive environment. Operating margins on an adjusted basis were 10.6% versus 7.7% in the prior year, due to lower inflation of $59 million, offsetting unfavorable price/mix of $49 million, productivity gains of $12 million and higher sales volume of $10 million also contributed to the year-over-year improvement in operating performance, only partially offset by unfavorable FX of $9 million. Corporate and eliminations for the quarter were $11 million. And in 2024, we expect them to be approximately $43 million to $48 million. Finally, turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents were $643 million for the quarter, with free cash flow of $56 million in Q4 and $716 million for the full year. Inventories were just shy of $2.6 billion with total inventory reduction of approximately $300 million, excluding acquisitions, with a reduction of 8 days versus the prior year to 130 days.Property, plant and equipment were just shy of $5 billion, with Q4 CapEx of $240 million and the full year at $613 million and D&A of $630 million. The company plans to reduce CapEx by approximately 20% to $480 million in 2024 with D&A of approximately $610 million. The balance sheet and cash flow of Mohawk remained very strong with gross debt of $2.7 billion and leverage of 1.5x, positioning the company well for the market rebound. Now Chris will review our Q4 operational performance."", 'William Christopher Wellborn', ""Thank you, Jim. In our Global Ceramic segment, industry volume remains low, which is compressing prices and margins. All of our geographies are experiencing similar competitive conditions and the industry pass through declining energy costs. We are managing our production to align with demand and have significantly reduced inventory throughout the year. To enhance our mix, we are introducing stylized products in large and small sizes tailored to each market. To contain costs, we have increased productivity, reduced overhead and implemented alternative formulation. In the U.S., we are expanding our distribution through our local service centers and offering new collections with premium Italian styling to improve our product mix. We're expanding our quartz countertop business with innovative new introductions and increasing our participation in the retail kitchen, bath and DIY channel.We've integrated Vitromex in Mexico and Elizabeth in Brazil and are enhancing our sales, marketing and operational strategy. In both countries, demand significantly declined last year due to rising interest rates and slowing economic conditions, which reduced our results. Combined with our legacy businesses, these acquisitions give us leading positions in Brazil and Mexico. In Europe, gas prices have continued to decline and are improving our competitive position. We are optimizing our recent expansion of premium porcelain slabs in Italy to meet growing demand in both the residential and commercial channels. In our Flooring Rest of World business, our improved results in the quarter were driven by lower input costs and productivity gains, offsetting pricing pressure and foreign exchange. The European building product category remains under stress with consumers remaining cautious and retailers reducing their inventory levels. We are investing in new products for 2024 while implementing tight cost control. We are reenergizing our flagship Quick-Step brand with interactive displays. We are completing the transition to rigid LVT, and we have decommissioned our residential flexible line. As material and energy cost decline, we reduced prices across our product categories in response to the competitive market.In insulation, we have recently experienced material increases and are raising our prices accordingly. Our wood panels performance has declined during the year from typically high pricing to a more competitive environment with excess capacity. We continue to implement restructuring actions and enhance our smaller bolt-on acquisitions in insulation, MDF boards, sheet vinyl and mezzanine flooring. In Flooring North America, fourth quarter profitability improved significantly over last year with benefits from decreased input costs, restructuring and productivity gains. Reduced market volumes led to low industry utilization rate and aggressive competition in the marketplace. We are continuing to invest in sales and marketing initiatives to expand our distribution and improve our long-term growth.To enhance our business, we are making capital investments to increase our differentiated features and lower our manufacturing costs. In each product category, we are introducing innovative new collections, which are being well accepted. We have already begun installing our new displays with retailers around the country to accelerate the sales of these product launches. We have created the next generation of LVT with our SolidTech premier collection, featuring new technology that enhances visuals with higher definition, color and texture. We have also introduced a new flooring category called PureTech, which is PVC-free. It is an alternative to LVT made from a renewable polymer core that is waterproof and made with 70% recycled content. The commercial channel outperformed our expectations led by the hospitality sector. We are leveraging our customer relationships to expand our needle punch flooring and trim acquisitions. With that, I'll return the call to Jeff for his closing remarks."", 'Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum', ""Thank you, Chris. As we enter 2024, the industry is at a cyclical low, and we expect quarter 1 seasonality to be more aligned with long-term historical levels. Our businesses are minimizing their expenses, reducing the overhead and restructuring to adapt to the present conditions. We're continuing to invest in innovative products to increase our sales and mix. We are reacting to competitive pressures to optimize our volumes as we pass through the declines in our input costs.We continue to manage our inventory and anticipate temporary shutdowns to align with demand. All businesses are implementing initiatives to enhance our processes to reduce the impact of inflation. Given these factors, we anticipate our first quarter EPS to be between $1.60 and $1.70, excluding any restructuring charges. Over the past 18 months, we have initiated many actions across the company to improve our cost structure, manage our lower volumes and integrate our recent acquisitions. We've closed 4 manufacturing facilities and a number of higher cost production line, consolidated administrative functions and reduced overall headcount. When complete, these actions will collectively decrease our operating cost by approximately $150 million, with about half of this already realized. Combined with our action, improving industry conditions as we emerge from the bottom of the cycle should improve our results in the second half of the year.We anticipate central banks will lower interest rate, expanding home sales, residential remodeling and commercial projects. The pace of improvement of the flooring category will be dependent on inflation rates, consumer confidence and the strength of home sales. We believe the U.S. and Latin American market should improve sooner than Europe, given the current geopolitical pressures. Historically, remodeling activity has led the flooring industry out of downturns, followed by new home construction with commercial projects taking longer given the time to plan and complete. After past housing recession, our industry has expanded with increased sales and margins for multiple years. Housing remains in short supply across all our geographies and increased remodeling investments will be required to update the aging housing stock. Our restructuring actions, investments in new technology, targeted expansions and recent acquisitions will enable us to further expand our business.As the world's largest flooring company, we believe we are uniquely positioned to improve our results as the market recovers. We'll now be glad to take your questions."", 'Operator', ""(Operator Instructions) And today's first question comes from Susan Maklari with Goldman Sachs."", 'Susan Marie Maklari', ""Jeff, maybe we could start out with how you think about the cadence and the sequential lift for the business as we move 2024. How should we think about coming into this year cyclical low that you talked about? And where we can go to over the next several quarters? And do you still think that there's the potential for that second half lift that you talked about on the last quarter call?"", 'Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum', ""Let's start with last year. The interest rates increased throughout the year, and our business declined with lower investments in housing and commercial projects. This year, we anticipate the reverse to occur with starting -- with the industry starting out slower and improving with consumer confidence and interest rates throughout the year. The U.S. mortgage rates have declined from their peak and Brazil has already started to lower their rates.We anticipate Europe to lag given geopolitical risk, energy prices and slower economies in the rest of our markets. We believe the business will strengthen in the second half from these and improved results from last year. We should also see an improvement in product mix as remodeling grows. We expect an extended period of higher demand as the economy recovers and our investments in new products, cost reductions and expansion projects should benefit our future results."", 'Susan Marie Maklari', ""Okay. That's very helpful. And then maybe digging into that a little bit more. When you think about different economies globally and what's going on there relative to the segments of -- Mohawk segments, how do you think about what that could imply for say, Flooring North America versus Global Ceramics or rest of world? Anything that you can give us just in terms of the different segments and how you're thinking about the opportunities there?"", 'Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum', ""Sure. The segments we see that we think we're going to see more improvement in Flooring North America and the Ceramic businesses with remodeling in each category leading the way. We think Europe will take longer to improve where they're going to be pricing pressures continuing in more in the flooring and panels business than the other categories that we have."", 'James F. Brunk', ""And we've kind of seen in Europe, consumers have traded down given tighter lower budgets and the geopolitical crisis is further stressing consumer confidence. But as that region recovers, we know we'll see improvement across our business."", 'Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum', 'Just to remind everybody in Europe, they still have the higher energy costs and the regulations make it a less dynamic marketplace (inaudible) through. And then at the same time, their wages have increased more than the rest of the world impacting inflation.', 'Operator', 'And our next question today comes from Philip Ng with Jefferies.', 'Philip H. Ng', ""Certainly, your business has been hard hit with rates being elevated on the R&R side. When it comes down, is the bigger driver we should be looking at is tied to housing turnover? Rates coming down, just kind of improving consumer confidence that it's going to drive demand? So just trying to gauge what are the things that we should look at? And when we do see -- and how quickly that could kind of unleash that pent-up demand?"", 'Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum', 'In past cycles, it all starts with consumer sentiment. As it starts improving, they start spending money on discretionary spending. And that then impacts the remodeling business, which the consumer, as soon as they feel more comfortable about it, can walk in the stores and start immediately. So that always starts it.The central banks loan interest rates then starts increasing the home resales, which also a large part of that shows up in the remodeling business, but it happens concurrently as you start. Then what happens is with the lower rates, you have the builders start building more new homes and they start increasing. But just to remind you now, so they take longer because our products are put in almost right before they sell the home at the end. And then finally, the piece that works is the, you start planning commercial projects, but they take a longer time to complete, and it works through one after the other.', 'James F. Brunk', ""And so Philip, you also have two key points. One is that in most of our geographies, new homes are really underbuilt. So the inventory is low. And then it's also an aging inventory. So it's kind of in a prime position as we start to come out for remodeling to increase, which puts us in a very strong position."", 'Philip H. Ng', ""Okay. And then a follow-up, Jim. You guys have obviously done a lot on the cost front and pivot the portfolio into -- with some new products. When we think about the recovery in the back half going to 2025, is there a good way to think about the operating leverage of that business, whether it's volumes or just top line more broadly from a drop-down standpoint?"", 'James F. Brunk', ""Well, a couple of things are important there. So you're right that utilization rates, which right now are anywhere between 70% and 80%, different, of course, based on geography and business is driving some shutdowns, which certainly impacted us in 2023. As we look at 2024, lower inventory reductions and improving volumes through the year should reduce that impact. And as you look further in terms of demand increasing, incremental margins could be anywhere from 25% to 35% depending on segment and the product category and also whether you're in the premium or more in the commodity product line."", 'Operator', 'Our next question today comes from Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research.', 'Eric Bosshard', ""Two things, if I could. First of all, on the commercial side, Jeff, you outlined a path to improvement in the back half of the year. I assume that's more residential focused, especially because commercial has been better. What is the path you're expecting or we should expect for commercial to travel from here? And is there incremental pressure that, that applies to the business in '24 or perhaps into '25 relative to '23?"", 'Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum', ""Yes. As the -- we went through '23 and the rates started going up, the commercial business slowed down, we expect it to continue to be slower. We think there's going to be a lag time between projects getting started, given how tight the markets are for borrowing money and the cost of borrowing money -- and then what I described earlier was when the interest rates start falling, the projects will come in, but then the time it takes to start them before we actually feel it could be 1 year to 1.5 years or more."", 'Eric Bosshard', ""Okay. And so within this, the path for revenue growth for Mohawk is 25% of the business is Europe and 25% of the business is commercial. I'm just trying to get a sense of the improvement in rates in U.S. residential. At the same time, those are lags or incremental lags. Can the revenues of the business grow in that type of an environment? Or do you need to wait for the commercial to recover before the total company could generate revenue growth?"", 'Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum', ""We're expecting the growth in the residential business to offset the decline in commercial and so to have growth in it, even though the commercial is weaker."", 'Eric Bosshard', ""And then the second question, the CapEx change in '24 versus '23. Can you just dig into that a little bit, what are you doing less up in '24? What did you do more of '23? Just give us a little bit of perspective on that decision."", 'James F. Brunk', ""Sure. As I noted in prepared remarks, our forecast for about $480 million. About 50% of that is going to be focused on cost reductions and product innovation. 20% will be to complete the growth initiatives that we've identified around laminate, quartz countertops, LVT, porcelain slabs and insulation. And then about 30% is for maintenance and other items in the year."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Stephen Kim with Evercore.', 'Stephen Kim', ""First question, I guess, could you talk a little bit more about the pricing dynamic. Maybe give us a sense for how it's varying at all across products or market. I gather in the U.S., particularly in ceramic, it seems like you've got some pressure coming from imports. But I was wondering if you could just sort of contextualize that sort of across your portfolio, the pricing dynamic specifically?"", 'James F. Brunk', 'So what we believe is that pricing is generally at the bottom or near the bottom. And so you should continue to see that trend through the year from a comparable standpoint. From year-over-year, you certainly still see the pressure. We anticipate though that lower material and energy basically to align with price and mix and then other inflation items such as wages and benefits and insurances and those types of items to be more covered by productivity and restructuring actions. In the EU, Europe remains still weak with pricing pressures and lower production rates. But as Jeff pointed out, as we go through the second half of the year, and that improvement should drive improved year-over-year results.', 'Stephen Kim', 'Okay. Helpful. (inaudible)', 'Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum', ""Sorry, Stephen, you're going to have to repeat that. You broke up."", 'Stephen Kim', '(inaudible)', 'Operator', ""Mr. Kim, this is the operator. We're not able to make out what you're saying. I'm going to clear the question, if you can dial back in, we'll get you back in the queue, sir. Our next question comes from Timothy Wojs with Baird."", 'Timothy Ronald Wojs', ""Just really had two questions. So the first one, maybe just a longer-term or bigger picture question around M&A. Historically, Jeff, kind of coming out of cycles, there's been a little bit more kind of M&A activity in the flooring industry over the last couple of decades. I guess how would you kind of characterize the opportunity around M&A as maybe we come out of the bottoming of this cycle? I mean, would that same kind of M&A opportunity be there today like it was over the last several cycles?"", 'Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum', ""I don't know how to predict the future. But in the past, what's happened is that when you get with low margins in the businesses that the expectations of the sellers are high and the expectations of the buyers are low and you can't get together. So as you start coming out and the margins start going back up, it's easier to align with valuations. So anybody who has wanted the seller who wants to get out, it typically comes as you're in the first couple of innings of the coming out of it, and I would expect the same thing is going to happen this time."", 'Timothy Ronald Wojs', ""Okay. Okay. Good. And then just the second question on the new kind of LVT formulations in line. Is there any way you could give us an update on kind of what you're seeing with that? And maybe any sort of kind of preliminary feedback or expectations for maybe what sales might look like there over the next several quarters?"", 'William Christopher Wellborn', ""I can just comment that we're ramping up our West Coast production and our new extrusion process in Georgia. We've also got unique technologies to provide improved visuals and surfaces And so we've got a -- and we're also introducing a new renewable polymer core as an alternative."", 'Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum', ""So it takes once you get the equipment running, you still have to align the sales with it, and it takes a while to get the you can't sell it before the equipment is up and running. So it's coming up now and the sales are coming up, and we would expect to fill it up as we go through the year."", 'Timothy Ronald Wojs', 'Okay. Any feedback preliminarily from the channel? Or is it just kind of too early?', 'Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum', ""It's too early to tell exactly. We have -- we're gaining commitments to fill it up, and we think we'll get it filled up as we go through the middle of the year."", 'Operator', 'And our next question today comes from Keith Hughes at Truist.', 'Keith Brian Hughes', 'Just a question more on the pace of business in North America and the weak volume in the quarter. Is the remodel market appear to be bottoming out right now? Is there a way you can tell where the pace of business is going here in the short term?', 'Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum', ""All we can do is get feedback. One is we know our own volumes, we get feedback from our customers of how they see it. They're all pretty optimistic at this point about next year getting better, but there's no way to actually measure where the pieces and what's going to change it other than the things that impacted our consumer sentiment in to a bottom. So that helps as people get on the higher prices on homes and things. There's -- people have been postponing it. So it really comes down to gaining confidence in the pieces, and it's not that much different in the other regions, if you want to know the truth. They're all in similar places."", 'Keith Brian Hughes', 'Okay. And then raw materials obviously part of the quarter here. Jim, will those numbers, assuming input costs stay where they are now, will those numbers continue to be a positive for you and sort of how long -- how many quarters until they fade away?', 'James F. Brunk', ""You're right. They are starting to fade away, but I anticipate that we'll continue to see lower energy and materials flow through from a comparison standpoint, at least through the first half of the year on a year-over-year basis, in terms of raw material and energy, which kind of aligns with where price and mix are in that same time period."", 'Keith Brian Hughes', 'So at a diminishing rate in the first and second quarter, is that a way to think about it?', 'James F. Brunk', ""Yes, because there's that much less to kind of flow out of the inventory through the P&L."", 'Operator', 'And our next question today comes from Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan.', 'Andrew Azzi', ""This is Andrew Azzi on for Mike. Just one for me. As you think further out and all the initiatives you've been taking with cost actions and mix initiatives, all the things that have been going on there, where do you think the margin perhaps in Flooring North America can get to maybe on a longer-term basis? And how does that compare to what we're seeing recently in the segment?"", 'Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum', ""The margins in the segment are still low as the plant utilization goes up, the stoppages of the plants, you're going to get decreased costs, you're going to get leverage on the SG&A as it goes up as -- we're going to try to hold the SG&A barely flat and the volume goes up. So we'll get leverage there. And those things will expand the margins. And we think you'll see continued margin growth as it occurs over the next few years."", 'Andrew Azzi', 'And then maybe also actually in these investments in sales resources and merchandising, is there any way to like quantify the magnitude of those initiatives? Or is that more of a longer-term horizon?', 'Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum', 'Part of the magnitude is in the -- you can see it in the SG&A costs, which relative to historical high. We made conscious choices to maintain our sales organizations to continue investing in products, continue investing in merchandising in order to set us up for the long term. So you can see it in the higher level of SG&A as a percent of sales, which will come down as the volume comes up.', 'James F. Brunk', 'And so as you see the pickup in the placement of samples and new materials in the marketplace, and we strengthened in the -- through the second half as consumer settlement, if it improves, then that will position ourselves as we go through the end of the year into next year.', 'Operator', 'Our next question today comes from Joe Ahlersmeyer with Deutsche Bank.', 'Joseph David Ahlersmeyer', ""Jim, you are talking here about the price/mix sort of offsetting the deflation benefits that you're seeing. And then on the other side of it, the productivity sort of offsetting the other bad guys here. I mean it sounds like you're to the place where you've been trying to get to, which is that improvement in EBIT is just going to be a function of volume.And if we're talking about a back half improvement, it seems like maybe what you're suggesting is that we could see flattish EBITDA in the front half, which you're already kind of guiding to on the first quarter and then EBIT up in the second half, so potentially EBIT up for the year? Are you willing to kind of flush that?"", 'James F. Brunk', ""I think that's pretty much in line, Joe, with what Jeff has indicated, As the business strengthens, if in fact, we're correct. -- through the second half of the year, that it will be a volume-led story to improve the results from a year-over-year perspective and then from a full year perspective."", 'Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum', 'Just as a comment, if the business picks up as historical with remodeling, the mix also improves because they sell better products to homeowners.', 'James F. Brunk', 'You also have the benefit, Joe, of more steady production. And with that, you have less of the shutdown, which is that unabsorbed overhead, which also plays into the second half of the year as if volumes do indeed begin to improve.', 'Joseph David Ahlersmeyer', ""Right. And this is actually my second question on the shutdown because it feels like you've had -- I think we're just looking at the back half, the most recent 2 back half, they're sort of negative-on-negative. And the way I've always understood these is they're positive once you lap them. So if you're getting volume growth and you're lapping these, that would kind of be a double positive, just wondering kind of the timing around decision to improve production, do you have to do that in anticipation of the improvement in demand in the back half? Or is it more flexible for you?"", 'Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum', ""Given the capacities we have we assume we're going to flex it up as it occurs, so you won't build the inventories in anticipation of it. If we were running at very high levels, you'd have to build some of it beforehand, but we're not intending to."", 'Operator', 'And our next question today comes from John Lovallo with UBS.', 'John Lovallo', 'The first one is just around the comments on returning to normal seasonality in the first quarter. So if I look at 2017 to 2019, for instance, is it fair to assume that kind of low to mid-single-digit sequential improvement maybe in both Global Ceramic and Flooring Rest of World revenue and maybe flat to slightly down revenue in North America? I mean, is that the right way to think about it? And along those same lines, how do you think about sort of normal seasonality in segment margins from fourth quarter to the first quarter?', 'James F. Brunk', 'So if you look from a segment perspective, in the first quarter, we would believe Flooring North America margin should improve from last year with increased productivity and lower costs, some of which coming from the restructuring actions. Ceramic and Flooring Rest of the World are more impacted by lower mix, a weaker mix and lower volumes with Flooring Rest of the World being impacted more, given so much of its market right now is in Europe and lower prices and wood panels and the laminate categories compressing margins.', 'John Lovallo', 'Got it. Is that cadence that I mentioned in terms of revenue though, consistent with how you guys are thinking about it? Low to mid-single-digit sequential improvement in both global Ceramic and Flooring Rest of the World and maybe flat to down in North America?', 'James F. Brunk', 'Are you speaking of just in the first quarter versus the prior year?', 'John Lovallo', 'Sorry, sequentially fourth quarter to first quarter.', 'James F. Brunk', ""The fourth quarter -- why don't you..."", 'John Lovallo', 'We can follow up.', 'James F. Brunk', 'Follow up on that one.', 'John Lovallo', 'Sure. Not a problem. Second question is just on capital allocation. I know you guys mentioned paying down the $900 million term loan. Any thoughts on when you might get back into the market in terms of repurchases?', 'Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum', ""We haven't decided to do it yet. We can change whenever we determine at the short term, we still see uncertainties in difficult financing conditions. We've decided to pay off $900 million of debt in the first quarter. So we haven't decided to begin buying back stock at this moment."", 'Operator', 'And our next question comes from Laura Champine with Loop Capital.', 'Laura Allyson Champine', ""On the Flooring North America, we were struck with the 700 basis point year-over-year profit improvement, given that sales were down 4%. I'm wondering if that is mostly cost recapture, if there's something else really driving that? And then on the segment profitability for Ceramic, I'm wondering how much of a hit that segment is taking from the acquisitions in Brazil and Mexico?"", 'Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum', ""So the -- in the Flooring North America, the earnings did improve from lower costs, offsetting pricing, restructuring as well as productivity gains in the period. And then we continue to invest in all these different marketing activities and new product collections to drive business. We think it's going to carry over into the first quarter and continue on with the margins."", 'William Christopher Wellborn', ""And Laura, on the South America, both in Mexico and Brazil, had dramatic increases in interest rates, which impacted the acquisitions and our base business. In that environment, we've done a lot to reduce the cost. We've got the businesses more or less fully integrated, and the interest rates are starting to come down, which should improve those businesses a lot in the future."", 'Laura Allyson Champine', 'Got it. But any more granularity you can give me on how much the negative impact was on the acquired revenues to the margins in Q4?', 'William Christopher Wellborn', 'Well, we -- the businesses are fully integrated. I expect that they are somewhat dilutive as the markets have slowed down and were underutilized.', 'Operator', 'And our next question comes from Matthew Bouley with Barclays.', 'Matthew Adrien Bouley', ""Just zooming into Global Ceramic, obviously, price cost was positive for the entire enterprise, but it was still negative. And Ceramic -- any color on how you're expecting price versus cost to play out sequentially into Q1 in Ceramic?"", 'William Christopher Wellborn', ""Yes. Let me -- I'll comment on Ceramic. So Q4 was in line with what we expected. Year-over-year margins were impacted by lower demand, price mix and FX. And then we also took extra production downtime around the holidays to manage our inventories. In that environment, we still were able to enhance our mix with new products. We reduced our cost, and we've increased our productivity And we also got those acquisitions integrated. You are seeing some decline in price/mix as the energy prices are coming down and most of those have been passed along to the consumers."", 'James F. Brunk', ""I would say sequentially, so from -- if that's what you're speaking of from Q4 to Q1, I think you've seen a lot of that bottoming them out and it should actually slightly improve again sequentially."", 'Matthew Adrien Bouley', ""Got it. Okay. Perfect. And then second one, obviously, you've gotten -- or you've announced a few cost reduction programs over the past year. Can you just sort of remind us of the magnitude of these cost reduction programs together? And are you kind of at run rate today in terms of those savings flowing through? Or there's additional benefit to kind of accrue as we move through '24?"", 'James F. Brunk', ""So we focused in the restructuring actions late over the last 18 months of trying to take out high-cost assets, aligning our capacity and implementing other lower-cost processes really across all 3 of the segments. Collectively, there's about $150 million of cost reductions that we should garner from these actions. Almost half of that has been realized in 2023. So you get the remaining portion to flow through 2024. Of course, you're seeing some of that in 2023 being offset by other factors. We'll continue to evaluate our current -- the current situation and take actions as necessary to continue to try to drive improved results."", 'Operator', 'And our next question today comes from Kathryn Thompson with Thompson Research Group.', 'Kathryn Ingram Thompson', ""Tagging on the previous question, you're largely behind the bulk of cost-cutting measures. But earlier in the call, you said that you don't know when you can't predict M&A. But that said, you can -- and we have plenty of public companies and private companies that can comment on their path for growth, including the balance more focused on organic growth and what the pipeline looks like for M&A. So could you please comment on your thoughts on growth going forward, both from an organic, focusing on what products and geographies greater focus and then comment on just the flavor of the pipeline for M&A?"", 'Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum', ""Let's start out with all the businesses are underutilized the capacities that we have. So the goal is to drive the utilization of the present product categories and operations that we have as the business improved. On the other ones, there were -- on the other products that we're investing in are the areas where before we went into the slowdown that we're more constrained and we're investing in those, those include the LVT category, which we're in the process of changing the plants over and they should be filled up as we go through this year. We're introducing a new LVT renewable polymer core structure going into the marketplace and being well accepted. In laminate, we're introducing new technologies in acoustics and durability to improve the use of those assets. Ceramic, we're putting products in that have differentiated color intensity textures and 3-dimensional surfaces. Countertops is in every product category. So the main objective is to use the assets that we own and drive them up as we go through. On the acquisition side, there are no pending acquisitions sitting at this moment that we're ready to close is that we're always in the market to look at opportunities, but there's a large difference between buyers and sellers at the moment, which we discussed before. So there's nothing immediate waiting to be closed at this point."", 'Kathryn Ingram Thompson', 'Any type of -- just in terms of -- from an M&A standpoint, is there -- just a further clarification or confirmation in terms of geographic and/or product focus?', 'Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum', 'The -- was that an acquisition question or an investment question?', 'Kathryn Ingram Thompson', ""That's the acquisition question -- it's an acquisition question."", 'Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum', ""We're just -- in Latin America, we completed 2 acquisitions. They are basically fully integrated. And so there's nothing more to do and those managements are taking care of those. We have a number of bolt-on acquisitions that we're finishing up and improving that we haven't got all the benefits across the world, which we've gone through at earlier points those are going through. We really don't have a specific piece that we need to drive. I guess if I had to pick one, we have our insulation business, which the insulation business is growing. So I would say that investing in additional assets in it would be done sooner than other ones to expand capacities in an additional area. And then on the acquisition side, -- it's really more where do we find the right acquisition that fits in with the business. We prefer bolt-on ones because of the advantages you get by putting them together, but we would go into new geographies if we found the right product and the right management to drive it."", 'Operator', 'And our next question comes from Adam Baumgarten with Zelman.', 'Adam Michael Baumgarten', 'Just Jeff, to confirm, do you expect residential markets to outperform commercial in 2024? And if that is the case, would that have a negative impact on mix and maybe margins?', 'Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum', ""Built in our plans are a decrease in the commercial businesses because what happens is you have the projects that were started a year to 2 years ago completing.

Lorberbaum', ""The whole category is under pressure as the volumes have dropped. As you would suspect, in each category, the more commoditized products have more pressure than the differentiated ones. The carpets under pressure with both pricing and mix. The LVT prices have declined as the prices -- the import prices have come down in it. And there's also less volume being sold in the categories.

Lorberbaum', ""Let's first start out that with imported products, there's a long supply chain. So when the things move, it takes a while before it flows through into the marketplaces and it has to be sustained for a while. So it's too early to tell if the freight rates would move up and stay up. It would flow through after the inventories were absorbed that are already in the market and the prices would rise. At this point, it's too early to decide if it's going to have any input -- impact and be sustained."", 'Rafe Jason Jadrosich', ""If container rates stay where they are today for the next quarter or 2 quarters, do you think that would start to have an impact to pricing and you'd see some price either stabilization or actually improvement?"", 'Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum', 'What happened is, as you would suspect, it would have to flow into the cost of the product. It would raise the prices and the prices in the marketplace would go up, and it would help our local manufacturing.', 'Rafe Jason Jadrosich', 'Great. And then where do you compete the most against imported product? Is that in the U.S.? Or is that in Europe? And the context is obviously with some of the disruptions in the Red Sea. Does that -- like could your Europe business start to benefit from fewer imports from Asia?', 'Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum', 'Yes. The -- so from Asia, you have the imports in Europe would be mostly LVT, then you have the Ceramic is moving where the most aggressive players are in India. Is it -- so those 2 would be the most. On the other side, we do ship product around the world. We ship high-end ceramic all over the place. We ship sheet vinyl to the Middle East and other marketplaces. So it impacts those limited ways.', 'Operator', ""This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Jeff Lorberbaum for any closing remarks."", 'Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum', ""Thank you very much. We appreciate your interest in Mohawk. We believe we're well positioned for the recovery that's going to come in the United States.

Good afternoon to everyone, and thank you for joining us. 2023 marked another solid year of execution delivering consistent financial results while enhancing our critical internet infrastructure and extending our record of .com and .net DNS availability beyond 26 years. During 2023, revenue grew 4.8% year-over-year while operating income increased by 6.1%. Shares outstanding at the end of 2023 decreased by 3.7% from the total of outstanding shares at the end of 2022. Our financial and liquidity positions remains stable with $926 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the year. Over the course of the year, we returned $883 million of capital to shareholders through the repurchase of 4.2 million shares.', 'At year end, $1.12 billion remained available authorized under the current share repurchase program which has no expiration. At the end of December, the domain base in .com and .net totaled 172.9 million domain names, down 0.6% from 173.8 million names at the end of 2022. During the fourth quarter, the domain name base decreased by 1.2 million domain names. From a new registration perspective, the fourth quarter ended with 9 million new registrations, compared with 9.7 million names for the same quarter last year. For the full year, new registrations were 39.4 million names, down 490,000 names from the 39.9 million names we saw during 2022. The renewal rate for the fourth quarter of 2023 is expected to be approximately 73.1% compared with 73.3% a year ago.', 'For the full year 2023, a preliminary renewal rate of 73.9% is below the 74.2% renewal rate of 2022. Both first time and previously renewed names were lower year-over-year. While there are many factors that drive demand for domain names, declining demand from China remains the primary source of drag on the overall domain name base growth. Our domains under management from China-based registrars declined by 2.2 million names in 2023. China-based registrar demand has been weak as a result of several factors including challenging economic conditions, a more stringent regulatory environment and the impact of a weaker local currency combined with retail pricing adjustments. Excluding registrars based in China, our domain name base grew by 1.2 million names or 0.8% during 2023.', 'While the domain name base thus far in 2024 has grown quarter-to-date, we have not yet seen any material changes in the current macroeconomic or regulatory landscape in China. Therefore we believe it’s prudent to expect China to continue to negatively impact revenue and domain base growth during 2024. However, with the China base portion of our base now at about 5% of our overall domain name base, we see the negative trend in China having a less pronounced effect on our overall business after 2024. For 2024, we are expecting the domain name base to remain flat year-over-year with a range of negative 1% and positive 1%. As announced in today’s earnings release, we have given notice of a price increase of $0.67 to the annual wholesale price for .com domain names with raises of our wholesale price from $9.59 to $10.26 effective September 1, 2024.', 'Even after this increase, we believe com will remain highly competitive with other TLD choices. As a reminder, any of our domains maybe registered for terms up to ten years at the current wholesale price. Now I’d like to turn the call over to George. I’ll return when George has completed his financial report with closing remarks.', 'George Kilguss: Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the company generated revenue of $1.493 billion, up 4.8% and delivered operating income of $1 billion, up 6.1% from 2022. Operating expense totaled $492 million in 2023 and was up 2.2% from the previous year. The full year 2023 operating margin was 67% and free cash flow was $808 million. For the quarter ended December 31, 2023, the company generated revenue of $380 million, up 3% from the same quarter of 2022, and delivered operating income of $256 million, an increase of 4.4% from the same quarter a year ago. Operating expense in Q4 totaled $124 million, compared to $122 million last quarter and it was flat from a year earlier.', 'Net income in the fourth quarter totaled $265 million, compared to $179 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $2.860 for the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to $1.70 for the same quarter of 2022. As stated in today’s earnings release, net income for the fourth quarter of 2023 included the recognition of income tax benefits related to the items noted in our release. Cumulatively, these income tax benefits increased net income by $69.3 million, and increased diluted earnings per share by $0.68. Operating cash flow for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $204 million, and free cash flow was $199 million, compared with $217 million and $209 million, respectively, in the year ago quarter. Operating cash flow and free cash flow for the full year 2023 totaled $854 million and $808 million, respectively.', ""I’ll now discuss our full year 2024 guidance. Revenue is expected to be in the range of $1.560 million to $1.580 million. Operating income is expected to be between $1.045 million and $1.065 million. Interest expense and non-operating income net, which includes interest income estimates is expected to be an expense of between $30 million to $40 million. Capital expenditures are expected to be between $35 million to $45 million. And the GAAP effective tax rate is expected to be between 21% and 24%. Overall, Verisign has continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the last quarter and throughout 2023 and we look forward to building on our strengths in our mission in the coming year. I'll now turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."", 'Jim Bidzos Thank you, George. While demand from our registrars in China is expected to continue to remain soft in 2024, the fundamentals of our business remains strong. We firmly believe our responsible and disciplined management of our business and capital continue to service well allowing us to report another solid year, which in our view is one in which we fulfill our stewardship mission of providing secure and reliable infrastructure services, manage our business responsibly and efficiently and returning capital to our shareholders. These goals remain unchanged and support our commitment to deliver strong financial results including steady growth in revenue, operating income and EPS. Thanks for your attention today.

The utilities under the Zacks Utility Gas Distribution industry control miles of underground pipeline network to provide natural gas services to customers. The rising demand for clean, burning natural gas will create more opportunities for natural gas distribution companies.Sempra Energy SRE, with its widespread transmission and distribution lines and interstate pipelines and significant investments in infrastructure development projects, is poised to benefit as natural gas production volumes are expected to increase in the 2024-2025 time frame. Steady investments and expanding infrastructure in crucial production regions should drive the performance of Atmos Energy Corporation ATO, UGI Corporation UGI and MDU Resources Group MDU.', 'About the Industry', 'The shale revolution has substantially increased natural gas production. Its clean-burning nature steadily boosts demand for natural gas from all customer groups. Natural gas distribution pipelines are vital in delivering natural gas from intrastate and interstate transmission pipelines to consumers through small-diameter pipelines. The natural gas network in the United States has nearly 2.3 million miles of underground distribution pipelines. Major concerns for the industry are aging infrastructure and rising investment costs required to upgrade and maintain the vast network of pipelines due to the hike in interest rates. Competition from other clean energy sources can lower demand for natural gas and, consequently, for pipelines.', 'Factors Shaping the Future of the Gas Distribution Industry', 'Production and Export Volumes of Gas to Increase: The short-term energy outlook released by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) indicates that domestic dry natural gas production will grow to 105 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) in February 2024 and continue to remain at that level in 2024 as weather-related disruption decreases. EIA expects dry natural gas production to average 104 Bcf/d through 2024 and will increase to 106 Bcf/d in 2025. EIA also forecasts gas consumption to increase 5% in first-quarter 2024 compared with the year-ago quarter level. Export volumes are expected to increase in 2024 and 2025, providing much relief to natural gas transporters. EIA expects U.S. gross liquefied natural gas (LNG) export volumes to increase nearly 2.2% year over year to 12.09 Bcf/d in 2024, and exports are expected to increase 19.4% to 14.43 Bcf/d in 2025. This indicates the need for more pipelines to send LNG to export terminals.Fresh Investments Create Demand: The clean-burning nature and wide availability of natural gas across the United States are driving demand. At present 187 million Americans use natural gas. The distribution network will continue to transport natural gas to all parts of the United States. With five new LNG export terminals being developed in the United States, there should be increased demand for natural gas pipeline services to transfer the gas from production areas to these terminals. Per EIA, once completed, the five new LNG projects will increase the combined export capacity by 9.7 Bcf/d by 2025. Per Playbook.AGA.org, one residential customer signs up for natural gas service every minute and 80 businesses add natural gas service each day. As production and demand for natural gas increase, more pipelines will be required to safely transfer the commodity to end-users.Possibility of Interest Rate Decline is a Tailwind: Utilities, in order to maintain, upgrade and expand operations, approach capital markets for loans. The utilities have been enjoying near-zero interest rates for the past few years. However, multiple rate hikes by the Federal Reserve took the benchmark rate to the 5.25-5.50% range, which impacted the utility operators. However, in its last four meetings, the Fed did not increase the benchmark rate, and there is a possibility of rate cuts in 2024. The likely drop in interest rates in 2024 would be a positive for utility operators who are planning large investments in infrastructure upgrades and the addition of renewable sources of energy to produce electricity.', 'Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Weak Prospects', 'The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates dull near-term prospects.

We had another strong quarter in Q4, finishing off an exceptional year for Regency. I'm so proud of the success and what we were able to accomplish, a direct result of the hard work of our dedicated and talented team.Tenant demand across our shopping centers remains robust and this is most evident in our record shop occupancy and then the strength of our leasing pipeline. As we look ahead, we believe the current macroeconomic backdrop supports the continuation of positive trends for neighborhood and community shopping centers. This favorable retail demand environment has also served as a great foundation for driving success in creating value through our sector-leading development program. In 2023, we started more than $250 million of new projects. With a healthy pipeline of future projects that the team continues to build, we are on track to start $1 billion or more of projects over the next 5 years.My hat is off to all involved on our team. You have heard me say before, I believe we have the best development platform in this sector. Our experienced team and ability to create value through this platform, and the ability to self-fund with levered free cash flow are unique competitive advantages for Regency.It was also a big year on the transactional side, highlighted by the closing of the Urstadt Biddle acquisition in August. The integration into Regency is now essentially complete. Kudos to all involved for affecting such a smooth and seamless transition.Our ability to grow through developments and transactions is also a testament to the strength and stability of our balance sheet, which, in turn, enabled us to successfully execute on our $400 million bond issuance and revolving credit line recast in January. Our ability to access low-cost capital is reflective of the quality of our portfolio, our track record and the strength of our lending relationships. Most of you on this call also know that I'm very proud of Regency's best-in-class corporate responsibility, reputation and practices. I'm also grateful when the efforts of our team are recognized, such as in Newsweek's most recent America's Most Responsible Companies list, where Regency ranked sixth overall in the United States and first in the real estate and housing category.Our company has been included in this list for all 5 years of its existence, and this is the highest ranking any real estate company has ever achieved. For the benefit of our shareholders and all stakeholders, we are committed to adhering to our corporate responsibility principles in all areas of our business.Before turning it over to Alan, I do want to reiterate that we believe the strength in leasing demand over the past 24 months or so is showing no signs of abating. Consistent job growth and moderating inflation are driving consumer resiliency in our trade areas. We also continue to experience tailwinds favoring brick-and-mortar retail in strong suburban markets, supporting a positive retail environment ahead.Alan?"", 'Alan Todd Roth', ""Thank you, Lisa, and good morning, everyone. We had another quarter with great operating results and leasing momentum, capping off a very active 2023. Our teams are taking full advantage of the healthy retail environment that has continued into 2024. Our success was evident in same-property NOI growth of 3.6% in 2023 excluding COVID period reserve collections and termination fees, with base rent growth being the most significant driver, a function primarily of driving rents higher, commencing shop occupancy and bringing redevelopment projects online.In the fourth quarter, we executed nearly 2.5 million square feet of leases with activity from categories including grocers, restaurants, health and wellness, off-price and personal services. Our leasing pipelines continue to be robust, representing another 1 million square feet of potential new leases in LOI and lease negotiation. We achieved cash rent spreads of 12% on a blended basis in Q4, including 35% spreads on new leasing. Full year 2023 cash rent spread of 10% was our highest annual level since 2016.GAAP and net effective rent spreads were above 20% in the quarter, demonstrating our ability to obtain contractual rent steps in our leases, while also being judicious on CapEx spend. Our same-property percent lease rate was up another 30 basis points in Q4, ending the year at 95.7% and our pre-lease spread widened further to 280 basis points as a result of our leasing success in the quarter. This pipeline of executed deals now reflects more than $40 million of base rent for leases yet to commence.I've said in the past that records are made to be broken, and the team drove our shop lease rate to yet another new record high of 93.4% in the fourth quarter. That represents an impressive 150-basis-point increase in shop leasing year-over-year, reflective of nearly 1.4 million square feet of shop space leased, our highest shop volume in more than a decade.Our anchor lease rate also ticked higher in the quarter and ended the year up 10 basis points over 2022, despite the impact from bankruptcy-related closures. Our teams have made great progress remerchandising this space with exceptional retailers and at higher rents. And in some cases, our ability to recapture the space has acted as a catalyst for long-awaited redevelopment projects.As I look towards 2024, it will take some time to see the benefit of this re-tenanting activity given the 12- to 24-month average downtime associated with anchor re-leasing and lead times on redevelopment projects. For example, some of the Bed Bath spaces that we've re-leased will not rent commence until the fourth quarter of this year. So even with our substantial leasing progress, our anchor commenced occupancy rate ended 2023 lower by 60 basis points. And as a result, we will feel the impact of these vacancies in 2024. That said, the work we've done to date means that we have meaningful visibility into our anchor commencement trajectory. We expect to move our portfolio lease rate even higher in 2024 as demand for space in our high-quality centers continues unabated. This will ultimately drive an elevated level of anchor commencement in late 2024 and into 2025.In closing, I am really proud of the tremendous work and success of our team over the last year, and I'm excited for another great year of leasing activity as the current retail environment is enabling us to create meaningful long-term value at our shopping centers.Nick?"", 'Nicholas Andrew Wibbenmeyer', ""Thank you, Alan. Good morning, everyone. We continue to experience strong momentum in our development and redevelopment program, as our investment teams were active in the fourth quarter. With additional projects breaking around in Q4, we ended 2023 with just over $250 million in starts. This is the highest level of starts in a single year for Regency in nearly 2 decades and demonstrates the incredible work and progress our team has made in sourcing new projects and ramping up our pipeline to achieve our goals.Among our fourth quarter starts is the $23 million redevelopment of Aventura Biscayne. With this project, we are excited to bring additional shop space to one of the best pieces of commercial real estate in South Florida, adjacent to our existing Aventura Square Shopping Center. In the quarter, we also began the redevelopment of Cambridge Square, in Atlanta. This $15 million project will bring in new public as well as extensive improvements to the center.As of year-end, our in-process pipeline has grown to $468 million, and overall, our execution remains on time and on budget with expected blending returns of more than 8%. Our in-process projects are 89% pre-leased on average, reflecting the tremendous work of our team and continued strong demand from high-quality retailers. I'll reiterate Alan's comments about anchor recapture as it can often be a catalyst to unlock accretive redevelopment opportunities and bring exciting new merchandising to reinvigorate a center. We have several examples of those within our in-process redevelopment pipeline today, including Baptist Health and Manor landing, Sprouts at Circle Marina center, REI at Walker Center and Publix at Buckhead Landing.Moving to acquisitions. Private transaction activity remains light, but our teams were still able to close 2 compelling transactions in the fourth quarter. As disclosed previously, we closed on the acquisition of Nohl Plaza in Orange County, California in October. And as a reminder, we bought this center as the future redevelopment pipeline project. And in December, we acquired The Longmeadow Shops in Massachusetts. This 100,000 square foot neighborhood center is fully leased to a strong national merchandising mix of tenants and serves as the premier shopping and dining destination within its trade area. Looking ahead to 2024 and beyond, our team is focused on further building our value creation pipeline and achieving our goal of starting more than $1 billion of development and redevelopment projects over the next 5 years. While it is difficult to get developments to pencil, we continue to be uniquely suited and remain optimistic about finding and executing attractive opportunities. Demand continues to be strong among best-in-class grocers, as well as other retailers and service providers looking to grow their footprints in our high-quality centers and within our trade areas. As Lisa just said, Regency has the best development team in the business, and our free cash flow and balance sheet give us the capability to fund projects and continue the success we enjoyed in 2023.Mike?"", 'Michael J. Mas', ""Thank you, Nick, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with some highlights from our full year results, walk through details related to our initial 2024 guidance range and finish by discussing recent balance sheet activity.We reported NAREIT FFO of $4.15 per share and core operating earnings of $3.95 per share in 2023. Year-over-year growth in core operating earnings per share was nearly 6% excluding the timing impact of COVID period reserve collection, driven in large part by same-property NOI growth of 3.6%. Base rent following significant gains in rent paying occupancy remained the largest contributor to our NOI growth rate at 360 basis points.Turning to our initial guidance for 2024. I'll first refer you to the helpful detail on Slides 5 through 7 in our earnings presentation. Excluding the timing impact of COVID period reserve collections last year, the midpoint of our 2024 range reflects core operating earnings growth of more than 3%. The largest contributor to growth continues to be same property NOI, for which our guidance is in the range of 2% to 2.5%. Base rent growth this year will continue to be driven by embedded rent steps, positive re-leasing spreads, additional rent commencement of shop leases and deliveries of redevelopment projects.However, anchor space recapture is expected to impact our commenced occupancy rate in the near term, primarily a result of bankruptcy-related move-outs and some junior anchor move-outs following lease expiration. Given the longer lead time to open new anchor tenants, we expect our average commence occupancy rate to be down by about 50 basis points year-over-year in 2024, impacting same-property NOI growth in the short term. But more importantly, due to robust tenant demand, we have been releasing the anchor space just about as quickly as we are recapturing it. And we expect our overall portfolio lease rate will trend higher throughout the year. We will begin to benefit from the outsized anchor rent commencement activity beginning in late 2024.In addition to same-property NOI growth, our earnings range also reflects previously discussed accretion from the UBP merger as well as positive contributions from recently completed ground-up developments. As we discussed last quarter, the impact of higher rates and debt refinancing activity remains a headwind to core operating earnings growth this year. That said, we are very pleased to gain greater visibility on this impact as we took advantage of an attractive debt capital markets window in early January to prefund our 2024 maturity with a new $400 million bond priced at 5.25%.Notably, as you consider our guidance range for interest expense and preferred dividends, please note that it is shown net of expected interest income.January proved to be a busy month as we also closed on the recast of our revolving credit facility, which was upsized by $250 million to a $1.5 billion total commitment, which included a tightening of our borrowing spread by 15 basis points. In an environment where access to capital is even more precious and banks are being incrementally more discriminating, we are proud of this result, a reflection of Regency's performance track record, portfolio quality and balance sheet position as well as the strength of our long-standing banking partnerships.Our recent activity has further fortified our sector-leading balance sheet and liquidity position. We remain at the low end of our targeted leverage range of 5 to 5.5x net debt to EBITDA. And following the prefunding of our '24 maturities, our next unsecured bond maturity is not until November of 2025. We have ample capacity on our newly upsized revolver and expect to generate free cash flow north of $160 million this year. This liquidity, balance sheet capacity and differentiated access to capital allows us to further grow our development and redevelopment pipeline, as both Lisa and Nick discussed, and remain opportunistic as we look for incremental avenues to drive growth and value.With that, we are happy to take your questions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question is from Michael Goldsmith with UBS.', 'Michael Goldsmith', ""As we look at the algorithm for 2024, is it that same property NOI growth is solid and then there's some puts and takes related to the merger and debt refinancing and a normalization of some factors that just may limit the flow through. So I guess my question is, what gets you to the low and the high end of the range this year? And then thinking about anchor leasing coming online at the end of 2024 and into 2025, and potentially more normalized comparison kind of going forward. Should that algorithm look better going forward?"", 'Michael J. Mas', ""Hey, Michael. You pack a punch with one question. There is a lot in there. So let me unpack some of that. And if I don't get to it all, I'm certain that others will have similar questions. So just to recap what you said there, from a core earnings perspective, big moving parts, and you've got it largely correct. Same-property NOI growth is the largest and has been the largest contributor to our earnings growth rate. So at the midpoint, we're looking at a core growth rate of just over 3%, same property growth, as you can see, 2% to 2.5% largest contributor there.Very proud to deliver the UBP merger accretion estimate of 1.5% to our growth rate, and that's been consistent, as you know, since we announced the transaction back in May. We continue to deliver upon that underwriting. The headwinds, of course, and you alluded to some of them, but let me just click through them for the benefit of everyone. No further COVID collections of about $4 million. That's $0.02 a share. By the way, we're extraordinarily happy for that headwind to be behind us and kudos to the team for collecting on that rent. Lower termination fees is about $0.02 and of course, the results of our recent debt financing, which we're also extraordinarily pleased with is another $0.02 of headwind to earnings growth.To your follow-up question, just let me start here. The puts and takes of outperformance, underperformance relative to the midpoint. Listen, it's going to come through the NOI plan. And specifically, within the NOI plan, it's going to come through move-outs as it's typically the occupancy and our assumptions around that. We really -- we put together this occupancy plan, this leasing plan. And later in the call, I'm sure Alan will jump in and give us some color. But we feel really good about the direction of our percent leased. When you look at the top line kind of surface level, we're going to move percent leased up towards our 96% target by about 20 basis points this year.And on the surface, it looks like we're moving in the exact right direction, consistent with the dynamics we're seeing in the marketplace, which we spent some time on the prepared remarks describing. But it's what's happening beneath the surface uniquely in 2024, which is causing some of that drag. And we are going to see in the first quarter of this year, a decline in commenced occupancy of about 80 basis points. Much of that -- the vast majority of that, we can see its bankruptcy filings, it's move-outs from Rite Aid. It's the move-outs from Bed Bath & Beyond. We have a couple of high rent paying leases in Manhattan that are expiring, and we've got great activity on the re-lease of those spaces, but we're going to feel that occupancy decline early in the year.And then to your -- to finish it up on your impactful question. As I said in the remarks, we're re-leasing this space is about as quickly as we can get it. By year-end, our commenced occupancy rate should be north of where we started. We should be up by about 20 basis points on that rate on a spot basis again, but it's that downtime. It's that average, it is that impact of timing that's going to weigh on our 2% to 2.5% growth rate. So lastly, '25 is looking from an algorithm perspective, '25 is looking like a disproportionate year to our standard 2.5% to 3% run rate. If all -- again, there's a lot to say here, I'm not giving 25% guidance, but if all can kind of hold together here. '25 we should see the benefit of that commenced occupancy rate coming back online and moving our growth forward."", 'Michael Goldsmith', 'Mike, thanks so much for the...', 'Lisa Palmer', ""If I may just -- if I may just 1 second. Just to come back to what we did say in our prepared remarks because the takeaway -- there's a lot of words because it was a lot -- it was a big question. The health of our business is really good. The demand is really strong, and we said that in all the prepared remarks. And the downtime that's associated with these anchor move-outs is very short term in nature. This is not something that is permanent. Certainly nothing that we're seeing right now. As I said in my remarks, as Alan did, we're not seeing any signs of the healthy demand for our space abating whatsoever. And I think that's a really important thing to remember. Your second question, Michael, maybe."", 'Michael Goldsmith', ""I'll keep it very short. You're looking for NOI growth of 2% to 2.5% for the core portfolio. How are you thinking about growth in the UBP portfolio? Is that growing a little bit faster than the core?"", 'Michael J. Mas', ""It is. Just looking at '24 on a stand-alone basis, the growth rate in that portfolio is north of the 2% to 2.5%. It would be accretive if we had included it in the same property portfolio. It would have been additive, I should say, by about 25 basis points to that 2% to 2.5% range. We like -- and it's consistent. What we saw in that portfolio was a leasing opportunity. We -- that portfolio was about and is about 200 basis points shy of our leased rate. And the team has assimilated the assets into the Regency platform. They are making great progress, and we're excited about the prospects there, but that growth rate is slightly additive."", 'Operator', 'our next question is from Dori Kesten with Wells Fargo.', 'Dori Lynn Kesten', 'I know your acquisition guide currently sits at 0, but can you talk about the volume of (inaudible) describes of interest to Regency out there today? And would you be surprised if you ended the year as a net acquirer?', 'Nicholas Andrew Wibbenmeyer', ""Appreciate the question. Yes, I'll just -- I'll give you a little color to what we're seeing in the market is we're definitely seeing a little pickup. As you heard us say time and time again in 2023, there was definitely a lot of opportunities out in the market. We were happy with the needle in the haystack. We did find, as you know, in 2023. But as we turn the page now into 2024, we are seeing more activity out there. I'd say it's still below historical norms, but definitely a pickup from '23. And as always, we're very active in underwriting and understanding those opportunities. And it goes back to what we always say, when we find opportunities that are equally accretive to our quality and our growth rate and accretive to earnings, we're going to pounce. And so we are hopeful to continue to find needles in the haystack as we move through '24. But as you know, we do not guide to those since we do not have clear visibility."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from Jeff Spector with Bank of America.', 'Jeffrey Alan Spector', ""And thanks for the comments on '24. I know there's a lot to get done, but comments into '25, right? Because I think investors, the market is kind of trying to look past, let's say, some of these headwinds in '24 in terms of a higher longer-term growth rate for that same-store NOI. Can you remind me, like, do you have a company goal target for that same-store NOI? And second would be, what other key initiatives are you working on, whether it's portfolio composition, technology, et cetera, to again drive that higher seems to in a while, let's say, into '25 and beyond?"", 'Lisa Palmer', ""Thanks, Jeff, for the question. We do provide and have really -- always provided kind of our same property NOI growth model, if you will, the wheel as we affectionately call it, it's in our materials. And we do target, over the long term, to grow same-property NOI by 2.5% to 3% annually. And the primary component of that is going to be contractual rent spreads and cash re-leasing spreads. Occupancy, whether -- and in this case, we have percent commenced occupancy in 2024 coming down. Occupancy is one that will move that up or down. And then also we have had a really successful track record of adding to that same property NOI growth through our investment in redevelopment dollars.So that is our long-term goal. And I know -- most of you know this, I've been with the company a long time. I do believe that throughout the years, we have continued to evolve and leverage all tools, technology to get better and to continue to improve processes and also continue to ensure that we are sustaining that long-term NOI growth, which is, as Mike commented, the largest contributor to core operating earnings growth."", 'Jeffrey Alan Spector', 'And then a more detailed question. Can you talk a little bit more about Longmeadow Shops, the acquisition in December? Can you discuss anything around the cap rate, seller motivation, value-add opportunity? Any color on that asset would be helpful.', 'Nicholas Andrew Wibbenmeyer', ""Sure. This is Nick. Appreciate the question, Jeff. I'll start with just your question related to the cap rate and valuation. And again, we talked about needles in the haystack and using every tool we have in our tool belt, and this is one of those opportunities where the seller approached us. They were looking for a units transaction. And as you can appreciate, a units transaction, they care about the currency they're getting. And therefore, they wanted Regency currency. They were a fan of ours from afar. And so for planning purposes, they were ready to transact. They have owned the asset for decades. And so we were excited about the opportunity. And as you can see from a valuation standpoint, this thing is plus or minus 8% going in yield. So very attractive from a yield standpoint as well as quality standpoint. And so we're excited about the future of that opportunity."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from Craig Mailman with Citi.', 'Craig Allen Mailman', ""Maybe I just want to follow up. I know it seems like the call has been kind of focused on what the longer-term earnings power is, given just how good fundamentals are. And I guess I maybe want to come out from a different way. Lisa, you've seen kind of the perfect storm of minimal supply, good demand. and that's helped to push market rent growth. But inflation has also been a big piece of that for the last couple of years as kind of top line for a lot of your tenants have taken off. As inflation starts to moderate back to more normalized levels, I mean, are you seeing any pushback on the market rent growth kind of being able to be sustained into '25? I know it's too early for '26, particularly with some cost pressures maybe on the labor side that take some of the fast casual, fast food guys that they hit some other type of tenancy?"", 'Lisa Palmer', ""I know you had addressed me with that question, Craig, but I think it's best to allow Alan to handle that."", 'Alan Todd Roth', ""Yes, Craig. No, I appreciate the question. As I said in our opening remarks, 10% is our highest total annual rent growth in 7 years. But we prefer to emphasize the GAAP growth as a better measure. And we had some impressive spreads this quarter, 20% total over 50% on new deals. But to your question, from an inflation perspective, we're approaching peak occupancy. So I think when we get there or even when we're near that as we are now, I still think that, that pricing power is there and expectation is that the teams can continue to push on both the spreads and the steps as we go forward.We are getting more steps, and we're getting steps in more deals now and we're getting higher steps. Approximately 95% of our new deals, head steps and 70% of those had 3% or higher. So again, I think the focus is there, and I believe that given where occupancy is that trend can continue, Craig."", 'Lisa Palmer', ""And again, I would just come on top. When you think about our business model and our value proposition to our investors, it is the sustainability and the safety of that growing cash flow stream, which translates to our core operating earnings growth and then dividend growth. And I know we're getting far removed from the 2020 year, but I think it's really important to remember that we went through I mean, a time, the entire world went through a time that none of us had ever experienced before, and we did not cut our dividend. And I think that, that's really important when again, you think about the value proposition for our investors. It's core operating earnings growth plus dividend growth to get to total shareholder returns in the 8% to 10% range."", 'Craig Allen Mailman', ""No. That's helpful. And I don't know, maybe this one is for Mike, I don't want to direct it to any one person, but interest expense headwinds have been an issue. You guys have successfully sourced some acquisitions and you have potentially $1 billion of redevelopment ongoing over the next 5 years. I'm just trying to get at, when you see coming to the numbers, the pipeline really kicking in age occupancy, the timing of some of these anchor box backfills kind of normalizing out. When maybe the headwinds moderate enough that you start to see kind of the leverage multiplier on same-store kind of flow through to earnings? Is that in the next couple of years? Or do you really have to get through the kind of the continued repricing of the debt stack?"", 'Michael J. Mas', ""Another powerpacked question. And I appreciate it, Craig. We do have some headwinds to our growth rate this year, and we kind of -- we just ran through them and clicked through (inaudible). And I think we understand those in '24, and again, happy to dig into any of those that you'd like to. But I do see the power of our existing free cash flow and the ability for us to put that capital directly into our growing and excitingly growing development and redevelopment pipeline, which will add to our growth rate going forward. Beyond -- and we actually have, from a leverage perspective, given our balance sheet position at the low end of our targeted leverage range, we actually have, on a leverage-neutral basis, even more capital driven again by that free cash flow to put into our acquisition intent. And Nick did a nice job of explaining how we think about acquisition activity going forward, which will add to our core operating earnings growth rate. But then you kind of put all that together, combined with the normalization and continued growing of our commenced occupancy through '24 towards the end, unfortunately, into '25. I think those elements will reflect themselves in a core operating earnings growth rate that is at least meeting the objectives that Lisa outlined of being 4% on core operating earnings with a commensurate increase in dividend growth.And if we can do better on the margin in all elements of our business, rent growth maybe even pushed those occupancy records even a little bit higher, all of those should result in maybe a slightly even more amplified vision of growth."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Samir Khanal with Evercore ISI.', 'Samir Upadhyay Khanal', ""Mike, I guess on the integration with Urstadt Biddle, I know you've talked about the 1.5% accretion for a while now. But as you've had time to digest this portfolio, what potential further upside are you seeing maybe from an internal growth standpoint on the occupancy side? And also what about the opportunities to unlock some of the redevelopment opportunities there?"", 'Michael J. Mas', ""Samir, I'll reiterate the -- from the beginning, we've articulated the strategy behind this merger as being a portfolio that looks like Regency's assets. And on a long-term basis, we see a growth rate that looks like Regency's growth rate. But in the near term, one element that we liked about the opportunity was this ability to bring that rent paying occupancy higher than it is -- than it currently exists. And I just articulated. In fact, this year, we are seeing an additive growth rate from a same-property perspective because of that movement and commenced occupancy.So there's not -- that doesn't -- what you didn't hear me say is there's a big redevelopment heavy component of this merger in the near term. But I'm not -- we're not dismissing that either. We do see -- we are -- we know it's a leasing exercise right now. But as we're leasing up this portfolio, we have an eye towards the future as we do in our -- across all of our assets. And we are constantly looking to find value-add accretive redevelopment opportunities for really well-located pieces of commercial real estate, and that's what we bought. And so we're pretty excited about the long-term prospects there."", 'Samir Upadhyay Khanal', ""Okay. And then I guess my question -- second question is around the health of the consumer and the local shop segment. I mean I appreciate the comments on the consumer being resilient and you're not seeing impact to the business yet. When you look at credit card debt, it's at a record level, you see delinquencies that are up. I guess, what are you seeing, not just on the shop segment, but kind of the local side of that?"", 'Lisa Palmer', ""I'll take it if Alan would like to add, please feel free, Alan. But generally speaking, again, think about our portfolio and the types of shopping centers we own neighborhood community shopping centers, tend to be more convenience, value, necessity service. So the consumer -- and in the trade areas that we do mostly operate in, there's not been a lot of job losses. So people are -- they still have their jobs and they are still earning wages. And therefore, they're still spending. And when people do cut back, they tend to not necessarily cut back at their neighborhood and community shopping centers first. They may trade down, which sometimes also will benefit us.So we're not going to say that we -- there will never -- that we won't feel any pressure from consumer spending declining. But again, we have long-term leases, and we can absorb in our tenants because they are high quality, good operators, can also absorb some decline in sales. Sales do not need to grow every year for a tenant to be able to pay their rent. Our tenants are great operators. And it has been, in my experience, we have gone through many cycles at Regency, and there have been moderate recessions. So even if we were to enter into a recession, there have been more moderate recessions where we really didn't feel any pain as a result of that.And then there are ones that are much more significant like the GFC and COVID, and we did feel that pain. But I don't see that -- I don't have any visibility to a recession of that type or that type of decline in 2024. So don't expect to feel much pressure."", 'Alan Todd Roth', ""And Samir, I would just add, just from an operator's perspective, we're going to look first to our AR balances, they're healthy. We're going to look next to sales reports. They remain strong. We're going to then look at are we seeing elevated levels of assignments, we're not. And so I think sort of all of those things also dovetail into the consumers' reaction at least within our portfolio right now."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from Greg McGinniss with Scotiabank.', 'Greg Michael McGinniss', ""Previously spoken about finding ground-up developers maybe lacked the capital to get construction started. Do you still see that as an opportunity for investment this year? Or are there other nontraditional opportunistic investment opportunities that you're looking to pursue this year?"", 'Nicholas Andrew Wibbenmeyer', ""Greg, this is Nick. I greatly appreciate the question. Yes, I mean, I'll just say it this way, again, we have the benefit of every tool in the toolbox available to us when it comes to sourcing, development, acquisition, investment opportunities overall. And so there's no doubt, construction loans are definitely still hard for people to get. So we are continuing to be engaged with smaller developers, but many times, they need more than just debt capital. They need expertise. They need relationships to fix their cash-on-cash returns. And so debt and equity is in play in those conversations. So we continue to have dialogue related to that.And more times than not, those conversations turn into some sort of equity participation given we can bring more tools to the overall deal than just debt. That being said, when appropriate, we will lean in to deals that we want to own long term. We've recently closed a transaction where we are just providing senior and mezz debt on a potential future acquisition, and it may have future development opportunities as well. And so again, we go into these conversations with every tool in the tool belt and bring them out, and we're excited about the future potential."", 'Greg Michael McGinniss', ""Great. For the second question here. It's a bit of a different type of asset from your shopping center, bread and butter. But what's your confidence in re-leasing those Manhattan vacancies that you talked about? And is 1017 (inaudible) potentially addressed this year as well?"", 'Alan Todd Roth', ""Greg, yes, thank you for that question. So I think as Mike mentioned in his opening remarks or maybe it was in the early part of the Q&A, those rents, as you know, are very high in Manhattan, and we did lose 2 key tenants, a former food import in the middle of last year and then a CVS that vacated just last month. We get it back, we lease it. And I think that speaks to the strength of the real estate. We do have signed transactions to solve the Third Avenue premises that unfortunately, sort of ties into that story of down rent paying occupancy in '24, where it's not going to come back online until the fourth quarter likely of this year.And as to Second Avenue, we're negotiating a lease there as well. So the real estate certainly is strong enough for us to find those replacement users. Feel very good about that, but it is impacting us in '24. As to Barney's, we continue to pursue all avenues, leasing it, demising it, redeveloping it or evaluating the sale. And so for us, we're going to act upon what makes the most best financial sense, and it's certainly a top priority for us."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from Ron Kamdem with Morgan Stanley.', 'Ronald Kamdem', ""Two quick ones. So I'm looking at the supplement, I see Avenida and Biscayne and Cambridge Square was added. Maybe can you provide an update on Westbard Square, that looks like $450 million. Is that still coming on in the next sort of 12 to 18 months? And even beyond that, how are you guys thinking about potential sort of new starts in development, given the strength of the balance sheet?"", 'Nicholas Andrew Wibbenmeyer', ""Ron, greatly appreciate the question. So I'll start with Westbard. I'm really happy to announce that redevelopment continues to progress very well. Giant, which is the grocer that we relocated and built a new flagship for them, just opened in the last couple of weeks and is doing tremendously well. So if anyone is in the D.C. area, I would highly recommend you all checking out that asset. We're very proud about the continued redevelopment potential as the team is doing a nice job keeping us on time and on budget.And then as you sort of zoom out and look at the wider scope, we feel really good about our development and redevelopment pipeline. As we mentioned in our prepared remarks, we started over $250 million in 2023, which was the highest amount of starts in quite some time, but we're not done. We still see a very strong pipeline as we look into 2024 and beyond. And it's all aspects of the business. It's redeveloping our existing portfolio. Sometimes it's teared out rebuilds of grocers, as you've seen with Cambridge, as you mentioned. Other times, it is putting these junior boxes back in production in one way or another, as Alan and I alluded to in our prepared remarks.And then last but not least, it is ground up, net new ground-up opportunities that are extremely difficult to pencil. There's no question about that. These are difficult transactions to pull together. But as you saw us execute in 2023, we are doing it. and we're excited about the potential to continue with several projects, some sooner than later. We hope to announce one here in the next couple of weeks in the Northeast. That would be a phenomenal ground-up opportunity. Our team is rounding home base right now. So excited that pipeline we expect to grow and hit as we've articulated, our $1 billion of starts plus or minus in the next 5 years."", 'Lisa Palmer', ""It's -- so many of you know how to play softball. And my favorite softball team actually opened the season today, and this is a softball, give me another opportunity to say the best team in the business, the best platform in the business. Our leveraged free cash flow funds that is a competitive advantage for us. And it's something we're really proud of. And I expect, and I'm confident that we will continue to execute and perform. Thanks for the question. That was great."", 'Ronald Kamdem', ""Great. Just if I could sneak in my second one. Just closing the thought on the same-store NOI. One, specifically, I think you talked about the 80 basis point step in 1Q. What's bad debt that's factored into the same-store NOI guidance and how that compares sort of historical? And then just a bigger picture, is the messaging that because this was sort of an odd year, as you sort of flip the calendar we should be thinking more about sort of the same-store NOI translating to core earnings growth in sort of the mid-single digits and so forth? Just making sure that's still the messaging."", 'Michael J. Mas', ""Yes. Appreciate it, Ron. So from a credit loss perspective, I think is at, I'll take your question. We are planning for 75 to 100 basis points of -- and that's -- by the way, that's a metric on billed revenues, but we are planning for 75 to 100 basis points of credit loss. That is very similar to what we planned for. And in fact, we kind of ended the year towards the lower end of that range in '23. Roughly half of that credit loss provision is, I'd call, bankruptcy related and the balance roughly to traditional bad debt expense.I think to extend your question beyond kind of as we deal with the drop in commenced occupancy in '24, and Alan alluded to some of the reasons for that. But as we solve them pretty actively throughout the course of the year, yes, we're going to -- it's about driving that commence occupancy rate, closing that gap on that SNO pipeline. That is what's going to translate to top line earnings growth on a core basis."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets.', 'Juan Carlos Sanabria', ""Just maybe a sample here, Lisa, given your recent comments. But just -- just curious on why do you think you guys are able to find a decent amount of development start opportunities when, if we listen to some of your peers, they're saying market rents have to grow 40% to 50% for new developments to pencil. Where is the disconnect, I guess, in those two comments?"", 'Lisa Palmer', ""I've never seen Nick play softball, so I'm a little afraid of this answer. I'll let him answer."", 'Nicholas Andrew Wibbenmeyer', ""Thank you, Juan. I appreciate the question. With that set up, now I'm nervous when my answer is going to be. No, I'm kidding. No, it is a great question, Juan. And both are true. And so I just want to keep stressing that. It is very, very difficult to find land that is priced appropriately, tenants that want to pay enough rent to make sense for that land cost and not construction cost. And so it is extremely difficult, and I want to stress that, and it is finding needles in a haystack. But because it's so hard and because you have to have all of those tools in your tool belt is why I am so excited because as Lisa has said time and time again, and I couldn't agree more. We have the best team in the business. We have 23 offices waking up every day, working with our critical grocery partners, helping them grow their business, and they want to grow their business. And so they are sitting at the table with us shoulder to shoulder with the land sellers, with the contractors helping us collectively all figure out how do we make these deals pencil so that they can get that new stores opened. And so although there are very few opportunities where that calculus comes together to make financial sense is not zero, and we continue to get more than our fair share. And so it's because it's so hard to find those opportunities that excites me because we can execute on, and we will continue to."", 'Juan Carlos Sanabria', ""But where do you think we should think of yields for new starts that you may find in '24?"", 'Nicholas Andrew Wibbenmeyer', ""Another great question. As you've seen, our in-process pipeline, as you can see, is in that 8% plus range on a blended basis, I would expect that to be the continued blended rate. That's not to say some opportunity that we want to lean into that we think are really compelling that we won't see the numbers start with a 7 from an initial yield standpoint. And so I would say that's where our eyesight is, is 7% on the low end of the range for really compelling risk-adjusted returns. But on a blended basis, we'd expect to see us continue to push north of 8%. And I'll just stress again on the development side. I do not expect we're going to wake up tomorrow and see a bunch of new supply coming on market because of how difficult it is first and foremost. And then number two, I just want to stress how much we do derisk these opportunities before we close and put a shovel in the ground. And so we have entitlements in hand before we close. We are substantially pre-leased, especially with our grocers and other anchors as you've seen in our pipeline. And so that pre-leasing is really critical to high-quality anchor tenants. And then last but not least, our construction drawings and bids are in hand. And so again, those are the key pieces of the puzzle to have in hand to give us the confidence that these deals do make sense. These projects can move forward. And as you've seen, our teams have done a tremendous job, and I appreciate the daily efforts of once we start making sure we bring them online, on time and on budget. And as Lisa has alluded to, we have a very strong track record of doing that given that history."", 'Juan Carlos Sanabria', ""And one more follow-up if you don't mind that. Anything unusual in the fourth quarter on the OpEx side flowing through the same store that kind of impacted the growth rate for the quarter that we should be aware of taking forward?"", 'Michael J. Mas', ""Yes and no. So on a year -- on a full year basis in '23, I think our growth rate was about 7% on OpEx. Insurance is a big part of the story, Juan. I think you're pretty well versed in what the property insurance markets feel like today, and we're not immune from that impact. Inflation has been an impact as well. As you know, we're largely triple net. So we're able to pass through successfully the vast majority of any increases, including those in insurance to our tenant base. And you can see that in our recovery rate, which has held its own.We did have a unique item in the fourth quarter in real estate taxes where we had kind of a burn off of a brownfield credit in a real estate tax line item. I don't know if you're picking that up in your analysis, but that was one unique item in the fourth quarter. That won't -- so that credit won't recur going forward."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from Anthony Powell with Barclays.', 'Anthony Franklin Powell', 'I guess a clarification question on the junior anchor comments, the ones that moved out at lease expiration. We is all Manhattan and other on the watchlist tenants? Or are there other tenants in that bucket? And if so, why did they move or why do they, I guess, vacate?', 'Alan Todd Roth', ""Anthony, this is Alan. I appreciate the questions. So it was Manhattan bankruptcies. But on top of that, there was many intentional move-outs as part of our intense asset management approach. And so I would give a few examples. I know a number of you live in or around Connecticut and Norwalk, by way of example. We've got a retailer that's going to stop paying rent here next month, and we're going to be down the entire year, and we are bringing Target into that project. It's not going to open until likely Q2, Q3 of 2025. Phenomenal merchandiser, great and highly accretive transaction and something that was absolutely the right long-term decision for us yet impacting 2024. I would also take a couple of office supply examples. We had 3 of them in fact that we intentionally made the decision to replace them one with Sprouts, one with HomeSense, one with a Baptist Health medical facility that I think Nick had mentioned in his remarks. And again, this is just an opportunity to enhance merchandising, provide durable occupancy with enhanced tenant credit and get really significant rent growth. And so that is our proactive way of really thinking through this and just from sort of that uneven climb comment. It's coming off-line here in '24 from a rent paying perspective and filtering its way back in year-end and into '25."", 'Anthony Franklin Powell', ""Okay. I guess on my next question, so you look at '25 and '26, you have like 7% of your anchors, I guess, separations in those 2 years. Are you going to keep doing this and maybe pushing tenants out for higher rent? Or is this kind of the peak of this activity in '24?"", 'Alan Todd Roth', ""I mean, look, I would just say from a practical perspective, we are constantly looking at our entire portfolio for opportunities to appropriately remerchandise, drive accretive returns, focus on redevelopment opportunities. That's always been part of our mantra, and we're going to certainly continue to do that."", 'Lisa Palmer', ""And I'd just add that over the long term, we would come back to our components of same-property NOI growth and would still expect to be in that 2.5% to 3% range."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from Ki Bin Kim with Truist Securities.', 'Ki Bin Kim', ""Just want to go back to Juan's question about OpEx expenses. I guess at high level, I know you explained some of the causes a bit, but I guess how concerning is the increase in expenses as it pertains to your business and ability to push rent? And does that actually start to impact the way you think about where you want to own properties, whether that be local politics or how these local governments are run?"", 'Michael J. Mas', ""I appreciate the question, Ki Bin. Listen, from a -- on a go-forward basis, the directionality of our OpEx and the growth rate in that line item hasn't changed our capital allocation thoughts at all. We continue to want to grow our portfolio across the entirety of our regions. In fact, there's in particular, Phoenix, we'd like to dive into and add to the extent we can find some opportunities in that region and add that to the Regency portfolio, but kind of no change from a capital allocation perspective as a result of the increases. I'll let Alan comment on the pressure that may or may not exist on rent growth."", 'Alan Todd Roth', ""Yes. I would say, Ki Bin, generally speaking, we're not seeing the pressure to rent growth. Does it play a small part? Sure. I mean at the end of the day, our retailers certainly look at their overall occupancy costs. And so when you kind of layer all of that in, again, on the margin, I think that could certainly have a small little impact, but it's just not material enough at this point to really change. I think the reality is where we are."", 'Ki Bin Kim', 'Okay. And then a quick follow-up here. The 50 basis points drag from the commenced occupancy, is that roughly equivalent to the NOI drag?', 'Michael J. Mas', ""Let me break down the NOI drag a little differently, which I think will help you out. So same property NOI growth, let me go through the puts and takes to everyone's benefit, 2% to 2.5%. Again, base rent is going to be the largest positive contributor to that growth rate and in fact, about the same range, and that's rent-steps lease spreads and the commencement of the shop occupancy, helping support that growth. Redevelopment contributions are going to be 50 to 75 basis points to the positive. And then here's your question on the offsets. It's really coming from 2 primary areas, bankruptcies, it's about 50 basis points of drag in that area. And that's both actual announced known bankruptcies as well as the potential for bankruptcies in 2024.And then the Manhattan assets that we've spoken about today at length is dragging us by about 30 basis points. So that 80 bps, Ki Bin, I just summarized for you, that's essentially tied to that rent that commenced occupancy drag in the first quarter."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from Linda Tsai with Jefferies.', 'Linda Tsai', ""Not sure if you answered this with the previous line of questioning, but you said 2025 is setting up based on lease timing to be a disproportionate year of growth in NOI. So does that mean '24 should be disproportionately above your long-term 3% target?"", 'Lisa Palmer', ""I think you meant to say 2025 in your question, not '24?"", 'Michael J. Mas', ""Yes. We're not meeting our objectives in 2024 that we articulate on a long-term basis. And then we -- frankly, I mean, hold -- we're pretty serious about hold ourselves accountable to. And in '25, yes, to the extent -- and again, we're not giving '25 guidance, Linda, but to the extent we -- the portfolio delivers what we see it delivering at the end of this year, going into '25 and compressing that commenced rate, bringing that growing SNO pipeline back online, yes, that should translate into above-average core operating earnings growth. All else being equal, and I stress all else being equal. We're going to have a bond to refinance again in '25. I mean there are other elements to the plan that certainly incorporate that will impact that result. But I think that the idea and the direction that you have in mind is correct."", 'Lisa Palmer', ""Yes. And the other big part of all else being equal is we can't control any geopolitical or economic uncertainty, but all else being equal, absolutely agree that's why I'd come back to over the long term, 2 years isn't a long term, but it's an average. We would expect to be in that 2.5% to 3% average same-property NOI growth."", 'Linda Tsai', ""That's very helpful. And my second question is the Rite Aids and Bed Bath & Beyond that contribute to the economic anchor occupancy decline. Can you just give us an update on where you are in the various stages of signed leases versus working on backfills still?"", 'Alan Todd Roth', ""Yes, Linda, happy to answer that question. This is Alan. So the team has made really great progress. I'll start with Bed Bath & Beyond. Nine of our 12 are executed. And again, so a number of those won't be coming online until later in this year, but really great retailers, REI, RH Outlet, LL Bean, Fresh Market, T.J. Maxx, I mean there's some just great users that are backfilling these. And we've experienced rent spreads that actually exceeded what we anticipated north of 40%, while also keeping our capital levels, as I mentioned in my remarks, at a very, I think, judicious level for those.So the remaining 3 are all in negotiation right now. So we are beyond the point of prospecting. We hope to wrap those up in relative short order and really have all of those back open and rent paying. With respect to Rite Aid, we had at the time of filing 22 locations, including those that came through the UBP merger. Six of those have been rejected. 5 are closed. One is in the closing process. And again, I think a testament to how our team proactively gets out in front of these, 2 of those 6 locations are already leased, 1 to a hardware store, 1 to a fitness operator. And so we're actively pursuing the remaining 4, and we're going to stay on our front foot relative to the balance of that portfolio as Rite Aid continues to go through the process as they haven't officially exited bankruptcy."", 'Linda Tsai', 'And how do we think about those rents for Rite Aid? Are they sort of all over the map? Or are they above or below market?', 'Alan Todd Roth', ""Yes. Interestingly enough, I like the way you just phrase that. They are all over the map. However, I will tell you that we are double digit certainly from a mark-to-market. I'd say, generally speaking, 15% to 20%, but there's some really massive ones that can be in there. There are some flat ones. So -- but generally, I feel really good about certainly the upside depending on those that we get back."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our next question is from Mike Mueller with JPMorgan.', 'Michael William Mueller', ""Just a really quick one here. Your 93.4% small shop leased rate. What's the commenced level that goes along with that? And where do you think that commenced level can grind tire to, if at all?"", 'Michael J. Mas', ""Let's see here. We are at 89.9% commenced shop occupancy. Our -- the SNO on the shops was 350 basis points at year-end. How much higher, what record are you going to set, Alan?"", 'Alan Todd Roth', ""North. We're going to continue to take it north, Mike. I would -- I mean, here -- pretty close -- we're getting pretty close to..."", 'Michael J. Mas', ""I mean we're in thin air, I've used the words to describe the level of lease rate that we have in our shop space. I like to think we can continue to grind it higher. We have great centers really good spaces that are still available and a great leasing team. And we'll keep pushing. The commence is just going to follow, right? So we are going to deliver on these leases. On balance, all in, that spread on a normal basis, including anchor should be 175 basis points between leased and commenced."", 'Michael William Mueller', 'Okay. So that spread applies to small shops, too?', 'Michael J. Mas', ""The small shop spread will be wider. The anchor spread will be narrower. We'll get back to you, Mike, on what kind of long-term spread is."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from the Floris Van Dijkum with Compass Point.', 'Unidentified Analyst', ""Ken Billingsley for Floris. A quick question on your guidance for '24. Given the same economic conditions that are supporting your core business, you're guiding to $100 million in dispositions at approximately 5.5% cap rate. Can you provide some color as to why you're seeing that given your confidence in this cap rate?"", 'Nicholas Andrew Wibbenmeyer', ""Ken, this is Nick. I appreciate that question. As you know, our guidance on disposition is when we have clear visibility to that. And so as we've stated over the last several years now, we feel really good about our portfolio and don't have the need to sell assets. that have risk, but we still have nonstrategic assets that we will prioritize for sale. And so those assets in the guidance, we do have visibility to that pricing. They're nonstrategic. And for instance, a couple of them are single tenants. And so we feel good about that guidance, and we feel good about that cap rate given the assets have been selected to be disposed of."", 'Operator', ""There are no further questions at this time. I'd like to hand the floor over to Lisa Palmer for any closing comments."", 'Lisa Palmer', 'Thank you all for your interest in Regency, and I hope everyone has a great weekend. Thank you.', 'Operator', ""This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.""]"

Profit margins rose this past quarter thanks to a combination of cost cuts and price increases, helping push earnings higher by 16%.

Results displayed lower-than-anticipated revenues.Over the trailing four quarters, Vornado’s FFO plus assumed conversions as adjusted per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on two occasions, met in another and missed in the remaining period, the average beat being 4.18%. This is depicted in the graph below:', 'Vornado Realty Trust price-eps-surprise | Vornado Realty Trust Quote', 'Per a Cushman & Wakefield CWK report, the economic uncertainty, hybrid work environment and declines in office-using employment continued to keep occupiers cautious about office leasing decisions, resulting in a decrease in new leasing activity and renewals in the fourth quarter.The fourth quarter of 2023 marked the eighth straight quarter for office demand being negative. Net negative absorption for the quarter was -19.2 million square feet (msf), which pushed the 2023 annual total to -77.5 msf.The overall U.S. gross leasing activity in 2023 was 282 msf, which reflected a decline of 21% from the prior year. Moreover, the national vacancy rate climbed 200 basis points (bps) in 2023 and finished the year at 19.7%, which marks an all-time high.

The benchmark crossed the major milestone of 5,000 for the first time ever in the latest trading session and is likely to move higher given the favorable market trends. The S&P 500 took almost three years to add 1,000 points after hitting 4,000 level on Apr 1, 2021.A solid earnings season, easing inflation data and a resilient economy are powering the rally, resulting in a gain of 4.8% so far this year. SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY, the proxy version of the S&P 500 Index, has also risen 4.8% (read: S&P 500 Nears 5,000: Bet on High-Beta ETFs).With the S&P 500 hitting new milestones, valuations are also getting lofty, making investors wary about their investments. For those, we have highlighted five stocks in SPY that are undervalued, as reflected in their lower P/E ratio than industry peers. The constituent stocks have a strong Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and a VGM Score of B or better, suggesting their outperformance in the months to come.These include American Airlines Group Inc.

The 4.4% earnings growth represents the best growth rate since the second quarter of 2022 (read: Should You Be Overwhelmed by Solid Q4 Earnings? ETFs to Play).The resilience of the U.S. economy has played a crucial role in the S&P 500's ascent, though it has reduced the likelihood of a near-term rate cut. Factors such as robust retail sales, consumer sentiment and a cooling trend in the producer price index indicate the possibility of the Fed achieving a soft landing, bringing inflation back to target without triggering a recession. This economic resilience, coupled with surging shares of big technology companies and optimism over artificial intelligence, has been a significant driver of the market's upward trajectory."", ""According to LSEG Datastream, the forward price-to-earnings ratio for the S&P 500 rose to 20.4 times, a level last reached in February 2022, far above the index’s historical average of 15.7.

That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock."", ""Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements."", 'Freeport-McMoRan is expected to post earnings of $0.37 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -28.9%.

It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell-side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure -- the Zacks Consensus Estimate."", 'Individual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time. In these situations, the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements.', 'Therefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for Alliant Energy basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price.', 'Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices', ""The change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it.

The global research centers are instrumental in driving product innovation, ensuring that the company stays ahead of consumer demands and environmental considerations."", ""Supply Chain and Input Cost Volatility: PepsiCo Inc (NASDAQ:PEP) acknowledges the challenges posed by increased commodity, packaging, and other input costs, as well as supply constraints. The company's reliance on the open market for essential ingredients and raw materials exposes it to price fluctuations, which can impact profitability. Although PepsiCo employs risk management strategies such as fixed-price contracts and derivatives, the inability to fully pass on cost increases to customers remains a weakness that can affect margins."", ""Geopolitical and Macroeconomic Uncertainty: The ongoing conflict in Ukraine and the resultant geopolitical tensions have led to supply chain disruptions and increased input costs for PepsiCo.

We're seeing each other again, me or you but welcome back."", 'James Caulfield', ""It's great to talk to you again, Bryan."", 'Bryan Douglass Spillane', 'So I have a question, I guess, just -- if you can field a few questions today about the organic sales growth guidance for the year. And maybe if you can help dimensionalize, not just the reduction but how much is recall, things that are sort of external? How much are things that are under your control? And maybe you can think about as we think the balance of that, just how much of improvement are you expecting maybe in North America versus international? Just trying to understand the moving parts of how we get to the organic sales guide for the year.', 'Ramon Luis Laguarta', ""Bryan, this is Ramon. Listen, let me step back for a minute and talk about the last 3 years and then how next year fits into that. So the last few years, we've seen a double-digit growth top line in the business consistently. So I think it's an 11% CAGR and a 14% or double-digit EPS growth consistently as well. So 3 very good years now. We see a -- in '24, we see a normalization of the categories and normalization of the cost, normalization of inflation. So we see everything trending back to our long-term algorithm. Now we guided to upper end of the -- both top line and bottom line at the previous earnings call. We maintained the top line at the upper end for the EPS and we moved back to at least 4% for the top line. And there's a few factors that I think are material. One is the Quaker recall. We had a food safety incident in our Quaker supply chain in the U.S. which has impacted us in November, December and it will continue to impact us, I think, for the -- at least for the first half of the year until we recover our supply chain to normality. We're also seeing some geopolitical events around the world that are impacting some of our markets, which might potentially continue in the first half of next year. And then the third element is, we're seeing a bit of a slowdown in the U.S., both the food category and the beverage category in the Q4. Part of that is slowdown due to pricing and disposable income situation. Part of that is also pivoting between in home consumption and away from home consumption that we're seeing in our business in the U.S. We think that, that might continue in next year. So that's why we're lowering our guidance. We feel good about the consumer in '24 in the U.S. We feel good in the sense of very low unemployment. We feel good about the fact that we think wages will go higher than inflation next year. And we hope that by the summer, interest rates will go down and that will create another source of oxygen for disposable income in households. So we feel good about the consumer in the U.S. but if you think about those 3 elements where -- why we decided to have at least 4% as the guidance for the top line."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.', 'Lauren Rae Lieberman', ""Great. Just kind of continuing on that thread perhaps, Ramon, we're focusing more on Frito. So track channel data hasn't looked great. The reported volume decline sort of bigger than what we've seen in some time for this business. But when I look at a multiyear stack, things look kind of steadier sequentially, when I look at the second half. So just curious how much of maybe these near-term results on Frito and looking into the beginning of the year is more multiyear comps. Is it the consumer backdrop, the impact of pricing? But just thinking a little bit about your expectations for -- plans, I guess, for driving greater units -- unit versus volume growth in '24, thinking about those 2 pieces."", 'Ramon Luis Laguarta', ""Great. Lauren, I think it's a great question. Yes, to summarize, we're seeing the Frito business going back to profitable volume growth in '24. So that's how we're thinking about the business. If you think about the slowdown in Q4 and you link it to the elements that I was referring to, there is a units versus volume dynamic in the Frito business that is quite relevant. As you see consumption moving from in home to away from home, the portion size is meaningfully different. So we're seeing growth in convenience stores. We're seeing growth in away from home in, like 2 to 3x the retail growth but obviously has an implication on volume. As we look at the '24, we have a very strong commercial plan for Frito. We have -- our core brands very well invested. You saw that in '23, we increased our A&M meaningfully, we're planning to do that as well in '24. So Lays has a big increase in A&M, Doritos has a big increase in A&M, all our permissible portfolio, which, if you think about a combination of SunChips, PopCorners, the whole Simply line, Smartfood, that part of the portfolio is growing almost 3x the average of Frito. So we're putting a lot of emphasis on that particular part of the portfolio and make sure that it has -- is well executed in the store. And now that supply chain is back to 100%, we're going to push that part of the portfolio even more aggressively. So we think that Frito will have a continuation of the share of market gains that it's been having for the last couple of years and we expect the category will rebound as well, part of that because of what we'll do with our brands, which obviously have a lot of weight in the overall category. But also the fact that we think consumers will continue to feel better throughout the year and that will recover the Frito-Lay top line, with a more balanced profitable volume growth and pricing versus what we've seen this year."", 'Operator', 'Next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs.', 'Bonnie Lee Herzog', ""All right. I guess I had a question on PBNA profitability. I believe you still have a goal to reach the mid-teen operating margin levels. But so far, we really haven't seen much progress. So Ramon, I guess hoping you could touch on your plans to achieve this. And then maybe whether you're considering making bigger structural changes to your business? If there's possible refranchising of your bottling network. I know you've mentioned in the past that you do see some advantages with broadly owning your network. But just curious to hear if your thoughts on this have changed. And I guess if not, what other initiatives do you plan to implement to improve profitability at PBNA?"", 'Ramon Luis Laguarta', ""Yes. So yes, listen, I would say we don't contemplate at this point any of the structural changes to our business. We continue to think that operating the business has advantages for us in terms of speed of execution and some other elements that -- as we see where the business is growing, in e-commerce, away from home and some other channels of the future, including direct-to-consumer, we think that that's going to create an advantage for us. Now we've been making progress at a good pace in our margin improvement. If you think about the last 3 years, the net revenue for PBNA has grown over $5 billion and the operating profit has grown $1 billion. Core operating margin has expanded more than 150 bps. So we see in the last few years a good improvement in the PBNA business. We think this will continue in the coming years, actually '24, that's the first step. We are optimizing the portfolio. We're eliminating parts of the portfolio that were less profitable. We've referred to bottled water. We've referred to some multi-serve parts of the portfolio that were not that profitable. We continue to optimize our efficiency of our supply chain, we're digitalizing our supply chain. We continue to extract -- eliminate waste from that. We continue to work on global business services that reduces the G&A. We're also optimizing A&M, trying to get to higher ROI on A&M and our trade investments. So we continue to think that optimizing all those elements in the different parts of the P&L will continue to drive a sustainable margin improvement, whilst we remain very competitive in the marketplace. And that's the balance that we're trying to strike with this business. So far, we feel good. The business grew with the rest of the category. If you take everything that is in our system, grew in line with the category and we increased the operating margin. So that's how we're thinking at this point about the PBNA business and with a long-term perspective, obviously, in how we will achieve those 2 elements of growing with the category and increasing the margins."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala with Jefferies.', 'Kaumil S. Gajrawala', ""Welcome back, Jamie. Well, I suppose you've gone nowhere but welcome back to dealing with us, I guess. Can you maybe talk a bit more about international, particularly margins are picking up above the average now, it's scaling quite nicely. But also if there's anything we need to be aware of as it relates to hyperinflation, Argentina, anything like that?"", 'Ramon Luis Laguarta', ""No, listen, I'll start and maybe Jamie can add to this. The -- listen, the international opportunity continues to be probably the most remarkable and exciting opportunity that we have as a company. As you're saying, our international business is very scaled now. It's almost $40 billion between beverages and snacks. So that's, if you compare it to some of the consumer goods companies, it's much bigger than many of the consumer goods companies globally. So clearly, a big opportunity and we have just scratched the surface when you think about the per capita consumption that we have in many markets and the opportunity we have ahead of us. So yes, you pointed it right. As we scale it, some of those businesses are becoming more profitable. And obviously, you start the virtuous circle of scale, reinvestment, margin expansion and getting to a much more profitable and advantaged businesses across many markets. So this year is not going to be a different one. So '24, we continue to think that international will grow faster than the U.S. business. We're seeing good momentum as we start the year in many of our international businesses. Our position is of investment in those markets. So we're going aggressively with productivity and reinvestment for growth, reinvestment in the brands, reinvestments in systems, in capabilities that continue to drive the per caps and our share of market position. So you should think about our international business as a big opportunity for PepsiCo. And with regards to the Argentina situation, it's -- we've already taken that hyper accounting and you shouldn't expect any material impact on organic sales growth."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.', 'Dara Warren Mohsenian', ""Jamie, great to hear your voice again. So I wanted to drill down a bit more on Bonnie's question but looking at PBNA, top line more than profit, there's clearly been some market share struggles in pieces of the portfolio there, sports drinks, CSDs, et cetera. So I guess can you just talk a little bit more about strategy changes from a top line standpoint how you sort of manage the business by product category and your thoughts around share trends as we look going forward?"", 'Ramon Luis Laguarta', ""Good. Listen, we feel good about the overall portfolio of PBNA. We manage the business as a full LRB business, not as a CSD or any particular subcategory. We're looking at the full portfolio and how it's always everywhere for consumers from the morning to the night, in all the multiple occasions. We continue to believe that we have an advantaged portfolio, if you think about our positions in sports and hydration, our positions in coffee, tea, now the portfolio we have in energy and our CSD position as well. So we continue to manage as a full LRB. Now if you think about our priorities for the year, relaunch of Pepsi brand, with a new image, with focus on Zero. Zero has been growing very fast and continues to be an advantage proposition for us. We're putting a lot of additional investment in Mountain Dew and we're launching Baja Blast as a permanent SKU. Baja Blast had been a success as an LTO or limited time offer for many years. Now we're launching it. We're using the Super Bowl as a platform this weekend to launch Baja Blast. We continue to build a position in lemon-lime with Starry. Starry, it's been a good first year. I think we had -- we're over indexing with Gen Z. We see the brand getting some good repeat. You will see also an investment around Super Bowl and continue during the year. So that's our CSD portfolio. We feel very good about Gatorade. Gatorade is -- we're moving from historically a liquid for high-performing athletes to an ecosystem of solutions in hydration and fuel for every type of active person. And we're seeing a lot of traction. It's not only Gatorade per se but it's Gatorlyte, it's GFit, it's Propel, it's Muscle Milk, all under 1 umbrella. And it's not only liquid solutions, it's powders, it's tablets, it's equipment, personalized equipment bottles and others. And now we're launching around the Super Bowl, Gatorade iD, which is also an ecosystem of loyalty and I would say, personalization for our consumers that will bring even more attention to the brand and more loyalty with younger consumers. On Energy, we're very happy with our portfolio. Obviously, the Starbucks coffee energy on one side, Rockstar and obviously, our collaboration with CELSIUS, which is -- which has been a great success and it provides scale to our go-to-market and kind of a point of entry as well with some of our customers. And then our tea business continues to do very well with Pure Leaf and our Starbucks collaboration now moving more into -- beyond coffee, I would say, more refreshers and some other innovation that Starbucks is developing for their cafes and we bring it ready-to-drink.So I think we have a beautiful portfolio. We continue to grow in retail and we're putting a lot of focus in away from home, as we're seeing that the away from home channel is getting much more traffic as people go back to normal mobility and that will be a focus for us going forward. This year, we think we'll continue to grow above the market and continue to gain share in what is a very profitable and high-growth channel. So this is how we're thinking about the business there. And hopefully, it gives you a good sense of the intentionality, how we're thinking about the broad portfolio and our willingness to compete with innovation, with brand investment and with great execution."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Peter Grom with UBS.', 'Peter K. Grom', ""Ramon, I just wanted to ask a follow-up based on your response to both Bryan and Lauren's question on the organic growth. And I may have misheard or could be misinterpreting this but you touched on some of the things that you are doing internally that will drive the improved performance. But I think you also mentioned some sort of assumption around maybe the U.S. consumer would feel better. I mean, if that doesn't happen, would that put the organic revenue guidance at risk? Or would it improve [backdrop], be more of a source of upside versus the greater than 4%?"", 'Ramon Luis Laguarta', ""The current assumption is what I said. We think that the consumer will continue to improve in its confidence and its disposable income throughout the year and that's the ongoing assumption. We have a very strong productivity program in the company, which gives us the fuel for investment and it gives us also a lot of flexibility to manage a potential different consumer reality. But at this point, we think this is the ongoing assumptions. We will invest in our brands, we will invest in our innovation. And now that supply chain is in a very good place compared to what it was a couple of years ago, even last year, we can rely on our -- the tools that we're very good at, which is brand building, innovation, execution, distribution increases, strong commercial programs with our partners and that's where we think we'll grow our -- we will drive the growth of our top line."", 'James Caulfield', ""I'd like to add, just to remind you, 40% of our business is now international. So U.S. is significant but we've got a big business outside the U.S."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Gerald Pascarelli with Wedbush.', 'Gerald John Pascarelli', ""Ramon, I have a question on energy drinks. Can you just speak about your plans to maybe drive performance in Rockstar this year? It's kind of been a relative underperformer in energy drinks for some time. And now you have Bang coming back into the market, which could potentially result in some incremental disruption. So maybe just some color on how you're thinking about driving an improvement in that brand and then maybe broader thoughts on the competitive dynamics within energy drinks this year?"", 'Ramon Luis Laguarta', ""Yes. I mean it's a great question. The energy category continues to grow, as you see above the LRB category. So it continues to expand into new consumers and new consumer occasions, which obviously creates growth for everyone that participates in the category. So we participate, as we've always said, with multiple vectors. We're proud of our Starbucks partnership and some of the products we offer Doubleshot, Tripleshot. We're proud of the Rockstar brand. Rockstar has been growing with the category. More or less, there are some parts of the country where it's well distributed and well preferred. Other parts of the country, we're trying to get consumer penetration and consumer adoption. The areas where we've been successful with Rockstar, which we will double down, the Zero and the Recover parts of the portfolio. Both of them, if you think, is energy with functionality and where we think our R&D can create advantage. So we're pushing those 2 platforms, Rockstar Zero and Rockstar Recover. And that will continue to be the focus of the brand. We've also been focusing on Hispanic consumer. And then also we've seen an increase in the penetration of the brand with the Hispanic population, with Hispanic consumers, will continue to drive that commercial activity. But we see this as a portfolio of solutions, including CELSIUS and how we -- the combined portfolio creates a very good point of execution for us as multibrand. It gives us an entry into convenience stores and some other points of sale away from home. And we'll continue to drive the portfolio as the unit of execution.Forgot, maybe I can say, the other thing we're doing with Rockstar, which we don't talk a lot but it's an important part of our growth, is we're launching Rockstar internationally in many markets around the world, from Asia to Europe, to parts of Latin America. And we're having good success. Again, as a portfolio of solutions that complements our Sting brand that we have in Asia or some other brands that we have in Europe as well."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Robert Moskow with TD Cowen.', 'Robert Bain Moskow', ""In your prepared remarks, you said that you expect less commodity inflation but some agricultural inputs might be higher. Can you be more specific? And I was hoping if you could focus a little on Frito because there's a very big potato crop this past year, vegetable oil costs are coming down. Do you see any relief on the horizon for Frito in that regard?"", 'James Caulfield', ""Rob, it's Jamie. Yes, that is the practice. We comment on the basket of inputs. We don't comment on specific commodity movement but you're absolutely correct that we do expect commodity inflation to moderate from what we had in '23."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan.', 'Andrea Faria Teixeira', ""And great having you back, Jamie, on the investor-facing mode. I have 1 question and then a clarification. First, for Ramon, I was hoping to see if you can elaborate a little bit more on how you're going to be lapping. And if you have a red lap, the mix drags and the shift from -- away from -- to away from home and where your market share is not probably as strong as in snacks as you have in at-home channels. And given your strong gross margin delivery in your experience in negotiating with large box retailers, especially in Europe, are retailers asking you to invest back in promo rollbacks given your gross margin delivery and productivity gains, in particular in North America and Europe? And my clarification for Jamie is, in terms of like your organic sales growth and EPS cadence for the year, anything we should be considering on your guide as far as cadence?"", 'James Caulfield', ""Yes. So on the organic sales growth, first of all, Andrea, it's great to hear your voice again and look forward to interacting as we go forward. Organic sales growth cadence, I'd say, back half stronger than the first half. As we talked about before, we've got the impact of -- the Quaker recall is going to be front half loaded. The laps get easier as we get into the back half of the year. And then some of these consumer pressures that have existed with elimination of stimulus benefits, resumption of student loan payments. We'll lap those as we get into the year."", 'Ramon Luis Laguarta', ""Yes. Andrea, listen, the -- with regards to the customer, I think we're all trying to build win-win plans, in the sense that we grow the business and we create profit growth for both our customers and ourselves. We normally -- we have always the consumer at the center. So it will be a combination of how we generate growth through, as I said, innovation and we have a few big innovations and brand relaunches this year. We put a lot of investment there together with our customers. We'll continue to try to expand our SKUs with the customers and there will be investments there. And there will be some investments in trying to give more value to consumers in a very holistic way, right, through pack price, through promotions, through consumer events that eventually will drive preference for our brands. But that's the way we're thinking about creating this joint business, planning with our large customers that create growth for the category growth for our customers and growth for us. With regards to away from home -- sorry, I forgot, Andrea. The away from home, we see it as an and, not as an or. So we see as an opportunity for us to continue to be in consumers' lives always everywhere. And as consumers pivot away from home, we'll try to be there for them. It's been an area of investment for us, both in distribution and specific solutions for away from home for quite some time. And we're seeing our businesses in the large markets, growing above the market in away from home. So clearly, this will be an opportunity for us for many years to come. And I think we're getting better at mixology. We're getting better at more food experiences, Walking Taco, Doritos Loaded. We're testing food trucks. We're testing many things that will make our brands available to consumers in -- beyond what is a packaged bag or a can or a bottle. Now I think consumers are expecting from us away from home a much more holistic experience and that's where we're working on. And I think we're making good progress."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Robert Ottenstein with Evercore.', 'Robert Edward Ottenstein', ""Great. A little bit more of a detailed question on PBNA. And just want to talk about Gatorade and CELSIUS. So in terms of Gatorade, could you just remind us in terms of the timing of the move to DSD and how that impacted your income statement? And then in terms of CELSIUS, obviously, the brand has done phenomenally well. It's getting pretty big now. Can you talk about how CELSIUS impacts the income statement in the U.S.? And then how your relationship with the company has evolved, you talked about taking Rockstar internationally. CELSIUS is doing some -- going international now. Are you part of that plan as well?"", 'James Caulfield', ""Yes. So on Gatorade, we're 90% through on the transition. Obviously, that move is positive to the financial results overall. That's what we did, is the enhanced performance and we're happy with the margins we have on that business. On CELSIUS, the way that works is, we're sharing the system revenue with CELSIUS."", 'Ramon Luis Laguarta', ""Yes. Listen, we're happy with the collaboration with CELSIUS and that continues to be a part of our growth strategy. There is an opportunity for us to collaborate in the international expansion as well. At this point, it's not, I would say, a scaled opportunity, is a market-by-market opportunity in very particular markets. So yes, we're contemplating that as an option and we're having conversations with CELSIUS, how we can leverage the PepsiCo system for a bigger expansion, nothing short term, I would say, at this point."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo.', 'Christopher Michael Carey', ""So I just wanted to ask about SG&A over the past 4 years. We've talked about this before in this forum but with the annual disclosures now out, I thought it would be a good time to revisit the topic. So specifically, Ramon, can you help contextualize the increase that we've seen in SG&A over the past 4 years, specifically, distribution cost. I'm really curious about maybe how much of this is underlying inflation as opposed to discretionary investments that PepsiCo is making? And I'm not really looking for a specific number per se. I realize that's probably difficult but distribution is up 40% over the past 4 years. And I'm just wondering how much of this is within your control, maybe some of the capabilities that you've been able to build over this time frame and maybe get a sense of how this line item should be trending going forward?"", 'James Caulfield', ""Yes. So as you point out, selling and distribution is the biggest part of that. The A part is less so. And it's going to be a reflection of what you see is; one, you've got market mix or sector mix components in there. We've driven a lot of productivity in our OpEx. But at the same time, we're investing in OpEx to drive distribution and growth in the business."", 'Ravi Pamnani', ""One other thing, Chris, that you should be mindful of is, we do have a big direct store delivery business. So we've had inflation in various things like labor and so forth and that's what's gone up. A&M has gone up as well, which is also kind of all part of that SG&A bucket. We've made numerous capability investments in there as well. So it's all of the above. I wouldn't hone in just on the distribution costs, which I know you focus on from the 10-K. There's a lot of buckets that go in that are far deeper that we can't get into for competitive reasons."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Filippo Falorni with Citi.', 'Filippo Falorni', ""So Ramon and Jamie, you both mentioned the organic sales growth guidance is going to be more second half weighted. And I know you don't provide breakdown on guidance on volumes. But given the importance of volume trends, can you give us a sense of how you see volumes evolving? Is there a possibility in your guidance where you see positive volumes in the second half of the year? And then on the pricing front, maybe you can give us a sense of what you're assuming in terms of pricing? I assume in the U.S. or developed markets, it's limited and there's more pricing in emerging market. But any color on pricing will be also helpful."", 'Ramon Luis Laguarta', ""Yes. I think you should be thinking about -- we want to grow units next year. We will see profitable volume growth next year. And you'll see a more balance between pricing and volume that you have seen in previous year where obviously, we had to cover a huge commodity increase and OpEx increase. As commodities kind of normalize and OpEx inflation normalizes, that lever will be less necessary outside of what has been a normal pricing levels of our category in the 2% to 3%. So you should be thinking about profitable volume growth and more of a normalized pricing compared to what it was in the '18 and '19 time frame."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Callum Elliott with Bernstein.', 'Callum Elliott', ""I wanted to build upon Chris' question, please and ask you about the A&M buckets and the spending behind your brands. I think the K shows advertising up around 10% year-on-year and that's around a 20 basis points increase as a percentage of sales. But we're still quite a long way below pre-pandemic levels as a percentage of sales and comfortably below the average over the last several years. So I guess the question is, are your brands getting enough support? And do we need to see upward pressure on advertising spend as a percentage of sales over the coming years?"", 'Ramon Luis Laguarta', ""That's great. Good point. Obviously, in absolute terms, we have much more A&M. So I think we have increased, last year it was $500 million. And if you think about a longer time frame, a meaningful over $1 billion increase in absolute A&M. So that's absolute dollars that go against our business. We're thinking about continuing that trend, continuing to support both our large brands across multiple markets and then smaller brands where we take the portfolio into the future. So that should be composition of our A&M. Now when you look at the last few years, you should bear in mind, we stopped advertising in Russia, which was a meaningful market for us. So that is reflected in our absolute numbers or relative numbers. So that you should contemplate about. But as a -- if you think about where and how we're going to create demand in the future, you should be thinking about A&M continue to increase. Obviously, we'll look at ways to optimize A&M and we have very strong measures on ROI and various ways to invest in our brands. But you should be thinking about us as a company that continues to build brands, continues to innovate, continue to create value through investment in consumer. And obviously, we also create a lot of demand through our push model. To some of the questions that was asked before, you should be thinking about our selling and distribution cost, not only as a cost but also as a way for us to execute very granularly across millions and millions of points of sale around the world where we reach the final point of sale and we create, I would say, visibility for our brands and impulse for our brands, which are relevant, if you think about the categories where we compete."", 'Operator', 'Our last question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank.', 'Stephen Robert R. Powers', ""Great. Jamie, add me to the list of people excited to work with you again. Actually, this question may be for you and probably is for you. On these calls for the last several years that we've been talking about on and off, just sort of the cash flow profile of the business and the capital investments that have been made in the business and the path eventually back towards a higher level of free cash flow conversion. I guess acknowledging that you've been there in the room the whole time, I guess, now as you assume the role of CFO, do you see any opportunities to speed that process of cash flow generation and a return to higher levels of free cash flow conversion from where we've been trending? Or is it more steady state? And if you could just give us a little perspective on how you're seeing those -- that cash flow profile of the business evolving from here, that would be great."", 'James Caulfield', ""Yes. So clearly, cash flow continues to be a priority. I'd focus on CapEx and we've been very intentional about the levels of capital we've invested in the business. Part of that was to catch up on capacity. We're currently in the midst of big investments in IT and digitalization but over time, I think you'll see the level of CapEx as a percent of sales begin to trend down and that will help with the cash flow conversion."", 'Ramon Luis Laguarta', ""Great. So thank you, everybody. I'm glad everybody is happy that Jamie is back and I see a lot of bonding, great. But obviously, thank you for the confidence that you've placed in our investment and we look forward to seeing many of you at CAGNY in a couple of weeks and having a longer conversation there. Thank you very much."", 'Operator', ""Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's presentation. You may now disconnect and have a wonder a wonderful day.""]"

The Omaha, Nebraska-based company, operating over 30,000 miles of track in the western two-thirds of the U.S., reported $24 billion in revenue for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. Despite facing soft consumer markets, inflationary pressures, and new labor agreements, Union Pacific Corp invested $3.7 billion back into its network, demonstrating a commitment to growth and service excellence.

This blog features Cisco's partnership with Code.org, Darsel, Raspberry Pi Foundation, and Science Buddies, in honor of the incredible work these organizations are doing to advance education opportunities globally."", 'In recognition of International Day of Education today, which was created to campaign for better education reforms and celebrate and advocate for access to education for all, Cisco is proud to spotlight some of its Education-focused non-profit partners that are helping to transform the lives of students and educators globally through their education programs, tools, and platforms.', ""This year's theme, learning for lasting peace, underscores the importance of education as a fundamental human right, crucial for sustainable development and innovation."", 'Code.org', '""As we celebrate International Day of Education, let\'s focus on what students need to succeed in the future. It is clear that Computer Science (CS) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are not only the most engaging subjects for students, they are critical for the future workforce. Every school should be offering students exposure to CS and AI education by next year."" - Cameron Wilson, President of Code.org', 'Code.org is a nonprofit dedicated to the vision every student in every school can learn computer science in K-12. They expand access to computer science in schools, focusing on increasing participation by young women and students from other underrepresented groups.', 'In their first decade, they created a global movement to teach and learn computer science, leading to almost 100 million students enrolled on their platform and policies changed in 50 U.S. states and 70 countries. With AI already changing the global workforce and education, Code.org aims to drive the next wave of innovation by bringing AI and CS to over one billion students worldwide.', ""Code.org's partnership with Cisco has brought its CS curriculum to millions of students, especially from underserved and underrepresented groups, by increasing the number of languages available, building technology to better integrate their platform with the IT infrastructure used by education systems, and enabling offline availability of their courses for students in classrooms with low or no Internet connectivity.

The digital divide in education not only intensifies global inequalities in education but also impedes global economic development - and we can only overcome it by investing in solutions that are effective in low-resource settings. Our commitment to do so stems from the belief that education can and should serve as a catalyst for equality and prosperity globally."" - Abdulhamid Hadir, Founder, CEO Darsel', ""Darsel is a US-based 501c3 nonprofit organization which is focused on improving math learning outcomes in low- and middle-income countries through innovative education technology solutions that bridges the digital divide.
