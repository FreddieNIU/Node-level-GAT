This will take the dividend yield to an attractive 3.9%, providing a nice boost to shareholder returns. View our latest analysis for State Street State Street's Earnings Will Easily Cover The DistributionsWe like to see robust dividend yields, but that doesn't matter if the payment isn't sustainable.State Street has a long history of paying out dividends, with its current track record at a minimum of 10 years. Past distributions do not necessarily guarantee future ones, but State Street's payout ratio of 34% is a good sign as this means that earnings decently cover dividends.The next 3 years are set to see EPS grow by 9.1%. Analysts estimate the future payout ratio will be 34% over the same time period, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.historic-dividendState Street Has A Solid Track RecordEven over a long history of paying dividends, the company's distributions have been remarkably stable. Since 2013, the dividend has gone from $0.96 total annually to $2.76. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 11% over that duration. We can see that payments have shown some very nice upward momentum without faltering, which provides some reassurance that future payments will also be reliable.The Dividend Has Growth PotentialThe company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. It's encouraging to see that State Street has been growing its earnings per share at 5.8% a year over the past five years. State Street definitely has the potential to grow its dividend in the future with earnings on an uptrend and a low payout ratio.We Really Like State Street's DividendIn summary, it is always positive to see the dividend being increased, and we are particularly pleased with its overall sustainability. Earnings are easily covering distributions, and the company is generating plenty of cash. All of these factors considered, we think this has solid potential as a dividend stock.Story continuesMarket movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable.

But when you pick a company that is really flourishing, you can make more than 100%. One great example is Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) which saw its share price drive 144% higher over five years. Meanwhile the share price is 7.0% higher than it was a week ago.The past week has proven to be lucrative for Thermo Fisher Scientific investors, so let's see if fundamentals drove the company's five-year performance. Check out our latest analysis for Thermo Fisher Scientific There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Over half a decade, Thermo Fisher Scientific managed to grow its earnings per share at 22% a year. This EPS growth is reasonably close to the 19% average annual increase in the share price. This indicates that investor sentiment towards the company has not changed a great deal. In fact, the share price seems to largely reflect the EPS growth.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthDive deeper into Thermo Fisher Scientific's key metrics by checking this interactive graph of Thermo Fisher Scientific's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Thermo Fisher Scientific, it has a TSR of 147% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market gained around 15% in the last year, Thermo Fisher Scientific shareholders lost 0.7% (even including dividends). However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 20% per year over half a decade. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Thermo Fisher Scientific better, we need to consider many other factors.

Since the market usually pay for a company’s long-term financial health, we decided to study the company’s fundamentals to see if they could be influencing the market. In this article, we decided to focus on Edwards Lifesciences'  ROE.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. View our latest analysis for Edwards Lifesciences How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Edwards Lifesciences is:25% = US$1.5b ÷ US$6.1b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.25 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.Edwards Lifesciences' Earnings Growth And 25% ROEFirstly, we acknowledge that Edwards Lifesciences has a significantly high ROE. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 9.8% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. This probably laid the groundwork for Edwards Lifesciences' moderate 20% net income growth seen over the past five years.Story continuesWe then compared Edwards Lifesciences' net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 10% in the same 5-year period.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. If you're wondering about Edwards Lifesciences''s valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry.Is Edwards Lifesciences Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?Edwards Lifesciences doesn't pay any dividend, meaning that all of its profits are being reinvested in the business, which explains the fair bit of earnings growth the company has seen.ConclusionOverall, we are quite pleased with Edwards Lifesciences' performance. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down.

[MKTS/GLOB]A majority of economists polled by Reuters still expect this will be the last increase of the current U.S. tightening cycle, after data this month showed signs of disinflation, eliminating the need for the Fed to lift rates further.Higher interest rates increase borrowing costs and can slow economic growth and reduce oil demand.In China, the world's second-largest economy and second-biggest oil consumer, leaders pledged to step up policy support for the economy amid a tortuous post-COVID recovery, focusing on boosting domestic demand, signalling more stimulus steps.Analysts at Deutsche Bank said demand for oil in China ""is now surpassing expectations,"" which ""helps to add confidence in the ability of China to make up (two-thirds) of oil demand growth this year.""(Reporting by Scott Disavino in New YorkAdditional reporting by Noah Browning in London and Florence Tan and Emily Chow in SingaporeEditing by Susan Fenton and Matthew Lewis)]"

The central bank is widely expected to raise interest rates by 25 basis points.Brent oil futures fell 0.5% to $80.48 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate crude futures fell 0.5% to $76.67 a barrel by 21:06 ET (01:06 GMT).

In our brief time together, I asked Jim why his company's stock traded on a forward price-to-earnings multiple of 15 times (discount to the broader market) whereas Microsoft is north of 30 times (premium to the broader market).IBM does cool stuff, I think, and is doing more of it increasingly in high-growth areas such as artificial intelligence and cloud computing. The company's lucrative consultancy business also had a very solid second quarter.Kavanaugh acknowledged the valuation gap between the two tech icons and said it would close with a steady stream of consistent execution.Perhaps that will happen.But the exchange left an impression on me: While IBM fights to command a more premium valuation in a hot tech market, Microsoft's valuation will keep expanding. So why not continue to ride the Microsoft juggernaut as an investor?Microsoft has winning momentum that is supporting higher profit estimates, higher valuation estimates, and higher cash flow estimates.The first place to look for Microsoft's momentum is, naturally, AI.Microsoft's reveal of its AI subscription pricing last week sent the stock to a new high — and with good reason, Jefferies veteran tech analyst Brent Thill explained.""AI is already benefiting Azure results and this should only be the beginning given Microsoft's pole position in a decade-long industry evolution. Microsoft announced M365 copilot pricing of $30 per user/month, which reflects a 53-83% pricing uplift, far greater than the 15-30% previously thought,"" said Thill. ""If just half of our conservative estimate of ~115 million E3 &amp; E5 users adopt M365 copilot, M365 copilot could drive $20.6 billion in incremental revenue representing ~53% growth from FY23 O365 commercial revenue or ~10% upside to FY23 total revenue. Hence, we believe that M365 copilot could help double O365 commercial revenue in the next 4-5 years.""Story continuesThose are huge potential financial statement drivers. Actually, they helped Microsoft set the stage for a major reset upwards of Street expectations, not unlike what Nvidia did a few months ago.So there is all of that.While Microsoft drives towards its AI future, the near term appears quite nice as well.The company's cloud business Azure continues to hum as the economy enters a ""steady state"" period, as characterized to me in a chat with American Express CEO Stephen Squeri.""Our recent CIO Survey showed stable, but muted, IT budget growth expectations for CY23. However, several forward looking indicators in the CIO survey support Microsoft's strong relative positioning within those muted CY23 budgets growth expectations, including Microsoft being the only software vendor in our survey for which forward growth expectations actually improved sequentially in our survey,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss pointed out.Notice I haven't even dived into the possible material profit lift from the addition of Activision Blizzard. I am running out of room on this page but will simply say this gaming deal will be another big tailwind to Microsoft.What can go wrong with this bull's dream story? Perhaps the economy falls off a cliff and Satya Nadella steps down as CEO in 2024.But I don't see either happening.And that means more winning for MicrosoftEarnings are out July 25.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

17,925e7fcc-5d78-304b-8c24-c25dc522d4f3,MSI,2023-07-24,3 Telecom Stocks Likely to Exceed Q2 Earnings Estimates,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-telecom-stocks-likely-exceed-103200155.html,1690194720,STORY,"['T', 'TMUS', 'MSI']","[In the second quarter of 2023, telecom stocks witnessed healthy demand trends with an accelerated pace of 5G deployment and increased fiber densification. Despite supply chain woes related to continued chip shortage and challenging macroeconomic environment, the industry seemed to benefit from higher demand for scalable infrastructure for seamless connectivity amid a wide proliferation of IoT devices.A steady pace of 5G deployment and investments by leading carriers to increase their fiber footprint in rural areas to bridge the digital divide seemed to infuse confidence in the sector. Telecom firms facilitated a seamless transition from an economy-of-scale network operating model to demand-driven operations by offering easy programmability and flexible automation.Factors at Play5G Rollout Gaining Steam: With the exponential growth of mobile broadband traffic and home Internet solutions, demand for advanced networking architecture has increased manifold. This has forced service providers to upgrade their networks and support the surge in home data traffic. To maintain superior performance standards, there is a continuous need for network tuning and optimization, which creates demand for state-of-the-art wireless products and services. Moreover, a faster pace of 5G deployment is expected to augment the scalability, security and universal mobility of the telecommunications industry and propel the wide proliferation of IoT.Fiber Densification: Expansion of fiber optic networks by carriers to support their 4G LTE and 5G wireless standards, as well as wireline connections, are acting as tailwinds. The fiber-optic cable network is vital for backhaul and the last mile local loop, which are required by wireless service providers for 5G deployment. Fiber networks are also essential for the growing deployment of small cells that bring the network closer to the user and supplement macro networks to provide extensive coverage.Inflated Equipment Prices: The industry is continuously facing an acute shortage of chips, which are the building blocks for various equipment used by telecom carriers. Moreover, high raw material prices due to inflation, the prolonged Russia-Ukraine war and the consequent economic sanctions against the Putin regime have affected the operation schedule of various firms. Although various steps have been taken to address the global shortage of semiconductor chips and devise ways to increase domestic production, the demand-supply imbalance has crippled operations and largely affected profitability due to inflated equipment prices.Network Convergence: With operators moving toward converged or multi-use network structures, combining voice, video and data communications into a single network, the industry is increasingly developing solutions to support wireline and wireless network convergence. The industry players have enabled enterprises to rapidly scale communications functionalities to a vast range of applications and devices with easy-to-use software application programming interfaces. The wide proliferation of cloud networking solutions further results in increased storage and computing on a virtual plane. As both consumers and enterprises use the network, there is tremendous demand for quality networking equipment.Focus on Novel Technologies: Telecom firms enable customers to manage exponential bandwidth costs effectively through steady investments in state-of-the-art technologies. These include DOCSIS (Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification), DSL (Digital Subscriber Line) and Next Generation PON (Passive Optical Network) platforms that enable service providers to deliver the highest bandwidth to subscribers across any physical connection. Further, some firms offer a variety of pathways for providing services through a combination of network-based video transcoding, packaging, storage and compression technologies required to deliver new IP video formats and home gateways to connected devices inside and outside the home.Story continuesHow to Pick?A multitude of telecom stocks is likely to report earnings in the coming weeks. A solid earnings performance of the telecom sector could sow the seeds for future investments and R&amp;D in network and 5G-enabled devices for superior 5G capabilities as the industry seeks to capitalize on the inherent growth potential.Among a diverse range of companies, choosing the right stock for your portfolio could appear to be a colossal task.

Considering the popularity of these latter categories of stocks, it will come as a pleasant surprise for healthcare investors that, at this point, financial professionals are considering healthcare to be a sector that is creating more opportunities for the technology industry and those investing in it as well.""Too Compelling To Ignore""This trend was noted by Jamie Cox, the managing partner at Harris Financial Group, in a CNBC interview on July 21. In the words of Cox, the healthcare sector, which is viewed as a sector operating just adjacent to the tech sector today, is ""too compelling to ignore"" at this moment, signaling that those who want to cash in on the booming tech trade this year can take an alternative route through the healthcare sector to achieve their goals. Here are some comments Cox made on CNBC on this matter:""It's all about healthcare, Dom. I mean, you know, tech and healthcare, the intersection of those two sectors cannot be ignored. There's so much innovation, so much R&amp;D that happened during the pandemic and we're just starting to see some of the pieces of it come to the marketplace. One particular area, medical devices - I mean you have people voluntarily wearing continuous glucose monitors. So companies like Insulet or Dexcom, these are companies that are absolutely knocking it out of the park. People are paying really close attention to healthcare and that is brought about by technology.""Story continuesConsidering these comments, investors can expect to see an increasing interplay between technology companies and healthcare companies in 2023, especially as tech companies themselves begin rapid innovative processes through artificial intelligence. On whether there is an investing angle in healthcare from the tech and artificial intelligence viewpoint, Cox said the following:""It's already happening. I mean, Meta has created algorithms to predict protein folding. The President actually referenced cancer research, and Meta is already sort of doing it. Protein folding will predict different strains of proteins and how they will react and create cancers in the body, and if you can predict the way a protein will fold then you can create drugs or target therapies to be able to treat it. So this is already here, and basically, we're gonna be seeing the benefits of it, or investible benefits of it in the years to come. But it's not gonna necessarily accrue to a healthcare company or a drug company like Pfizer. It can also accrue to a company like Meta. That's what I'm saying, the intersection of healthcare and technology is here to stay.""Medical Devices For The WinFor Cox, the place to be in the healthcare investing space is the medical devices area. He believes that this area will see the ""most benefit"" in light of the growing collaboration between healthcare and technology services. He pinpointed companies focusing on diabetes and cardiac care as the ones to keep an eye on as the situation further develops since these areas will become the best investment opportunities in the healthcare space in the near future, according to Cox.Considering viewpoints such as those presented by Cox this July, healthcare companies such as Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), and Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA), among others, can expect to reap the benefits of the tech rally and the AI boom just as much as other players in the market. Considering this interplay of the two sectors, we have compiled a list of the best healthcare stocks to buy under $50 for investors looking to buy into this promising industry today. Considering current developments, these stocks may very well be some of the best long-term healthcare stocks to stick by.

As companies’ offerings and macro environments change, the attractiveness of their stocks fluctuates. And, of course, valuations play a massive role in the attractiveness of stocks. A stock that was a great buy when its forward price-earnings ratio was 20 will, all things being equal, not be beautiful after its forward P/E ratio has zoomed up to 60 in a relatively short amount of time. This has led to the rise of growth stocks to sell.Because growth stocks tend to surge that way, such names are particularly susceptible to quickly going from “buys” to “sells.” With all of that in mind, here are three growth names that were once, in my view, great buys but now have become growth stocks to sell.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsTesla (TSLA)Tesla (TSLA) supercharging station during the day.Source: Arina P Habich / Shutterstock.comAt the end of 2022 and the beginning of this year, when Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) was trading at around $120, I was a big fan of TSLA stock. I viewed worries about Elon Musk’s controversial free-speech policies at Twitter as overdone. I also thought that the Street was overly concerned about the price cuts that the automaker was implementing. The market was undervaluing the company, given its very powerful brand name and rapidly growing top and bottom lines. It’s a classic case of one of those growth stocks to sell.But I’ve always realized that the electric-vehicle maker has significant weaknesses and threats. Specifically, its EVs reportedly often require major repairs, and it’s facing significantly increased competition in all its major markets. Further, its advanced driver assistance offering has always been widely criticized, and its upcoming Cybertruck is so unorthodox that it may not appeal to many consumers.Moreover, TSLA stock, trading around $280, has more than doubled from its lows. And now has a vast forward-price-earnings ratio of 82. Given these points, I view TSLA as one of the growth stocks to sell.Story continuesStarbucks (SBUX)StarbucksSource: ©iStock.com/garett_mosherBack in 2012, I viewed Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) stock as a great opportunity. The shares had rebounded greatly from their huge decline during the Great Financial Crisis but were still way below their all-time highs. Moreover, the shares were not rising very much due to worries about the company’s competition, doubts about the strength of the U.S. economy, and theories that the firm had saturated its market in the U.S. and Europe.But I was upbeat about  Starbucks’ opportunities in China and the efforts it was making to improve its food offerings and start serving alcohol. (I’m not sure what wound up happening with that particular effort). As with Tesla years later, I thought the market was greatly undervaluing the firm’s strong brand name. As a result, I bought Starbucks stock in 2012 and made some money from it, but I sold it in 2016 when its CEO and founder, Howard Schultz announced in late 2016 that he would resign.Now, however, I view the work-from-home trend and stepped-up competition from Luckin Coffee (OTC:LKNCY) in China and Dutch Bros (NYSE:BROS) in the U.S. as major threats to the firm. As a result, although I’m hopeful that SBUX’s CEO can turn around the company, I would not advise owning SBUX stock at this point and view it as one of the growth stocks to sell.McDonald’s (MCD)Source: ShutterstockI’ve been bullish on McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) for many years, citing the fast food company’s appealing offerings, incredibly powerful brand name, and rapid growth.However, amid irrational fears about a U.S. recession, the valuation of MCD stock has become far too high.  Specifically, the shares now have a trailing price-earnings ratio of 31. I believe the valuation is over the top for a well-established company that will never deliver explosive growth.Finally, I believe that McDonald’s will encounter greatly steeped up competition from  Restaurant Brands International’s (NYSE:QSR) Burger King. QSR has delivered strong growth in recent quarters and last year “hired former Domino’s (NYSE:DPZ) CEO Patrick Doyle as its executive chairman.” Doyle did a great job of turning around Domino’s and could very well do the same for Burger King.   On the date of publication, Larry Ramer’s wife was long LKNCY.

28,d5d79052-b325-3234-ad22-270cfcf2dddb,ADM,2023-07-24,Calculating The Fair Value Of Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/calculating-fair-value-archer-daniels-110033682.html,1690196433,STORY,['ADM'],"[Key InsightsArcher-Daniels-Midland's estimated fair value is US$77.79 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to EquityWith US$82.14 share price, Archer-Daniels-Midland appears to be trading close to its estimated fair valueOur fair value estimate is 17% lower than Archer-Daniels-Midland's analyst price target of US$93.33Today we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Archer-Daniels-Midland The CalculationWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.77bUS$3.00bUS$2.25bUS$2.21bUS$2.19bUS$2.19bUS$2.21bUS$2.23bUS$2.26bUS$2.30bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x3Analyst x3Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ -0.75%Est @ 0.10%Est @ 0.71%Est @ 1.13%Est @ 1.42%Est @ 1.63% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.9% US$2.6kUS$2.6kUS$1.8kUS$1.7kUS$1.6kUS$1.5kUS$1.4kUS$1.3kUS$1.2kUS$1.2k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$17bThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.9%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$2.3b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (6.9%– 2.1%) = US$49bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$49b÷ ( 1 + 6.9%)10= US$25bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$42b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$82.1, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Archer-Daniels-Midland as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Archer-Daniels-MidlandStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is not viewed as a risk.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Food market.OpportunityGood value based on P/E ratio compared to estimated Fair P/E ratio.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to decline for the next 3 years.Moving On:Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

(NYSE:PM) boasts of strong institutional backing",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/79-ownership-philip-morris-international-120017219.html,1690113617,STORY,['PM'],"[Key InsightsInstitutions' substantial holdings in Philip Morris International implies that they have significant influence over the company's share priceA total of 15 investors have a majority stake in the company with 50% ownershipOwnership research along with  analyst forecasts data  help provide a good understanding of opportunities in a stockEvery investor in Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 79% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Philip Morris International. View our latest analysis for Philip Morris International ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Philip Morris International?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.We can see that Philip Morris International does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Philip Morris International's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Philip Morris International is not owned by hedge funds. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is Capital Research and Management Company with 17% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 8.7% and 6.1% of the stock.After doing some more digging, we found that the top 15 have the combined ownership of 50% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Philip Morris InternationalThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Philip Morris International Inc.. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$236m worth of shares (at current prices). It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 21% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Philip Morris International. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Philip Morris International better, we need to consider many other factors. Case in point: We've spotted   2 warning signs for Philip Morris International  you should be aware of.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

(NYSE:GS) has announced that it will be increasing its dividend from last year's comparable payment on the 28th of September to $2.75. This will take the annual payment to 3.1% of the stock price, which is above what most companies in the industry pay. See our latest analysis for Goldman Sachs Group Goldman Sachs Group's Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsWe like to see robust dividend yields, but that doesn't matter if the payment isn't sustainable. The last dividend was quite easily covered by Goldman Sachs Group's earnings. This means that a large portion of its earnings are being retained to grow the business.Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 64.5%. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 25% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.historic-dividendGoldman Sachs Group Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has an extended history of paying stable dividends. Since 2013, the dividend has gone from $2.00 total annually to $11.00. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 19% per annum over that time. Rapidly growing dividends for a long time is a very valuable feature for an income stock.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowThe company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. Goldman Sachs Group has seen EPS rising for the last five years, at 18% per annum. Shareholders are getting plenty of the earnings returned to them, which combined with strong growth makes this quite appealing.Goldman Sachs Group Looks Like A Great Dividend StockIn summary, it is always positive to see the dividend being increased, and we are particularly pleased with its overall sustainability. Earnings are easily covering distributions, and the company is generating plenty of cash. All of these factors considered, we think this has solid potential as a dividend stock.Companies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock. Taking the debate a bit further, we've identified 2 warning signs for Goldman Sachs Group that investors need to be conscious of moving forward. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

That also gave it the highest-grossing opening of the year, passing the $146.4 million haul from April’s The Super Mario Bros. Movie. The film made its debut the same weekend as director Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer, which brought in $82.5 million.An estimated 200,000-plus moviegoers bought tickets to see both new releases on the same day at chains such as AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. and Cineworld Group Plc’s Regal, a phenomenon dubbed “Barbenheimer.” The simultaneous releases energized theatergoers, helping cinemas turn in the best weekend since Avengers: Endgame made its debut in April 2019.Other notable performers include Sound of Freedom, a film about child sex trafficking, which took in about $19.8 million in its third weekend, according to Comscore. The unlikely summer hit beat out Paramount Pictures’ Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One, which fell to fourth place with $19.4 million.The weekend was a bright spark in an otherwise difficult summer for the film industry, which has suffered disappointing results from big-budget movies such as The Flash and Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.Read More: Cinemas Say People Are Booking the Barbenheimer Double FeatureStory continuesBarbie, which was directed by Greta Gerwig and stars Margot Robbie in the title role, was expected to generate between $140 million and $175 million in its domestic debut, according to industry tracker Boxoffice Pro. Forecasts rose sharply in recent weeks as the picture enjoyed a surge in media attention. The movie made an additional $194.3 million in international markets, Warner Bros. said.The picture pokes fun at the history of the doll while addressing criticisms about her unrealistic figure and materialistic nature. It follows the character as she breaks out of the perfect world created by toymaker Mattel Inc. and into one with real people on whom the doll has had an impact.Shares of Mattel closed up 1.8% in New York Monday, while Warner Bros. Discovery Inc. dipped 2.5%.Read More: Mattel’s Risky Bet on a Feminist Barbie Movie Might Just WorkBarbie was heavily promoted, even by Hollywood standards, including a life-size replica of her Dreamhouse in Malibu, California, and giant pink boxes in theaters in which fans could have their photo taken. Many cinemagoers, including adults, wore pink or dressed like characters from the film.Ryan Gosling, appearing as Barbie’s boyfriend Ken, brought a comedic element that likely resonated with fans who might not otherwise have wanted to see a film about a fashion doll, according to Robert Marich, author of Marketing to Moviegoers: A Handbook of Strategies and Tactics. This was evident in trailers and other promotions.“The Ken marketing was hilarious,” he said.The success of the picture is also a victory for El Segundo, California-based Mattel, which is seeking to adapt a sprawling roster of toy brands from Hot Wheels to Barney into film and TV properties.Universal Pictures’ Oppenheimer also had a lot going for it. Director Nolan’s new picture has a three-week lock on Imax theaters domestically. Nearly half of Oppenheimer’s ticket sales in the US and Canada were for so-called premium large format screens, with Imax screens accounting for 26% of the domestic box office performance.Nolan has traditionally put out his movies, such as The Dark Knight and Inception, on the third weekend of July. A fierce advocate for cinemas, he moved to Universal from Warner Bros. after the latter decided to release its 2021 film slate simultaneously on streaming.(Updates with final weekend totals.

AMC's preferred shares fell 2.2%.Domino's Pizza shed 3.2% after the world's largest pizza chain missed quarterly revenue estimates, as increased delivery fees and higher prices hurt demand for its pizzas and chicken wings.Exchange operator Nasdaq trimmed the weight of a handful of companies that make up close to half of the Nasdaq 100 to address ""overconcentration"" in the benchmark.Also on tap on Monday, S&amp;P Global is expected to show its flash services sector PMI fell to 54.1 from 54.4 in June, while the closely watched flash manufacturing PMI likely rose to 46.4 in July from 46.3 in the previous month.

Retailers worldwide have also pitched in, with brands from Zara to H&amp;M and Gap rolling out themed merchandise like Barbie hoodies, perfumes and toothbrushes.UBS' Arpiné Kocharyan expects the movie's release to have an ""overall halo effect"" on the franchise, with the larger opportunity in consumer products as the film targets an older audience.""This might not move the needle for revenues, but could impact Mattel's earnings, given substantially higher margin of more than 80% on royalty stream,"" Kocharyan added.The live-action movie, which also stars Ryan Gosling as Ken, raked in $155 million in the United States and Canada over the weekend, making it the biggest opening at the box office for 2023, distributor Warner Bros said on Sunday.Still, not everyone seemed convinced.""Although there is plenty of buzz around the film, I don't expect the movie to generate a significant boost to sales for Mattel as the movie isn't geared towards the target market (young children) and is rated PG-13,"" said Zachary Warring, equity analyst at CFRA Research.Carol Osborne, a marketing faculty at University of South Florida's Muma College of Business, said the hype around the ""Barbification of the world"" will soon subside.For the second quarter, Mattel is set to report falling sales and a net loss of 2 cents per share, compared with a profit of 18 cents a year ago, as the company continues to reel from higher costs, slowing consumer spending amid high inflation, and retailers cutting back on inventories.Story continuesBarbie was Mattel's top brand from 2019 to 2022, according to company data. But its gross billings - or the amount invoiced to customers - fell behind Hot Wheels in the first quarter of 2023.The toymaker's shares, which have gained about 19% so far in 2023, were up about 1.4% in premarket trading on Monday. Rival Hasbro's shares have risen 5% this year.Mattel's forward 12-month price-to-earnings multiple (P/E), a common benchmark for valuing stocks, is 16.01, higher than 13.6 for Hasbro.(Reporting by Savyata Mishra in Bengaluru; Editing by Devika Syamnath)]"

Its two main segments include Machine Clothing and Engineered Composites, which continue to yield impressive results, contributing significantly to net sales for the company in 2022.The Engineered Composites segment has demonstrated resilient growth, with double-digit expansion over the past few years.

Reported EPS is $0.33 EPS, expectations were $0.44.Operator: Good morning and welcome to Newmont's Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Palmer, President and Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead.Tom Palmer: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Newmont's second quarter earnings call. Today, I'm joined by my executive leadership team, including our Chief Operating Officer, Rob Atkinson, and we'll all be available to answer your questions at the end of the call. I'd also like to introduce our recently appointed Chief Financial Officer, Karyn Ovelmen. Karyn is a highly experienced financial professional who has held both CFO roles and Board seats in the resource and energy sectors. She brings a breadth of global experience, and we are very pleased that she has joined the Newmont team. Before I begin, please note our cautionary statement and refer to our SEC filings, which can be found on our website.Guided by a clear consistent strategy, our focus is on running a safe and sustainable mining business to generate long-term value. Our business is underpinned by a strong balance sheet and a global portfolio with the size and scale to make decisions that deliver on our strategy. And while I'm not happy with our ultimate financial results for the second quarter, I am very comfortable with the prudent decisions that we made during the quarter to safeguard our workforce, protect long-term value, and position Newmont to deliver strong performance in the second half of this year and beyond. During the second quarter, Newmont produced 1.2 million ounces of gold and 256,000 gold equivalent ounces from copper, silver, lead, and zinc, generating nearly $1 billion in adjusted EBITDA and more than $650 million in cash from our continuing operations.Story continuesThere were four important decisions that we made during the second quarter. First, we decided to suspend operations at Peñasquito to focus on finding an appropriate and sustainable resolution to the current dispute with the Union representing our workforce in Mexico. This dispute is associated with a profit-sharing agreement that we made with the Union leadership only 12 months ago. And in May, we paid our employees their profit-sharing bonus for the 2022 year, calculated in strict accordance with this agreement. The Union leadership are now demanding more than double the agreed amount and have taken strike action through the withdrawal of labor. At Newmont, Peñasquito sits within a strong, balanced global portfolio of operations, a portfolio that is supported by the industry's strongest balance sheet.During this important time for Peñasquito, we will remain firm in our resolve and continue to make decisions that protect the long-term value of the operation and benefit our employees, our contracting partners, our host communities, our customers, and all of our stakeholders. We strongly encourage the Union leadership up to and including Senator Napoleón Gómez to cease this strike action and return their members to work. The second decision we made during the quarter was associated with protecting our workforce at Éléonore from the unprecedented wildfires being experienced this summer in Canada, evacuating the mine and placing the operation on care and maintenance. Third, at Cerro Negro, we made the decision to pause mining for two weeks and complete important safety inspections to ensure that we had the appropriate control environment in place at this remote underground mine and to protect the health and safety of our mining teams working there.And finally, at Akyem, we made the decision to process lower grade stockpiles that were originally planned for the fourth quarter in order to optimize the mine plan, ensuring that we are in a position to safely extract the maximum amount of ore as we complete the current layback in the gen pit over the next few months. As planned, higher gold production is expected in the second half of the year, and will be driven by higher grades and tonnes mined from both Subika Underground and open pit at Ahafo. Higher grades and tonnes mined Cerro Negro is the first wave of our district expansion which comes online in the third quarter. Higher tonnes mined and processed at Tanami, where we will mine the highest grades for the year in the fourth quarter.Higher grade run-of-mine ore processed at Akyem as we return and complete the current layback. And when combined with the higher production that we expect from our two non-managed joint ventures, Nevada Gold Mines and Pueblo Viejo, we remain on track to deliver on our full year guidance. We ended the quarter with $6.2 billion in total liquidity and maintained an investment-grade balance sheet, preserving financial flexibility as we continue through a period of meaningful reinvestment and return a stable dividend to our shareholders. Consistent with our 2023 dividend payout range, we declared a second quarter dividend of $0.40 per share, demonstrating both our ongoing commitment to shareholder returns and our confidence in the long-term strength of our business.We remain on track to close on our acquisition of Newcrest in the fourth quarter and are leveraging the lessons we learned from the successful integration of Goldcorp four years ago as we build out our integration plans. We have also commenced the portfolio optimization work associated with this transaction, making the important decision in June to defer the Yanacocha Sulfides project. This is the first step in delivering significant value through portfolio optimization, and we will continue to evaluate opportunities to resequence project capital and rationalize the portfolio of the combined company over the next couple of years. At Newmont, we recognize that a strong, safety and sustainability culture is not only an indicator of a reliable well-run business.It is fundamental to delivering on our commitments to employees, contracted partners, host communities and all of our stakeholders. As we position ourselves to safely integrate Newcrest and enter this next chapter in Newmont's 102-year history, we made an important decision in the second quarter to further strengthen our commitment to responsible gold leadership and increase our focus on safety and sustainability. In June, we promoted Suzy Retallack for the role of Chief Safety and Sustainability Officer, reporting directly to me. Suzy is an industry leader with more than 20 years of experience in driving value-based decisions. Over the last five years, as our Senior Vice President, Health, Safety and Security, Suzy has been instrumental in leading the delivery of a step change in Newmont's safety performance, in particular, in the area of fatality risk management.Suzy will apply the lessons we have learned from our significant improvement in health, safety and security to further improve our performance in the areas of environment and social responsibility. In this new role, Suzy will also support me and my leadership team in the work we need to do as a company and as an industry to create workplaces that are free from harassment, assault, bullying and discrimination. I'll now turn it over to Rob and then to Karyn to take us through each of our operations and projects, along with a review of our quarterly financial highlights. Over to you, Rob.Rob Atkinson: Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Turning to the next slide, let's begin in Australia. Boddington delivered another strong performance in the second quarter increasing both gold and copper production from sustained grades and improved mill throughput. As part of our multi-decade life of asset strategy for Boddington, we have increased our autonomous haulage fleet with five additional trucks as we increased the planned waste movement in both the North and the South pits. This investment into the next layback at Boddington will support stable gold and copper production for many years to come. We remain clearly on target to hit our 2023 production guidance, and we are well positioned to deliver more than 1 million gold equivalent ounces from this cornerstone asset.Moving to Tanami, the site has recovered extremely well following the record wet weather and extensive flooding experienced in the Northern Territory during the first quarter. We doubled our quarterly gold production in the second quarter and remain firmly on track to land within our full year guidance ranges and will mine the year's highest grades in the fourth quarter. In addition, we continue to progress the second expansion at Tanami with nearly 50% of the concrete lining of our 1.5 kilometer deep shaft installed. The lining and the furnishing of the shaft continue to be on the critical path as our project team works to deliver significant ounce and cost improvements to our Tier 1 operation in Tanami. Moving up to Africa. In June, I visited both the Ahafo South and Akyem as well as our Ahafo North project in Ghana.At Akyem, I spent time with the team as we work through the decision Tom covered earlier to prioritize safety, optimize the mine plan and maximize the ore extracted as we close out the current layback in the coming months. As a consequence of this work, we expect grades to improve by 35% during the third quarter, positioning the site to deliver significantly higher production in the second half of the year and land within our 2023 guidance ranges. At Ahafo South, we delivered higher production as we access the third mining level and additional draw points in the Subika Underground ahead of plan. Fined with access to higher grades from the open pit, the Ahafo mill will process higher grade from both underground and surface in the second half.Ahafo is also on track to commission a replacement conveyor in the third quarter and it remains on target to hit guidance for the year. And finally, it was great to see firsthand the progress we are making on the Ahafo North project. The highway relocation in bulk airports continue to progress very well and with the new mining fleet in place, the project team is preparing to commence pre-stripping in the second half of the year. Moving across to North America. As Tom described, Canada has been impacted by unprecedented wildfires, with Quebec, particularly impacted during the second quarter. And in the second week of June, as the fire front approach the property, we made the swift and proactive decision to evacuate our workforce and place Éléonore on care and maintenance to protect our employees and contractors.During this time, our first priority was, and will always be, the safety and well-being of our workforce and local communities. We're now safely ramping up production activities as the forest fire threat continues to abate. And we will continue to monitor the situation in Quebec very closely as we work with the provincial government agencies to assess fire progress and air quality on a daily basis. Moving to Porcupine, we delivered another steady performance in the second quarter and remain well-positioned to deliver improved production in the second half of the year driven by higher grades from the Hollinger pit in Q3 and from Borden Underground in Q4. We continue to progress the Pamour project and are preparing for a full funds investment decision later this year.We will complete commissioning of a new water treatment plant in the coming weeks, which will accelerate dewatering of the premarket and allow us to commence pre-stripping during the fourth quarter with first ore expected in 2024. At Musselwhite, we delivered consistent gold production as we progress planned development activities that will increase scope availability in the second half of the year, including access to another double lift stope [ph]. As a consequence, we expect tonnes mined to increase by more than 30% and grades to increase by around 15%, supporting a strong third and fourth quarter. And finally, Cripple Creek and Victor delivered solid results due to higher grade and strong recoveries from our heap leach facilities. And now moving down to South America.Yanacocha delivered a strong second quarter as we begin to realize the benefits from applying our injection leaching technology. At Merian, we continued the planned stripping of the next layback in the Merian Pit and the site is on track to deliver 40% higher grade from the Maraba pit in the third quarter, putting Merian on target to hit full year guidance. Moving to Cerro Negro. In the third quarter, tonnes mined is expected to increase nearly 30% as the underground ramps up to full productivity following the safety pause that Tom referred to, and grade is expected to increase by 50% as we begin to access the higher-grade stopes from San Marcos, the first of six new deposits associated with the exciting underground district expansion at Cerro Negro.San Marcos will continue to ramp up throughout the year and is expected to reach commercial production in late 2023. Finally, as Tom discussed, we made the decision to suspend operations at Peñasquito on June 7, as we focus on finding a resolution to the dispute with the union leadership. We have and will continue to abide by the fair and equitable agreement that is currently in place and that was importantly, fully agreed to only a year ago with the union. We will continue to communicate directly with our employees and engage with the union leaders and government officials to find a fair, appropriate and sustainable resolution to this very disappointing dispute. You can expect that we will provide a fulsome update to the market once an agreement has been reached, and we look forward to returning our focus to safe and sustainable mining at Peñasquito.And now I'll wrap up on the next slide with our two non-managed joint ventures. Our share in Nevada Gold Mines and interest in Pueblo Viejo contributed 338,000 ounces of attributable gold production in the second quarter, and we look forward to both joint ventures delivering on their expected strong second half. And with that, I'll pass it over to Karyn to cover our financial results.gold, ore, miningPhoto by Gold-bar-jingming-pan on UnsplashKaryn Ovelmen: Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. I'm happy to be joining the call today and look forward to presenting our second quarter financial results and answering any questions you might have. Before I get started, I wanted to talk briefly about what brought me to Newmont. When I was doing my due diligence on Newmont, I was excited to learn about the company's clear and consistent strategy, leading approach to safety and sustainability, its global diverse portfolio of assets and deep project pipeline to position Newmont for long-term success. Joining in May, I've had the pleasure to meet Newmont's senior leaders and the Board and spend time with my very talented finance team. And I can say that the strength of our people and capabilities have already far surpassed our initial expectations.Over the coming months, my team and I will be focused on building upon the strong foundation that we have today, partnering with the business to improve our overall financial performance and driving our disciplined capital allocation strategy, with a balance sheet that can support our strategic initiatives throughout the commodity cycle. Turning to the next slide. Let's get started with a look at the financial highlights. In the second quarter, Newmont delivered $2.7 billion in revenue at a realized gold price of $1,965 per ounce, adjusted EBITDA of $910 million, cash from operations of $656 million, which includes over $100 million of unfavorable working capital changes. Included in working capital changes were nearly $250 million in tax payments in the second quarter, partially offset by a draw on receivables.We would expect to draw on receivables to reverse in future quarters. The tax payments to decrease in the third and fourth quarter as they have in previous years. In total, we generated $40 million of free cash flow for the quarter, which is net of more than $600 million of capital spend as we continue to progress our most profitable near-term projects and position the portfolio for growth, both in ounces and margins in future years. We maintained a strong cash position with $3.2 billion and an attractive leverage ratio of 0.7 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA. We also maintained solid margins in the second quarter, driven by higher realized gold prices and steady direct costs. Second quarter GAAP net income from continuing operations was $155 million, or $0.19 per diluted share.Adjustments included $0.05 related to unrealized mark-to-market losses on equity investments, $0.03 related to transaction cost associated with our pending acquisition of Newcrest, and $0.06 related to tax adjustments and other items. Taking these into account, we reported second quarter adjusted net income of $0.33 per diluted share. And it is also important to note that this number has not been adjusted for the $46 million in operating costs and depreciation at Peñasquito since the strike commenced and at Éléonore, while the site was proactively shut down due to the wildfires. As Tom and Rob noted, Newmont remains well-positioned to deliver a strong performance in the second half of the year and achieve our full year guidance. Second quarter, we declared a dividend of $0.40 per share or $1.60 per share on an annualized basis, consistent with the last two quarters and calibrated within our 2023 dividend payout range of $1.40 to $1.80 per share.We have now maintained a dividend yield above 3% for 11 consecutive quarters, and this continues to be the highest dividend per share in the gold sector. With that, I'll turn it over to Tom for an update on the time line from today through to the close of our acquisition of Newcrest.Tom Palmer: Thanks, Karyn. Over the last two months since we announced the binding agreement to acquire Newcrest, my team and I have engaged with many of our important stakeholders, including employees, shareholders, local communities and government leaders. These conversations were aimed at listening to and answering questions, whilst also ensuring that the benefits of the transaction and Newmont's strategic rationale were well understood. Over the next couple of months, we will continue to progress the various regulatory approvals ahead of closing the transaction, primarily in Australia and Papua New Guinea. And I'm pleased to advise we've already received clearance from the Canadian government. Earlier this month, I visited Papua New Guinea for the second time, meeting with various government officials including Prime Minister, James Marape; Deputy Prime Minister, John Russo; and Mining Minister, Sir Ano Pala.As we continue this engagement, we remain excited for the opportunity to operate Lihir, and develop the world-class Waihi gold boom project. We are diligently working towards launching a scheme booklet and filing a proxy statement this quarter with shareholder votes expected in October. We then expect to close the transaction in November and begin the important work to safely integrate the Newcrest teams and operations into our portfolio. Then be in a position to provide 2024 guidance for the combined company in February of next year, along with our fourth quarter and 2023 results. With that, I'll thank you for your time today and turn it over to the operator to open the line for questions.See also 13 Best Consulting Stocks to Buy Now and 10 Best Socially Responsible Stocks to Buy.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"
48,05f491ce-83ec-3e65-a601-0da970ef0e73,NEM,2023-07-24,Barclays loves these gold mining stocks — and gives them double-digit upside,TipRanks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/barclays-loves-gold-mining-stocks-140650727.html,1690121210,STORY,"['BARC.L', 'AEM', 'NEM', 'HG=F', 'GC=F', 'SI=F']","[Few things fire up the imagination of wealth better than a gold mine. After all, while money doesn’t grow on trees, we can actually dig it up out of the ground. Our wealth-related metaphors often revolve around gold, with phrases like ‘things as good as gold’ and ‘an asset that’s like a gold mine.’ Indeed, gold stands as the ultimate symbol of riches and prosperity.While owning a gold mine might be a distant dream for many, investing in the stock of a gold mine presents an entirely feasible opportunity. Mining companies form an important segment of the stock market. They will focus on different resources, some seeking gold, some silver, some extracting base metals like copper or zinc. All can generate profits when managed effectively, and investors can find sound choices throughout the mining sector.But we’re talking about gold. Barclays, the London-based banking giant, has released a report focusing on the North American mining sector, and particularly on American gold miners. The firm’s 5-star analyst, Matthew Murphy, notes the headwinds – a slow recovery in China, a downward trend in the Eurozone – but adds that he expects US mining firms to do well, supported by continued demand for gold.“We expect most of our companies to have slightly better results in Q2, even amidst some deterioration of commodity prices. We remain more constructive on gold than copper as economic deceleration continues,” Murphy wrote.At the bottom line, Murphy has several specific recommendations when it comes to gold mining firms. We’ve delved into the TipRanks database to uncover details on two of them, both sporting ‘Buy’ ratings and boasting double-digit upside potential.Newmont Mining (NEM)We’ll start with Newmont Mining, one of the world’s largest producers of gold. The company boasts a $34 billion market cap, and while it also produces silver, copper, lead, and zinc, its main activity is gold mining. Newmont, which is based in the state of Colorado, is active across both North and South America, and also has operations in Australia and the West African nation of Ghana.Story continuesWhile Newmont was the world’s largest gold producing company in 2022, in the most recently reported quarter, 2Q23, it experienced a 17% decrease in gold production compared to the previous year. This decline was primarily caused by the suspension of operations at the Penasquito mine in Mexico due to a workers’ strike. Additionally, the Cerro Negro mine in Argentina and the Akyem mine in Ghana also underperformed, contributing to the weaker-than-expected results.As such, the company missed expectations on both the top-and bottom-line in Q2. Revenue fell by 12.4% year-over-year to $2.68 billion, in turn missing the consensus estimate by $220 million. Adj. EPS of $0.33 came in some distance below the $0.47 forecast.The shares fell by 6% in the subsequent session, amounting to stock’s steepest daily drop since July 2022.Nevertheless, Newmont is actively moving to expand its activities, and to that end, in May of this year, the company entered an agreement to acquire Australia’s Newcrest Mining Limited for about $19.5 billion. Newmont will acquire 100% of Newcrest’s shares and the move will give Newmont control of Newcrest’s portfolio of assets. The transaction is expected to close in Q4 and the combined entity will have the world’s largest concentration of Tier 1 mining operations.Looking ahead, Barclays’ Murphy is impressed by the potential inherent in Newmont, and writes of the company’s prospects, “We forecast NEM’s average production to increase by ~40% for gold to 8.9Mozpa and ~300% for copper to ~390Mlbpa over the next five years, and expect nearly two-thirds of gold production (5Moz) to come from 10 Tier 1 assets (before considering any portfolio rationalization). We expect cash costs and AISC to increase marginally post-deal (~2-3%) to ~$740/oz and ~$1,015/oz, respectively, but to improve with time as NEM’s Full Potential optimization efforts are implemented.”Murphy goes on to rate the shares as Overweight (a Buy), and he sets a $61 price target that implies a one-year gain of 41%. (To watch Murphy’s track record, click here.)Wall Street is generally bullish on Newmont, although some analysts have reservations. The stock has 11 recent analyst reviews, breaking down to 8 Buys, 2 Holds, and 1 Sell, for a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The shares are selling for $43.21 and the $56.84 average price target suggests a 12-month upside potential of 31%. (See NEM stock forecast)Agnico Eagle Mines (AEM)For the second Barclays mining pick we’re looking at, we’ll turn to Toronto-based Agnico Eagle Mines. The firm has been in operation since 1957 and controls a series of mining projects in Canada, Mexico, Finland, and Australia, along with high-quality development projects in the US and Colombia. Agnico produced more than 3.1 million ounces of gold in 2022, at a production cost of $843 per ounce.That production cost is an important metric for investors to consider – especially when set against the trading price of gold, which was near $1,800 per ounce at the end of last year. Gold is currently priced at ~$1,961 per ounce on the commodity markets.Agnico will report Q2 earnings on Wednesday (July 26), but we can look to the Q1 results for a feel for its financials. Production numbers remained strong in the quarter and the company generated 812,813 ounces of gold, with total cash costs per ounce of $832 and an all-in sustaining cost (AISC) of $1,125 per ounce. Based on this, the company realized $1.51 billion in total revenues, beating the forecast by $21.6 million. EPS reached $0.58, also coming in ahead of expectations – by $0.09.The company’s operating cash flow in the quarter came to $1.30 per share, and Agnico declared a 40-cent common share dividend for Q1. Agnico’s current dividend yields 3.2%, and the company has been keeping up regular payments since 1983.Looking ahead, Agnico expects full-year gold production to reach between 3.24 million and 3.44 million ounces, with an AISC between $1,140 and $1,190.In his coverage of this stock, analyst Matt Murphy sees several paths toward continued profitability, mainly from the Canadian mining operations. Murphy says of Agnico, “While we model the current plan for Canadian Malartic and Odyssey as a base case, we have played with nearby lower grade open pittable ore and further away (regional) higher grade underground reserve addition scenarios. Our preliminary estimate is that these scenarios could add some $1-3/sh to our NAV (3-9%), with low-grade open pits actually offering more upside under our current assumptions. We could also see a scenario with mine-life extension at the depth of East Gouldie; however, with a life already extending to 2042 and the exploration expense, that might add less value at present.”Quantifying his stance, Murphy rates the stock as Overweight (Buy), and his price target of $61 suggests the stock will gain 17% in the coming months.This stock has a Strong Buy rating from the analyst consensus, and it’s unanimous, based on 6 positive reviews in recent weeks. The shares have an average price target of $64.63 and a trading price of $52.09, implying an upside of 23% on the one-year horizon.

AMC's preferred shares fell 2.2%.Domino's Pizza shed 3.2% after the world's largest pizza chain missed quarterly revenue estimates, as increased delivery fees and higher prices hurt demand for its pizzas and chicken wings.Exchange operator Nasdaq trimmed the weight of a handful of companies that make up close to half of the Nasdaq 100 to address ""overconcentration"" in the benchmark.Also on tap on Monday, S&amp;P Global is expected to show its flash services sector PMI fell to 54.1 from 54.4 in June, while the closely watched flash manufacturing PMI likely rose to 46.4 in July from 46.3 in the previous month.

You can skip our detailed analysis of companies innovating to create meat alternatives and head straight to 8 Countries With Highest Rates Of Vegetarians. India leads the countries with the highest rates of vegetarians, with nearly 24% of the population following a vegetarian diet, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. Such a high vegetarian percentage stems from cultural beliefs in the country, particularly among Hindus, Jains, and Buddhists, who often espouse non-violence towards animals. Other countries with high vegetarian populations are Mexico, Brazil, and Taiwan. According to an old study conducted by The Economic and Social Research Institute, 1.5 billion people in the world eat no meat, which made up around 18% of the global population at the time this research was published. The World Health Organization recommends taking 400 grams of fruits and veggies daily to maintain good health. However, according to the Centers For Disease Control and Prevention, only 1 in 10 adults get enough vegetables and fruits, owing to the fast food culture and meat-based diets. If we talk about countries that take their vegetable portions seriously, Croatia tops the list of vegetable consumption per capita by country, while Chad eats the least amount of vegetables. These differences hint at certain cultures' efforts to maintain their health standards and the climates they are blessed with. For instance, Croatia is one of the top exporters of vegetables, grains, and fruits because of its agricultural abundance. Given that nearly 20% of the world's freshwater is used in raising livestock and nearly 33% of arable land is used to grow feed for livestock, vegetarianism surely appears as a sustainable food choice. However, as a whopping majority of the world consumes meat and meat-based products, vegetarianism and veganism are still not as popular. According to Statista's Consumer Insights of 2023, 86% of respondents surveyed in 21 countries said that their diet contains meat.Story continuesIf you take particular interest in the world's dietary habits when it comes to meat, we have already covered the Top 20 Countries with the Highest Meat Consumption; go through it to know about the main carnivorous nations.Companies Adding a New Flavor To Vegetarianism Owing to the popularity of vegetarian diets, some big names in the food sector have stepped up to make products more accessible to their customers. For instance, Beyond Meat, Inc. (NASDAQ:BYND) offers plant-based meat products that take animals out of the equation but still taste like meat. Beyond Meat, Inc. (NASDAQ:BYND) helps those new to vegetarianism by satiating their cravings without having them eat meat. In fact, all plant-based proteins that mimic meat are there to make the vegetarian transition easier for those whose major diet portion comprises non-veg items. According to a non-profit, Good Food Institute (GFI), ""Plant-based products lead to better health outcomes in terms of fiber provision, controlling cholesterol, and minimizing animal slaughter. Therefore, the diverse product line of Beyond Meat, Inc. (NASDAQ:BYND), which includes burgers, steaks, and sausages (all made from plant-based meat), is gaining immense popularity. Likewise, Kellogg Company (NYSE:K) owns MorningStar Farms, manufactures vegetarian and vegan products. In recent years, Kellogg Company (NYSE:K) has been moving towards making all its products 100% plant-based. To show commitment towards making vegetarianism practical for all, Kellogg Company (NYSE:K) even introduced the ""Incogmeato"" product line, which closely mimics the taste and texture of real meat.Also, despite being traditionally associated with meat products, Tyson Foods Inc (NYSE:TSN) has introduced a plant-based product line called Raised &amp; Rooted, offering plant-based nuggets, burgers, and more. This Tyson Foods Inc (NYSE:TSN) product line includes plant-based nuggets made from a blend of pea protein isolate and other plant ingredients, as well as blended burgers made from a combination of beef and plants. These vegetarian products were launched as Tyson Foods Inc (NYSE:TSN) 's response to the rising popularity of plant-based diets and represent a significant shift in strategy for a company mostly known for its meat products. If you want to know which vegan stocks are taking flight, read 10 Vegan Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up On to invest right. 20 Countries With Highest Rates Of Vegetarians20 Countries With Highest Rates Of VegetariansOur Methodology We developed our list based on the global ranking of vegetarian populations. Our sources for this study were World Population Review, United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization (UN FAO), World Atlas, World Animal Foundation, and The Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI), among others. Notably, you'll find some nations with the same percentages on our list of countries with the highest rates of vegetarians. In that case, we graded them based on their population sizes to tiebreak them. For example, a 10% vegetarian population in Brazil is significantly higher than the 10% vegetarians in Taiwan, so we will rank the country with the bigger population higher.According to our findings, here are the top countries with the most people eating plant-based diets:20. SingaporeVegetarian Population: 6.9%The influence of Buddhism in Singapore, which advocates non-violence towards animals, has been instrumental in shaping the country's dietary choices. Also, the nation's urbanized landscape limits its agricultural sector; most food, including vegetarian food, is imported. This reality has also led to a growing trend towards plant-based diets because of their lower environmental impact. 19. BelgiumVegetarian Population: 7%Belgium is one of the countries leading in vegetarianism, reflecting a global trend towards plant-based diets. As of 2023, approximately 7% of the country's population is vegetarian. Interestingly, Ghent, a city in Belgium, is renowned for its 'Veggie Thursday' initiative as it promotes vegetarian meals once a week. This city also hosts a high number of vegetarian and vegan-friendly restaurants per capita. Moreover, Belgian policymakers have recognized the need to promote vegetarian diets, as some schools and public institutions offer vegetarian options or even full vegetarian menus.18. CanadaVegetarian Population: 7.2%Canada is also amongst the countries with the highest rates of vegetarians, owing to the population's health-conscious choices. The country's diverse culture is rich in varied dietary traditions and promotes a broad acceptance of plant-based diets. Moreover, Canada's robust agricultural sector is admired for its high-quality grains, pulses, and fruits and vegetables. Such reliable agricultural standards also support the popularity of vegetarian diets. Sustainability goals and public health campaigns have also played a significant role in pushing forward the veg movement.17. PolandVegetarian Population: 8.4%Vegetarianism in Poland has steadily gained traction due to growing health and environmental awareness among Poles. A report from HappyCow, a service that lists vegan and vegetarian eateries globally, ranked Warsaw 9th in terms of vegetarian-friendly cities. Warsaw is a hotspot for plant-based cuisine as it offers close to 70 vegetarian and vegan establishments within a 10km radius. Yong Poles have shown an increasing inclination towards vegetarianism, spurred by ethical considerations. 16. ItalyVegetarian Population: 8.9%Italy is deeply rooted in its rich culinary traditions and has been increasingly embracing vegetarianism. The shift reflects the nation's traditional ""cucina povera"" philosophy, where dishes are based on locally sourced, seasonally available ingredients. The prevalence of plant-centric dishes, like risotto, pasta, and vegetable antipasti, is also linked to Italy's robust agricultural sector, which is rich in vineyards, olive groves, and vegetable farms. 15. NorwayVegetarian Population: 9%Norway's percentage of vegetarians is reported to be 9 as of 2023, as the people are opting for a plant-based lifestyle because of ethical concerns. To cater to this dietary shift, the food industry in Norway has expanded its vegetarian and vegan offerings. While traditional Norwegian cuisine is known for its meat and seafood dishes, it has been reimagined with plant-based alternatives to stamp the country's commitment to sustainability.14. JapanVegetarian Population: 9.1%In Japan, vegetarianism traces its roots in the Buddhist principle of 'Ahimsa' or non-violence, which inspired a meat-free diet. Currently, 9.1% of Japanese people consume a meat-free diet. However, a big percentage of modern Japanese cuisine is predominantly non-vegetarian, owing to Western influences post-World War II and the readily-available fast food choices. Pure vegetarian or vegan options could be challenging to find outside major cities like Tokyo or Kyoto. Misunderstandings about vegetarianism also exist in the country, as fish-based products are often included in 'vegetarian' meals. Nevertheless, there's a growing trend towards plant-based foods in Japan. 13. JamaicaVegetarian Population: 9.8%Vegetarianism in Jamaica is deeply ingrained because of the influence of Rastafarianism, a religion that promotes an ""ital"" lifestyle. The ital beliefs involve the consumption of natural, plant-based foods, often locally sourced, to dent colonial legacy. Also, the prevalence of fresh produce, including fruits, vegetables, and legumes, contributes to a culture where vegetarianism thrives. Moreover, Jamaican dishes often focus on plant-based ingredients like callaloo, ackee, and pigeon peas. A 2017 survey suggested that nearly 10% of the Jamaican population self-identified as vegetarians.12. New ZealandVegetarian Population: 9.9%New Zealand has a substantially-sized livestock industry, but the country has experienced a significant trend towards vegetarianism. As of 2023, 9.9% of the population follows a vegetarian or vegan diet, owing to concerns over animal welfare and recognition of the health benefits of veg foods. Innovative local companies are meeting the growing demand with plant-based meat substitutes and dairy alternatives.11. DenmarkVegetarian Population: 10%Denmark has a meat-centric cuisine, but there's an evident preference for vegetarianism. Culturally, this change can be attributed to the emphasis on health consciousness and environmental sustainability. Also, the country's agricultural sector, primarily its fertile lands, and technologically advanced farming, supports an ample production of plant-based foods. From cosmopolitan cities like Copenhagen, where vegetarian restaurants flourish, to rural areas, vegetarianism is gradually gaining acceptance. 10. GermanyVegetarian Population: 10%Germany ranks 10th amongst countries with the most people eating plant-based diets, as roughly 10% of Germans self-identified as vegetarians. Major cities like Berlin have become renowned for their vegetarian and vegan-friendly eateries to mark Germany's commitment to this lifestyle. Plus, the country's food industry has adapted to the demand by offering plant-based substitutes to meat products and is now contributing to Germany's status as a major force in Europe's vegetarian movement.9. VietnamVegetarian Population: 10.1%Vietnam has a Buddhist heritage, which encourages compassion towards all beings. Consequently, such beliefs lead to vegetables-based dietary preferences, evidenced by 10% of the Vietnamese population adhering to vegetarianism. The cuisine features an abundance of fresh vegetables, tofu, mushrooms, and flavorful herbs that don't let food get boring, even for meat lovers. Cities like Ho Chi Minh and Hanoi host vegetarian restaurants and ""chay"" shops that serve vegetarian and vegan versions of Vietnamese dishes.Click to continue reading 8 Countries With Highest Rates Of Vegetarians.Suggested Articles:Vegetable Consumption per Capita by Country10 Best Organic Food and Farming Stocks To Buy20 Most Profitable Food Businesses in the WorldDisclosure: None. 20 Countries With Highest Rates Of Vegetarians is originally published at Insider Monkey.]"

The innovation complements Mastercard’s virtual card platform as the company provides choice in payments to players across the ecosystem and accelerates the digitization of B2B transactions across buyers and suppliers.In an increasingly digital-first world, more businesses are looking to replace cumbersome paper-based payment processes. Virtual cards are rapidly gaining momentum in B2B payments, with over 90% of suppliers reporting that they prefer receiving a digital payment – and the related invoice information - over checks.1 However this shift towards emerging tech has also left accounts receivable teams struggling to keep pace with increased virtual card payment processing, underscoring the critical need for an automated solution.Mastercard Receivables Manager was developed to make virtual card transactions more efficient, secure and cost-effective to process. Suppliers will no longer need to manually capture and enter virtual card details to reconcile the vast number of digital payments received. Instead, the new product consolidates these card payments from all issuers so the remittance data can automatically be matched to open invoices, and formatted and delivered for their Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems - making it easier for suppliers to reconcile invoices with efficiency and accuracy. This also gives suppliers new advantages, including the ability to drive early payments and improve overall visibility of their cash flow.""This is a significant milestone in our journey to deliver more seamless, digital-first user experiences to the B2B payments ecosystem,"" said Chad Wallace, global head of Commercial Solutions at Mastercard. ""We’re bridging the gap between buyers’ virtual card preferences and suppliers’ acceptance challenges by automating manual processes and transforming the way accounts receivable teams operate.""Story continuesMastercard has partnered with Billtrust, a B2B order-to-cash software and digital payments market leader, to deliver its latest commercial solution.

(NASDAQ:EXPE) by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Expedia Group Is Expedia Group Fairly Valued?We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period.

For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 9.5%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$2.4b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (9.5%– 2.1%) = US$33bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$33b÷ ( 1 + 9.5%)10= US$13bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$28b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$119, the company appears quite good value at a 38% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Expedia Group as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 9.5%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.251. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Expedia GroupStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is not viewed as a risk.WeaknessNo major weaknesses identified for EXPE.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.Trading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%.ThreatRevenue is forecast to grow slower than 20% per year.Next Steps:Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Lockheed Martin What's The Estimated Valuation?We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$6.45bUS$6.45bUS$6.81bUS$7.19bUS$7.43bUS$7.64bUS$7.85bUS$8.05bUS$8.24bUS$8.43bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x11Analyst x10Analyst x3Analyst x2Est @ 3.30%Est @ 2.94%Est @ 2.69%Est @ 2.52%Est @ 2.40%Est @ 2.31% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.2% US$6.0kUS$5.6kUS$5.5kUS$5.4kUS$5.3kUS$5.0kUS$4.8kUS$4.6kUS$4.4kUS$4.2k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$51bWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period.

Do not re-use. Do not re-sterilize. Re-use or reprocessing of a single use device may lead to contamination and compromised device function or structural integrity.Safety and efficacy of PERCLOT have not been clinically evaluated in children (less than 21 years old) and pregnant or lactating women.PERCLOT should be used with caution in the presence of infection or in contaminated areas of the body. If signs of infection or abscess develop where PERCLOT has been applied, re-operation may be necessary in order to allow drainage.Safety and efficacy of PERCLOT in neurological and ophthalmic procedures have not been established.Safety and efficacy of PERCLOT have not been clinically evaluated for use in controlling post-partum bleeding or menorrhagia.Once hemostasis is achieved, excess PERCLOT should be removed from the site of application by irrigation and aspiration particularly when used in the pericardial cavity and around foramina of bone, areas of bony confine, the spinal cord, and/or the optic nerve and chiasm. PERCLOT achieves its maximum swelling within 10 minutes when exposed to blood or other fluids. Dry, white PERCLOT should be removed. The possibility of the product interfering with normal function and/or causing compression of surrounding tissues due to swelling is reduced by removal of excess dry material.The effect of this product on patients with known sensitivity to starch or starch-derived materials has not been studied.The efficacy of PERCLOT in achieving hemostasis in cortical bone and spinal bleeding has not been studied in randomized clinical trials.Blood vessels, suture line gaps, and large needle holes with a diameter of ≥2mm must be ligated prior to PERCLOT application.Do not apply more than 50g of PERCLOT in diabetic patients as it has been calculated that amounts in excess of 50g could affect the glucose load.As with other hemostatic agents, do not apply PERCLOT to sites where there is negative peripheral venous pressure as material may be drawn into the vascular system potentially resulting in life-threatening thromboembolic events.Rx Only. For safe and proper use please refer to full device Instructions for Use for Contraindications, Warnings, and Precautions.Forward-Looking StatementsThis release includes forward-looking statements concerning potential benefits associated with PERCLOT. The statements are based on assumptions about many important factors, including the following, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements: demand for and market acceptance for new and existing products; product development risks; inability to create additional production capacity in a timely manner or the occurrence of other manufacturing or supply difficulties (including as a result of natural disasters, public health crises and epidemics/pandemics, regulatory actions or otherwise); satisfaction of regulatory and other requirements; actions of regulatory bodies and other governmental authorities; product quality, manufacturing or supply, or patient safety issues; changes in law and regulations; and other risks identified in Baxter's most recent filing on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q and other SEC filings, all of which are available on Baxter's website.

68,45a70866-d664-307d-a3ef-fd18da69012e,JNJ,2023-07-24,CEO of J&J spinoff Kenvue says big companies can lose focus: ‘By definition you are little more remote from where the action is’,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ceo-j-j-spinoff-kenvue-052018942.html,1690176018,STORY,"['KVUE', 'JNJ', 'GE']","[Good morning.I spoke Friday with one of the newest members of the Fortune 500 club—Thibaut Mongon, CEO of Kenvue, which spun off from Johnson &amp; Johnson in May. The company generated about $15 billion in sales last year, from popular brands like Tylenol, Listerine, Neutrogena, and Band-Aid, which would have landed it around No. 275 on last year’s 500 list. (Kenvue spun off largely free of the liabilities from lawsuits involving baby powder, which stayed with the mothership.)Mongon called it the “assignment of a lifetime"" to take this portfolio of iconic brands and write the next chapter of consumer health. I asked the 20-year J&amp;J veteran what he could do as an independent company that he couldn’t do at J&amp;J. His answer:“I would say two things. One is this idea of focus. Focusing the organization on one way of winning in our industry, one way to measure our performance, aligning the organization along clear and similar performance indicators—that’s something that is tougher to do in a large corporation, where by definition you are a little more remote from where the action is.“The second is capital allocation. Kenvue has historically generated north of $2 billion of cash flow every year. In the Johnson &amp; Johnson environment, this cash flow was centralized at the corporation level. Now we will be able to make use of this cash flow for the sole benefit of our brands.”That, of course, raises questions about why conglomerates exist in the first place. Last week, I finished reading William Cohan’s book Power Failure about the greatest conglomerate of the last century, General Electric, and how it fell apart in this century. Cohan’s narrative suggests GE in its last two decades was the converse of what Mongon is striving for, suffering from a lack of clear operating goals and some very bad mistakes in capital allocation. Power Failure is a primer in how not to run a large company.Story continuesIn spite of such lessons, however, companies are still more inclined to acquire than to divest, and the corporate deal environment is poised for a 2024 rebound to near record levels. A new survey out this morning of 1,200 global CEOs by EY found that a full 98% of them “expect to actively pursue a strategic transaction in the next 12 months"" (up from 89% in January 2023), with 59% looking to M&amp;A, 47% looking to divest, and 63% looking to enter strategic alliances or joint ventures. Improving technology capabilities—particularly in A.I.—is a leading driver of these transactions, EY says.Other news below. And if you haven’t seen Barbenheimer yet, you are missing out on the summer’s biggest happening.Alan Murray@alansmurrayalan.murray@fortune.comThis story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

I am now pleased to turn the call over to Joaquin.Joaquin Duato: Thank you, Jess, and good morning, everyone. This was a strong quarter for Johnson &amp; Johnson with market leading performance, important advances across our innovative pharmaceutical, our MedTech pipelines and a successful initial public offering of Kenvue. We delivered solid sales and earnings growth for the second quarter of 2023, reporting operational sales of 7.5% and adjusted operational EPS growth of 9.7%. These strong results contributed to our confidence in raising our expectations for this year. You may have seen this morning the announcement that we intend to split off Kenvue shares through an exchange offer as the next step in the separation of Kenvue. Joe will provide additional information later in the call.We're excited about entering a new era for Johnson &amp; Johnson one built around science, innovation and technology and strategically focused on pharmaceutical and MedTech, while maintaining our position as the world's largest, most diversified healthcare products company with 25 platforms over $1 billion in annual sales. And on today's call, I would like to share recent highlights and achievements from across the business that have contributed to our year-to-date results, as well as upcoming catalysts that give me great confidence in our near and long-term future performance. Starting with MedTech, for the second quarter of 2023, we generated 14.7% operational and 9.9% adjusted operational growth, which excludes the impact of the Abiomed acquisition.On a pro forma basis using sales publicly reported by Abiomed prior to our acquisition, MedTech grew 10.2%. These strong results continue to show that our efforts to improve the growth of the MedTech business are working. Q2 highlights in Electrophysiology include the publication of clinical data supporting the safety and effectiveness of QDOT, our newest Ablation Catheter for Atrial Fibrillation. In fact, this study demonstrated a clinical success rate of 86%, as well as achieving shorter procedure and fluoroscopy times than ablation with conventional catheters. I'm also happy to share that this month, we completed enrollment in the third clinical study evaluating our pulsed field ablation solutions. The SmartfiRE study evaluates our dual energy catheter, which enables physicians to instantly switch energy source whether radio frequency or pulsed field based on patient needs.The Abiomed integration continued to deliver against planned milestones and is on track across all areas and regions with no disruption to commercial activities or pipeline progression. Second quarter sales of $331 million, compared to Abiomed's public reported sales in the same period last year as a standalone company reflects approximately 20% growth. We also continue to see strong enrollment in the ongoing pivotal clinical trials, which aim to expand the use of our products into new patient populations. We anticipate that heart recovery will become a significant multiyear growth platform for Johnson &amp; Johnson. In orthopedics, the VELYS robotic assisted solution is poised for further acceleration, having recently received CE and CA Mark international approvals.In Surgery, we are pleased with our progression on Ottava, our next generation soft tissue surgical robotic system, and we look forward to providing an investor update later in the year. In Vision, we recently launched products such as ACUVUE OASYS MAX and TECNIS Eyhance and we are performing very well across both contact lenses and surgical vision. Now turning to pharmaceuticals. In the second quarter of the year, we delivered above market operational growth of 6.2%, excluding the COVID-19 vaccine. Of note, our multiple myeloma portfolio has grown more than 30% year-on-year, which includes the acceleration of our newly launched products CARVYKTI and TECVAYLI. These new launches along with SPRAVATO are performing very well and are expected to be important contributors to achieving our 2025 sales target.We also achieved important regulatory and operational milestones, including multiple readouts from our pipeline. A few things I’m particularly excited by include: first, the receipt of fast track designation from the U.S. FDA for all three prospective indications for Milvexian, our Factor XI oral anticoagulant in partnership with Bristol Myers Squibb, which has the potential to treat a broader set of patients such as those who currently have limited therapeutic options, due to bleeding risk. Second, the recent submission of a supplemental BLA for CARVYKTI to the FDA and European Commission supported by data from the CARTITUDE-4 study, seeking approval for a new earlier indication in treating relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. Third, the presentation of initial TAR-200 data from the SunRISe-1 study in bladder cancer at the American Urological Association meeting.And finally, we announced positive top line results from the Phase 3 PAPILLON study evaluating RYBREVANT in combination with chemotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed lung cancer with Exon 20 Insertion Mutations. This is the first of several ongoing pivotal Phase 3 studies to read out for RYBREVANT based regimens in EGFR mutated lung cancer. In addition, I want to highlight the Phase 2 study data that we presented earlier this month at the World Congress of Dermatology for JNJ-2113, our Novel Oral IL23 Receptor Antagonist Peptide in Psoriasis. The finding suggests that JNJ-2113 has broad potential across the spectrum of IL23 mediated diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease. We are already advancing into Phase 3 in moderate to severe plaque psoriasis and initiating a Phase 2b in ulcerative colitis and will continue to assess additional opportunities.We are very excited about the potential of this asset and believe it represents $1 billion plus commercial opportunity. We also continue to defend the intellectual property associated with our medicines, including STELARA. In fact, we have reached settlements regarding our STELARA IP with both Amgen and Alvotech. We expect Amgen to launch in the U.S. on January 1, 2025 and Alvotech to launch in the U.S. on February 21, 2025. In all, our pharmaceutical business delivered very strong results. Our pipeline is progressing well and we continue to be confident in meeting our 2025 sales target of $57 billion. We are excited to enter the back half of the year from a position of strength, and we have high expectations as we evolve to a two sector Johnson &amp; Johnson with a higher growth profile.I am now pleased to turn the call over to Jess to review our financial results in more detail. Jess?Jessica Moore: Thanks, Joaquin. As a reminder on May 8, 2023, Kenvue, Inc., closed its initial public offering. Johnson &amp; Johnson continues to own 89.6% of total outstanding shares of Kenvue’s common stock and remains the majority shareholder. Therefore, the following financial results continue to include the consumer health business with the 10.4% of consumer health's net earnings no longer attributed to Johnson &amp; Johnson being adjusted for in other income and expense from the date of the IPO through the end of the quarter. Starting with Q2 2023 sales results. Worldwide sales were $25.5 billion for the second quarter of 2023, an increase of 6.3% versus the second quarter of 2022. Operational sales growth, which excludes the effect of translational currency, increased 7.5%, as currency had a negative impact of 1.2 points.In the U.S., sales increased 10.2%. In regions outside the U.S., our reported growth was 2.2%. Operational sales growth outside the U.S. was 4.7% with currency negatively impacting our reported OUS results by 2.5 points. Operational sales in Europe were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 vaccine and loss of exclusivity of ZYTIGA. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth with 6.2% worldwide, 8% in the U.S. and 4.4% outside the U.S. Turning now to earnings. For the quarter, net earnings were $5.1 billion and diluted earnings per share was $1.96 versus diluted earnings per share of $1.80 a year ago. Excluding after tax intangible asset amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $7.4 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.80, representing increases of 6.5% and 8.1%, respectively, compared to the second quarter of 2022.On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 9.7%. I will now comment on business segment sales performance highlights. Unless otherwise stated, percentages quoted represent the operational sales change in comparison to the second quarter of 2022, and therefore, exclude the impact of currency translation. Beginning with the Pharmaceuticals segment. Worldwide Pharmaceutical sales of $13.7 billion increased 3.1%, with growth of 9.2% in the U.S. and a decline of 4% outside the U.S. Operational sales growth increased 3.8% as currency had a negative impact of 0.7 points. Excluding COVID-19 vaccine sales, Worldwide operational sales growth was 6.2% with growth of 9.9% in the U.S. and growth of 1.5% outside the U.S. Sales outside the U.S., excluding the COVID-19 vaccine, were negatively impacted by approximately 500 basis points, due to the loss of exclusivity of ZYTIGA in Europe.Pharmaceutical growth was driven by our key brands and continued uptake in our recently launched products with nine assets delivering double-digit growth. We continue to drive strong sales growth for both DARZALEX and ERLEADA with increases of 23.4% and 26.9%, respectively. STELARA grew 8%, driven by market growth and IBD share gains in the U.S., partially offset by unfavorable patient mix and increased rebates. TREMFYA grew 18.9%, driven by market growth and share gains in the U.S., partially offset by unfavorable patient mix. Growth of 16.5% in pulmonary hypertension was driven by favorable patient mix, share gains in the U.S. and market growth. Turning to newly launched products. We continue to make progress on our launch of CARVYKTI and continue to expand access and reimbursement for SPRAVATO.We are also encouraged by the early success of our launch of TECVAYLI, sales of which are included in other oncology. Total pharmaceutical sales growth was partially offset by the loss of exclusivity in REMICADE and ZYTIGA, along with a decrease in IMBRUVICA sales due to competitive pressures. IMBRUVICA maintains its market leadership position worldwide. I will now turn your attention to the MedTech segment. Worldwide MedTech sales of $7.8 billion increased 12.9% with growth of 14.6% in the U.S. and 11.3% outside of the U.S. Operational sales growth increased 14.7% as currency had a negative impact of 1.8 points. Abiomed contributed 4.8% to operational growth. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, worldwide adjusted operational sales growth was 9.9%.Sales in the second quarter accelerated sequentially from Q1 for all MedTech businesses driven by global procedure growth, recovery in China, continued uptake of recently launched products and commercial execution, partially offsetting growth in the quarter was the impact of volume based procurement in China, as well as supply constraints. The Interventional Solutions franchise delivered operational growth of 56.9%, which includes $331 million related to Abiomed. Electrophysiology is a major contributor to the growth with a double-digit increase of 25.9%. This reflects strong growth in all regions, including Europe, driven by our comprehensive portfolio, including the most recently launched QDOT RS catheter. Orthopedics operational growth of 5.7%, reflects strong procedure recovery, success of recently launched products, such as the enhanced shorter portfolio, as well as global expansion of our digital solutions, such as VELYS Robotic assisted solution.Growth was partially offset by the impact of volume-based procurement in China and continued supply challenges primarily in hips. Operational growth of 8.4% and surgery was driven primarily by procedure recovery and strength of our biosurgery and wound closure portfolios. Growth was partially offset by the impacts of volume-based procurement in China and supply challenges. Global growth of 6.9% in vision was driven by price actions and contact lenses and other, as well as strength of new products, including ACUVUE OASYS 1-Day family of products and contact lenses and TECNIS Eyhance our monofocal intraocular lens and surgical vision. Growth of contact lenses was partially offset by strategic portfolio choices and supply challenges. Although these continue to improve.Moving to the Consumer Health segment. Worldwide Consumer Health sales of $4 billion increased 5.4% with growth of 6% in the U.S. and 5% outside the U.S. Operational sales growth increased 7.7% as currency had a negative impact of 2.3 points. Sales in the second quarter accelerated sequentially from Q1 for all consumer health franchises, primarily driven by strategic price increases and growth in OTC globally, due to strong pain performance, and cold, cough and flu season. Excluding the impact of strategic portfolio decisions and sales of personal care products in Russia, volume across all consumer franchises was relatively flat on strong price actions. For more detailed information, please visit investors.kenvue.com. Now turning to our consolidated statement of earnings for second quarter of 2023, I'd like to highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed compared to the same quarter of last year.Cost of products sold leveraged by 80 basis points, primarily driven by favorable patient mix and lower COVID-19 vaccine supply network related costs in the pharmaceutical business, partially offset by commodity inflation in the consumer and MedTech businesses. Selling, marketing and administrative margins deleveraged 20 basis points, driven by incremental costs to support the standalone consumer health business, partially offset by proactive management of costs. We continue to invest strategically in research and development at competitive levels, investing 15% of sales this quarter. The $3.8 billion invested was a 3.4% increase versus the prior year. The other income and expense line was income of $60 million in the second quarter of 2023, compared to an expense of $273 million in the second quarter of 2022.This was primarily driven by favorable litigation settlements, lower litigation expense, and lower unrealized losses on securities, partially offset by higher COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing exit related cost. And as previously mentioned, the 10.4% of consumer health earnings that are no longer attributable to Johnson &amp; Johnson, which resulted in a $37 million reduction in consolidated earnings. Regarding taxes in the quarter, our effective tax rate was 23.9% versus 17.6% in the same period last year. This increase was primarily driven by 2023 tax cost incurred as part of the planned separation of the consumer health business, due to the internal reorganization of certain international subsidiaries. Excluding special items the effective tax rate was 16.6% versus 15.4% in the same period last year.I encourage you to review our upcoming second quarter 10-Q filing for additional details on specific tax matters. Lastly, I'll direct your attention to the box section of the slide, where we have also provided our income before tax, net earnings and earnings per share adjusted to exclude the impact of intangible amortization expense and special items. Now let's look at adjusted income before tax by segment. In the second quarter of 2023, our adjusted income before tax for the enterprise as a percentage of sales increased from 34% to 34.6%, primarily driven by favorable product and patient mix, partially offset by unfavorable segment mix and commodity inflation. Pharmaceutical margins improved from 42% to 42.7%, primarily driven by favorable patient mix, sales, marketing and administrative expense leverage, and R&amp;D portfolio prioritization, partially offset by higher milestone payments.MedTech margins improved from 26.5% to 28.6%, driven by favorable intellectual property related litigation settlements and cost management initiatives, partially offset by commodity inflation. Finally, consumer health margins declined from 25.9% to 23.5%, due to incremental costs to support the standalone consumer health business, foreign exchange impacts, and commodity inflation, partially offset by supply chain efficiencies. It is important to highlight that the adjusted income before tax for the consumer health business as reported by Johnson &amp; Johnson defers from the financial results reported by Kenvue Inc. this morning. The difference is primarily driven by incremental costs required to run Kenvue as an independent company. Additional differences also exist on an after tax basis, due to the application of different tax rates.This concludes the sales and earnings portion of the Johnson &amp; Johnson second quarter results. I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Joe Wolk. Joe?Pharmacy, Medicines, HealthPhoto by Myriam Zilles on UnsplashJoe Wolk: Thank you, Jessica, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. As previously shared, we reported particularly strong results across all segments for the second quarter and the first-half of 2023. During the second quarter, adjusted operational sales growth by pharmaceuticals excluding COVID-19 revenue accelerated 6.2% over the first quarter of 2023. Similarly, on a sequential basis, MedTech operational sales increased to 4.5% over an already strong first quarter. During the first-half of the year we executed against our long-term business strategy and achieved key clinical and regulatory milestones. These advancements provide a strong foundation for long-term growth and are a testament to the hard work and dedication of our talented colleagues around the world.We also made considerable progress toward the separation of Kenvue. On May 8th, as partial consideration for the transfer of the Consumer Health business, Kenvue paid $13.2 billion to Johnson &amp; Johnson from the net proceeds of the initial public offering and debt financing transactions in connection with the separation. Today, we were pleased to announce an update on our next step toward the separation of Kenvue, subject to market conditions, our intention is to split off Kenvue shares through an exchange offer as our next step in the separation. As part of the proposed exchange offer, Johnson &amp; Johnson's shareholders will have the choice to exchange all some or none of their shares of Johnson &amp; Johnson common stock for shares of Kenvue common stock subject to the terms of an offer.We believe a split off is the most advantageous form of separation for Johnson &amp; Johnson, Kenvue and our shareholders, specifically an exchange offer provides Johnson &amp; Johnson the potential opportunity to acquire a large number of outstanding shares of Johnson &amp; Johnson common stock at one time in a tax free manner for U.S. federal income tax purposes without reducing overall cash or future financial flexibility. Further, following the completion of the exchange offer, Kenvue would most likely have a shareholder base that would have made the election to own its shares. The exact timing of our decision to launch an exchange offer will, as stated earlier, depend on market conditions, but the launch of the tender could occur as early as the coming days.Offer terms for the exchange inclusive of applicable discounts, as well as the duration of the exchange tender period would be set upon launch. We understand that you may have questions on this process. At this point, there are no additional details about the contemplated split off to share, but we are committed to providing timely updates as appropriate. Let's now turn to cash and capital allocation. We ended the second quarter with approximately $29 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $46 billion of debt for a net debt position of $17 billion, inclusive of approximately $7 billion of 10 Kenvue net debt. Free cash flow through the second quarter was approximately $5.4 billion, compared to $8.1 billion in the prior year.The second quarter reflects elevated tax payments of approximately $2 billion related to TCJA and past audit related matters. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged with continued investment in our business being the highest priority to drive new and better solutions for patients, followed by dividends, increasing on an annual basis, adding strategic opportunities for inorganic growth, and share repurchases when attractive. Our R&amp;D investment in the first-half of 2023 was $7.4 billion or approximately 15% of sales. This includes external investments such as our recently announced partnership with Cellular Biomedicine Group on two next generation CAR-Ts for the treatment of B-cell malignancies further broadening our cell therapy portfolio.In April, we announced our 61st consecutive year of dividend increases and in combination with the completion of our $5 billion share repurchase program authorized by the Board in September of 2022, and completed earlier this year, we returned $8.5 billion to shareholders in the first-half of 2023. Let's discuss our outlook for the balance of 2023. Before I get into the specifics of guidance, in light of the potential Kenvue split off transaction I will remind you that our updated full-year guidance today continues to include results from the Consumer Health Business given Johnson &amp; Johnson remains the majority shareholder of Kenvue. I suspect you already know this, but it would not be accurate to subtract any guidance provided separately by Kenvue from total Johnson &amp; Johnson guidance and assume that the resulting total reflects guidance for the new Johnson &amp; Johnson.When Johnson &amp; Johnson is no longer the majority shareholder of Kenvue, we will provide timely updated new Johnson &amp; Johnson guidance that will reflect among other things the removal of Consumer Health's current contribution to Johnson &amp; Johnson's performance, as well as any updates to Johnson &amp; Johnson's outstanding share count. So with that context, moving on to our full-year guidance. Based on the strong results delivered in the quarter, like we did in April, we are again raising full-year operational sales and EPS guidance, despite some strategic items not accretive to EPS as detailed on this schedule. Specifically the lost income related to the approximate 10% non-controlling interest in Kenvue and the acquired in process research and development cost related to our investment in Cellular Biomedicine Group.We now expect operational sales growth for the full-year 2023 to be in the range of 7% to 8% or up $1.4 billion in the range of $99.3 billion to $100.3 billion on a constant currency basis and adjusted operational sales growth in the range of 6% to 7%. As you know, we don't speculate on future currency movements. Last quarter, we noted that we utilized the Euro spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar at $1.10. The Euro spot rate as of mid-last week remains at $1.10. However, the U.S. dollar has strengthened versus other select currencies such as the Won and the Yen. As such, we now estimate a negative impact of foreign currency translation of approximately 500 basis points resulting in estimated reported sales growth between 6.5% to 7.5%, compared to 2022 with a midpoint of $99.3 billion.Regarding other lines on the P&amp;L, we now anticipate a slight improvement to our adjusted pretax operating margin driven by expense management. We have reduced our other income estimate to be in the range of $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion, primarily related to the company’s 10.4% non-controlling interest in Kenvue. Regarding interest income and expense, we now anticipate a reduction of net interest expense to the range of a $150 million to $250 million, due to interest income on the net proceeds linked to the Kenvue separation. And finally, based on current tax law, we are maintaining our effective tax rate estimate in the range of 15.5% to 16.5%. These changes result in us increasing our adjusted operational earnings per share guidance by $0.10 per share to a range of $10.60 to $10.70 or $10.65 at the midpoint on a constant currency basis.Constant currency growth of 5% at the midpoint. While not predicting the impact of currency movements, assuming recent exchange rates I previously referenced our reported adjusted earnings per share for the year assumes no additional foreign exchange impact. As such, our reported adjusted earnings per share for the year increases by $0.10 per share to a range of $10.70 to $10.80 or $10.75 at the midpoint, reflecting growth of 6% at the midpoint. While we do not provide guidance by segment or on a quarterly basis, let me offer some qualitative considerations to support your modeling. In MedTech, we continue to anticipate stable procedure volumes and healthcare staffing levels in the back half of the year with normal seasonality. We expect continued competitive performance attributable to commercial execution recently launched products and improvement in supply.Headwinds from volume based procurement in China, as well as potential impacts from international sanctions in Russia are expected to be higher in the second-half than the first-half of the year. In Pharmaceuticals, we continue to expect to deliver our 12th consecutive year of above market growth in 2023, driven by key assets and continued uptake of our newly launched products. We expect continued strong growth in the back half of the year slightly higher than the first-half. When modeling consumer health growth rates in 2023, it's important to take into consideration prior year comparisons with lapping price increases in the back half of the year. Given the strong momentum in our pharmaceutical business and the upcoming clinical milestones mentioned earlier we remain very confident in our ability to meet our 2025 pharmaceutical sales target of $57 billion.Looking ahead, we have many important catalysts for the remainder of the year that can drive meaningful near and long-term value. Beyond the separation, in the near-term, we are continuing to drive performance in MedTech with better commercial execution and recently launched innovative products being a significant factor in driving the continued higher growth trajectory across the MedTech business. Many of the solutions mentioned are early in their commercialization, which means there are still significant opportunity ahead. For example, in electrophysiology we are excited to begin the commercialization of the QDOT MICRO Catheter in the U.S. during the second-half of this year. In Orthopaedics, the VELYS robotic assisted solution, recently received regulatory approvals in Europe, and we plan to launch it in key European countries by the end of this year.And in Vision, we are seeing the benefits of our recently launched innovations such as ACUVUE OASYS 1-Day multifocal, which is driving Johnson &amp; Johnson's market share growth in the large and growing presbyopia market. We look forward to continued growth from this and other recent Vision launches. Related to our pharmaceutical business, we are excited about upcoming advancements in our pipeline with a number of important regulatory and clinical milestones for our key future assets, including on the regulatory front there is expected approval of [daratumumab] (ph) in relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. Clinically, we expect a Phase 3 data for TREMFYA for Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. The results of the MARIPOSA study of RYBREVANT plus lazertinib in front line non-small cell lung cancer with the opportunity to potentially present that data at an upcoming major medical meeting.Phase 1 data for TAR-210 in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, and Phase 2 data for Nipocalimab in rheumatoid arthritis. A couple of other items to highlight. In case you missed them, we recently published our Health For Humanity report our U.S. Pharmaceutical pricing transparency report and our U.S. patent table, all of which can be found on our website. Also, a reminder that we will be hosting an enterprise business review featuring both Pharmaceutical and MedTech at the New York Stock Exchange on December 5th. I'll conclude my prepared remarks by reiterating that we have had a strong first-half of the year both financially and operationally and we expect to continue to build upon that momentum in the second-half of this year. With that, I will now turn the call over to Erik Haas.Erik Haas: Thank you, Joe. On Tuesday, July 18th in the case of Valadez v Johnson &amp; Johnson, a jury in Alameda County, California ruled in favor of the plaintiff on this talc product liability claims. We intend to pursue an appeal based on the erroneous rulings by the trial judge that prevented us from sharing with the jury critical facts that demonstrate that plaintiff's exceedingly rare form of mesothelioma was not caused by baby powder. Without the benefit of that evidence, the jury rendered a verdict that is irreconcilable with a decades of independent scientific evaluations confirming Johnson's baby powder is safe, does not contain asbestos and does not cause cancer. The research, clinical evidence in over 40-years of studies by independent medical experts around the world continue to support the safety of our cosmetic talc.The verdict award will not be paid, while the bankruptcy proceeding continues, and this decision has absolutely no impact on that process, which has the support of lawyers representing the majority of claimants. We remain focused on all claimants having the opportunity to vote and decide for themselves on a -- our plan to compensate them in a timely and efficient manner. Looking ahead with respect to the bankruptcy re-filing by LTL, the bankruptcy judge is expected to rule by August 2nd the motion to dismiss hearing that took place in the last week of June. In addition, a hearing on the motion for LTL's proposed, reorganization plan and voting procedures process, and the path forward is scheduled for August 22nd. As we previously stated, Johnson &amp; Johnson stands by its physician that is talcum powder products are safe as confirmed through decades of numerous independent scientific tests and studies.I would now like to hand the call back over to Jess.Jessica Moore: Thanks, Erik. This concludes the prepared remarks section of our call. I will now turn the discussion over to the Q&amp;A portion of the call.

Basically, the central bank may start to get serious about inflation.While the disinflationary trend is positive, there’s some work to be done. First, the unemployment rate declined slightly. Second, the average length of the work week increased. Third, wage growth remained stable and relatively robust on a month-to-month basis. At scale, these factors imply that more dollars are chasing after fewer goods, which of course is inflationary. Therefore, it may be time to consider defense stocks amid market stability concerns.Sure, the market may be hot right now. However, the Fed will want to cool it to meaningfully tame inflation. Thus, the below boring stocks may be a better approach to investing in uncertainty.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsRepublic Services (RSG)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar bills. Bank stocksSource: shutterstock.com/CC7Almost a no-brainer for boring stocks to buy based on the possible upcoming labor market impact, Republic Services (NYSE:RSG) specializes in recycling services and non-hazardous solid waste disposal. What I appreciate about Republic is that it offers a permanently relevant business. No matter what happens in the economy, people will produce trash. With limited land resources, the industry will almost surely rise in demand long term.Fundamentally, Republic also benefits from a massive moat. Just try and get a permit for a landfill and see how quickly you get rejected. It’s just not happening. And in recent years, developing nations that previously stored North American trash is simply saying no mas. Cynically, such a framework will likely only bolster the waste management industry, making RSG one of the top defensive stocks to consider.Story continuesTo be fair, with RSG trading at a forward earnings multiple of nearly 29 times, you’re not going to get a discount. However, Republic benefits from strong revenue growth and consistent profitability. For investing in uncertainty, RSG makes for a great case.Kelly Services (KELYA)Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words ""buy"" and ""sell"" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image. Best Speculative StocksSource: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.comArguably one of the best boring stocks for the upcoming labor market impact, Kelly Services (NASDAQ:KELYA) at first seems irrelevant. As an employment staffing agency, Kelly inherently offers jobseekers utilitarian value. However, in a tight labor market where labor market growth remains robust, job applicants don’t need middlemen entities. Instead, they can directly apply to positions given the plentiful opportunities available.However, if the Fed imposes an aggressively hawkish monetary policy, said action may affect market stability. Perhaps most noticeably, the labor arena may experience a slackening, where job seekers are many but opportunities are few. In such a scenario, desperation will almost surely rise. And desperation cynically helps Kelly Services.Also, it’s worth noting that Kelly doesn’t just specialize in specific fields, such as accounting and finance. Rather, it runs the whole gamut from white-collar specialties to warehousing/factory jobs. Plus, in a slack labor market, beggars can’t be choosers. Therefore, the shifting power pendulum makes KELYA a strong idea for defensive stocks to buy.Dollar Tree (DLTR)a green button on a keyboard has an arrow pointing upward with the word ""Buy"". representing safe stocks to buySource: AdityaB. Photography/ShutterStock.comIf the central bank takes the gloves off in its fight against inflation, then discount retailer Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR) will make a compelling case for boring stocks to buy against a possible labor market impact. Should borrowing costs rise, that will likely negatively affect companies’ expansionary efforts. Layoffs would materialize, thus incentivizing DLTR.Now, what makes DLTR stand out regarding investing in uncertainty is an activist investor-supported turnaround effort. According to The Detroit News, the overhaul depends on improving supply chain capabilities, modernizing technology systems, and lifting wages. Plus, Dollar Tree CEO Rick Dreiling mentioned that the physical stores need to be upgraded.“Our decor right now in both banners is right out of 1975,” Dreiling told analysts at an investor day last month. I couldn’t agree more.Priced at a forward multiple of 24.2X, DLTR isn’t cheap, I must say. However, because of its strong revenue growth and consistent profitability, DLTR is a buy. That’s especially the case because mass layoffs will see consumers shop for discounts.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

71,7fc700b0-55ba-38d0-8bc4-ac0512602e02,MRK,2023-07-24,11 Best Healthcare Stocks Under $50,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/11-best-healthcare-stocks-under-154424631.html,1690127064,STORY,"['GSK', 'WBA', 'VCEL', 'NVST', 'EXEL', 'XENE', 'PFE', 'MRK']","[In this article, we will be taking a look at the 11 best healthcare stocks under $50. To skip our detailed analysis of the healthcare sector, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Healthcare Stocks Under $50.After the COVID-19 pandemic, many investors believed that the shining moment being enjoyed by healthcare and vaccine stocks was finally about to blow over. However, this way of thinking may have been premature. On July 21, the S&amp;P 500 healthcare sector was up by 18.95 points, representing an increase of 1.21%. The sector has been hanging on as the market continues to shift and transform in light of several developments, most notably the influence of artificial intelligence and big tech companies. Considering the popularity of these latter categories of stocks, it will come as a pleasant surprise for healthcare investors that, at this point, financial professionals are considering healthcare to be a sector that is creating more opportunities for the technology industry and those investing in it as well.""Too Compelling To Ignore""This trend was noted by Jamie Cox, the managing partner at Harris Financial Group, in a CNBC interview on July 21. In the words of Cox, the healthcare sector, which is viewed as a sector operating just adjacent to the tech sector today, is ""too compelling to ignore"" at this moment, signaling that those who want to cash in on the booming tech trade this year can take an alternative route through the healthcare sector to achieve their goals. Here are some comments Cox made on CNBC on this matter:""It's all about healthcare, Dom. I mean, you know, tech and healthcare, the intersection of those two sectors cannot be ignored. There's so much innovation, so much R&amp;D that happened during the pandemic and we're just starting to see some of the pieces of it come to the marketplace. One particular area, medical devices - I mean you have people voluntarily wearing continuous glucose monitors. So companies like Insulet or Dexcom, these are companies that are absolutely knocking it out of the park. People are paying really close attention to healthcare and that is brought about by technology.""Story continuesConsidering these comments, investors can expect to see an increasing interplay between technology companies and healthcare companies in 2023, especially as tech companies themselves begin rapid innovative processes through artificial intelligence. On whether there is an investing angle in healthcare from the tech and artificial intelligence viewpoint, Cox said the following:""It's already happening. I mean, Meta has created algorithms to predict protein folding. The President actually referenced cancer research, and Meta is already sort of doing it. Protein folding will predict different strains of proteins and how they will react and create cancers in the body, and if you can predict the way a protein will fold then you can create drugs or target therapies to be able to treat it. So this is already here, and basically, we're gonna be seeing the benefits of it, or investible benefits of it in the years to come. But it's not gonna necessarily accrue to a healthcare company or a drug company like Pfizer. It can also accrue to a company like Meta. That's what I'm saying, the intersection of healthcare and technology is here to stay.""Medical Devices For The WinFor Cox, the place to be in the healthcare investing space is the medical devices area. He believes that this area will see the ""most benefit"" in light of the growing collaboration between healthcare and technology services. He pinpointed companies focusing on diabetes and cardiac care as the ones to keep an eye on as the situation further develops since these areas will become the best investment opportunities in the healthcare space in the near future, according to Cox.Considering viewpoints such as those presented by Cox this July, healthcare companies such as Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), and Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA), among others, can expect to reap the benefits of the tech rally and the AI boom just as much as other players in the market. Considering this interplay of the two sectors, we have compiled a list of the best healthcare stocks to buy under $50 for investors looking to buy into this promising industry today. Considering current developments, these stocks may very well be some of the best long-term healthcare stocks to stick by. Also, considering the fact that they are some of the best cheap healthcare stocks on the market today, they may serve as attractive investment options for healthcare investors in 2023.11 Best Healthcare Stocks Under $50Our MethodologyWe used a stock screen to find healthcare stocks under $50 and then selected the most popular stocks using Insider Monkey's hedge fund data for the first quarter.

While the latest jobs report came in below economists’ expectations, the unemployment rate declined while wage growth month-to-month stabilized at a robust pace. Plus, with the average work week increasing, the Federal Reserve impact may cynically benefit defensive stocks.As I discussed in my interview with CGTN America anchor Phillip Yin, the central bank is on the right track but it needs to rein in a culture of big government accommodation. That’s going to be painful and it could lead to a recession. Therefore, you may be better off following stock market trends with these safe and boring ideas.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsColgate (CL)man's hand holding wads of cash. stocks to buy. Stocks With 1000% UpsideSource: Vova Shevchuk / Shutterstock.comFundamentally, the narrative for Colgate (NYSE:CL) representing one of the safe stocks for investing during disinflation centers on everyday demand. Almost certainly, people will brush their teeth every day, irrespective of market conditions. Not only that, Colgate’s oral health products help consumers conduct do-it-yourself healthcare.Now, let me be 100% clear: I’m in no way making any kind of advice, neither dental nor financial nor anything really. However, The Washington Post mentioned that many folks struggled with returning to the dentist’s office following the Covid-19 quarantines. Should an economic crisis hit, it’s not unreasonable to assume households will stock up on Colgate products and save money on their dental trips.Financially, Colgate isn’t particularly remarkable. But based on the upcoming Federal Reserve impact, investors should take confidence in the company’s consistent profitability. Also, as investment data aggregator Gurufocus points out, Colgate’s trailing year net margin clocks in at 8.71%, better than 77.72% of its peers.Story continuesCostco (COST)Man holding stacks of money. Unknown Millionaire-Maker cryptosSource: Epic Cure / ShutterstockOrdinarily, Costco (NASDAQ:COST) makes a strong fundamental case for rising inflation. After all, the membership-only big-box retailer incentivizes bulk purchases. However, I believe it also makes a strong case for stock market trends associated with disinflation or even outright deflation. How so? Well, the company is simply much more resilient (based on its core user base) than other retailers.I don’t want to get into all the consumer demographic details between Costco and its competitors. But just do the research yourself, starting with this Business Insider article. The same resource also conducts research on Costco’s rivals. And you can easily come away with the reality that Costco shoppers are younger, wealthier, and probably more educated.Again, I’m not trying to stir up big-box rivalries ala Yankees versus Red Sox. However, when faced with selecting defensive stocks that are more appropriate for investing during disinflation, you’re going to want to align with the more resilient ideas.Merck (MRK)A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.Source: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.comAs a pharmaceutical giant, Merck (NYSE:MRK) makes an excellent case for safe stocks to buy for investing during disinflation. When it comes to healthcare, the sector offers a robust defensive framework because of critical needs. Should you face medical-related problems, you’re going to get professional help, recession, or no recession.Also, Merck’s Keytruda – a humanized antibody used in cancer immunotherapy – represents not only the company’s top product but also one of the best-selling drugs in the world, according to Statista. Keytruda generated nearly $21 billion in sales last year. Based on data from McKinsey &amp; Company, global oncology therapeutics sales are forecasted to hit $250 billion by 2024. Thus, MRK enjoys a massive total addressable market.Financially, the company unsurprisingly benefits from consistently robust long-term revenue and EBITDA growth. As well, it benefits from consistent profitability year in, and year out. Its net margin stands at 22.52%, above 91.22% of the competition. Thus, it’s a great idea for defensive stocks amid the tides of disinflation.Progressive (PGR)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar bills. Bank stocksSource: shutterstock.com/CC7There are safe stocks and then there is Progressive (NYSE:PGR). From an outright financial perspective, I wouldn’t necessarily classify PGR as “safe.” Without context, some might argue Progressive is rather risky, particularly with its less-robust balance sheet. Also, let’s face the harsh reality of the company’s soft second-quarter earnings report. On the day of the disclosure, shares fell more than 13%. Ouch.Notably, Progressive stated that “…it experienced unfavorable prior accident years reserve development of $137.8 million tied mostly to increases from actuarial reserve reviews in its personal auto products.” In the short term, PGR seems rough. However, against a longer-term framework, the company benefits from a captive audience.Most states in the U.S. require auto insurance. And among the very few that let the issue slide, it’s just stupid not to have coverage. However, you may have noticed that folks have become nuts since the pandemic. Based on real reporting, it’s not just your anecdotal observations: roadways are becoming more dangerous. Thus, Progressive just makes a lot of sense ahead of the possible Federal Reserve impact.Waste Management (WM)tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comOne of the “cheat codes” in the market, if you’re facing any kind of market ambiguity but want to stay in the equities space, go with Waste Management (NYSE:WM). Let’s just start with its massive, unparalleled moat. As a provider of the namesake service, only a few enterprises have the capability of offering it. Go ahead and try to get a permit for a landfill and see how far you get.Just as critically, Waste Management benefits simultaneously from a natural monopoly and a captive audience. First, enterprises just can’t wake up one day and compete with WM. Second, no matter how advanced we become as a society, we will always produce rubbish. Indeed, it’s quite possible that because of innovations such as e-commerce, folks collectively are producing more trash.Of course, that trash has to go somewhere. It’s a dirty job but because of it, it’s also essentially recession-proof. Sure, with a forward earnings premium of nearly 28 times, I’m not going to say WM is cheap. However, with its robust sales growth and consistent profitability, it’s one of the top defensive stocks to buy.ABM Industries (ABM)Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words ""buy"" and ""sell"" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image. Best Speculative StocksSource: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.comBilled as a facility management provider, ABM Industries (NYSE:ABM) originally was founded in 1909 as a single-person window-washing business. Today, the company offers various solutions, including facilities engineering, parking, and transportation, electrical and janitorial services, among many others. Of course, one of the main challenges for ABM being one of the safe stocks to buy centers on the work-from-home narrative.With remote operations becoming so popular, commercial real estate faces a reckoning, imposing a cloud over ABM. However, investors should consider two factors. First, the issue of time theft has become a major conflict source for employers. Second, the disinflationary ambiance of the potential Federal Reserve impact swings the power pendulum back to hiring companies. In my view, working from home will soon come to an end.If so, such a circumstance would make ABM a viable idea regarding upcoming stock market trends. On a more objective note, ABM trades at a forward multiple of 11.1x. This contrasts with the sector median of 15x.DTE Energy (DTE)A businessman ripping his shirt off to reveal an upward green arrow with the word buy on it underneathSource: ImageFlow/Shutterstock.comBased in Detroit, Michigan, DTE Energy (NYSE:DTE) is a diversified energy company involved in the development and management of energy-related businesses and services nationwide. Per its corporate profile, DTE’s operating units include an electric company serving 2.2 million customers in Southeast Michigan and a natural gas company serving 1.3 million customers in Michigan.Fundamentally, DTE represents one of the safe stocks to buy ahead of possible disinflation because utilities carry natural monopolies. Because of the steep barrier to entry, would-be competitors don’t even try. As well, DTE also benefits from a captive audience. Again, even if a recession materializes, people have to do whatever it takes to pay their utility bills. Not doing so is basically like giving up.Financially, investors must exercise patience with DTE as utilities don’t exactly print the most sterling financial metrics. For example, DTE’s balance sheet stability could use some work. However, the company prints a strong revenue growth rate. And as you might expect, the utility is consistently profitable.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

With the Federal Reserve mulling a possible interest rate hike, market participants should really prep for investing in downturn cycles.Yes, it’s true that the June jobs report came in lower than economists anticipated. However, a few indicators suggested that the Fed may have some work cut out for it. Notably, the unemployment rate declined while the length of the average work week increased. Also, wage growth stabilized and remained robust on a month-to-month basis. Taken together, these factors are inflationary. Based on the Fed’s actions, value investing might make more sense.Essentially, high-growth enterprises may be too overheated. As discussed in my interview with CGTN America anchor Phillip Yin, the risk of pain exists as the central bank pulls back on the culture of accommodation. Therefore, it just might make more sense to consider bounce-back stocks rather than already-hyped enterprises.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsMosaic (MOS)a green button on a keyboard has an arrow pointing upward with the word ""Buy"". representing safe stocks to buySource: AdityaB. Photography/ShutterStock.comOne of the world’s leading producers and marketers of concentrated phosphate and potash crop nutrients, Mosaic (NYSE:MOS) in arguably most other circumstances makes a great case for investing in downturn cycles. However, some questions have risen about its value investing proposition, particularly because of ongoing geopolitical flashpoints. Still, the criticality of the underlying business should be enough for intrepid investors to take a shot.Currently, the market prices MOS with a trailing earnings multiple of 4.43, which ranks better than 91.89% of its peers. Also, MOS trades at a forward multiple of 7.72X. In contrast, the underlying projected earnings multiple for the underlying agriculture industry stands at 10.31X. Thus, Mosaic makes a compelling argument for undervalued stocks when combined with the relevant fundamentals.Story continuesAlso, Mosaic prints a three-year revenue growth rate (per share basis) of 32.3%, above 80.28% of its peers. And it features a trailing-year net margin of over 15%, making it a top player among prospective bounce-back stocks.HF Sinclair (DINO)A businessman ripping his shirt off to reveal an upward green arrow with the word buy on it underneathSource: ImageFlow/Shutterstock.comHeadquartered in Dallas, Texas, HF Sinclair (NYSE:DINO) is an independent petroleum refiner and marketer that produces high-value light products such as gasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuel, and other specialty products. On the surface, DINO might seem like one of the undervalued stocks for good reason. In part because of the Fed’s hawkish monetary policy, the hydrocarbon sector has been under pressure.Another factor that raises skepticism over DINO as one of the prospective ideas for value investing centers on the work-from-home narrative. With millions of white-collar workers still operating remotely, this dynamic may impose headwinds on traffic volumes. However, should the Fed hike rates, the hydrocarbon energy sector may counterintuitively rise based on a sector-specific stock market recovery.Basically, higher borrowing costs would incentivize cost-cutting measures (read layoffs). As a result, the power pendulum would swing decisively toward employers. And that might be when work from home ends, ushering the return of the morning (and evening) commute. Thus, DINO represents one of the possible bounce-back stocks.FutureFuel (FF)tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comBased in Clayton, Missouri, FutureFuel (NYSE:FF) is a leading manufacturer of diversified chemical products and biofuels. Per its public profile, FutureFuel’s chemicals segment manufactures specialty chemicals for specific customers (‘custom chemicals’) as well as multi-customer specialty chemicals (‘performance chemicals’). Since the start of the year, FF gained a bit more than 7%, a relatively modest performance. However, that also raises the specter of FF’s candidacy as one of the undervalued stocks.Fundamentally, FutureFuel’s business is incredibly relevant because of the need for not only energy but diversified energy sources. That’s probably one major factor contributing to FF shares gaining over 37% in the trailing one-year period.On a financial note, FF trades at a trailing multiple of 8.36X. However, the underlying sector median stands at 19.71X.  Notably, FutureFuel’s three-year revenue growth rate clocks in at 24.5%, above 83% of its peers. However, shares are still priced at 0.95X trailing sales. Thus, it’s one of the undervalued stocks to consider for forward-looking investors.Northwest Pipe (NWPX)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar bills. Bank stocksSource: shutterstock.com/CC7Founded in 1966, Northwest Pipe (NASDAQ:NWPX) is a leading manufacturer of water-related infrastructure products. Per its corporate profile, Northwest is the largest manufacturer of engineered steel water pipeline systems in North America. As well, the company produces high-quality precast and reinforced concrete products. Since the start of the year, shares lost almost 10% of their equity value.It’s understandable given the ebb and flow of sentiment between a possible stock market recovery and investing in downturn cycles. However, Northwest Pipe’s advantage is that irrespective of broader economic conditions, it remains vital to infrastructural health and stability. Therefore, it’s well worth consideration for forward-looking speculators.On a financial note, the market prices NWPX at a trailing multiple of 10.16. In contrast, the sector median stat stands at 22.81X. Also, Northwest features a three-year revenue growth rate of 17%. Nevertheless, shares traded at a sales multiple of 0.68x ranked lower than 76.48% of its peers. Thus, it’s a strong idea for value investing.AXT (AXTI)A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.Source: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.comBased in Fremont, California, AXT (NASDAQ:AXTI) presents an extremely risky case for undervalued stocks to buy. A materials science company, AXT develops and manufactures high-performance compound and single-element semiconductor substrate wafers. Given its significant relevance to semiconductor infrastructure, AXTI theoretically should be a compelling idea among undervalued stocks. Still, shares lost more than 31% of equity value since the Jan. opener.Those that still believe in the relevance of the company have legitimate reasons for hope. Presently, AXT prints a three-year revenue growth rate of 16.2%, above 61.45% of enterprises listed in the semiconductor space. Also, its EBITDA growth rate during the same period comes in at 66.4%, above 88.33% of rivals.Despite these impressive stats, AXTI trades at a sales multiple of 1.06X. In contrast, the sector median stands at 2.76x. Also, the market prices AXTI at a trailing earnings multiple of 14.29x. As a discount to earnings, AXT ranks better than 68.72% of the competition.Sensus Healthcare (SRTS)Man holding stacks of money.

As part of the broader healthcare complex, SRTS offers a solid narrative for undervalued stocks. Basically, no matter what’s going on with the economy, healthcare will likely never lose its relevance.That said, SRTS makes for an extremely risky idea among possible bounce-back stocks. Just last Friday, shares gave up more than 12% of equity value. Since the Jan. opener, SRTS hemorrhaged more than 56%. And in the trailing one-year period, it’s down almost 69%. It’s not exactly the most comforting series of chart stats.Still, from a financial perspective, Sensus benefits from a strong balance sheet, in particular its cash-to-debt ratio of nearly 20X. Operationally, the company prints a three-year revenue growth rate of 16.9%, ranked better than 71.53% of its peers. Nevertheless, the market prices SRTS at a revenue multiple of 1.36x ranked below 77.53% of the competition.Gulf Resources (GURE)An image of a street sign post with directions labeled ""Buy"", ""Hold"", and ""Sell""Source: PX Media / ShutterstockBased in China, Gulf Resources (NASDAQ:GURE) arguably ranks as the riskiest idea on this list of undervalued stocks. Featuring a market capitalization of less than $25 million, it’s a nano-cap play among nano caps. For those seeking excitement to the extreme, I suppose GURE could be right up your alley. For anyone else, it’s nothing short of daredevil speculation. Then again, if you have some loose change in your pocket, you could throw some at GURE.Right now, shares lost a bit more than 26% since the Jan. opener. In the trailing one-year period, GURE slipped almost 43%, again making it a risky proposition for bounce-back stocks. However, Gulf claims to be one of the largest producers of bromine in China. Further, the commodity represents a key ingredient for energy storage solutions.Against a financial framework, Gulf benefits from a strong balance sheet. In particular, its cash-to-debt ratio stands at 11.36X, above 81.32% of its peers.

No. In fact, if anything over the last two or three weeks we've seen stronger demand ex-Ireland, ex-UK, of people trying to get the hell away from the unseasonably high rainfall we've had,"" O'Leary told an analyst call.""If anything, it gives me even more confidence for sustained growth in Mediterranean holidays over the next decade.""($1 = 0.8993 euros) (Reporting by Padraic Halpin; Editing by Christian Schmollinger, Kirsten Donovan and Catherine Evans)]"

A company poll of analysts had expected a 620 million euro profit.Ryanair said it remained cautiously optimistic about modestly increasing full year profit.It now expects traffic in the year to March 2024 to grow by 9%, to around 183.5 million passengers compared to 185 million originally expected, citing Boeing delivery delays.Some new aircraft deliveries will be delayed from April 2024 to June 2024, O'Leary said, adding that Ryanair was working closely with Boeing and Spirit AeroSystems to ensure no further delays beyond that.Story continuesChief Financial Officer Neil Sorahan told Reuters he was not as concerned about the delays as he was a few months ago, that Boeing had improved significantly and deliveries were more recently hit by factors outside the planemaker's control.Ryanair said customers were not shifting to booking trips to cooler climates or cancelling flights due to the heatwave in Europe, echoing comments from rival easyJet, which also reported record figures for the period last week.""Are we seeing any changes in demand patterns? No. In fact, if anything over the last two or three weeks we've seen stronger demand ex-Ireland, ex-UK, of people trying to get the hell away from the unseasonably high rainfall we've had,"" O'Leary told an analyst call.""If anything, it gives me even more confidence for sustained growth in Mediterranean holidays over the next decade.""($1 = 0.8993 euros)(Reporting by Padraic Halpin; Editing by Christian Schmollinger, Kirsten Donovan and Catherine Evans)]"

It’s also one of America’s most well-known stocks thanks to Warren Buffett’s 13% ownership stake. While the bank has found itself in a bit of hot water recently, I’ve learned over the years that the Oracle of Omaha isn’t afraid to own controversial stocks that get into trouble with regulators and consumers. One that comes to mind is Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC). Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B) held on to shares for several years after it came to light that the bank opened at least 3.5 million fraudulent accounts to meet growth targets. The holding company eventually bailed on the bank stock in mid-2022. For its part, Bank of America was recently fined a combined $150 million by two government agencies — $90 million by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and $60 million by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. In addition, it had to refund $100 million to customers.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading Tips“Bank of America wrongfully withheld credit card rewards, double-dipped on fees, and opened accounts without consent,” CFPB Director Rohit Chopra said in a statement. “These practices are illegal and undermine customer trust.”This wasn’t the first time Bank of America has been fined for illegal practices and it probably won’t be the last. While that doesn’t necessarily mean investors should throw in the towel on the stock (Buffett certainly isn’t), here are three other companies you may want to put on your list of stocks to avoid due to controversies surrounding them. Alibaba (BABA)A photo of the Alibaba (BABA) app on a smartphone.Source: BigTunaOnline / Shutterstock.comThings have gotten so bad for Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) that Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Daniel Zhang stepped down in June after eight years in the top job. Officially, Zhang is stepping aside to focus on taking the company’s cloud unit public as part of Alibaba’s plan to split into six units. And many seem to believe the move is a good one. Story continuesPer Reuters:“The appointment of Daniel to focus on running cloud is really a show of confidence and trust in him to take the most precious business and run with it to develop it in the right way given this age of generative artificial intelligence (AI),” said Brian Wong, a former Alibaba employee and author of the book, “The Tao of Alibaba”.“The idea or expectation that one person could manage the business’ crown jewel Cloud and at the same time manage the entire Alibaba Group is an unreasonable expectation.”Maybe so, but I find it hard to believe that Alibaba couldn’t have found someone capable of growing the cloud unit. On July 10, Alibaba’s share price jumped on news that the $985 million fine levied by Chinese regulators against the company’s Ant Group affiliate could end the government’s crackdown on Chinese tech companies.Zhang presided over the company during the period in question, as well as that of the $2.8 billion antitrust fine it got in 2021. It’s more than possible that he stepped down to appease regulators or, at the very least, to avoid any further confrontation with the government.Once upon a time, I thought Alibaba stock was undervalued because of its cloud unit. In May 2019, I suggested a profitable cloud business could help get BABA shares to $250. They surpassed that level in July 2020, riding the pandemic wave. But since topping out later that year above $300, shares have lost around 70% of their value. Given the slowdown in Chinese economic growth and continued regulatory uncertainty, it’s best to put BABA on your list of stocks to avoid.Illumina (ILMN)Illumina (ILMN) logo displayed on reddish stone facade building against blue sky backgroundSource: shutterstock.com/JHVEPhotoIllumina (NASDAQ:ILMN) stock is down nearly 9% year to date compared with an 18% advance for the S&amp;P 500. Part of the problem is the San Diego-based biotech firm’s fight with Carl Icahn, who himself is in the crosshairs of short-seller Hindenburg Research, which published a report in May suggesting the billionaire would be subject to margin calls if shares of Icahn Enterprises (NASDAQ:IEP) fell further. Icahn restructured his debt and, as a result, was forced to pledge 95% of his IEP stock as collateral on his new financing.So, how does this relate to Illumina?Icahn owns 1.4% of the biotech company. In May, he won a proxy fight with the company that saw Chairman John Thompson resign, replaced by Icahn appointee Andrew Teno. In addition, the billionaire wanted CEO Francis deSouzato to step down and be replaced by former Illumina CEO Jay Flatley over DeSouza’s controversial $7.1 billion acquisition of gene-sequencing technology company Grail in 2021.  DeSouza eventually stepped down on June 12. One month later, the European Union fined Illumina $475 million for closing the Grail acquisition without its approval. The Federal Trade Commission has also ordered the company to sell Grail because the deal would stifle innovation in cancer testing technology. It’s bad enough to be fined nearly half a billion for arrogantly flouting regulators’ wishes. But to be entangled with someone like Icahn, who’s got a history of activism that’s not always a winning hand, leaves me wondering why anyone would bother with ILMN when there are so many other biotechs to choose from.Meta Platforms (META)Meta Written On The Googles - Man Wearing Virtual Reality Goggles Inside A Metaverse. FTC investigating META.Source: Aleem Zahid Khan / Shutterstock.comMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) got fined $1.3 billion in May for violating European Union data protection rules. Eventually, North America will get wise to the Facebooks of the world and seriously start protecting consumer privacy.Here in Canada, where I live, Facebook and Google are acting like spoiled children, threatening to ban news from their Canadian news feeds because a new law was passed on June 22. C-18 requires online advertising behemoths such as Facebook and Google to pay media outlets for sharing their content with social media users. As the Los Angeles Times points out, Australia implemented similar legislation in 2021 and it’s been a boon to publishers down under. “That bill has already restored tens of millions of dollars in revenue to Australia’s troubled newsrooms, and, while far from perfect, has transformed the media environment dramatically,” wrote columnist Brian Merchant. Meta and Facebook have been fined more than $6 billion since 2000. That seems like a lot. However, when you consider that Mark Zuckerberg’s wealth in 2023 has increased by nearly $67 billion due in large part to Meta shares’ 158% year-to-date gain, it’s a drop in the bucket. Zuckerberg will do whatever he wants, including trampling all over publishers’ intellectual property worldwide. His company has no redeeming qualities. It’s the worst of social media.   Investing in META is no better than buying tobacco stocks.

These attractions could prove irresistible, particularly for those plotting a long-term investment course where valuation and investment return assume a towering significance over time. Yet, the landscape is strewn with dividend stocks offering unsustainable distributions, which could trap investors.Hence, the quest for firms with a robust business model that can uphold their distribution over the long haul becomes massive. Investors get a generous safety net when wagering on shares of undervalued enterprises, not to mention a heftier dividend yield. Discovering such stocks may seem akin to looking for a needle in the haystack, but it’s worth the effort.Therefore, investing for income is a strategic play that could offer massive long-term rewards. Investing in undervalued dividend stocks puts you in that sweet spot where prudence meets reward.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsPrudential (PRU)Prudential logoSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comPrudential (NYSE:PRU) is a behemoth in the global financial services realm, continuing to pique investor interest with its tenacity and overall robustness. Despite kicking off 2023 on a rough note, PRU stock is down roughly 8% year-to-date. Much of that has to do with the steep drop in reported revenue and earnings each quarter last year. Nevertheless, its recent record suggests the company continues to navigate choppy waters with its impressively diversified portfolio with aplomb.Prudential made a statement with a net income of $1.46 billion and revenue of $15.9 billion in its first quarter. Evidently, the firm is back in the saddle, ready to ride the bull market again. Despite its resilience, the stock is trading at just 0.6 times forward sales estimates while yielding a mighty impressive dividend yield of almost 5.5%. Moreover, its dividend payout has risen by 14 consecutive years, significantly adding to its allure.Story continuesBank of America (BAC)bank of America stock BAC stockSource: ShutterstockBank of America (NYSE:BAC) is effectively riding the turbulent currents of the financial industry. The firm has showcased an admirable knack for charting a path forward, emerging stronger from every challenge that’s come its way. The Silicon Valley Bank debacle in March could have thrown a lesser entity off course, but BAC stood tall amidst the turmoil. Moreover, it welcomed a torrential influx of $15 billion in deposits as investors sought the sturdy shelter of an established player.BAC delivered spectacular results in the first quarter, blowing past analyst estimates on both lines. The bank’s robust earnings per share growth, a substantial hike in net interest income, and stellar revenue growth across all segments effectively bolster its long-term position. With it managing a whopping $3 trillion in assets and a savory dividend yield of more than 3%, it would be wise to have BAC stock in your portfolios now.Public Storage (PSA)a Public Storage sign in front of a facility of storage buildingsSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comPublic Storage (NYSE:PSA) is a popular real estate investment trust (REIT) specializing in acquiring and maintaining self-storage properties. Its business has done remarkably well despite the crippling economic headwinds. Moreover, the firm has reported funds from operations (FFO) of $4.08 per diluted share in the first quarter, a key measure for REIT investors in examining the dividend’s safety.Its robust $4.08 FFO per share comfortably outpaces its quarterly dividend, indicating strong coverage. Additionally, Public Storage showcased strong growth, with its FFO and revenues soaring by 11.8% and 12.4% year-over-year, respectively, in the first quarter of 2023. This pattern points to a healthy financial trajectory for this REIT. Moreover, its 4-year average dividend yield is at an extraordinary 4.1%, backed by industry-leading growth numbers. Additionally, analysts at TipRanks rated the stock as a Moderate Buy with about a 9% upside from current levels.Northrop Grumman (NOC)Northrop Grumman (NOC) logo on a corporate buildingSource: Kristi Blokhin / Shutterstock.comNorthrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC) is arguably one of the best defense contractors known for its steady and dependable dividend payout. It channeled over 70% of its free cash flow into dividends last year, a testament to its shareholder commitment.The company has effectively surpassed first-quarter expectations despite some turbulence, as evidenced by profit declines across key business units such as mission and aeronautics systems. It reported earnings per share of $5.50 on revenue of $9.3 billion, beating out the forecasted $5.09 on $9.2 billion. Particularly, its space unit offers a ray of optimism, with first-quarter sales skyrocketing 17% year-over-year. Impressively, its revenue eclipses that of the aeronautics division by over 35%.NOC stock is down almost 16% year-to-date, offering a powerful dividend yield of 1.7%, with consecutive dividend growth for almost 20 years.Agnico Eagle Mines (AEM)gold miningSource: ©iStock.com/TomasSeredaRising above cost and workforce challenges, Agnico Eagle Mines (NYSE:AEM) posted robustly in the gold production sphere last year. Hailed as the third-largest gold producer globally, the firm effectively showcased strong cost control and strategic expansion projects, leading to record-breaking margins. Notably, Agnico Eagle has maintained its position in lucrative mining jurisdictions and witnessed significant production growth compared to its peers.Moreover, with an array of projects in the U.S. and Colombia lined up and aimed at augmenting its gold and silver production profile, the firm is set for long-term growth expansion ahead. While rising costs due to persistent inflation could be considered a risk, Agnico Eagle seems well-equipped to manage labor and other costs. Additionally, the company offers a healthy and sustainable dividend yield, exceeding the 3% mark for its shareholders. With minimal political risk and a low valuation, the stock emerges as an appealing buy.Restaurant Brands (QSR)Three young adult friends sit around a vintage restaurant booth eating hamburgers. image represents restaurant stocksSource: ShutterstockRestaurant Brands (NYSE:QSR) boasts a robust global footprint, operating around 29,000 restaurants in over 100 countries. The company continues to demonstrate impressive financial health with encouraging numbers across both lines. Consolidated total revenues and adjusted EBITDA grew over 9.5% and nearly 11% for the first quarter year-over-year, comfortably outpacing sector averages. Moreover, it has been an excellent performer in the stock market in the past year, generating a total return of 56% compared to the S&amp;P 500’s of just 21%.Furthermore, in its first quarter, it reported a notable year-over-year increase in sales to $1.59 billion, alongside a net income of $277 million. The driving forces behind this success lie in the company’s diverse brand portfolio and the massive scale at which it operates.Hence, with its international presence and commitment to continuous operational improvements, QSR stock represents one of the best income stocks at this time. Additionally, it offers a 2.79% yield with seven years of consecutive payout growth.Kellogg (K)Kellogg's sign on their Canada's head office building in MississaugaSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comIn the world of consumer stocks, Kellogg (NYSE:K) has been somewhat static, with its stock dipping 5% over the last five years with only a modest increase of 2% in the past decade. That stagnation stems from limited growth in its traditional cereal business, which faces challenges due to changing consumer behaviors and increased competition.The company wants to spin off its cereal business from its other faster-growing consumer products, particularly snack items. The business will split its high-growth sections into a new entity named “Kellanova,” while rebranding its cereal branch as “WK Kellogg Co.”For investors, this could present a strategic opportunity wager on K stock before the split at the end of 2023. Moreover, despite recent challenges, the company has maintained a solid track record of 18 consecutive years of dividend growth, yielding an appealing 3.5%.On the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Thomas Carper, a Democrat from Delaware, though it has never advanced beyond that.Carper, along with Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) and Reps. Raul Ruiz (D-Calif.) and Brad Wenstrup (R-Ohio), reintroduced the bill for the seventh time since 2012 on Thursday.The bill, among other things, directs Medicare Part D to cover obesity treatments if ""used for the treatment of obesity … or for weight loss management for an individual who is overweight … and has one or more related co-morbidities.""A key difference from the 2012 version is a shift to require Medicare Part D coverage, rather than coverage based on ""if the [Health] Secretary determines that coverage of such a drug under this part is appropriate.""In 2012, estimates showed 42% of Americans will be obese by 2030, according to that version of the bill. The latest version increased that estimate to 47%.The bill highlights the cost of obesity to the annual Medicare budget: ""On average, a Medicare beneficiary with obesity costs $2,018 (in 2019 dollars) more than a healthy-weight beneficiary.""In comparison, there are concerns that the cost of the weight loss drugs — almost $1,000 per month — could bankrupt Medicare. And questions about whether or not it is a chronic disease drug or a lifestyle drug will determine the fate of the bill.Ozempic maker Novo Nordisk (NVO) is the only company with a drug approved for obesity without Type 2 diabetes. It has spent $11 million on food and travel for doctors to discuss products including Wegovy and Ozempic and spent $4.6 million on ongoing lobbying in Congress in 2022 alone.Story continuesIn the first quarter of this year, the company spent more than $1.3 million on lobbying Congress on various topics, including obesity drugs — double what it spent in all of 2013, the first full year the bill was introduced, according to data from OpenSecrets.org.Boxes of Ozempic and Mounjaro, semaglutide and tirzepatide injection drugs used for treating type 2 diabetes and made by Novo Nordisk and Lilly, are seen at a Rock Canyon Pharmacy in Provo, Utah, U.S. May 29, 2023. REUTERS/George FreyNovo Nordisk also hired the lobbying firm Arnold &amp; Porter, which recently hired a former sponsor of the bill, Rep. Ron Kind (D-Wis.), as a senior strategic adviser. Kind won’t be allowed to lobby the bill for a year, according to ethics rules.In addition to engaging doctors, the company has also lobbied state governments and obesity advocates to create awareness about its products and increase coverage for them.Lobbying efforts Without commercial insurance and Medicare buy-in, weight loss drugs remain inaccessible to a large swath of Americans. But employers and commercial insurers are acting cautiously.Most insurers either require prior approval for the drug to be used or are sticking to only covering Type 2 diabetes patients. Medicare has been banned from covering these drugs for the use of weight loss alone for decades.This is why Novo and its competitors want to convince not just Congress but also state legislatures to cover the drugs for obesity. State governments represent a large population of covered lives, and some state legislatures govern what can and cannot be covered by the state's budget for its employees' health spend.Sen. Tom Carper (D-Del.), shown here on Wednesday, Feb. 15, 2023, in Washington, has introduced the Treat and Reduce Obesity Act (TROA) every year since 2012. (AP Photo/Mariam Zuhaib, File)The company has either directly hosted or been indirectly involved in, through advocates from organizations sponsored by Novo (and Eli Lilly (LLY)), policy events throughout the country. Yahoo Finance reviewed programs from at least two of these events, one in Philadelphia in August 2021 and one in New Jersey in 2022.The speakers included a member of Novo Nordisk or the Obesity Action Coalition (OAC), which is funded by Novo Nordisk. The company contributes more than $500,000 to OAC annually and has been a corporate partner since 2013, according to OAC’s website. (Eli Lilly contributes more than $100,000 annually, according to the website.)An attendee of the event in Philadelphia, who was not authorized to speak to media, said weight loss drugs were discussed.New Jersey Assemblyman Herb Conaway, chair of the Assembly health committee, is now the sponsor of a bill that would cover obesity drugs under all state-administered health plans, such as those for state employees, public education employees, and Medicaid enrollees.A request for comment was not returned by Conaway’s office.Eli Lilly has also sponsored policy events that included discussion of obesity as a chronic disease. Its drug, Mounjaro, is awaiting FDA approval for patients with obesity without Type 2 diabetes. Pfizer (PFE) is a recent entrant in the space, with an oral drug candidate currently in clinical trials.'The opioid playbook'?Several experts in the health insurance industry spoke to Yahoo Finance on background, since they were unauthorized to speak to the media. The common refrain among them: ""This is the opioid playbook.""From 1996 to 2001, Purdue Pharma, the maker of OxyContin, began a lobbying campaign that focused on pain management. Introducing that idea at conferences and forums hosted by Purdue and educating medical professionals about the drug as well as training them on how to speak about it was what led to the widespread use of opioids and the current epidemic.Others said this is too harsh a comparison and that it was more like the debate over Medicare coverage for erectile dysfunction drugs Viagra and Cialis. At that time, Medicare had been covering the drug, and outrage poured in over tax dollars being used for ""lifestyle prescription drugs."" Paying for doctors' food and travel and educating them on the drugs is a practice that landed Novo Nordisk in trouble across the pond, with the UK’s drug lobbying group suspending the company for two years. Unlike in the US, the UK does not allow these lobbying strategies.Flags are seen outside Novo Nordisk headquarters in Copenhagen, Denmark, February 5, 2020. REUTERS/Jacob Gronholt-PedersenLobbying itself is legal and many other companies employ similar strategies to help boost sales in the US. But the current price tag of the obesity drugs has caused concern for those who would foot the bill — employers, commercial insurers, and the federal government.When asked about the ongoing lobbying efforts, the company said: ""We advocate for the full continuum of care for patients with obesity, including coverage for anti-obesity medications in Medicare Part D. We also actively work with private insurers and employers to encourage broader coverage of anti-obesity medicines.""Novo Nordisk told Yahoo Finance it has been partnering with organizations to ""provide fact-based context and education on this misunderstood disease"" as well as ""working with influential individuals to help change the societal perspective of obesity.""Katherine Hempstead, a senior health policy advisor at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation who attended one of the policy events in the US, said it wasn’t blatant selling of the product.But the bill in Congress could be a huge push towards greater coverage of the drug, she said.""A part of me feels like there’s an inevitability to this, at some point these drugs will get covered in some ways. Especially when you hear about people going to compounding and getting dangerous substitutes because they want them so much,"" Hempstead said.That is why the lobbying for weight loss drugs is likely only to increase, Khrysta Baig, a health policy researcher at Vanderbilt University, told Yahoo Finance.""There seems to be greater energy behind the bill as new and pipeline anti-obesity medications have gained public attention. With Wegovy’s [semaglutide] approval in 2021 and the expected approval of tirzepatide [Eli Lilly’s Mounjaro] for weight loss sometime this year, public and industry interest in Medicare coverage seems to have increased,"" Baig said.The injectable drug Ozempic is shown Saturday, July 1, 2023, in Houston. (AP Photo/David J. Phillip)Surprise surgeThe popularity of the products may have taken Novo by surprise. The company almost doubled its 2023 forecast after first quarter sales showed a 25% increase in sales based on a boost from Wegovy and Ozempic — and that's in a market without widespread insurance coverage.Novo had to reduce the production of lower dosages of Wegovy as a result of the surge in interest and instead focus on higher dosages to help maintain the care of patients. That strain put an emphasis on Novo's older drug, Saxenda, which has also been added to the FDA's drug shortage list.Dr. Angela Fitch, president of the Obesity Medicine Association and one of the doctors paid as a consultant for Novo, said company officials told her they didn’t predict the new drugs taking off the way they have.""Once you get out something that actually works, the people will want it,"" Fitch, chief medical officer of health startup knownwell, said, noting there is a potential population of about 120 million Americans who could benefit.Or as General Catalyst advisor Dr. Stephen Klasko put it: ""Yes, they’re for obesity, but they’ve really become a lifestyle drug. If you’re in one of the clubs in Miami, where you used to talk about your plastic surgery, you’re now talking about which GLP-1 you’re on.""He added, ""All you have to know is Weight Watchers’ stock went up 45% when they announced that they’re selling GLP-1s now.""Beyond the current shortage of products, Novo is also responsible for a 400% spike in spending on Ozempic for one employer and a 73% spike in utilization for one state’s education budget on Wegovy and Saxenda.In recent conversations with employers, weight care management startup Found's CEO Sara Jones Simmer said she was hearing about surges in healthcare spending.""[Employers] were seeing Ozempic go from not even being in the top 20 of drug costs literally to number one within six months time,"" Jones Simmer told Yahoo Finance. ""We talked to one employer that shared…Ozempic prescriptions had increased 400% year over year, and they said there’s no way the number of Type 2 diabetics in our organization has changed 400% so where is this coming from?""And employers can’t pull the drugs off their formulary, denying coverage to those who need it. But at the same time, ""if they don’t do anything about it, people are going to get on these medications that are designed to be taken in perpetuity, that cost, on average, $17,000 a year, and that could bankrupt especially a small employer,"" she said.Similarly, New Jersey’s state education benefits plan has seen a 73% increase in the use of Wegovy and Saxenda, according to documents viewed by Yahoo Finance.Ozempic ranks in the top three for drug spending for fiscal year 2022 and is the top drug in the diabetes category, accounting for 12% of total plan spend, according to the documents.Novo Nordisk declined to comment on whether or not they anticipated this level of demand. But it is still facing a shortage of both Ozempic and Wegovy, after a slow initial rollout of Wegovy last year, and has scrambled to expand production more quickly than it anticipated. The company has also had to pause advertising for the drugs.""A second CMO [manufacturer] is now ready to begin production to help increase Wegovy supply capacity, and a third site at one of our current CMOs is expected later this year,"" the company said.Follow Anjalee Khemlani on Twitter @AnjKhemRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

To skip our detailed analysis of the healthcare sector, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Healthcare Stocks Under $50.After the COVID-19 pandemic, many investors believed that the shining moment being enjoyed by healthcare and vaccine stocks was finally about to blow over. However, this way of thinking may have been premature. On July 21, the S&amp;P 500 healthcare sector was up by 18.95 points, representing an increase of 1.21%. The sector has been hanging on as the market continues to shift and transform in light of several developments, most notably the influence of artificial intelligence and big tech companies. Considering the popularity of these latter categories of stocks, it will come as a pleasant surprise for healthcare investors that, at this point, financial professionals are considering healthcare to be a sector that is creating more opportunities for the technology industry and those investing in it as well.""Too Compelling To Ignore""This trend was noted by Jamie Cox, the managing partner at Harris Financial Group, in a CNBC interview on July 21. In the words of Cox, the healthcare sector, which is viewed as a sector operating just adjacent to the tech sector today, is ""too compelling to ignore"" at this moment, signaling that those who want to cash in on the booming tech trade this year can take an alternative route through the healthcare sector to achieve their goals. Here are some comments Cox made on CNBC on this matter:""It's all about healthcare, Dom. I mean, you know, tech and healthcare, the intersection of those two sectors cannot be ignored. There's so much innovation, so much R&amp;D that happened during the pandemic and we're just starting to see some of the pieces of it come to the marketplace. One particular area, medical devices - I mean you have people voluntarily wearing continuous glucose monitors. So companies like Insulet or Dexcom, these are companies that are absolutely knocking it out of the park. People are paying really close attention to healthcare and that is brought about by technology.""Story continuesConsidering these comments, investors can expect to see an increasing interplay between technology companies and healthcare companies in 2023, especially as tech companies themselves begin rapid innovative processes through artificial intelligence. On whether there is an investing angle in healthcare from the tech and artificial intelligence viewpoint, Cox said the following:""It's already happening. I mean, Meta has created algorithms to predict protein folding. The President actually referenced cancer research, and Meta is already sort of doing it. Protein folding will predict different strains of proteins and how they will react and create cancers in the body, and if you can predict the way a protein will fold then you can create drugs or target therapies to be able to treat it. So this is already here, and basically, we're gonna be seeing the benefits of it, or investible benefits of it in the years to come. But it's not gonna necessarily accrue to a healthcare company or a drug company like Pfizer. It can also accrue to a company like Meta. That's what I'm saying, the intersection of healthcare and technology is here to stay.""Medical Devices For The WinFor Cox, the place to be in the healthcare investing space is the medical devices area. He believes that this area will see the ""most benefit"" in light of the growing collaboration between healthcare and technology services. He pinpointed companies focusing on diabetes and cardiac care as the ones to keep an eye on as the situation further develops since these areas will become the best investment opportunities in the healthcare space in the near future, according to Cox.Considering viewpoints such as those presented by Cox this July, healthcare companies such as Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), and Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA), among others, can expect to reap the benefits of the tech rally and the AI boom just as much as other players in the market. Considering this interplay of the two sectors, we have compiled a list of the best healthcare stocks to buy under $50 for investors looking to buy into this promising industry today. Considering current developments, these stocks may very well be some of the best long-term healthcare stocks to stick by. Also, considering the fact that they are some of the best cheap healthcare stocks on the market today, they may serve as attractive investment options for healthcare investors in 2023.11 Best Healthcare Stocks Under $50Our MethodologyWe used a stock screen to find healthcare stocks under $50 and then selected the most popular stocks using Insider Monkey's hedge fund data for the first quarter.

(NYSE:PFE) will pay a dividend of $0.41 on the 5th of September. Based on this payment, the dividend yield on the company's stock will be 4.4%, which is an attractive boost to shareholder returns. View our latest analysis for Pfizer Pfizer's Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsImpressive dividend yields are good, but this doesn't matter much if the payments can't be sustained. However, Pfizer's earnings easily cover the dividend. This means that most of what the business earns is being used to help it grow.Over the next year, EPS is forecast to fall by 35.5%. If the dividend continues along the path it has been on recently, we estimate the payout ratio could be 52%, which is comfortable for the company to continue in the future.historic-dividendPfizer Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. Since 2013, the dividend has gone from $0.88 total annually to $1.64. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 6.4% over that duration. Companies like this can be very valuable over the long term, if the decent rate of growth can be maintained.The Dividend Has Growth PotentialInvestors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. We are encouraged to see that Pfizer has grown earnings per share at 7.1% per year over the past five years. A low payout ratio and decent growth suggests that the company is reinvesting well, and it also has plenty of room to increase the dividend over time.Pfizer Looks Like A Great Dividend StockOverall, we think that this is a great income investment, and we think that maintaining the dividend this year may have been a conservative choice. The company is generating plenty of cash, and the earnings also quite easily cover the distributions. If earnings do fall over the next 12 months, the dividend could be buffeted a little bit, but we don't think it should cause too much of a problem in the long term. All of these factors considered, we think this has solid potential as a dividend stock.Story continuesInvestors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock. Taking the debate a bit further, we've identified 1 warning sign for Pfizer that investors need to be conscious of moving forward.

87,c6ba12bd-00cf-46aa-8bb7-b4ddc47b61b0,IBM,2023-07-24,Why you should also be obsessed with Microsoft,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-you-should-also-be-obsessed-with-microsoft-100049093.html,1690192849,STORY,"['MSFT', 'NVDA', 'CRM', 'AAPL', 'IBM', 'ATVI', 'AMZN']","[This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:The chart of the dayWhat we're watchingWhat we're readingEconomic data releases and earningsWinners are winners for a reason, something I have been reminded of a good number of times this summer.The winner in focus today: Microsoft (MSFT).I was reminded of Microsoft's winning ways in a phone chat with IBM's top CFO Jim Kavanaugh. In our brief time together, I asked Jim why his company's stock traded on a forward price-to-earnings multiple of 15 times (discount to the broader market) whereas Microsoft is north of 30 times (premium to the broader market).IBM does cool stuff, I think, and is doing more of it increasingly in high-growth areas such as artificial intelligence and cloud computing. The company's lucrative consultancy business also had a very solid second quarter.Kavanaugh acknowledged the valuation gap between the two tech icons and said it would close with a steady stream of consistent execution.Perhaps that will happen.But the exchange left an impression on me: While IBM fights to command a more premium valuation in a hot tech market, Microsoft's valuation will keep expanding. So why not continue to ride the Microsoft juggernaut as an investor?Microsoft has winning momentum that is supporting higher profit estimates, higher valuation estimates, and higher cash flow estimates.The first place to look for Microsoft's momentum is, naturally, AI.Microsoft's reveal of its AI subscription pricing last week sent the stock to a new high — and with good reason, Jefferies veteran tech analyst Brent Thill explained.""AI is already benefiting Azure results and this should only be the beginning given Microsoft's pole position in a decade-long industry evolution. Microsoft announced M365 copilot pricing of $30 per user/month, which reflects a 53-83% pricing uplift, far greater than the 15-30% previously thought,"" said Thill. ""If just half of our conservative estimate of ~115 million E3 &amp; E5 users adopt M365 copilot, M365 copilot could drive $20.6 billion in incremental revenue representing ~53% growth from FY23 O365 commercial revenue or ~10% upside to FY23 total revenue. Hence, we believe that M365 copilot could help double O365 commercial revenue in the next 4-5 years.""Story continuesThose are huge potential financial statement drivers. Actually, they helped Microsoft set the stage for a major reset upwards of Street expectations, not unlike what Nvidia did a few months ago.So there is all of that.While Microsoft drives towards its AI future, the near term appears quite nice as well.The company's cloud business Azure continues to hum as the economy enters a ""steady state"" period, as characterized to me in a chat with American Express CEO Stephen Squeri.""Our recent CIO Survey showed stable, but muted, IT budget growth expectations for CY23. However, several forward looking indicators in the CIO survey support Microsoft's strong relative positioning within those muted CY23 budgets growth expectations, including Microsoft being the only software vendor in our survey for which forward growth expectations actually improved sequentially in our survey,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss pointed out.Notice I haven't even dived into the possible material profit lift from the addition of Activision Blizzard. I am running out of room on this page but will simply say this gaming deal will be another big tailwind to Microsoft.What can go wrong with this bull's dream story? Perhaps the economy falls off a cliff and Satya Nadella steps down as CEO in 2024.But I don't see either happening.And that means more winning for MicrosoftEarnings are out July 25.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

88,22e73a86-870c-3e0d-b62f-7e0eb843a15b,IBM,2023-07-24,IBM Report: Half of Breached Organizations Unwilling to Increase Security Spend Despite Soaring Breach Costs,PR Newswire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ibm-report-half-breached-organizations-040100455.html,1690171260,STORY,['IBM'],"[AI/Automation cut breach lifecycles by 108 days; $470,000 in extra costs for ransomware victims that avoid law enforcement; Only one third-of organizations detected the breach themselves CAMBRIDGE, Mass., July 24, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- IBM (NYSE: IBM) Security today released its annual Cost of a Data Breach Report,1 showing the global average cost of a data breach reached $4.45 million in 2023 – an all-time high for the report and a 15% increase over the last 3 years. Detection and escalation costs jumped 42% over this same time frame, representing the highest portion of breach costs, and indicating a shift towards more complex breach investigations.According to the 2023 IBM report, businesses are divided in how they plan to handle the increasing cost and frequency of data breaches. The study found that while 95% of studied organizations have experienced more than one breach, breached organizations were more likely to pass incident costs onto consumers (57%) than to increase security investments (51%).The 2023 Cost of a Data Breach Report is based on in-depth analysis of real-world data breaches experienced by 553 organizations globally between March 2022 and March 2023. The research, sponsored and analyzed by IBM Security, was conducted by Ponemon Institute and has been published for 18 consecutive years. Some key findings in the 2023 IBM report include:AI Picks Up Speed – AI and automation had the biggest impact on speed of breach identification and containment for studied organizations. Organizations with extensive use of both AI and automation experienced a data breach lifecycle that was 108 days shorter compared to studied organizations that have not deployed these technologies (214 days versus 322 days).The Cost of Silence – Ransomware victims in the study that involved law enforcement saved $470,000 in average costs of a breach compared to those that chose not to involve law enforcement. Despite these potential savings, 37% of ransomware victims studied did not involve law enforcement in a ransomware attack.Detection Gaps – Only one third of studied breaches were detected by an organization's own security team, compared to 27% that were disclosed by an attacker. Data breaches disclosed by the attacker cost nearly $1 million more on average compared to studied organizations that identified the breach themselves.Story continues""Time is the new currency in cybersecurity both for the defenders and the attackers. As the report shows, early detection and fast response can significantly reduce the impact of a breach,"" said Chris McCurdy, General Manager, Worldwide IBM Security Services. ""Security teams must focus on where adversaries are the most successful and concentrate their efforts on stopping them before they achieve their goals. Investments in threat detection and response approaches that accelerate defenders speed and efficiency – such as AI and automation – are crucial to shifting this balance."" Every Second Costs According to the 2023 report, studied organizations that fully deploy security AI and automation saw 108-day shorter breach lifecycles on average compared to organizations not deploying these technologies – and experienced significantly lower incident costs. In fact, studied organizations that deployed security AI and automation extensively saw, on average, nearly $1.8 million lower data breach costs than organizations that didn't deploy these technologies – the biggest cost saver identified in the report.At the same time, adversaries have reduced the average time to complete a ransomware attack. And with nearly 40% of studied organizations not yet deploying security AI and automation, there is still considerable opportunity for organizations to boost detection and response speeds.Ransomware 'Discount Code'Some studied organizations remain apprehensive to engage law enforcement during a ransomware attack due to the perception that it will only complicate the situation. For the first time this year, the IBM report looked closer at this issue and found evidence to the contrary. Participating organizations that did not involve law enforcement experienced breach lifecycles that were 33-days longer on average than those that did involve law enforcement – and that silence came with a price. Ransomware victims studied that didn't bring in law enforcement paid on average $470,000 higher breach costs than those that did.Despite ongoing efforts by law enforcement to collaborate with ransomware victims, 37% of respondents still opted not to bring them in. Add to that, nearly half (47%) of studied ransomware victims reportedly paid the ransom. It's clear that organizations should abandon these misconceptions around ransomware. Paying a ransom, and avoiding law enforcement, may only drive-up incident costs, and slow the response.Security Teams Rarely Discover Breaches ThemselvesThreat detection and response has seen some progress. According to IBM's 2023 Threat Intelligence Index, defenders were able to halt a higher proportion of ransomware attacks last year. However, adversaries are still finding ways to slip through the cracks of defense. The report found that only one in three studied breaches were detected by the organization's own security teams or tools, while 27% of such breaches were disclosed by an attacker, and 40% were disclosed by a neutral third party such as law enforcement.Responding organizations that discovered the breach themselves experienced nearly $1 million less in breach costs than those disclosed by an attacker ($5.23 million vs. $4.3 million). Breaches disclosed by an attacker also had a lifecycle nearly 80 days longer (320 vs. 241) compared to those who identified the breach internally. The significant cost and time savings that come with early detection show that investing in these strategies can pay off in the long run.Additional findings in the 2023 IBM report include:Breaching Data Across Environments – Nearly 40% of data breaches studied resulted in the loss of data across multiple environments including public cloud, private cloud, and on-prem—showing that attackers were able to compromise multiple environments while avoiding detection. Data breaches studied that impacted multiple environments also led to higher breach costs ($4.75 million on average).Costs of Healthcare Breaches Continue to Soar – The average costs of a studied breach in healthcare reached nearly $11 million in 2023 – a 53% price increase since 2020. Cybercriminals have started making stolen data more accessible to downstream victims, according to the 2023 X-Force Threat Intelligence Report. With medical records as leverage, threat actors amplify pressure on breached organizations to pay a ransom. In fact, across all industries studied, customer personally identifiable information was the most commonly breached record type and the costliest.The DevSecOps Advantage – Studied organizations across all industries with a high level of DevSecOps saw a global average cost of a data breach nearly $1.7 million lower than those studied with a low level/no use of a DevSecOps approach.Critical Infrastructure Breach Costs Break $5 Million – Critical infrastructure organizations studied experienced a 4.5% jump in the average costs of a breach compared to last year – increasing from $4.82 million to $5.04 million – $590K higher than the global average.Additional SourcesTo download a copy of the 2023 Cost of a Data Breach Report, please visit: https://www.ibm.com/security/data-breach.Read more about the report's top findings in this IBM Security Intelligence blog.Sign up for the 2023 IBM Security Cost of a Data Breach webinar on Tuesday, August 1, 2023, at 11:00 a.m. ET here.Connect with the IBM Security X-Force team for a personalized review of the findings: https://ibm.biz/book-a-consult.For a closer look at the report recommendations visit: Cost of a Data breach Action Guide.About IBM SecurityIBM Security helps secure the world's largest enterprises and governments with an integrated portfolio of security products and services, infused with dynamic AI and automation capabilities.

But if you buy good businesses at attractive prices, your portfolio returns could exceed the average market return. For example, the United Airlines Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:UAL) share price is up 75% in the last three years, clearly besting the market return of around 35% (not including dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 59% in the last year.After a strong gain in the past week, it's worth seeing if longer term returns have been driven by improving fundamentals. See our latest analysis for United Airlines Holdings In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During three years of share price growth, United Airlines Holdings moved from a loss to profitability. That would generally be considered a positive, so we'd expect the share price to be up.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on United Airlines Holdings' earnings, revenue and cash flow.A Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that United Airlines Holdings shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 59% over one year. That certainly beats the loss of about 5% per year over the last half decade. This makes us a little wary, but the business might have turned around its fortunes. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

Reported EPS is $0.49 EPS, expectations were $0.49.Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to the CCSX Corporation Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. I will now turn the call over to today’s speaker Matthew Korn, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.Matthew Korn: Thank you, operator. Hello, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. Joining me this afternoon are Joe Hinrichs, President and Chief Executive Officer; Jamie Boychuk, Executive Vice President of Operations; Kevin Boone, Executive Vice President of Sales and Marketing; and Sean Pelkey, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In the presentation accompanying this call, you will find our forward-looking disclosure on slide two followed by our non-GAAP disclosure on slide three. And with that, it's my pleasure to introduce Mr. Joe Hinrichs.Joe Hinrichs: Thank you, Matthew, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining our conference call. Our performance over the second quarter met our expectations led by the strong results of our merchandise business. As we had indicated at year-end and again last quarter, we knew that we would have to manage through lower intermodal storage revenue and normalizing export coal prices. We expect the intermodal volume to be soft as imports slowed and destocking activity continued. That said, we also knew that we were gaining momentum with our customers, led by our improved service performance and in our own workplace as our ONE CSX efforts took hold. Our network continues to run well, and our company's initiatives combined with our employees' hard work and commitment to making a big difference and helping to set our railroad apart.There was much more to do, but our results this quarter show signs of the progress we are making as we lay the groundwork for long-term growth and value-creation. Turning to slide five. Let's review the highlights for the second quarter. We moved over 1.5 million carloads in the second quarter, led by a 3% volume growth in merchandise and 4% growth in coal, and our margins remained strong with an operating ratio below 60%, including the impact of the Quality Carriers' trucking business. We generated $3.7 billion in revenue, which was 3% lower than the previous year and flat from the first quarter. Operating income decreased 13% year-over-year to $1.5 billion and our earnings per share decreased by 9% to $0.49. When making comparisons to last year, it's important to remember that our second quarter 2022 results included a $122 million gain, representing $0.04 per share of EPS related to the Commonwealth of Virginia property sale.Story continuesAll in, this was a solid performance highlighted by great results in our core business. The fact that our team was able to drive 3% merchandise volume growth in such an uncertain macroeconomic market is a testament to what we are able to do when we work together. Now moving on to slide six. Earlier this month, CSX released its new 2022 ESG report, which highlights the tremendous progress that our team has made in moving our company forward. Since I started here last fall, you've heard me talk about ONE CSX, about building a supportive and positive culture and about the need to consider all of our stakeholders who are measuring our success as a company. Many of you have asked me, what this really means in practice. What does the railroad look like where its people feel valued and included, where its customers feel appreciated, and where the communities in which it operates you are respected?I think the picture and the highlight that you see here offer a small view into how we're making this happen here at CSX. To us, incorporating environmental, social and governance considerations into the priorities of our company goes hand-in-hand with our ONE CSX focus. Adding to the greater sense of purpose that we all share. These are real, authentic actions that we're taking today. We talk often about our environmental leadership and our clear advantage here over trucks as a core part of our value proposition to our customers and our shareholders. By expanding our use of technology, conducting practical testing of alternative fuels and offering support and encouragement to our suppliers, we continue to make progress. As we reported in our press release last week, we are testing biodiesel blends in locomotives in revenue service.csx, train, appalachian, rail, winter, railway, chesapeke and ohio, power, business, coal, infrastructure, freight, countryside, energy, transport, cargo, west virginia, sd 70ac,matthew siddons / Shutterstock.comLast month, you heard that we are in talks with CPKC to form a joint venture for the development of hydrogen-powered locomotives, which offer encouraging promise as a low emissions fuel solution. What we probably do not talk enough about are all the incredible efforts made by our railroaders, to build up the places in which we live and work. It's been a priority of ours to increase our company's positive cultural impact. And I am proud of how quickly the people in CSX have responded. As you see here, our volunteer hours are up substantially. Our CSX-sponsored community events have multiplied. And the number of people who we have been able to help and support has been incredible. I look forward to much more to come. There's one last item I'd like to mention.At CSX, safety is our top priority, and that's why we focus so much on our reported injury and accident rates. Our fundamental goal is to make sure that every one of our employees gets home safely every day. When that does not happen and we lose one of our colleagues as we lost Derek Little last month, it affects us deeply. As a reminder, why we make so much effort on safety and how much more work we need to do. Now let me turn it over to the team.Jamie Boychuk: Thank you, Joe, and good afternoon, everyone. As Joe just said, we continue to make every effort to enhance our company's safety performance. As slide eight shows, we made good progress this quarter with both our FRA injury frequency and FRA train accident rate improving sequentially. Our injury rate also improved year-over-year and was the lowest rate for a second quarter that we've seen since 2015. Our focus is to ensure that every employee, including new hires who are less familiar, understands and appreciates their part to reinforce our safety-focused culture. Turning to slide nine. Our operating performance held up well over the second quarter and continues to lead the industry. Thanks to the hard work of our railroaders, who execute the operating plan every day.I've seen firsthand the positive response to the efforts being made by our employees to strengthen our culture. Our men and women in the field are valued, included, respected, appreciated and listen to, which helps them feel even more pride in the service they are delivering to our customers. Because of them, we're able to show how well our scheduled railroading model works, and I am excited as there are more opportunities ahead. Velocity averaged 17.7 miles per hour in the second quarter, slightly lower than last quarter, but up substantially from the same period in 2022. Dwell averaged 9.3 hours, an improvement of over 20%, compared to the same period last year. Intermodal trip plan performance of 96%, increased by 6 percentage points year-over-year, while carload trip plan performance of 84% improved by 25 percentage points.I'm pleased with the compliments and support we have received from our customers, regulators, and shareholders on our service improvements. Our goal is to keep improving our service and show that we can continue to sustain this over time so we can drive long-term growth for CSX. With that, I will turn it over to Kevin to discuss our sales and marketing performance.Kevin Boone: Thank you, Jamie. As Joe noted, despite headwinds across many of our markets, the team was able to capitalize on strong year-over-year improvement in service. Importantly, as service has improved, there’s opening up opportunities to discuss new business with our customers where we are seeing in our year-to-date pipeline up 30%. I'm proud of the team and the progress we have made. There remains a lot of work ahead of us as we focus on building our pipeline of growth opportunities. Initiatives including whiteboarding sessions with customers, increasing direct engagement with small and medium-sized shippers, bringing new technology tools to better serve our customers and finally, expanding our reach by leveraging our transload network and collaborating with both with our short-line and Class 1 partners are just a few of the focus areas for the team as we move into the back half of the year.Turning to slide 11. Our strong merchandise performance continued into the second quarter, with revenue increasing 5% even as our fuel surcharge declined substantially on lower diesel prices. This growth was driven by 3% higher volume, compared to last year and a 1% all-in increase in revenue per unit. As we saw in the first quarter, our customers are seeing improved service levels, which is opening up opportunities and encouraging them to bring more of their business to our network. For the quarter, we saw many of the market trends continue from the start of the year. In automotive, we are seeing more consistent production and we've seen our improved service lead to new opportunities and business wins. Minerals benefited from strong construction demand for aggregates in our improving cycle times.And our metals and equipment business continues to be a bright spot, with volumes up across steel, scrap, and equipment. We've been successful in expanding our commercial relationships and translating our service product and to convert new business wins. I'm also pleased that our fertilizer business delivered higher volumes year-over-year, supported by strong domestic shipments of potash and nitrogen. On the other side, chemicals continues to be soft as demand remains challenged across our broad book of business. Forest products. [Technical Difficulty] products faces headwinds in paper and pulpboard. We've also seen some slowdown in export grains for ag and food. For the second-half of the year, we expect to build on the successes we've had to win more wallet share of our existing customers, while continuing our efforts to attract new customers away from truck.We expect auto, minerals, and metals markets to remain supportive and will be important contributors to volume growth over the remainder of 2023. We look for destocking activity to wind down in many of the markets we serve including chemicals, so timing there remains uncertain. What's most important is that our team is not sitting back and waiting for markets to turn. We are pushing forward with our own initiatives. Our business development group has been making great progress with our Select Site program and expanding our pipeline of partner projects. And we're strategically investing in developing new locations, providing additional transloading capabilities and investing in railcars to drive more business to CSX. Turning to slide 12. Second quarter coal revenue decreased 2% as a 4% volume gain was more than offset by a 6% decline in revenue per unit, driven by lower export coal benchmarks.We saw continued growth in export volumes due to beneficial cycle times, good performance at our Curtis Bay terminal and a push among our coal customers to move more tonnage into the overseas markets. Domestic utility shipments declined as we expected, as low natural gas prices weighed on coal burn. Though demand in Southern utilities remained favorable. We expect momentum in the export markets to continue over the second-half of the year, with CSX volume supported by new mine capacity and coal producers making opportunistic shipments into the international markets. On the domestic side, we see tougher comparisons versus a strong second-half last year. But the hot summer is providing a helpful tailwind early in this quarter and just recently we are seeing a few customers looking for additional sets.Of course, as international pricing benchmarks have eased from last year's record highs, we will see an impact on our revenue per unit into the third quarter. Most of our exports are met coal with the benchmark around $225 per metric ton. We anticipate our third quarter all-in coal RPU will sequentially decline by a mid-teens percentage. Current international benchmark prices remained very healthy and supportive of strong production into the back half of the year. Now turning to slide 13. Second quarter revenue decreased by 18% due to a 10% decline in volume and a 9% reduction in revenue per unit, reflecting the effect of lower fuel surcharge. As in the first quarter, international intermodal drove most of the volume decrease with the business seeing headwinds from declining imports and inventory destocking.Volumes in the domestic business showed a much more modest decline [Technical Difficulty] by the good progress we continue to make with rail conversions and the team's efforts to identify new markets and lanes. Our best-in-class Eastern service product continues to position us for truck conversion in the quarters and years ahead. Looking forward, while we and our customers are still looking for a rebound in the international business, pressing ahead with our own initiatives, we brought on a new shipper late in the quarter that recognize the value of our strong service product. And we're seeing other opportunities in new lanes, growing activity at inland ports. Domestically, we're encouraged by many opportunities to work more closely with all of our Class 1 partners to target truck conversion.Just one example of this is the agreement we reached with CPKC just a few weeks ago to create a new interchange in Alabama that will link our customers across the Southeast with key markets in Texas and Mexico. We think there's much more opportunities for new creative partnerships that can help bring even more business to all of the railroads. And we remain very excited about the opportunities ahead of us. Now I will turn it over to Sean to discuss the financials.See also 25 Most Needed Jobs in US and 15 Most Consumed Crops in the World.Sean Pelkey: Thank you, Kevin, and good afternoon. Looking at the second quarter results, revenue was lower by 3% or $116 million, declines in fuel recovery, other revenue, and benchmark-based export coal pricing [Technical Difficulty] benefits from strong merchandise pricing, as well as volume growth across merchandise and export coal. Operating income was down 13% to $1.5 billion, reflecting a $122 million headwind from cycling a gain on the Virginia property transaction. I'll discuss the expense line items in more detail on the next slide. Interest and other expense was $25 million higher compared to the prior year, and income tax expense decreased by $64 million on lower pre-tax earnings. As a result, EPS fell by $0.05, reflecting a $0.04 impact of lower property gains.Let's now turn to the next slide and take a closer look at expenses. Total second quarter expense increased $105 million. Lower fuel price was largely offset by the prior year Virginia gain. While network efficiency improvements resulted in over $20 million of cost savings across labor, PS&amp;O, and rents, it was not enough to overcome more than $100 million of headwinds from inflation and higher depreciation. Turning to the individual line items. Labor and fringe expense increased $57 million, impacted by inflation and increased headcount. Importantly, service improvements are helping us get more employees home sooner, with overtime ratios down nearly 10% and a significant reduction in the number of employees tuck away from home over 24 hours.As a reminder mid-year union wage rates stepped-up by 4% on July 1, and will be reflected in our second half cost per employee. PS&amp;O expense increased $37 million with inflation and higher repair and maintenance expense, partly offset by savings in intermodal operations and cycling of costs related to the Pan Am acquisition. While we are overhauling and rebuilding more engines than last year, locomotive efficiency was 4% improved in the quarter. Depreciation was up $33 million as a result of last year's equipment study, as well as a larger asset base. Fuel cost was down $134 million driven by lower gallon price. Equipment and rents was $5 million favorable, reflecting strong improvement in car cycle times with merchandise cycles 13% better than last year.These efficiency gains more than offset costs from inflation and higher volume, particularly in the automotive market. Finally, as discussed, property gains were $117 million unfavorable in the quarter. Now turning to cash flow and distributions on slide 17. After fully funding infrastructure investments and strategic projects, CSX has generated $1.5 billion of free cash flow year-to-date. This has supported $2.4 billion in shareholder returns, including over $1.9 billion in share repurchases and $450 million of dividends. We were encouraged to receive recent news of a credit ratings upgrade. This move reflects the strong core cash-generating power of CSX through economic cycles, which supports our ongoing commitment to investing in the business and our balanced opportunistic approach to capital return.Economic profit, as measured by CSX cash earnings, is up over $80 million year-to-date. While intermodal storage revenue declines in export coal headwinds we’ll have a more significant year-over-year impact in the second-half, we remain committed to cultivating and investing in return-seeking projects that see the pipeline of mid and long-term growth and efficiency gains. With that, let me turn it back to Joe for his closing remarks.Joe Hinrichs: Alright. Thank you, Sean. Now let's conclude with some comments on our outlook for 2023 as shown on slide 19. First, we reiterate our expectation that revenue ton miles will grow in the low-single digits for the full-year. We remain very happy with the performance of our merchandise business through the first-half of the year and we look for volumes to be supported by continued strength in automotive, minerals and metals and the successes we've had in the marketplace. We expect full-year coal volumes to be higher, driven by strong demand for export coal. As we noted last quarter, domestic coal shipments will likely soften as demand is impacted by low natural gas prices. For intermodal, as Kevin said earlier, we have seen modest signs of improvement for domestic intermodal activity starting late in the second quarter, but there are no signs yet of a near-term recovery for the international business.We're still benefiting from a favorable pricing environment, though our expectation for $300 million decline in supplemental revenues is unchanged, with most of that year-over-year reduction occurring in the second-half of the year. Lower international met coal benchmark prices will also impact our coal revenue per unit over the remainder of the year. As before, we are making our best efforts to drive efficiency and control costs to offset real inflationary pressures, and we are committed to staying focused on improving service to our customers. And finally, we still estimate capital expenditures at $2.3 billion with a strong focus on innovation and growth. To sum up, I am proud of the progress that the ONE CSX team continues to make. There is no doubt that we face some mixed economic conditions in the near-term.However, there are so many opportunities opening up for us to win share, expand our markets and achieve profitable growth if we remain focused on safety, service, execution and working together. I am very excited about what is ahead for CSX. Thank you, and we'll now take your questions.Matthew Korn: Thank you, Joe. We will now move to our question-and-answer session. In the interest of time and to make sure that everyone has an opportunity, we ask you to all please limit yourselves to one and only one question.

(NASDAQ:ADI) Has Fared Decently But Fundamentals Look Uncertain: What Lies Ahead For The Stock?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analog-devices-inc-nasdaq-adi-140031500.html,1690120831,STORY,['ADI'],"[Analog Devices' (NASDAQ:ADI) stock up by 3.2% over the past month. However, the company's financials look a bit inconsistent and market outcomes are ultimately driven by long-term fundamentals, meaning that the stock could head in either direction. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Analog Devices'  ROE today.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. Check out our latest analysis for Analog Devices How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Analog Devices is:10% = US$3.6b ÷ US$36b (Based on the trailing twelve months to April 2023).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.10 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.A Side By Side comparison of Analog Devices' Earnings Growth And 10% ROEWhen you first look at it, Analog Devices' ROE doesn't look that attractive. A quick further study shows that the company's ROE doesn't compare favorably to the industry average of 16% either. Analog Devices was still able to see a decent net income growth of 18% over the past five years. So, there might be other aspects that are positively influencing the company's earnings growth. Such as - high earnings retention or an efficient management in place.Story continuesNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Analog Devices' reported growth was lower than the industry growth of 35% over the last few years, which is not something we like to see.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if Analog Devices is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.Is Analog Devices Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?While Analog Devices has a three-year median payout ratio of 75% (which means it retains 25% of profits), the company has still seen a fair bit of earnings growth in the past, meaning that its high payout ratio hasn't hampered its ability to grow.Moreover, Analog Devices is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Existing analyst estimates suggest that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 36% over the next three years. The fact that the company's ROE is expected to rise to 15% over the same period is explained by the drop in the payout ratio.SummaryOverall, we have mixed feelings about Analog Devices. Although the company has shown a fair bit of growth in earnings, the reinvestment rate is low. Meaning, the earnings growth number could have been significantly higher had the company been retaining more of its profits and reinvesting that at a higher rate of return. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

95,a11d3df1-4326-3d94-9980-ffdadd7babf2,RF,2023-07-24,Regions Financial's (NYSE:RF) Dividend Will Be Increased To $0.24,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/regions-financials-nyse-rf-dividend-122256303.html,1690114976,STORY,['RF'],"[Regions Financial Corporation (NYSE:RF) has announced that it will be increasing its dividend from last year's comparable payment on the 2nd of October to $0.24. This takes the dividend yield to 4.9%, which shareholders will be pleased with. See our latest analysis for Regions Financial Regions Financial's Dividend Forecasted To Be Well Covered By EarningsWhile it is great to have a strong dividend yield, we should also consider whether the payment is sustainable.Regions Financial has a long history of paying out dividends, with its current track record at a minimum of 10 years. Taking data from its last earnings report, calculating for the company's payout ratio shows 34%, which means that Regions Financial would be able to pay its last dividend without pressure on the balance sheet.Over the next 3 years, EPS is forecast to fall by 1.3%. Fortunately, analysts forecast the future payout ratio to be 41% over the same time horizon, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.historic-dividendRegions Financial Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $0.04 in 2013 to the most recent total annual payment of $0.96. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 37% over that duration. It is good to see that there has been strong dividend growth, and that there haven't been any cuts for a long time.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowInvestors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. Regions Financial has impressed us by growing EPS at 15% per year over the past five years. With a decent amount of growth and a low payout ratio, we think this bodes well for Regions Financial's prospects of growing its dividend payments in the future.Story continuesRegions Financial Looks Like A Great Dividend StockOverall, we think this could be an attractive income stock, and it is only getting better by paying a higher dividend this year. The earnings easily cover the company's distributions, and the company is generating plenty of cash. However, it is worth noting that the earnings are expected to fall over the next year, which may not change the long term outlook, but could affect the dividend payment in the next 12 months. All of these factors considered, we think this has solid potential as a dividend stock.It's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock.

This week’s list includes Nvidia NVDA, Alphabet GOOGL, Meta Platforms META, Snap SNAP and Microsoft MSFT.Will Big Tech Earnings Keep the Rally Going?Tech stocks have been standout performers in the market this year. Driving this momentum has been a combination of favorable developments on the macro front, primarily growing clarity surrounding the Fed’s tightening cycle, optimism about the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) that some view warily as reminders of the late 1990s, and an emerging sense that the worst of Tech spending headwinds is either behind us or close to that stage.With many Tech companies on deck to report June-quarter results this week, the market will be looking for more color on business spending trends, particularly on the cloud side. A big part of Tech’s improved earnings outlook over the last few months has been a function of more effective cost controls that have helped stabilize margins.Improved clarity on top-line trends will help solidify the nascent favorable revisions trend and undergird the group’s impressive stock market momentum.Surrounding it all is the AI debate, where we have already seen direct revenue impact from the likes of Nvidia and some ideas from Microsoft. Still, the innovation’s productivity-enhancing potential appears to be some ways off in the future.That said, the stock market is essentially a discounting system of the future. To the extent that we see viable business models in the days ahead that make use of AI, the so-called large language models beyond Nvidia selling more capable chips, and Microsoft starting to charge for new AI-driven bells and whistles in its Office productivity suite, the stock market excitement would be totally justified.These topics will be front and center in this week’s earnings reports from three of the ‘Big 7 Tech players.’ Alphabet and Microsoft report after the market’s close on Tuesday (7/25), and Instagram parent Meta Platforms reports after the close on Wednesday (7/26). Of the remaining four members of this ‘club,’ Tesla has reported already, and Amazon, Apple, and Nvidia are not reporting this week.Story continuesDigital advertising has historically been seen as core to Alphabet and Meta, but Amazon has steadily become a major player in the space as well. Ad spending likely remained stable in Q2, but it will be interesting to see how these management teams see trends for the current and coming periods, given the macroeconomic uncertainties. This will also be in play in the Snap report, which also reports Q2 results on Tuesday (7/25) this week.All of these companies are big players in the artificial intelligence (AI) space, with the Microsoft vs. Alphabet rivalry particularly intense. With the initial excitement around ChatGPT and other AI applications now behind us, the questions now center around how these AI capabilities will be monetized through new and existing business models. It is reasonable to expect each of these management teams to spend considerable time on their Q2 earnings calls on their AI plan.The ‘Big 7 Tech Players’ as a whole for the current and coming periods in the context of what they achieved in the preceding period is expected to have +14.7% higher earnings in 2023 Q2 on +8% higher revenues. This would follow the -2.5% drop in earnings on +4.9% higher revenues in 2023 Q1.Please note that the +14.7% earnings growth and +8% revenue growth in Q2 today is up from +4% earnings growth and +4.3% revenue growth expected for the group three months back. As with Q2, estimates for full-year 2023 have notably increased as well.The group’s phenomenal boost in 2021 partly reflected pulled forward demand from future periods that was in the process of getting adjusted last year and this year. As you can see above, the expectation is for the group to resume ‘regular/normal’ growth next year, but a lot of that is contingent on how the macroeconomic picture unfolds.Beyond these mega-cap players, total Q2 earnings for the Technology sector as a whole are expected to be down -4.4% from the same period last year on -0.1% lower revenues.This big-picture view of the ‘Big 7 players’ and the sector as a whole shows that the worst of the growth challenge is shifting into the rearview mirror.Please note that the -1.9% earnings decline expected for the sector is less than half of the -4.8% decline expected three months back.The Earnings Big PictureRegular readers of our earnings commentary know that we have consistently been flagging a favorable turn in the revisions trend since the start of 2023 Q2, with earnings estimates stabilizing in the aggregate after consistently coming down for almost a year and actually starting to go up for some key sectors.This combination of favorable macroeconomic developments and optimism about the transformational power of artificial intelligence (AI) appears to be driving market optimism.Q2 is on track to be the third quarter in a row of earnings declines and the first quarter of declining revenues. We should point out here that a big part of the earnings and revenue weakness is due to the Energy sector. Excluding the Energy sector drag, Q2 earnings would be down -2.9% on +3.1% higher revenues. 2023 Q2 will be the 6th consecutive quarter of declining margins for the S&amp;P 500 index.Margins in Q2 are expected to be below the year-earlier level for 12 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with the biggest margin pressure expected to be in the Basic Materials, Construction, Energy, Medical, Conglomerates, Autos, Aerospace, and Tech sectors.On the positive side, the Finance sector is the only one expected to experience significant margin gains, with the Consumer Discretionary and Transportation sectors as distant second and third. Sectors expected to be essentially flat regarding margins relative to 2022 Q2 are Retail, Utilities, and Industrial Products.As noted earlier, the estimate revisions trend has notably stabilized since the start of Q2. In the aggregate, S&amp;P 500 earnings estimates for 2023 have declined -1.2% since the beginning of April but only -0.3% on an ex-Energy basis. Importantly, estimates for sectors like Tech, Construction, Autos, and Transportation have increased in that timeframe.Q2 Earnings ScorecardWe get into the heart of the Q2 earnings season, with more than 650 companies on deck to report results, including 165 S&amp;P 500 members or one-third of the index’s total membership. With results from 89 index members already out through Friday, July 21st, we will have crossed the halfway mark in the Q2 reporting cycle by the end of this week.Total Q2 earnings for the 89 S&amp;P 500 members are up +3.4% from the same period last year on +8.5% higher revenues, with 78.7% beating EPS estimates and 60.7% beating revenue estimates.For a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Q2 Earnings Season Gets Off to a Positive StartWhy Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

Fundamentally, the underlying sector represents a critical need. Recession or not, if you’re in trouble, you’re going to seek some kind of medical help. In many ways, healthcare enterprises benefit from a captive audience.Another major factor bolstering defensive investing in the healthcare industry centers on the aging population. Most notably, you have the baby boomer generation, which represents the largest increase in the U.S. population. Later on, you’re going to have the millennial generation, the oldest of whom hit middle age. Let’s just be real – the older one gets, the more they demand health services.Admittedly, there’s more than a touch of cynicism in this arena. But if you don’t mind this factor, investing in healthcare may be quite lucrative right now.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsKenvue (KVUE)Medicine and healthcare concept - team or group of doctors and nursesSource: Supavadee butradee / Shutterstock.comA consumer health company, Kenvue (NYSE:KVUE) represents a spinoff from industry stalwart Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ). When it comes to healthcare stocks to buy for defensive investing against upcoming market trends, both enterprises make strong arguments. However, I’m going to give the nod to Kenvue for its broad relevancies.To be fair, KVUE arrived with much fanfare but eventually struggled. Since its public market debut, shares fell more than 7%. Nevertheless, with the underlying enterprise offering relevant, popular products in the categories of self-care, skin health, beauty, and essential health, KVUE should eventually rise higher.For example, if the Fed decides to raise interest rates, many companies’ expansionary efforts may dwindle from higher borrowing costs. Further, layoffs may materialize, which would likely spark desperation in the workforce. That might mean a return to the office, which cynically would benefit categories like skin health.Story continuesPlus, pressure in the consumer economy may lead to more instances of self-care (as opposed to clinical care). This too should help KVUE, making it one of the top ideas for investing in healthcare.Novo Nordisk (NVO)Healthcare professional in green scrubs standing with arms crossed.Source: ShutterstockA delicate topic, it’s unavoidable that waistlines are getting bigger, which cynically supports the case of Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) as one of the healthcare stocks to buy. According to Market.us, the global obesity treatment market size reached approximately $5.65 billion last year. By 2032, this segment will soar to a valuation of $15.09 billion. Further, North America presently dominates the arena with a 54% market share.Fundamentally, this framework bolsters Novo Nordisk since obesity-related therapeutics is one of the company’s specialties. Therefore, it’s not surprising that NVO ranks among the top ideas within the healthcare industry. Since the beginning of this year, shares popped up nearly 17%. Over the trailing one-year period, NVO gained nearly 42%.Because of the outperformance, I must say that NVO isn’t exactly cheap. Right now, the market prices shares at a forward multiple of 30.49 times. Nevertheless, the company benefits from a three-year revenue growth rate (per share basis) of 14.9%, above 60.76% of its peers. Also, it’s consistently profitable with a trailing-year net margin of 32.47%.McKesson (MCK)two doctors look over a piece of paper while standing in a hallwaySource: ShutterstockA global leader in healthcare supply chain management solutions, McKesson (NYSE:MCK) also specializes in retail pharmacy, community oncology/specialty care, and healthcare information solutions. Per its corporate profile, McKesson partners with pharmaceutical manufacturers, providers, pharmacies, governments, and other organizations in healthcare to help provide the right medicines, medical products, and healthcare services to the right patients quickly and effectively.Because of its wide reach and relevancy, MCK easily ranks among healthcare stocks for defensive investing. No matter what challenges materialize in the economy, people will always have medical needs, particularly as the population ages. Therefore, while it’s not a blistering winner, it gets the job done in the charts. Since the Jan. opener, MCK moved up over 9%.

And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Alan.Alan Schnitzer: Thank you, Abbe. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today In the face of an historic cat quarter, our top and bottom line results demonstrate the strength of our franchise and the resilience of our business model. This quarter, we reported strong underlying results and investment returns, as well as, net favorable prior-year reserve development, which were essentially offset by an historic level of industry-wide catastrophe losses. There were PCS designated catastrophe events taking place on 88 of the 91 days of the quarter. Despite pre-tax catastrophe losses of $1.5 billion, we generated slightly positive core income for the quarter. We are very pleased with the underlying fundamentals of our business.Pre-tax underlying underwriting income of $781 million for the quarter was up nearly 40% driven by record net earned premiums of $9.2 billion, and a consolidated underlying combined ratio, which improved 1.7 points to an excellent 91.1%. Earned premiums were higher in all three of our business segments. Underlying profitability in our Business Insurance segment was particularly strong. The underlying combined ratio improved by 3 points to an excellent 89.4%. The underlying combined ratio in our Bond &amp; Specialty business was higher year-over-year, but at 87.8%, still generated a very attractive return. In our Personal Insurance segment, the underlying combined ratio improved by 2 points, reflecting the actions we've taken to improve profitability.25 Cities With Highest Percentage Of African American PopulationCopyright: dolgachov / 123RF Stock PhotoTurning to investments, our high-quality investment portfolio generated net investment income of $594 million after-tax for the quarter, reflecting stronger and reliable returns from our fixed-income portfolio and solid returns from our non-fixed-income portfolio. Given our confidence in the strength of our business, we returned $633 million of excess capital to shareholders during the quarter, including $400 million of share repurchases. Turning to production. Thanks once again to excellent execution by our colleagues in the field, we grew net written premiums by $1.3 billion or 14% to a record $10.3 billion. In Business Insurance, we grew net written premiums by 18% to $5.2 billion. Renewal premium change in the segment was a record-high at 12.8%, driven by renewal rate change, which accelerated 2.5 points sequentially to 7.2%.The renewal premium change we achieved this quarter was broad-based. RPC was double-digit or near double-digit in every line, other than workers' compensation, and it was higher sequentially in every line, including workers' compensation. Even with strong pricing retention, an important indicator of marketplace stability, remained very strong at 88%. New business increased 36% to $671 million, led by the property line. In Bond &amp; Specialty Insurance, record net written premiums were about even with the prior-year quarter. Retention in our management liability business was an excellent 91%, and new business increased 11%. Surety net written premiums were also once again strong. Given the attractive returns, we are very pleased with the strong production results in both of our commercial business segments.The growth we're putting on the books is from geographies, products and distribution partners that we know well. In Personal Insurance, top line growth of 13% was driven by higher pricing. Renewal premium change was 19.2% in our Homeowners and Other business, and increased to a record high 16.1% in our auto business. Another quarter of terrific production across the board positions us well for the rest of the year and into 2024. You'll hear more shortly from Greg, Jeff and Michael about our segment results. Before I turn the call over to Dan, I'd like to spend a few minutes on what Travelers is doing in an important area for us, artificial intelligence. We subscribe to the view that over time the impact of AI across the economy is going to be profound, so is the opportunity for Travelers.With our performance transformed mindset and our disciplined framework for assessing our investment priorities, we've been focused for years on responsibly developing differentiating AI capabilities across our three innovation priorities, extending our lead in risk expertise, providing great experiences for our customers, agents, brokers, and employees, and optimizing productivity and efficiency. Between our colleagues who are dedicated to AI specifically and others in enabling disciplines, we have a very significant number of our employees engaged on the objective of making sure that we're leading when it comes to AI. As we've shared before and as you can see on Slide 23 of the webcast presentation, for some time, we've been steadily increasing our technology spend.This year, we'll spend more than $1.5 billion on technology. As this slide demonstrates, we've also been improving the strategic mix of our tech spend. That includes a meaningful increase in investments to develop require cutting-edge AI capabilities built on modern cloud technology. Importantly, we've done all that while significantly improving our expense ratio. In no small part, thanks to the success of our technology investments. The quantity and quality of data are key differentiators when it comes to AI. For more than a decade, we've been investing in datasets, data quality and data accessibility. Between submissions in our commercial businesses and quotes in PI, we intake millions of business opportunities each year. We also take and adjust and adjudicate millions of claims.As one of the largest risk control organizations in the industry, we provide risk mitigation to our commercial customers, completing more than 100,000 risk control consultations annually. We capture valuable data from virtually all of those interactions. Our data also include decades of curated institutional knowledge in the forms of policies, procedures, guidelines, forensic investigations and so on. All of that creates an excellent foundation for the next iteration of generative AI. In addition to our extensive proprietary data, we've been assembling actionable third-party data for years. In fact, we have more than 2,000 datasets from hundreds of third-parties. All-in, we believe that we have a significant and hard-to-replicate data advantage.Given the competitive advantages that will come from deploying AI across the insurance value chain and the expertise, resources and data required to get there, scale will increasingly be a differentiator in our industry, as well the ability to execute complex initiatives effectively and efficiently. Expertise, resources, data, scale and execution excellence, all favor Travelers. The potential use cases for AI in our industry are many and varied. We pursue very focused opportunities that are consistent with our innovation priorities and will create meaningful and sustainable competitive advantages, all with an eye towards leveraging strategic capabilities across our organization. AI capabilities that we currently have in production span the spectrum from those driving efficiency through automation, to more advanced generative AI and large language models.More advanced models augment various aspects of our underwriting, claim handling, service delivery and other work. We use intelligent process automation broadly throughout our business to handle hundreds of routine workflows. Automation and AI have been meaningful drivers of our expense ratio improvement over the past seven years or so. The key success driver in insurance is segmenting risk as finely as possible, to achieve pricing that is accurately calibrated to the risk. Deep learning models have significantly improved our ability to classify it in segment risk in our flow businesses. For example, in Personal Insurance, we leverage proprietary AI and aerial imagery to assess roof and other site-related conditions at the parcel level. Parcel level risk assessment at scale was practically unimaginable to several years ago.And that type of information is very difficult to obtain from the insured with a reliable degree of accuracy. In our Select Accounts business, we estimate that AI has improved business classification, a critical underwriting input by more than 30%. In our Middle Market business, we've developed a suite of sophisticated AI models, which facilitate targeted cross-selling, supporting our effort to sell more products to more customers. We're also using AI to better understand our customers and their needs. So this improved customer segmentation, we can better align new product development and generate insights that improve the customer experience. Enhancing our industry-leading analytics using machine learning models to deliver sophisticated actuarial insights into loss cost trends and development, which improve our already strong pricing and product monitoring capabilities.On the most advanced end, we're leveraging generative AI in large language models, and we've been doing so for several years. For example, in our Bond &amp; Specialty business, our proprietary large language models have processed hundreds of thousands of broker submissions as we work toward improving intake time from hours to minutes. This will improve our responsiveness to our customers and distribution partners, and contribute to our productivity. In our claim organization, our proprietary large language model ingest legal complaints filed against our insureds and then highlights key liability and coverage issues, assists in routing the cases to the best-suited defense counsel, and provides risk-related insights that can be incorporated back into our underwriting process.We've also developed and are piloting a Travelers claim knowledge assistant, a generative AI tool trained on many thousands of pages of proprietary technical source material that was previously only accessible to thousands of different documents. The model provides claim professionals with the ability to easily access accurate actionable information on technical and procedural claim matters, increasing speed, accuracy, and consistency in various workflows, including in interactions with our customers and distribution partners. So in terms of AI, we're investing with speed and strategic direction, consistent with our stated objective of delivering industry-leading returns. I've only shared some of what's in-flight, and the capabilities that we've developed are in various phases of adoption.The full impact of the capabilities we're developing, and others on our roadmap are still ahead of us. To sum things up, we are very confident in the outlook for our business. We have terrific underlying fundamentals in our commercial businesses, improving underlying results in our personal insurance business, and steadily rising investment returns in our fixed-income portfolio. As you've heard, we're also investing in impactful new capabilities to advance our ambitious innovation agenda. With that momentum and the best talent in the industry, we are well-positioned to continue to deliver meaningful shareholder value over time. And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Dan.See also 25 Most Visited Cities in North America and 17 Best Places to Retire in Europe.Dan Frey: Thank you, Alan. We're pleased to have generated record levels of earned premium this quarter, and an underlying combined ratio of 91.1%, a 170-basis point improvement from last year's strong results. This led to a very strong underlying underwriting gain of $615 million after-tax, up $171 million or 39% from the prior-year quarter. The expense ratio for the second quarter improved 40 basis points from last year to 28.6%, once again, benefiting from the combination of our focus on productivity and efficiency coupled with strong top line growth. As Alan mentioned, the industry experienced a very active cat quarter and our second quarter results include $1.5 billion of pre-tax catastrophe losses, our second largest ever cat amount for a second quarter.As disclosed in the significant events table and our 10-Q, we had six events surpass the $100 million mark in Q2, the most ever for a single quarter since we began disclosing the table in 2013. Turning to prior-year reserve development. We had total net favorable development of $60 million pre-tax. In Business Insurance, net unfavorable PYD of $101 million was the result of better-than-expected loss experienced in workers' comp across a number of accident years being more than offset by an increase in some of our other casualty reserves, as well as, for run-off operations. In Bond &amp; Specialty, net favorable PYD of $119 million was driven by better-than-expected results in management liability and surety. Personal Insurance at $42 million of net favorable PYD, driven by Homeowners and Other.After-tax net investment income of $594 million was in line with the prior-year quarter. Fixed maturity NII was again higher than the prior year quarter, reflecting both the benefit of higher average yields, and higher invested assets. Returns in the non-fixed-income portfolio were solid, but as expected, we're not as strong as the double-digit yield we experienced in the prior-year quarter. With interest rates having moved higher during the second quarter, we are raising our outlook for fixed income NII, including earnings from short-term securities by $35 million after tax for the back half of the year. We now expect approximately $570 million after tax in the third quarter and $595 million after tax in the fourth quarter. New money rates as of June 30th are about 140 basis points higher than what's embedded in the portfolio, so fixed income NII should continue to improve as the portfolio gradually turns over and continues to grow.Turning to capital management. Operating cash flows for the quarter of $1.5 billion were again very strong. All our capital ratios were at or better than target levels, and we ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of approximately $2 billion. In late May, we issued $750 million of 30-year debt in order to maintain a debt-to-capital ratio in line with our target range as our premium volume has continued to grow. Interest rates increased and spreads widened during the quarter, and as a result, our net unrealized investment loss increased from $3.9 billion after tax at March 31st to $4.6 billion after tax at June 30th. As we've discussed in prior quarters, the changes in unrealized investment gains and losses generally do not impact how we manage our investment portfolio.We generally hold fixed-income investments to maturity. The quality of our fixed-income portfolio remains very high and changes in unrealized gains and losses have little impact on our cash flows, statutory surplus or regulatory capital requirements. Adjusted book value per share, which excludes net unrealized investment gains and losses, was $115.45 at quarter-end, up 1% from year-end and up 3% from a year ago. We returned $633 million of capital to our shareholders this quarter, comprising share repurchases of $400 million and dividends of $233 million. We have approximately $6.2 billion of capacity remaining under the share repurchase authorization from our Board of Directors. Since the significant level of cat losses in late June resulted in lower earnings for the quarter than we had anticipated, we expect the level of share repurchases over the back half of the year to be lower than the level of share repurchases in the first half of the year.Turning to the topic of reinsurance, Page 20 of the webcast presentation shows a summary of our July 1st reinsurance placements. While we did see some meaningful price increases on our reinsurance renewals, those increases were broadly in line with the price increases we are obtaining on the direct property premiums we're writing. So there's little or no impact expected on margins. We take another moment to highlight a few items on Page 20. First, we renewed our main cat reinsurance program at terms that were generally consistent with the expiring program. Second, we increased the coverage under our Northeast Property treaty by fully placing the $850 million layer above the attachment point of $2.5 billion. A year ago, we placed $750 million of that $850 million layer and the attachment point was $2.25 billion.This treaty remains pretty far out on the tail for us. Finally, as part of our ongoing management of tail risk exposure for the enterprise and in response to inflation-driven growth in insured values in our Personal Insurance property book, we added a new hurricane cat excess of loss reinsurance program, specific to Personal Insurance coastal exposure, providing 50% coverage for the $1 billion layer above an attachment point of $1.75 billion, again far out on the tail. Any margin impact from this new program will be de minimis, given both the size of our PI property book and the level of price increases we are obtaining on that book. To sum up the quarter, our ability to absorb $1.5 billion of pre-tax cat losses and still report slightly positive core income for the quarter is a testament to the overall strength of our franchise, and the underlying fundamentals of our business.Q2 was another quarter of double-digit premium growth, improved underlying profitability, and further improvement in our outlook for fixed-income NII, all of which bodes well for our future returns. With that, I'll turn the call over to Greg for a discussion of Business Insurance.Greg Toczydlowski: Thanks, Dan. Business Insurance produced $402 million of segment income for the second quarter, down from the prior-year quarter, driven by prior-year reserve development and higher cats, as Dan mentioned. Underlying underwriting results continue to be exceptional, with the underlying underwriting income up more than 50% from the prior-year quarter. We're once again particularly pleased with the quarter's underlying combined ratio of 89.4%, which improved by three points from the prior-year quarter. The loss ratio benefited from property losses that were about a 1.5 points better than our expectations for the current year quarter. The loss ratio also improved due to earned pricing. The expense ratio remained strong at 30.1%.Net written premiums increased 18% to a quarterly record of $5.2 billion, driven by renewal premium change of 12.8%, retention of 88% and new business of $671 million, all record highs. Underneath RPC, renewal rate change accelerated sequentially from the first quarter by 2.5 points to 7.2%. We're thrilled with these production results and the superior execution by our field team in the marketplace. In terms of pricing, we're pleased with our response to the persistent environmental headwinds in both the property and liability lines. In each of our product lines, renewal premium change was higher than the first quarter. And beyond pricing, we continue to improve terms and conditions to ensure we're achieving an appropriate risk-reward trade-off on the business we write.As we always say, we execute in a granular manner, deal-by-deal, class-by-class. Into that point, we're thrilled with our execution. Demonstrated by record retention of 88% on our very-high quality book of business and rate that is thoughtfully segmented by return profile. New business, as a percentage of the book, returned to pre-pandemic levels, led by the property line. We're pleased with new business dollars at an all-time high. And as always, when it comes to new business, we remain focused on risk selection, underwriting terms and conditions, and pricing. We're also very pleased with the impact that our strategic investments are having on our production results. As for the individual businesses, in Select, renewal premium change was up 1 point from the first quarter to a strong 10.6%, while retention also remained historically high at 84%.New business increased $30 million or 28% from the prior-year quarter, driven by the continued success of our BOP 2.0 product. In Middle Market, renewal premium change was up more than 2 points sequentially from the first quarter to a historically high 10.5% with renewal rate change increasing sequentially by 1.5 point to 5.9% and continued strong exposure growth. Retention was once again exceptional at 90%, while new business was up 32% from the prior-year quarter, with increases across all account sizes in most markets. To sum up, Business Insurance had another strong quarter and continued to execute on the fundamentals to drive profitable growth. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.Jeff Klenk: Thanks, Greg. Bond &amp; Specialty posted strong top and bottom line results for the quarter. Segment income of $230 million was up slightly from the very strong prior-year quarter. The combined ratio was a terrific 77.1%. The underlying combined ratio was a solid 87.8% for the quarter. A small number of surety losses drove the roughly 4 point increase in the underlying loss ratio year-over-year. As we've said before, surety losses can be a bit lumpy. Even with the incremental losses this quarter, our returns in the surety line remain excellent. Turning to the top line, we delivered record net written premiums this quarter. In domestic management liability, we are pleased that we drove record retention of 91% in the quarter, up 2 points sequentially and 3 points from the second quarter of 2022, while continuing to achieve solid renewal premium change.This result reflects our team's deliberate execution to retain our high-quality book of business in light of the very strong returns. We're also pleased that we increased new business 11% from the prior-year quarter. That's a reflection of the strong franchise value we offer to our customers and distribution partners, and a lot of hard work by our team in the field. Additionally, we are pleased to report record surety net written premiums in the quarter. So both top and bottom line results for Bond &amp; Specialty were once again strong this quarter driven by our continued underwriting and risk management diligence, excellent execution by our field organization, and the benefits from our ongoing strategic investments to extend our market-leading competitive advantages.And now, I will turn the call over to Michael.Michael Klein: Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone In Personal Insurance, the second quarter segment loss of $538 million and a combined ratio of 122% were significantly impacted by catastrophes. While it's not unusual for us to have a loss in the second quarter given it's typically the quarter with the highest weather-related losses, catastrophe losses this quarter for both us and the industry were significantly elevated compared to historical results. Net written premiums for the quarter grew 13%, driven by double-digit renewal premium change in both Domestic Automobile and Homeowners and Other. The underlying combined ratio of 94.1% improved 2 points from the prior-year quarter, reflecting an improvement in the underlying combined ratio in Homeowners and Other, partially offset by an increase in Automobile.In Automobile, the second quarter combined ratio was 108.4% with an underlying combined ratio of 103.5%. The underlying combined ratio increased 1.7 points from the prior-year quarter due to higher severity, driven by increased vehicle replacement and repair costs and a mix-shift from collision-only claims for its claims with bodily injury and third-party property damage, which is more consistent with more cars on the road leading to more multi-car accidents. These increases were partially offset by the growing benefit of earned pricing and a lower expense ratio. While some of the inflationary pressures in auto are beginning to show signs of easing, they are not improving at the rate we expected. Consequently, we're not yet achieving the written rate adequacy levels, we had anticipated.While we continue to make progress and expect to get there in the coming quarters, exactly when will depend on a few things. For example, how quickly inflation comes down, how quickly we can get additional rate through the regulatory process and our actual loss experience. In Homeowners and Other, the second quarter combined ratio of 135.1%, increased 17.1 points, due to significantly higher catastrophe losses. The underlying combined ratio of 85.2% improved 5.1 points, primarily driven by non-cat weather losses that were lower than in the prior-year quarter. Non-cat weather losses in the quarter were also better than our expectation, as more events reached our catastrophe threshold. Turning to production, our results continue to demonstrate disciplined market execution of rate and non-rate actions in both lines as we remain focused on improving profitability and managing growth in response to continued inflationary pressures in the environment.In Domestic Automobile, renewal premium change of 16.1% increased 2.1 points from the first quarter of 2023. We expect renewal premium change to continue to increase from current levels throughout the second half of this year. In Domestic Homeowners and Other, renewal premium change of 19.2% was broadly consistent with the first quarter. We expect renewal premium change to remain in the high-teens through the end of the year. Before I conclude, I just want to take a minute to thank our claim partners for responding to our customers when it matters most. Behind the aggregate statistics of catastrophe events occurring virtually every day of the quarter, our tens of thousands of individual customers whose homes and vehicles are damaged or destroyed and whose lives are disrupted.In each case, our claim team is responding, helping those customers get their homes repaired and their cars back on the road, continuing to deliver high-quality customer service despite the high volume of clients. Both the loss environment and the personal insurance marketplace remain dynamic. We continue to respond to the changing environment with a steadfast focus on execution quickly addressing changes in loss experience with targeted pricing, underwriting and other non-rate actions, remaining disciplined in writing business that is consistent with our appetite and making thoughtful and impactful investments for the future. We're confident that the actions we've taken and we'll continue to take will improve profitability as we move through 2023 and beyond.Now, I will turn the call back over to Abbe.Abbe Goldstein: Thanks, Michael. We're ready to open up for questions.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"
111,1cf178dc-9e81-3727-a61a-3520af460af0,CMI,2023-07-24,Those who invested in Cummins (NYSE:CMI) five years ago are up 114%,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/those-invested-cummins-nyse-cmi-130034771.html,1690117234,STORY,['CMI'],"[Generally speaking the aim of active stock picking is to find companies that provide returns that are superior to the market average. And while active stock picking involves risks (and requires diversification) it can also provide excess returns. For example, the Cummins Inc. (NYSE:CMI) share price is up 86% in the last 5 years, clearly besting the market return of around 53% (ignoring dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 30% in the last year , including dividends .With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. View our latest analysis for Cummins While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During five years of share price growth, Cummins achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 26% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 13% average annual increase in the share price. Therefore, it seems the market has become relatively pessimistic about the company.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe're pleased to report that the CEO is remunerated more modestly than most CEOs at similarly capitalized companies. But while CEO remuneration is always worth checking, the really important question is whether the company can grow earnings going forward. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Cummins' earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, Cummins' TSR for the last 5 years was 114%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that Cummins shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 30% over the last year. Of course, that includes the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 16% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Cummins better, we need to consider many other factors.

But more than that, you probably want to see it rise more than the market average. Unfortunately for shareholders, while the Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) share price is up 16% in the last five years, that's less than the market return. Zooming in, the stock is actually down 0.8% in the last year.Let's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns. Check out our latest analysis for Colgate-Palmolive There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During five years of share price growth, Colgate-Palmolive actually saw its EPS drop 4.1% per year.Since EPS is down a bit, and the share price is up, it's probably that the market previously had some concerns about the company, but the reality has been better than feared. Having said that, if the EPS falls continue we'd be surprised to see a sustained increase in share price.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthBefore buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Colgate-Palmolive's TSR for the last 5 years was 31%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveColgate-Palmolive provided a TSR of 1.7% over the last twelve months. But that return falls short of the market. If we look back over five years, the returns are even better, coming in at 6% per year for five years. It's quite possible the business continues to execute with prowess, even as the share price gains are slowing. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Colgate-Palmolive better, we need to consider many other factors. Even so, be aware that  Colgate-Palmolive is showing  3 warning signs in our investment analysis , you should know about...Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

117,2c6054cc-b535-35ea-ae29-beb937685c98,CL,2023-07-24,7 Safe Stocks to Buy as Fed Gears Up for Disinflation,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-safe-stocks-buy-fed-041513176.html,1689653713,STORY,"['PGR', 'DTE', 'ABM', 'COST', 'CL', 'MRK']","[While the Federal Reserve aggressively raised the benchmark interest rate to tame historically high inflation, much evidence indicates that the central bank hasn’t done enough, thus bolstering the case for safe stocks for investing during disinflation. Fundamentally, the Fed’s goal will be to facilitate a gentle deceleration of prices without sparking a recession.However, the initiative will be easier said than done. While the latest jobs report came in below economists’ expectations, the unemployment rate declined while wage growth month-to-month stabilized at a robust pace. Plus, with the average work week increasing, the Federal Reserve impact may cynically benefit defensive stocks.As I discussed in my interview with CGTN America anchor Phillip Yin, the central bank is on the right track but it needs to rein in a culture of big government accommodation. That’s going to be painful and it could lead to a recession. Therefore, you may be better off following stock market trends with these safe and boring ideas.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsColgate (CL)man's hand holding wads of cash. stocks to buy. Stocks With 1000% UpsideSource: Vova Shevchuk / Shutterstock.comFundamentally, the narrative for Colgate (NYSE:CL) representing one of the safe stocks for investing during disinflation centers on everyday demand. Almost certainly, people will brush their teeth every day, irrespective of market conditions. Not only that, Colgate’s oral health products help consumers conduct do-it-yourself healthcare.Now, let me be 100% clear: I’m in no way making any kind of advice, neither dental nor financial nor anything really. However, The Washington Post mentioned that many folks struggled with returning to the dentist’s office following the Covid-19 quarantines. Should an economic crisis hit, it’s not unreasonable to assume households will stock up on Colgate products and save money on their dental trips.Financially, Colgate isn’t particularly remarkable. But based on the upcoming Federal Reserve impact, investors should take confidence in the company’s consistent profitability. Also, as investment data aggregator Gurufocus points out, Colgate’s trailing year net margin clocks in at 8.71%, better than 77.72% of its peers.Story continuesCostco (COST)Man holding stacks of money. Unknown Millionaire-Maker cryptosSource: Epic Cure / ShutterstockOrdinarily, Costco (NASDAQ:COST) makes a strong fundamental case for rising inflation. After all, the membership-only big-box retailer incentivizes bulk purchases. However, I believe it also makes a strong case for stock market trends associated with disinflation or even outright deflation. How so? Well, the company is simply much more resilient (based on its core user base) than other retailers.I don’t want to get into all the consumer demographic details between Costco and its competitors. But just do the research yourself, starting with this Business Insider article. The same resource also conducts research on Costco’s rivals. And you can easily come away with the reality that Costco shoppers are younger, wealthier, and probably more educated.Again, I’m not trying to stir up big-box rivalries ala Yankees versus Red Sox. However, when faced with selecting defensive stocks that are more appropriate for investing during disinflation, you’re going to want to align with the more resilient ideas.Merck (MRK)A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.Source: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.comAs a pharmaceutical giant, Merck (NYSE:MRK) makes an excellent case for safe stocks to buy for investing during disinflation. When it comes to healthcare, the sector offers a robust defensive framework because of critical needs. Should you face medical-related problems, you’re going to get professional help, recession, or no recession.Also, Merck’s Keytruda – a humanized antibody used in cancer immunotherapy – represents not only the company’s top product but also one of the best-selling drugs in the world, according to Statista. Keytruda generated nearly $21 billion in sales last year. Based on data from McKinsey &amp; Company, global oncology therapeutics sales are forecasted to hit $250 billion by 2024. Thus, MRK enjoys a massive total addressable market.Financially, the company unsurprisingly benefits from consistently robust long-term revenue and EBITDA growth. As well, it benefits from consistent profitability year in, and year out. Its net margin stands at 22.52%, above 91.22% of the competition. Thus, it’s a great idea for defensive stocks amid the tides of disinflation.Progressive (PGR)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar bills. Bank stocksSource: shutterstock.com/CC7There are safe stocks and then there is Progressive (NYSE:PGR). From an outright financial perspective, I wouldn’t necessarily classify PGR as “safe.” Without context, some might argue Progressive is rather risky, particularly with its less-robust balance sheet. Also, let’s face the harsh reality of the company’s soft second-quarter earnings report. On the day of the disclosure, shares fell more than 13%. Ouch.Notably, Progressive stated that “…it experienced unfavorable prior accident years reserve development of $137.8 million tied mostly to increases from actuarial reserve reviews in its personal auto products.” In the short term, PGR seems rough. However, against a longer-term framework, the company benefits from a captive audience.Most states in the U.S. require auto insurance. And among the very few that let the issue slide, it’s just stupid not to have coverage. However, you may have noticed that folks have become nuts since the pandemic. Based on real reporting, it’s not just your anecdotal observations: roadways are becoming more dangerous. Thus, Progressive just makes a lot of sense ahead of the possible Federal Reserve impact.Waste Management (WM)tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comOne of the “cheat codes” in the market, if you’re facing any kind of market ambiguity but want to stay in the equities space, go with Waste Management (NYSE:WM). Let’s just start with its massive, unparalleled moat. As a provider of the namesake service, only a few enterprises have the capability of offering it. Go ahead and try to get a permit for a landfill and see how far you get.Just as critically, Waste Management benefits simultaneously from a natural monopoly and a captive audience. First, enterprises just can’t wake up one day and compete with WM. Second, no matter how advanced we become as a society, we will always produce rubbish. Indeed, it’s quite possible that because of innovations such as e-commerce, folks collectively are producing more trash.Of course, that trash has to go somewhere. It’s a dirty job but because of it, it’s also essentially recession-proof. Sure, with a forward earnings premium of nearly 28 times, I’m not going to say WM is cheap. However, with its robust sales growth and consistent profitability, it’s one of the top defensive stocks to buy.ABM Industries (ABM)Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words ""buy"" and ""sell"" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image. Best Speculative StocksSource: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.comBilled as a facility management provider, ABM Industries (NYSE:ABM) originally was founded in 1909 as a single-person window-washing business. Today, the company offers various solutions, including facilities engineering, parking, and transportation, electrical and janitorial services, among many others. Of course, one of the main challenges for ABM being one of the safe stocks to buy centers on the work-from-home narrative.With remote operations becoming so popular, commercial real estate faces a reckoning, imposing a cloud over ABM. However, investors should consider two factors. First, the issue of time theft has become a major conflict source for employers. Second, the disinflationary ambiance of the potential Federal Reserve impact swings the power pendulum back to hiring companies. In my view, working from home will soon come to an end.If so, such a circumstance would make ABM a viable idea regarding upcoming stock market trends. On a more objective note, ABM trades at a forward multiple of 11.1x. This contrasts with the sector median of 15x.DTE Energy (DTE)A businessman ripping his shirt off to reveal an upward green arrow with the word buy on it underneathSource: ImageFlow/Shutterstock.comBased in Detroit, Michigan, DTE Energy (NYSE:DTE) is a diversified energy company involved in the development and management of energy-related businesses and services nationwide. Per its corporate profile, DTE’s operating units include an electric company serving 2.2 million customers in Southeast Michigan and a natural gas company serving 1.3 million customers in Michigan.Fundamentally, DTE represents one of the safe stocks to buy ahead of possible disinflation because utilities carry natural monopolies. Because of the steep barrier to entry, would-be competitors don’t even try. As well, DTE also benefits from a captive audience. Again, even if a recession materializes, people have to do whatever it takes to pay their utility bills. Not doing so is basically like giving up.Financially, investors must exercise patience with DTE as utilities don’t exactly print the most sterling financial metrics. For example, DTE’s balance sheet stability could use some work. However, the company prints a strong revenue growth rate. And as you might expect, the utility is consistently profitable.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

In connection with the transaction, PGIM will retain an investment mandate related to a portion of the assets supporting the block.Story continuesThe transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2023, subject to regulatory approval, including the Bermuda Monetary Authority. Upon closing, Prudential anticipates an increase in after-tax annual adjusted operating income of approximately $55 million, plus amortization of the cost or benefit of reinsurance, which is currently expected to be accretive to earnings, but will be finalized at closing.3Wells Fargo Securities, LLC served as exclusive financial advisor, and Willkie Farr &amp; Gallagher LLP served as legal counsel to Prudential for the transaction.Mayer Brown LLP served as legal counsel to Somerset Re for the transaction, and RBC Capital Markets advised Somerset Re.1 Proceeds include approximately $425 million of capital that supports the block. Proceeds are subject to customary adjustments at closing.2 Prudential will retain responsibility for the ongoing relationships with mortality reinsurance providers.3 As a result of the transaction, we expect to incur one-time expenses of approximately $65 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, primarily due to the extinguishment of certain financing facilities.About Prudential Financial, Inc.Prudential Financial, Inc.

There can be no assurance that future developments affecting Prudential Financial, Inc. and its subsidiaries will be those anticipated by management. These forward-looking statements are not a guarantee of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties, and there are certain important factors that could cause actual results to differ, possibly materially, from expectations or estimates reflected in such forward-looking statements. Actual proceeds may differ from what Prudential currently expects due to adjustments at closing. Certain important factors that could cause actual results to differ, possibly materially, from expectations or estimates reflected in such forward-looking statements can be found in the ""Risk Factors"" and ""Forward-Looking Statements"" sections included in Prudential’s Annual Report on Form 10-K. Prudential does not undertake to update any particular forward-looking statement included in this document.Prudential Non-GAAP MeasuresThis release includes a reference to adjusted operating income. Adjusted operating income is a non-GAAP measure used by Prudential to evaluate segment performance and to allocate resources. Adjusted operating income excludes ""Realized investment gains (losses), net, and related charges and adjustments."" A significant element of realized investment gains and losses are impairments and credit-related and interest rate-related gains and losses. Impairments and losses from sales of credit-impaired securities, the timing of which depends largely on market credit cycles, can vary considerably across periods. The timing of other sales that would result in gains or losses, such as interest rate-related gains or losses, is largely subject to our discretion and influenced by market opportunities as well as our tax and capital profile.Realized investment gains (losses) within certain businesses for which such gains (losses) are a principal source of earnings, and those associated with terminating hedges of foreign currency earnings and current period yield adjustments, are included in adjusted operating income. Adjusted operating income generally excludes realized investment gains and losses from products that contain embedded derivatives, and from associated derivative portfolios that are part of an asset-liability management program related to the risk of those products. Adjusted operating income also excludes gains and losses from changes in value of certain assets and liabilities relating to foreign currency exchange movements that have been economically hedged or considered part of our capital funding strategies for our international subsidiaries, as well as gains and losses on certain investments that are designated as trading. Adjusted operating income also excludes investment gains and losses on assets supporting experience-rated contractholder liabilities and changes in experience-rated contractholder liabilities due to asset value changes, because these recorded changes in asset and liability values are expected to ultimately accrue to contractholders. Additionally, adjusted operating income excludes the changes in fair value of equity securities that are recorded in net income.Adjusted operating income excludes ""Change in value of market risk benefits, net of related hedging gains (losses),"" which reflects the impact from changes in current market conditions, and market experience updates, reflecting the immediate impacts in current period results from changes in current market conditions on estimates of profitability, which we believe enhances the understanding of underlying performance trends. Adjusted operating income also excludes the results of Divested and Run-off Businesses, which are not relevant to our ongoing operations, and discontinued operations and earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests, each of which is presented as a separate component of net income under GAAP. Additionally, adjusted operating income excludes other items, such as certain components of the consideration for acquisitions, which are recognized as compensation expense over the requisite service periods, and goodwill impairments. Earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests is presented as a separate component of net income under GAAP and excluded from adjusted operating income. The tax effect associated with pre-tax adjusted operating income is based on applicable IRS and foreign tax regulations inclusive of pertinent adjustments.Adjusted operating income does not equate to ""Net income"" as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Adjusted operating income is not a substitute for income determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and our definition of adjusted operating income may differ from that used by other companies. The items above are important to an understanding of our overall results of operations. However, we believe that the presentation of adjusted operating income as we measure it for management purposes enhances the understanding of our results of operations by highlighting the results from ongoing operations and the underlying profitability of our businesses. Trends in the underlying profitability of our businesses can be more clearly identified without the fluctuating effects of the items described above.We believe that our use of this non-GAAP measure helps investors understand and evaluate Prudential’s performance and financial position. The presentation of adjusted operating income as we measure it for management purposes enhances the understanding of the results of operations by highlighting the results from ongoing operations and the underlying profitability of our businesses. Trends in the underlying profitability of our businesses can be more clearly identified without the fluctuating effects of the items described below. However, this non-GAAP measure is not a substitute for net income determined in accordance with GAAP, and the adjustments made to derive this measure is important to an understanding of our overall results of operations and financial position.Due to the inherent difficulty in reliably quantifying future realized investment gains/losses and changes in asset and liability values given their unknown timing and potential significance, we cannot, without unreasonable effort, provide an estimate of expected lost net income, which is the GAAP measure most comparable to adjusted operating income.View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230723518598/en/ContactsMedia: Bill Launder, bill.launder@prudential.com]"

But if you choose individual stocks with prowess, you can make superior returns. For example, the Prudential Financial, Inc. (NYSE:PRU) share price is up 46% in the last three years, clearly besting the market return of around 35% (not including dividends). On the other hand, the returns haven't been quite so good recently, with shareholders up just 4.4% , including dividends .Since the stock has added US$1.2b to its market cap in the past week alone, let's see if underlying performance has been driving long-term returns. See our latest analysis for Prudential Financial There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Over the last three years, Prudential Financial failed to grow earnings per share, which fell 44% (annualized).This means it's unlikely the market is judging the company based on earnings growth. Given this situation, it makes sense to look at other metrics too.Interestingly, the dividend has increased over time; so that may have given the share price a boost. It could be that the company is reaching maturity and dividend investors are buying for the yield.The image below shows how earnings and revenue have tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-and-revenue-growthPrudential Financial is a well known stock, with plenty of analyst coverage, suggesting some visibility into future growth. So we recommend checking out this free report showing consensus forecastsWhat About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for Prudential Financial the TSR over the last 3 years was 70%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectivePrudential Financial provided a TSR of 4.4% over the last twelve months. But that was short of the market average. On the bright side, that's still a gain, and it's actually better than the average return of 4% over half a decade It is possible that returns will improve along with the business fundamentals. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. For example, we've discovered 3 warning signs for Prudential Financial that you should be aware of before investing here.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

(NYSE:PX) insiders have a lot at stake",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/30-ownership-p10-inc-nyse-133333886.html,1690119213,STORY,['PX'],"[Key InsightsSignificant insider control over P10 implies vested interests in company growthA total of 9 investors have a majority stake in the company with 51% ownership Institutions own 25% of P10Every investor in P10, Inc. (NYSE:PX) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are individual insiders with 30% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.With such a notable stake in the company, insiders would be highly incentivised to make value accretive decisions.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of P10, beginning with the chart below. Check out our latest analysis for P10 ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About P10?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.We can see that P10 does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of P10, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthWe note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in P10. 210 Capital LLC is currently the company's largest shareholder with 11% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 7.5% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 7.4% by the third-largest shareholder.We also observed that the top 9 shareholders account for more than half of the share register, with a few smaller shareholders to balance the interests of the larger ones to a certain extent.Story continuesWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of P10The definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our information suggests that insiders maintain a significant holding in P10, Inc.. It has a market capitalization of just US$1.3b, and insiders have US$398m worth of shares in their own names. That's quite significant. It is good to see this level of investment. You can check here to see if those insiders have been buying recently. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 15% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Private Equity OwnershipPrivate equity firms hold a 19% stake in P10. This suggests they can be influential in key policy decisions. Sometimes we see private equity stick around for the long term, but generally speaking they have a shorter investment horizon and -- as the name suggests -- don't invest in public companies much. After some time they may look to sell and redeploy capital elsewhere.Private Company OwnershipWe can see that Private Companies own 12%, of the shares on issue. It might be worth looking deeper into this. If related parties, such as insiders, have an interest in one of these private companies, that should be disclosed in the annual report. Private companies may also have a strategic interest in the company.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

123,91d35122-5252-4be3-9693-4c2d16993402,ORCL,2023-07-24,C3 AI: Why the hype may have gotten out of hand,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/c3-ai-why-the-hype-may-have-gotten-out-of-hand-170005703.html,1690131605,STORY,"['AI', 'RTX', 'PLTR', 'ORCL']","[C3 AI (AI) has been on a tear in the public markets this year, up a staggering 260% year to date. So you might think that Wall Street would be all gung-ho on the artificial intelligence specialty firm headed up by the legendary Tom Siebel, known for founding and selling the software company, Siebel Systems.Not so fast.Despite the soaring stock price and famous CEO-founder, tech analysts have worries about the 14-year-old company that range from the way its executives count customers to its churning of CFOs.But you can also see why the company has a lot of fans. In 2022, when the AI boom kicked off, C3's shares soared, sending the company's market cap careening above $4 billion as bullish investors made the case that the company was indeed an enterprise AI leader. (They do, after all, have that prized ticker, AI.)In fiscal fourth quarter 2023, C3 generated $72.4 million, primarily from subscription revenue, and reported a GAAP net loss per share of $0.58.So who's right? Is C3 a rising star or a supernova? Or something in between? Yahoo Finance asked analysts and short-sellers on both sides to weigh in.The bear caseC3's massive climb has left some analysts and short-sellers wondering if the stock has gotten too hot to handle. The list of concerns includes worries about the size of C3's customer base, CFO turnover, and how the company's revenue growth stacks up with its competitors.""Subscription revenue has been essentially flat quarterly over the past three or four quarters, and, while they're rapidly improving profitability, they're still burning money,"" said Kingsley Crane, Canaccord Genuity senior analyst. ""So when you look at revenue, growth, and profitability... it's in the bottom quartile for software companies in the public markets.""He added: ""I've said it before, but I think the fundamentals of C3 don't necessarily align with the movement and its price, though that's true for a lot of companies.""Story continuesHow C3 counts its customers, which has changed over time, is particularly vexing.""Get the customer straight,"" said Ben Axler, Spruce Point Capital Management founder and CIO, in a June interview with Yahoo Finance Live. ""We've now seen multiple revisions about what they claim to be their customers. ... If I can't get confidence in the customer [numbers], I can't get confidence in the revenue.""The filing that Axler, who's shorting the stock, is referring to includes a section that states that, in its customer count, the company includes ""products and services including paid trials, one-time, subscription, and professional service offerings.""""There are customer counts and customer entities, and they've restated and changed the way that they've calculated those numbers,"" said Canaccord's Crane. (See chart above.)""For example,"" he continued, ""if they're doing business with Shell in three or four different divisions, that would be, by their count, three to four customers and one customer entity. So the real number of customers — what we typically think of as a customer entity — I would say is likely below 100.""In its latest count, C3 says it has 287 customers.The customer count may indicate another problem: There's just not enough business yet. Sahm Adrangi, Kerrisdale Capital Management founder, who is also shorting the stock, said: ""If this company does have a competitive product, why has customer count remained relatively flat?""Additionally, C3 has seen massive turnover in its CFO role. Since 2019, C3 has had four CFOs, and that's a lot. Since 2019, less than 10% of US public companies with a market cap of $1 billion-plus have had turnover in the CFO position, according to data from Bedrock AI.In fact, in its 14-year history, C3 has had nine CFOs. Though it's not entirely clear why there's been so much turnover, Siebel told Yahoo Finance that it links back to how C3 has evolved and grown.""We started with three people,"" said Siebel, who owns about a 6% stake in C3. ""We went to 10 people. We went to 100 people. We went from a US company to a multi-national company. I can assure you, it's a different type of CFO that you need to run a five-person company than you need to run a thousand-person global company.""The bull caseFirst of all, in case you haven't noticed, C3 is in a hot market.D.A. Davidson senior software analyst Gil Luria said: ""C3 has built a business that should reach $300 million this year around applications of machine learnings and predictive artificial intelligence, which makes the company one of the biggest providers of enterprise AI, and one of the first pure plays in that space.""To Siebel, the prospective size of the AI market is key to C3's growth potential.""Generative AI alone exceeds, I think, $1.2 billion,"" he said. ""If we look at enterprise AI ... even without generative AI, the predictions are a $500 [billion], $600 [billion], $700 billion addressable market opportunity. So this is as big a market opportunity as I think we've seen.""But what about the customers? Davidson's Luria thinks C3's customer count is lagging behind because, as an enterprise company, it has a long sales cycle coupled with long-term contracts.Stanford Graduate School of Business lecturer Robert Siegel, who conducted a 2018 case study on the company, suggests that C3's customer base, which currently includes the US Air Force, Raytheon (RTX), and ConEdison, may indeed be limited — though that's not necessarily a bad thing.""They appear to be strongest with large complex industrial customers who have tremendously large data sets and who are not digitally native,"" said Siegel. ""Does that limit their customer base? Perhaps in the number of customers ... but not necessarily in terms of the size of the opportunities.""Constellation Research founder R “Ray” Wang added that there's yet another way to look at C3's growth.""C3's growth can be looked at in two ways — growth in the public sector and growth in the private sector,"" he said. ""Public sector growth is succeeding because it’s taking market share from competitors like Palantir. Private sector growth has been limited to the forward-looking companies that understand the value.""When it comes to the shifting accounting of these customers, Siebel said: ""The company has evolved over the last 14 years, the customers mix has changed very significantly ... and we've continued to do our best to provide the market as accurately as we can or representation of the number of customers that we have.""A headshot of Siebel, provided by C3.The bottom lineNo matter what the bears say, for the time being, C3's stock seems to be on a relentless climb. How does that line up with the fundamentals?Adrangi makes the case that we should be looking for rates more akin to Palantir's (PLTR) growth metrics. Some numbers to consider: In 2022, Palantir's revenue spiked 24% year over year to $1.91 billion. C3's last fiscal year revenue (2023, reported in May) was $266.8 million, a spike of 5.6% compared to the prior year.But that growth just isn't totally there yet. That said, AI is nascent — and C3 is helping lead the charge. Getting these enterprise AI products to work, for all the bluster we're hearing about them, is exceedingly difficult and requires a lot of elbow grease before the product is fully running and scalable, according to Tola Capital Partner Aaron Fleishman.So are the bulls or bears right? If you have to pick a side, who do you roll with? Ultimately, the decision is based on how much you buy into the AI hype — and Siebel, who has a heck of a track record.For his part at least, the opportunity is clear.""I think that any investor taking a short on the AI thesis in 2023 is like betting against the Internet in 1996,"" Siebel told Yahoo Finance.Allie Garfinkle is a Senior Tech Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

These attractions could prove irresistible, particularly for those plotting a long-term investment course where valuation and investment return assume a towering significance over time. Yet, the landscape is strewn with dividend stocks offering unsustainable distributions, which could trap investors.Hence, the quest for firms with a robust business model that can uphold their distribution over the long haul becomes massive. Investors get a generous safety net when wagering on shares of undervalued enterprises, not to mention a heftier dividend yield. Discovering such stocks may seem akin to looking for a needle in the haystack, but it’s worth the effort.Therefore, investing for income is a strategic play that could offer massive long-term rewards. Investing in undervalued dividend stocks puts you in that sweet spot where prudence meets reward.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsPrudential (PRU)Prudential logoSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comPrudential (NYSE:PRU) is a behemoth in the global financial services realm, continuing to pique investor interest with its tenacity and overall robustness. Despite kicking off 2023 on a rough note, PRU stock is down roughly 8% year-to-date. Much of that has to do with the steep drop in reported revenue and earnings each quarter last year. Nevertheless, its recent record suggests the company continues to navigate choppy waters with its impressively diversified portfolio with aplomb.Prudential made a statement with a net income of $1.46 billion and revenue of $15.9 billion in its first quarter. Evidently, the firm is back in the saddle, ready to ride the bull market again. Despite its resilience, the stock is trading at just 0.6 times forward sales estimates while yielding a mighty impressive dividend yield of almost 5.5%. Moreover, its dividend payout has risen by 14 consecutive years, significantly adding to its allure.Story continuesBank of America (BAC)bank of America stock BAC stockSource: ShutterstockBank of America (NYSE:BAC) is effectively riding the turbulent currents of the financial industry. The firm has showcased an admirable knack for charting a path forward, emerging stronger from every challenge that’s come its way. The Silicon Valley Bank debacle in March could have thrown a lesser entity off course, but BAC stood tall amidst the turmoil. Moreover, it welcomed a torrential influx of $15 billion in deposits as investors sought the sturdy shelter of an established player.BAC delivered spectacular results in the first quarter, blowing past analyst estimates on both lines. The bank’s robust earnings per share growth, a substantial hike in net interest income, and stellar revenue growth across all segments effectively bolster its long-term position. With it managing a whopping $3 trillion in assets and a savory dividend yield of more than 3%, it would be wise to have BAC stock in your portfolios now.Public Storage (PSA)a Public Storage sign in front of a facility of storage buildingsSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comPublic Storage (NYSE:PSA) is a popular real estate investment trust (REIT) specializing in acquiring and maintaining self-storage properties. Its business has done remarkably well despite the crippling economic headwinds. Moreover, the firm has reported funds from operations (FFO) of $4.08 per diluted share in the first quarter, a key measure for REIT investors in examining the dividend’s safety.Its robust $4.08 FFO per share comfortably outpaces its quarterly dividend, indicating strong coverage. Additionally, Public Storage showcased strong growth, with its FFO and revenues soaring by 11.8% and 12.4% year-over-year, respectively, in the first quarter of 2023. This pattern points to a healthy financial trajectory for this REIT. Moreover, its 4-year average dividend yield is at an extraordinary 4.1%, backed by industry-leading growth numbers. Additionally, analysts at TipRanks rated the stock as a Moderate Buy with about a 9% upside from current levels.Northrop Grumman (NOC)Northrop Grumman (NOC) logo on a corporate buildingSource: Kristi Blokhin / Shutterstock.comNorthrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC) is arguably one of the best defense contractors known for its steady and dependable dividend payout. It channeled over 70% of its free cash flow into dividends last year, a testament to its shareholder commitment.The company has effectively surpassed first-quarter expectations despite some turbulence, as evidenced by profit declines across key business units such as mission and aeronautics systems. It reported earnings per share of $5.50 on revenue of $9.3 billion, beating out the forecasted $5.09 on $9.2 billion. Particularly, its space unit offers a ray of optimism, with first-quarter sales skyrocketing 17% year-over-year. Impressively, its revenue eclipses that of the aeronautics division by over 35%.NOC stock is down almost 16% year-to-date, offering a powerful dividend yield of 1.7%, with consecutive dividend growth for almost 20 years.Agnico Eagle Mines (AEM)gold miningSource: ©iStock.com/TomasSeredaRising above cost and workforce challenges, Agnico Eagle Mines (NYSE:AEM) posted robustly in the gold production sphere last year. Hailed as the third-largest gold producer globally, the firm effectively showcased strong cost control and strategic expansion projects, leading to record-breaking margins. Notably, Agnico Eagle has maintained its position in lucrative mining jurisdictions and witnessed significant production growth compared to its peers.Moreover, with an array of projects in the U.S. and Colombia lined up and aimed at augmenting its gold and silver production profile, the firm is set for long-term growth expansion ahead.

That stagnation stems from limited growth in its traditional cereal business, which faces challenges due to changing consumer behaviors and increased competition.The company wants to spin off its cereal business from its other faster-growing consumer products, particularly snack items. The business will split its high-growth sections into a new entity named “Kellanova,” while rebranding its cereal branch as “WK Kellogg Co.”For investors, this could present a strategic opportunity wager on K stock before the split at the end of 2023. Moreover, despite recent challenges, the company has maintained a solid track record of 18 consecutive years of dividend growth, yielding an appealing 3.5%.On the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

(NYSE:YUM)?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/time-consider-buying-yum-brands-110023184.html,1690196423,STORY,['YUM'],"[Today we're going to take a look at the well-established Yum! Brands, Inc. (NYSE:YUM). The company's stock received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NYSE over the last few months, increasing to US$143 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$128. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Yum! Brands' current trading price of US$138 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Yum! Brands’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. Check out our latest analysis for Yum! Brands What's The Opportunity In Yum! Brands?Yum! Brands appears to be overvalued by 39% at the moment, based on my discounted cash flow valuation. The stock is currently priced at US$138 on the market compared to my intrinsic value of $98.89. This means that the buying opportunity has probably disappeared for now. If you like the stock, you may want to keep an eye out for a potential price decline in the future. Given that Yum! Brands’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.What kind of growth will Yum! Brands generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by 47% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Yum! Brands. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? YUM’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading above its fair value. At this current price, shareholders may be asking a different question – should I sell? If you believe YUM should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards its real value can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on YUM for a while, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its true value, which means there’s no upside from mispricing. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for YUM, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.So if you'd like to dive deeper into this stock, it's crucial to consider any risks it's facing.

132,549996f9-d770-39fe-bea2-8038c49f9f42,MLM,2023-07-24,Investing in Martin Marietta Materials (NYSE:MLM) five years ago would have delivered you a 136% gain,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investing-martin-marietta-materials-nyse-104652614.html,1690195612,STORY,['MLM'],"[When you buy a stock there is always a possibility that it could drop 100%. But on the bright side, if you buy shares in a high quality company at the right price, you can gain well over 100%. One great example is Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (NYSE:MLM) which saw its share price drive 127% higher over five years. It's also good to see the share price up 30% over the last quarter.Let's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns. Check out our latest analysis for Martin Marietta Materials To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Over half a decade, Martin Marietta Materials managed to grow its earnings per share at 7.6% a year. This EPS growth is lower than the 18% average annual increase in the share price. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days. And that's hardly shocking given the track record of growth.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Martin Marietta Materials has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? You could check out this free report showing analyst revenue forecasts.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, Martin Marietta Materials' TSR for the last 5 years was 136%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that Martin Marietta Materials shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 40% over one year. That's including the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 19% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Take risks, for example - Martin Marietta Materials has   1 warning sign   we think you should be aware of.Of course Martin Marietta Materials may not be the best stock to buy.

Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.So if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY). Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business. See our latest analysis for Occidental Petroleum Occidental Petroleum's Improving ProfitsOver the last three years, Occidental Petroleum has grown earnings per share (EPS) at as impressive rate from a relatively low point, resulting in a three year percentage growth rate that isn't particularly indicative of expected future performance. As a result, we'll zoom in on growth over the last year, instead. Occidental Petroleum's EPS shot up from US$6.97 to US$9.82; a result that's bound to keep shareholders happy. That's a commendable gain of 41%.Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. The good news is that Occidental Petroleum is growing revenues, and EBIT margins improved by 9.9 percentage points to 35%, over the last year. That's great to see, on both counts.In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. For finer detail, click on the image.earnings-and-revenue-historyYou don't drive with your eyes on the rear-view mirror, so you might be more interested in this free report showing analyst forecasts for Occidental Petroleum's future profits.Story continuesAre Occidental Petroleum Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?We would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$54b company like Occidental Petroleum. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$147m. We note that this amounts to 0.3% of the company, which may be small owing to the sheer size of Occidental Petroleum but it's still worth mentioning. So despite their percentage holding being low, company management still have plenty of reasons to deliver the best outcomes for investors.Is Occidental Petroleum Worth Keeping An Eye On?You can't deny that Occidental Petroleum has grown its earnings per share at a very impressive rate. That's attractive. Further, the high level of insider ownership is impressive and suggests that the management appreciates the EPS growth and has faith in Occidental Petroleum's continuing strength. The growth and insider confidence is looked upon well and so it's worthwhile to investigate further with a view to discern the stock's true value. What about risks? Every company has them, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for Occidental Petroleum   (of which 1 shouldn't be ignored!) you should know about.Although Occidental Petroleum certainly looks good, it may appeal to more investors if insiders were buying up shares.

At the 0.3 mg/kg dose, 60% of patients who responded to axatilimab were still responding at one year ––  Results continue to support axatilimab's promising safety and efficacy profile, and reinforce its potential as a first-in-class CSF-1R monoclonal antibody in chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) –– Syndax and Incyte intend to file a Biologics License Application (BLA) by year-end 2023; full dataset to be presented at a future medical meeting –– Syndax to host conference call today at 8:30 a.m. ET –WALTHAM, Mass. and WILMINGTON, Del., July 24, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Syndax Pharmaceuticals (Nasdaq: SNDX) and Incyte (Nasdaq: INCY) today announced positive topline data from the pivotal AGAVE-201 trial of axatilimab, an anti-CSF-1R antibody, in adult and pediatric patients with chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) following two or more prior lines of therapy.The trial achieved its primary endpoint across all cohorts, with patients treated with axatilimab at doses of 0.3 mg/kg every two weeks, 1.0 mg/kg every two weeks and 3.0 mg/kg every four weeks demonstrating overall response rates (ORR) within the first six months of treatment of 74%, 67% and 50%, respectively (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: [63,83], [55,77] and [39,61], respectively). Responses were achieved across key patient subgroups, including those with prior exposure to ruxolitinib, belumosudil and/or ibrutinib. Based on these results, and pending agreement from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Syndax and Incyte intend to submit a Biologics License Application (BLA) to the FDA by year-end 2023.""Today marks an important day not only for Syndax and Incyte, but, more importantly, for patients suffering from chronic GVHD,"" said Michael A. Metzger, Chief Executive Officer of Syndax. ""Axatilimab is the first investigational chronic GVHD treatment to target inflammation and fibrosis through the inhibition of disease associated macrophages, and the AGAVE-201 data demonstrates the potentially pronounced impact this mechanism, alone or in combination with standard of care therapies already available for the management of this disease, may have on patients suffering from chronic GVHD. These results underscore our belief that axatilimab could provide a valuable and highly differentiated therapeutic option for this devastating disease. We look forward to working with our partners at Incyte as we move axatilimab towards regulatory filing. On behalf of the entire Syndax team, I would like to thank the patients, their caregivers and the investigators who made this trial possible.""Story continues""The results from the AGAVE-201 study are extremely compelling and underscore the potential benefits axatilimab may offer appropriate patients facing the serious complications associated with chronic GVHD,"" said Steven Stein, M.D., Chief Medical Officer of Incyte. ""At Incyte, we remain committed to advancing our research and understanding of this complex disease and will work closely with Syndax and regulatory authorities to bring this innovative medicine to chronic GVHD patients.""The AGAVE-201 pivotal study enrolled a total of 241 patients across 121 sites in 16 countries. Patients enrolled in the trial had received a median of four prior systemic therapies with 74% having previously received ruxolitinib, 23% having previously received belumosudil and 31% having previously received ibrutinib. 54% of these patients had at least four organs involved at baseline including 45% with lung involvement.Among responders treated with 0.3 mg/kg of axatilimab, 60% of patients maintained a response at 12 months (measured from first response to new systemic therapy or death, based on the Kaplan Meier estimate). The median duration of response in this population has not been reached. Additionally, in the 0.3 mg/kg group, 55% of patients experienced a clinically meaningful improvement in symptoms, as measured by at least a seven-point decrease in the modified Lee chronic GVHD Symptom Scale score.The most common adverse events were consistent with the on-target effects of CSF-1R inhibition and with what was previously observed with axatilimab treatment. In the overall population, adverse events in greater than 20% of patients include an increase in aspartate aminotransferase, blood creatine phosphokinase, lipase, blood lactate dehydrogenase, alanine aminotransferase and fatigue (n=239). Serious adverse events in the overall population occurred in 101 (42.3%) patients, with 37 (15.5%) patients experiencing adverse events leading to discontinuation of study treatment. In the 0.3 mg/kg dose group (n=79), fatigue was the only serious adverse event that occurred in greater than 20% of patients. Serious adverse events in the 0.3 mg/kg group occurred in 30 (38%) patients, with five (6.3%) patients experiencing adverse events leading to discontinuation of study treatment.""Chronic GVHD is a very common complication post allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant that can have profound effects on patient medical burden and quality of life. More effective treatment options for this significant complication are desperately needed,"" said Carrie Kitko, M.D., Medical Director of the Pediatric Stem Cell Transplant Program at the Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center. ""I am highly encouraged by these data which demonstrate robust responses in a heavily pre-treated patient population. These findings further support that axatilimab has the potential to provide a clinically meaningful response for patients suffering from this morbid condition.""Conference Call and WebcastSyndax will host a conference call and webcast to discuss the results of the Phase 2 AGAVE-201 trial today, July 24, 2023 at 8:30 a.m. ET.The live webcast may be accessed through the Events &amp; Presentations page in the Investors section of the Company's website.

Chronic GVHD is estimated to develop in approximately 40% of transplant recipients, and affects approximately 14,000 patients in the U.S.1,2. Chronic GVHD typically manifests across multiple organ systems, with skin and mucosa being commonly involved, and is characterized by the development of fibrotic tissue3.About AxatilimabAxatilimab is an investigational monoclonal antibody that targets colony stimulating factor-1 receptor, or CSF-1R, a cell surface protein thought to control the survival and function of monocytes and macrophages. In pre-clinical models, inhibition of signaling through the CSF-1 receptor has been shown to reduce the number of disease-mediating macrophages along with their monocyte precursors, which has been shown to play a key role in the fibrotic disease process underlying diseases such as chronic GVHD and IPF. Phase 1/2 data of Axatilimab in chronic GVHD demonstrating its broad activity and tolerability was last presented at the 63rd American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting and data was published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology.  Axatilimab was granted Orphan Drug Designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of patients with chronic GVHD and IPF. In September 2021, Syndax and Incyte entered into an exclusive worldwide co-development and co-commercialization license agreement for axatilimab. Axatilimab is being developed under an exclusive worldwide license from UCB entered into between Syndax and UCB in 2016.About AGAVE-201The global Phase 2 AGAVE-201 dose-ranging trial evaluated the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of axatilimab in 241 adult and pediatric patients with recurrent or refractory active chronic GVHD whose disease had progressed after two prior therapies. Patients were randomized to one of three treatment groups that investigated a distinct dose of axatilimab administered at 0.3 mg/kg every two weeks, 1 mg/kg every two weeks or 3 mg/kg every four weeks. The trial's primary endpoint is the proportion of patients in each dose group who achieved an objective response as defined by 2014 NIH Consensus Criteria for chronic GVHD by cycle 7 day 1. Secondary endpoints include duration of response, percent reduction in daily steroids dose, organ specific response rates and validated quality-of-life assessments using the Modified Lee Symptom Scale.For more information about AGAVE-201, visit https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04710576.About Syndax Pharmaceuticals, Inc.Syndax Pharmaceuticals is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing an innovative pipeline of cancer therapies.

138,45a70866-d664-307d-a3ef-fd18da69012e,GE,2023-07-24,CEO of J&J spinoff Kenvue says big companies can lose focus: ‘By definition you are little more remote from where the action is’,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ceo-j-j-spinoff-kenvue-052018942.html,1690176018,STORY,"['KVUE', 'JNJ', 'GE']","[Good morning.I spoke Friday with one of the newest members of the Fortune 500 club—Thibaut Mongon, CEO of Kenvue, which spun off from Johnson &amp; Johnson in May. The company generated about $15 billion in sales last year, from popular brands like Tylenol, Listerine, Neutrogena, and Band-Aid, which would have landed it around No. 275 on last year’s 500 list. (Kenvue spun off largely free of the liabilities from lawsuits involving baby powder, which stayed with the mothership.)Mongon called it the “assignment of a lifetime"" to take this portfolio of iconic brands and write the next chapter of consumer health. I asked the 20-year J&amp;J veteran what he could do as an independent company that he couldn’t do at J&amp;J. His answer:“I would say two things. One is this idea of focus. Focusing the organization on one way of winning in our industry, one way to measure our performance, aligning the organization along clear and similar performance indicators—that’s something that is tougher to do in a large corporation, where by definition you are a little more remote from where the action is.“The second is capital allocation. Kenvue has historically generated north of $2 billion of cash flow every year. In the Johnson &amp; Johnson environment, this cash flow was centralized at the corporation level. Now we will be able to make use of this cash flow for the sole benefit of our brands.”That, of course, raises questions about why conglomerates exist in the first place. Last week, I finished reading William Cohan’s book Power Failure about the greatest conglomerate of the last century, General Electric, and how it fell apart in this century. Cohan’s narrative suggests GE in its last two decades was the converse of what Mongon is striving for, suffering from a lack of clear operating goals and some very bad mistakes in capital allocation. Power Failure is a primer in how not to run a large company.Story continuesIn spite of such lessons, however, companies are still more inclined to acquire than to divest, and the corporate deal environment is poised for a 2024 rebound to near record levels. A new survey out this morning of 1,200 global CEOs by EY found that a full 98% of them “expect to actively pursue a strategic transaction in the next 12 months"" (up from 89% in January 2023), with 59% looking to M&amp;A, 47% looking to divest, and 63% looking to enter strategic alliances or joint ventures. Improving technology capabilities—particularly in A.I.—is a leading driver of these transactions, EY says.Other news below. And if you haven’t seen Barbenheimer yet, you are missing out on the summer’s biggest happening.Alan Murray@alansmurrayalan.murray@fortune.comThis story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

Fundamentally, the Fed’s goal will be to facilitate a gentle deceleration of prices without sparking a recession.However, the initiative will be easier said than done. While the latest jobs report came in below economists’ expectations, the unemployment rate declined while wage growth month-to-month stabilized at a robust pace. Plus, with the average work week increasing, the Federal Reserve impact may cynically benefit defensive stocks.As I discussed in my interview with CGTN America anchor Phillip Yin, the central bank is on the right track but it needs to rein in a culture of big government accommodation. That’s going to be painful and it could lead to a recession. Therefore, you may be better off following stock market trends with these safe and boring ideas.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsColgate (CL)man's hand holding wads of cash. stocks to buy. Stocks With 1000% UpsideSource: Vova Shevchuk / Shutterstock.comFundamentally, the narrative for Colgate (NYSE:CL) representing one of the safe stocks for investing during disinflation centers on everyday demand. Almost certainly, people will brush their teeth every day, irrespective of market conditions. Not only that, Colgate’s oral health products help consumers conduct do-it-yourself healthcare.Now, let me be 100% clear: I’m in no way making any kind of advice, neither dental nor financial nor anything really. However, The Washington Post mentioned that many folks struggled with returning to the dentist’s office following the Covid-19 quarantines. Should an economic crisis hit, it’s not unreasonable to assume households will stock up on Colgate products and save money on their dental trips.Financially, Colgate isn’t particularly remarkable. But based on the upcoming Federal Reserve impact, investors should take confidence in the company’s consistent profitability. Also, as investment data aggregator Gurufocus points out, Colgate’s trailing year net margin clocks in at 8.71%, better than 77.72% of its peers.Story continuesCostco (COST)Man holding stacks of money. Unknown Millionaire-Maker cryptosSource: Epic Cure / ShutterstockOrdinarily, Costco (NASDAQ:COST) makes a strong fundamental case for rising inflation. After all, the membership-only big-box retailer incentivizes bulk purchases. However, I believe it also makes a strong case for stock market trends associated with disinflation or even outright deflation. How so? Well, the company is simply much more resilient (based on its core user base) than other retailers.I don’t want to get into all the consumer demographic details between Costco and its competitors. But just do the research yourself, starting with this Business Insider article. The same resource also conducts research on Costco’s rivals. And you can easily come away with the reality that Costco shoppers are younger, wealthier, and probably more educated.Again, I’m not trying to stir up big-box rivalries ala Yankees versus Red Sox. However, when faced with selecting defensive stocks that are more appropriate for investing during disinflation, you’re going to want to align with the more resilient ideas.Merck (MRK)A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.Source: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.comAs a pharmaceutical giant, Merck (NYSE:MRK) makes an excellent case for safe stocks to buy for investing during disinflation. When it comes to healthcare, the sector offers a robust defensive framework because of critical needs. Should you face medical-related problems, you’re going to get professional help, recession, or no recession.Also, Merck’s Keytruda – a humanized antibody used in cancer immunotherapy – represents not only the company’s top product but also one of the best-selling drugs in the world, according to Statista. Keytruda generated nearly $21 billion in sales last year. Based on data from McKinsey &amp; Company, global oncology therapeutics sales are forecasted to hit $250 billion by 2024. Thus, MRK enjoys a massive total addressable market.Financially, the company unsurprisingly benefits from consistently robust long-term revenue and EBITDA growth. As well, it benefits from consistent profitability year in, and year out. Its net margin stands at 22.52%, above 91.22% of the competition. Thus, it’s a great idea for defensive stocks amid the tides of disinflation.Progressive (PGR)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar bills. Bank stocksSource: shutterstock.com/CC7There are safe stocks and then there is Progressive (NYSE:PGR). From an outright financial perspective, I wouldn’t necessarily classify PGR as “safe.” Without context, some might argue Progressive is rather risky, particularly with its less-robust balance sheet. Also, let’s face the harsh reality of the company’s soft second-quarter earnings report. On the day of the disclosure, shares fell more than 13%. Ouch.Notably, Progressive stated that “…it experienced unfavorable prior accident years reserve development of $137.8 million tied mostly to increases from actuarial reserve reviews in its personal auto products.” In the short term, PGR seems rough. However, against a longer-term framework, the company benefits from a captive audience.Most states in the U.S. require auto insurance. And among the very few that let the issue slide, it’s just stupid not to have coverage. However, you may have noticed that folks have become nuts since the pandemic. Based on real reporting, it’s not just your anecdotal observations: roadways are becoming more dangerous. Thus, Progressive just makes a lot of sense ahead of the possible Federal Reserve impact.Waste Management (WM)tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comOne of the “cheat codes” in the market, if you’re facing any kind of market ambiguity but want to stay in the equities space, go with Waste Management (NYSE:WM). Let’s just start with its massive, unparalleled moat. As a provider of the namesake service, only a few enterprises have the capability of offering it. Go ahead and try to get a permit for a landfill and see how far you get.Just as critically, Waste Management benefits simultaneously from a natural monopoly and a captive audience. First, enterprises just can’t wake up one day and compete with WM. Second, no matter how advanced we become as a society, we will always produce rubbish. Indeed, it’s quite possible that because of innovations such as e-commerce, folks collectively are producing more trash.Of course, that trash has to go somewhere. It’s a dirty job but because of it, it’s also essentially recession-proof. Sure, with a forward earnings premium of nearly 28 times, I’m not going to say WM is cheap. However, with its robust sales growth and consistent profitability, it’s one of the top defensive stocks to buy.ABM Industries (ABM)Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words ""buy"" and ""sell"" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image. Best Speculative StocksSource: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.comBilled as a facility management provider, ABM Industries (NYSE:ABM) originally was founded in 1909 as a single-person window-washing business. Today, the company offers various solutions, including facilities engineering, parking, and transportation, electrical and janitorial services, among many others. Of course, one of the main challenges for ABM being one of the safe stocks to buy centers on the work-from-home narrative.With remote operations becoming so popular, commercial real estate faces a reckoning, imposing a cloud over ABM. However, investors should consider two factors. First, the issue of time theft has become a major conflict source for employers. Second, the disinflationary ambiance of the potential Federal Reserve impact swings the power pendulum back to hiring companies. In my view, working from home will soon come to an end.If so, such a circumstance would make ABM a viable idea regarding upcoming stock market trends. On a more objective note, ABM trades at a forward multiple of 11.1x. This contrasts with the sector median of 15x.DTE Energy (DTE)A businessman ripping his shirt off to reveal an upward green arrow with the word buy on it underneathSource: ImageFlow/Shutterstock.comBased in Detroit, Michigan, DTE Energy (NYSE:DTE) is a diversified energy company involved in the development and management of energy-related businesses and services nationwide. Per its corporate profile, DTE’s operating units include an electric company serving 2.2 million customers in Southeast Michigan and a natural gas company serving 1.3 million customers in Michigan.Fundamentally, DTE represents one of the safe stocks to buy ahead of possible disinflation because utilities carry natural monopolies. Because of the steep barrier to entry, would-be competitors don’t even try. As well, DTE also benefits from a captive audience. Again, even if a recession materializes, people have to do whatever it takes to pay their utility bills. Not doing so is basically like giving up.Financially, investors must exercise patience with DTE as utilities don’t exactly print the most sterling financial metrics. For example, DTE’s balance sheet stability could use some work. However, the company prints a strong revenue growth rate. And as you might expect, the utility is consistently profitable.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Now, I will turn the call over to David Auld, our President and CEO.David Auld: Thank you, Jessica, and good morning. I am pleased to also be joined on this call by Mike Murray and Paul Romanowski, our Executive Vice Presidents and Co-Chief Operating Officers; and Bill Wheat, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. For the third quarter, the D.R. Horton team delivered solid results, highlighted by earnings of $3.90 per diluted share. Our consolidated pre-tax income was $1.8 billion on an 11% increase in revenues to $9.7 billion, with a pre-tax profit margin of 18.3%. Our homebuilding return on inventory for the trailing 12 months ended June 30 was 31.8%, and our return on equity for the same period was 24.3%. Despite continued high mortgage rates and inflationary pressures, our net sales orders increased 37% from the prior-year quarter, as the supply of both new home and existing homes at affordable price points is limited and demographics supporting housing demand remain favorable.Story continuesWe are focused on consolidating market share by supplying more homes to meet homebuyer demand, while maximizing the returns and capital efficiency each of -- in each of our communities. With improvements in both labor capacity and availability of materials, our cycle times are decreasing, positioning us to release homes for sale earlier in the construction cycle. We are pleased that we were able to increase our homebuilding starts to 22,900 homes this quarter, which was supported by a 6% sequential increase in our active selling communities. Our homebuilding operating margins are lower than the record high margins we reported last year due to cost inflation and pricing adjustments and incentives we implemented to address homebuyer affordability challenges caused by higher mortgage rates.However, our margins improved sequentially from the March to June quarter as home prices and incentives have stabilized and some reductions in construction costs are now being realized in our homes closed. We are well-positioned with our experienced operators, diverse product offerings, flexible lot supply, and strong capital and liquidity position to produce and sustain consistent returns, growth and cash flow. We will maintain our disciplined approach to investing capital to enhance the long-term value of our company, including returning capital to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases on a consistent basis. Paul?Paul Romanowski: Earnings for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 decreased 16% to $3.90 per diluted share, compared to $4.67 per share in the prior-year quarter. Net income for the quarter decreased 19% to $1.3 billion on consolidated revenues of $9.7 billion. Our third quarter home sales revenues were $8.7 billion on 22,985 homes closed, compared to $8.3 billion on 21,308 homes closed in the prior year. Our average closing price for the quarter was $378,600, flat sequentially and down 3% from the prior-year quarter. Mike?List of Homebuilder Stocks Sorted By Hedge Fund SentimentPhoto by Jens Behrmann on UnsplashMike Murray: Our net sales orders in the third quarter increased 37% to 22,879 homes, and order value increased 26% from the prior year to $8.7 billion. Our cancellation rate for the quarter was 18%, flat sequentially and down from 24% in the prior-year quarter. Our average number of active selling communities was up 6% sequentially and up 8% year-over-year. The average price of net sales orders in the third quarter was $381,100, up 2% sequentially and down 8% from the prior-year quarter. To adjust to changing market conditions and higher mortgage rates over the past year, we increased our use of incentives and reduced the sizes of our homes to provide better affordability to homebuyers. Although home prices and incentives have begun to stabilize, we expect to continue utilizing a higher level of incentives as compared to last year.Our sales volumes can be significantly affected by changes in mortgage rates and other economic factors. However, we will continue to start homes and maintain sufficient inventory to meet sales demand and aggregate market share. Bill?Bill Wheat: Our gross profit margin on home sales revenues in the third quarter was 23.3%, up 170 basis points sequentially from the March quarter. The decrease in our gross margin from March to June reflects a decrease in incentive costs and lower stick-and-brick costs on homes closed during the quarter. On a per square foot basis, home sales revenues and lot costs were both flat sequentially, while stick-and-brick cost per square foot decreased 4%. As Mike mentioned, we continue to -- we expect to continue offering a higher level of incentives as compared to 2022. But due to the recent stabilization in home prices and some reductions in both incentives and construction costs, we expect our homebuilding gross margins to be slightly higher in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter. Jessica?Jessica Hansen: In the third quarter, our homebuilding SG&amp;A expenses increased by 6% from last year and homebuilding SG&amp;A expense as a percentage of revenues was 6.7%, up 10 basis points from the same quarter in the prior year. Fiscal year-to-date homebuilding SG&amp;A was 7.2% of revenues, up 30 basis points from the same period last year as we've maintained the capacity of our platform to grow market share. Paul?Paul Romanowski: We started 22,900 homes in the June quarter, up 15% from the March quarter. We ended the quarter with 43,800 homes in inventory, down 22% from a year ago and flat sequentially. 25,000 of our homes at June 30 were unsold, of which 5,700 were completed. For homes we closed in the third quarter, our construction cycle time decreased by over a month from the second quarter, reflecting improvements in the supply chain. We expect to see a further decrease in our cycle time for homes closed in the fourth quarter. We will continue to [ingest] (ph) our homes and inventory and starts pace based on market conditions. Mike?Mike Murray: Our homebuilding lot position at June 30 consisted of approximately 555,000 lots, of which 25% were owned and 75% were controlled through purchase contracts. 34% of our total owned lots are finished and 53% of our controlled lots are or will be finished when we purchase them. Our capital-efficient and flexible lot portfolio is a key to our strong competitive position. Our third quarter homebuilding investments in lots, land and development totaled $2.2 billion, up 25% from the prior-year quarter and 27% sequentially. Our current quarter investments consisted of $1.2 billion for finished lots, $700 million for land development, and $290 million for land acquisition. Paul?Paul Romanowski: During the quarter, our rental operations generated $162 million of pre-tax income on $667 million of revenues from the sale of 1,754 single-family rental homes and 230 multi-family rental units. Our rental property inventory at June 30 was $3.3 billion, which consisted of $1.9 billion of single-family rental properties and $1.4 billion of multi-family rental properties. Our rental operations are generating significant increases in both revenues and profits this year, as our platform expands across more markets. For the fourth quarter, we expect our rental revenues to be greater than our third quarter and our rental profit margin to be lower than our third quarter. Bill?Bill Wheat: Forestar, our majority-owned residential lot development company, reported total revenues of $369 million for the third quarter on 3,812 lots sold with pre-tax income of $62 million. Forestar's owned and controlled lot position at June 30 was 73,000 lots. 57% of Forestar's owned lots are under contract with or subject to a right of first offer to D.R. Horton. $270 million of our finished lots purchased in the third quarter were from Forestar. Forestar is separately capitalized from D.R. Horton and had more than $780 million of liquidity at quarter-end, with a net debt to capital ratio of 19.1%. Forestar is uniquely positioned to capitalize on the shortage of finished lots in the homebuilding industry and to aggregate significant market share over the next few years with its strong balance sheet, lot supply and relationship with D.R. Horton. Mike?Mike Murray: Financial services earned $94 million of pre-tax income in the third quarter on $229 million of revenues, resulting in a pre-tax profit margin of 41.2%. During the quarter, 99% of our mortgage company's loan originations related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations, and our mortgage company handled the financing for 74% of our buyers. FHA and VA loans accounted for 51% of the mortgage company's volume. Borrowers originating loans with DHI Mortgage this quarter had an average FICO score of 723 and an average loan to value ratio of 88%. First-time homebuyers represented 56% of the closings handled by our mortgage company this quarter. Bill?Bill Wheat: Our balanced capital approach focuses on being disciplined, flexible and opportunistic to support and to sustain an operating platform that produces consistent returns, growth and cash flow. We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet with low leverage and significant liquidity, which provides us with flexibility to adjust to changing market conditions. During the first nine months of the year, our cash provided by homebuilding operations was $2.1 billion and our consolidated cash provided by operations was $2.3 billion. At June 30, we had $4.6 billion of homebuilding liquidity, consisting of $2.6 billion of unrestricted homebuilding cash and $2 billion of available capacity on our homebuilding revolving credit facility.Homebuilding debt at June 30 totaled $2.7 billion, which includes $400 million of senior notes that we redeemed early in July. Our homebuilding leverage was 11.1% at the end of June and homebuilding leverage net of cash was 0.7%. Our consolidated leverage at June 30 was 22%, and consolidated leverage net of cash was 11.2%. At June 30, our stockholders' equity was $21.7 billion, and book value per share was $64.03, up 23% from a year ago. For the trailing 12 months ended June, our return on equity was 24.3%. During the quarter, we paid cash dividends of $85 million and our Board has declared a quarterly dividend at the same level as last quarter to be paid in August. We repurchased 3.1 million shares of common stock for $343 million during the quarter for a total of 7.7 million shares repurchased fiscal year-to-date for $764 million.Jessica?Jessica Hansen: As we look forward, we expect current market conditions to continue with uncertainty regarding mortgage rates, the capital markets and general economic conditions that may significantly impact our business. For the full year, we currently expect to close between 82,800 and 83,300 homes in our homebuilding operations and between 6,500 and 7,000 homes and units in our rental operations. We expect our consolidated revenues for fiscal 2023 to be in a range of $34.7 billion to $35.1 billion. We expect to generate greater than $3 billion of cash flow from operations in fiscal 2023, primarily from our homebuilding operations. We also expect our fiscal 2023 share repurchases to be approximately $1.1 billion, similar to last year.For the fourth quarter, we currently expect to generate consolidated revenues of $9.7 billion to $10.1 billion, and homes closed by our homebuilding operations to be in the range of 22,800 to 23,300 homes. We expect our home sales gross margin in the fourth quarter to be approximately 23.5% to 24%, and homebuilding SG&amp;A as a percentage of revenues in the fourth quarter to be in the range of 6.7% to 6.8%. We anticipate our financial services pre-tax profit margin of around 30% to 35%, and we expect our income tax rate to be approximately 24.5% in the fourth quarter. We will continue to balance our cash flow utilization priorities among our core homebuilding operations, our rental operations, maintaining conservative homebuilding leverage and strong liquidity, paying an increased dividend and consistently repurchasing shares.David?David Auld: In closing, our results and position reflect our experienced teams, industry-leading market share, broad geographic footprint and diverse product offerings. All of these are key components of our operating platform to sustain our ability to produce consistent returns, growth and cash flow, while continuing to aggregate market share. We will maintain our disciplined approach to investing capital to enhance the long-term value of the company, which includes returning capital to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases on a consistent basis. Thank you to the entire D.R. Horton team for your continued focus and hard work. This concludes our prepared remarks.

""If I just knew with a little more certainty how many rate cuts, how fast the rate cuts will come, even the clarity of the path - I think that would be part of the reason to potentially go 'overweight' on Brazil.""The move would make Brazil, where Principal owns asset manager Claritas, an area of opportunity for investing in equities.Current equity ""buys"" for Principal, which manages more than $660 billion globally, include Latin America's No. 2 economy Mexico, which has benefited from the nearshoring trend, as well as some ""pockets"" of Europe and Asia, including Japan, South Korea and Singapore.Overall, however, the group recommends lowering exposure to stocks in favor of fixed income, a view supported by its forecast of a mild global recession in the fourth quarter driven by a slowing U.S. economy.""Some declared the 60/40 portfolio was dead,"" Jablonski said, referring to the strategy of hedging against market declines by investing 60% in equities and 40% in bonds.""But the correlation between stocks and bonds is coming down, so the 60/40 is quite healthy, alive and well.""

Currently, only six percent of arable land in Africa is irrigated. Crops that rely on rainfall are more susceptible since climate change is leading to more erratic weather patterns, including drought.PlantVillage is on a mission to help African smallholder farmers adapt to climate change at scale, by using artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing and an incredible team of young people on the ground. Last year, PlantVillage was the recipient of funding through the Cisco Foundation's $100 million climate portfolio for a program to help scale regenerative practices on 12,500 farms in Kenya and create many green jobs in the process.Specifically, the project helped to plant border (including fruiting) trees along the boundaries of farms, contributing to many short and longer-term benefits, such as helping to prevent further erosion through stabilizing the soil, providing shade and wind protection to lower the field temperatures and increase soil moisture, serving as a source of income via the carbon markets and over time, many positive impacts from the fruiting trees.A short time ago I spent some time with David Hughes, PlantVillage's founder; Chelsea Akulet, Plant Village Project Coordinator; Tracyline Jayo, Plant Village Research Associate, and several other members the PlantVillage Field Officers, young people local to the area in which they serve, who help to ‘bridge the gap' between the technology and the farmers.How did the idea for PlantVillage come about?David Hughes: The first formalized system of agricultural knowledge sharing began in a time of crisis, in my hometown of Dublin during the Irish Potato Famine. Experts, or ‘extension workers' were sent out to farms to help them cope with the disease of potatoes (late blight) and help them diversify into other crops. Expert delivery of advice to farmers has continued ever since, across the world. Over 170 years of excellent research has meant that we know a great deal about how to deal with pests and diseases. However, we just don't share this knowledge effectively with African farmers.Story continuesPlantVillage was started to ‘level the playing field', via the AI charged super computer in your pocket (also called your phone). We provide smallholder farmers in Africa the tools and technologies to diagnose problems caused by pests and diseases on their farms using award winning AI solutions we develop with partners around the world. Government-backed and privately funded ‘extension workers' do already operate in Africa, but there are not enough of them. For example, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, there's one ‘extension worker' for approximately every 8-10,000 farmers. PlantVillage is the idea that mobile-connected, cloud technology can help us ‘leapfrog' and so we pioneered the application of AI in a phone, working offline, that would help smallholder farmers cope with pests and diseases.Since technology has changed every other sector of the world, why would it not change African agriculture? We wanted to take the same phone and cloud-based software systems that have driven your ability to get food, get a date, or get a lift home, to drive the transformation and adaptation of hundreds of millions of farmers in Africa to climate change.What made you realize that farmers could be leading the way in climate action?David: In 2019, two of the largest cyclones to ever hit East Africa left a trail of destruction and made it clear that climate change was here and only going to get worse. It was these events that helped us to shift our focus towards being a climate change-centric organization. Because if you don't consider how farmers in Africa (particularly, low-income, smallholder farmers who rely on rain), can cope with climate change, all the downstream dealing with pests are for naught, because you're not focusing on the biggest problem.Four years later we have seen that climate change has become worse and not just for Africa, but globally. Right now, we're 1.2 degrees Celsius above historical norms. It's necessary that we adapt and learn, and engage farmers, so we can figure out how we grow food in the context of our climate changing.Following an investment by the Huck Institutes at Penn State, providing me a named chair in Global Food Security, I wanted to use the money from that to see if we could not only provide advice on adaptation but also leverage the farms and phones to create AI powered Carbon Capture Cubes. The idea is simple: can AI and the PlantVillage software help us maximize the ability of smallholder farms to drawdown and store carbon at scale. We are focused on tree planting on farms (agroforestry) and the durable storage of carbon in the soil via biochar. This has taken off via Cisco and the Carbon XPRIZE (which we won) and has become a major part of PlantVillage's efforts.Tell us more about how the PlantVillage field officers and technology work together.Chelsea Akulet: We are young people from the community who are known as the ‘sons and daughters of the soil'. We're come straight from university and have a lot of passion. It's an opportunity for us to help and it's easier for our farmers to listen to us and to adapt, as we're from the same place as them and they trust us.David: We have found that by bringing smartphones to the typical smallholder farmers they can immediately benefit from the AI system resulting in less diseases in their farms and the ability to connect to the global community to get help. And now with our focus on climate change mitigation via partners like Cisco, we are showing how the phone can be a catalyst. This is not just for adaption and mitigation, but also creating many green jobs such as local people who work in tree nurseries.Can you share how PlantVillage helps with ‘knowledge sharing'?David: The philosophy behind PlantVillage comes from Elinor Ostrom's seminal work on the Tragedy of the Commons. Before she died, Elinor started working on something called the Tragedy of the Knowledge Commons. Increasingly, in a digital world, what's happening is that small groups are putting knowledge into the public space because it's good to share knowledge. But then, large actors ‘suck up' that knowledge and then put a paywall behind it. As we reach a peak of technological connectedness, where knowledge should be more available, it's becoming less available.At PlantVillage, we believe that knowledge should be accessible to all individuals. It's not enough to say that knowledge is accessible and free, you must have a bridge to translate that knowledge. For example, NASA puts out a lot of knowledge every day. But, in Africa, if you don't have an internet connection, smartphone, or the ability to speak English (or all three), then that knowledge isn't free. We need to make sure we look at ‘bridges to knowledge' and think about how knowledge needs to be equitable.Tracyline Jayo: Farmers get knowledge through the PlantVillage Nuru App. We talked about the app using AI to help farmers in the field to diagnose crop pests and diseases, without an internet connection. But it also contains a library of knowledge, the largest open-access library of crop health knowledge in the world. The Dream Team can then advise them on management and connect them with their nearest ‘extension officer' to get any further advice.David: It's also important to mention the scale. As an organization, with the help of partners, we reach about 14 million farmers in any given week, across multiple channels, for example, TV, SMS and radio. This can be about the weather, biochar, and other technologies.What does the future look like for PlantVillage?David: We're in the global impact game. In a world where the most important thing is growing food for ten billion people, with an increase of 2 degrees Celsius, the most important thing is how much time you spend with farmers to help them cope with climate change and leverage their farms to reduce the negative effects of climate change via carbon capture and storage at scale.The 21st century is Africa's century because it should be. It's a young continent made up of 1.3 billion people and by 2050 there will be 2.3 billion, 1 billion of whom will be children. We're betting on young people and PlantVillage is on a 45-year journey of global change. It's a global movement, which is right for the time we're in.Are you interested in learning more about PlantVillage?
