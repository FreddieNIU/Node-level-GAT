However, there was no official comment on the matter from either of the parties.Citing sources familiar with the matter, Bloomberg added that the companies are mulling a possible dual-listing. As part of the deal, Western Digital is likely to spin off its flash unit and integrate it with Kioxia, to create a new publicly trading company in the United States. This will be followed by a second listing in Japan.  The combined company would then have a major share of the global NAND flash market.Kioxia is an industry pioneer and global leader in memory solutions in flash memory and solid-state drives.

The acquisition of SanDisk enabled the company to venture into the flash drive storage technology space.Amid challenging macroeconomic conditions, the company is witnessing weakness in demand for both hard drive and flash products across all segments. Flash demand is under pressure owing to inventory reduction at PC OEMs and lower flash pricing.To battle macroeconomic uncertainties, WDC is focused on reducing capital investments and operating expenses to better align cash flow and cost structure with market conditions.Western Digital is scheduled to report second-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings on Jan 31. For fiscal second quarter, the company expects non-GAAP revenues in the range of $2.9-$3.1 billion. Management projects non-GAAP earnings to be between loss of 25 cents and earnings of 5 cents per share.Story continuesThe company expects non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 20-22%. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be between $650 million and $670 million.The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 8 cents loss per share and $3.01 billion in revenues, respectively.At present, WDC carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 3.9%, on average. It posted an earnings surprise of around 0.8% in the last reported quarter. The impacts of weaker prices and seasonally lower shipment volumes are likely to reflect on its fourth-quarter results.Nucor’s shares are up 61.4% over a year, compared with the industry’s 22% rise. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Zacks ModelOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for Nucor this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earning beat.Earnings ESP: Earnings ESP for Nucor is +3.29%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter is currently pegged at $4.18. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Nucor currently carries a Zacks Rank #1.What do the Estimates Say?Nucor, last month, issued its earnings guidance for the fourth quarter. It anticipates fourth-quarter earnings to be between $4.25 and $4.35 per share.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter consolidated revenues for Nucor is currently pegged at $7,910.3 million, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 23.7%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter average sales price per ton for the company’s steel mills unit stands at $1,077, suggesting a 27.1% year-over-year decline and a 16.9% sequential decrease. The same for total steel mill shipments is pegged at 4,677,000 tons, reflecting a roughly 20.3% sequential decline.A Few Factors to WatchThe company’s fourth-quarter results are likely to reflect weaker steel prices. Profitability in its steel mills and steel products segments are expected to have been dented by lower selling prices and seasonally lower shipment volumes.Nucor, in December, said that it expects earnings to decline significantly in the steel mills segment on a sequential comparison basis in the fourth quarter. The expected decline is due to lower average selling prices, margin contraction and lower shipment volumes.The biggest decline in profitability has been forecast at its sheet mills. The company expects shipments for its bar mills to be lower in the fourth quarter due to seasonal factors with customers lowering inventories as year-end approaches.Nucor also expects earnings for its steel products segment to decline modestly on a sequential comparison basis on reduced selling prices and volumes. Earnings for the raw materials unit are forecast to decline significantly in the fourth quarter compared with the third quarter due to lower profitability of the company’s DRI facilities and reduced selling prices for raw materials. Planned outages impacted the DRI facilities during the fourth quarter.U.S. steel prices tumbled after surging to roughly $1,500 per short ton in April 2022 due to supply concerns stemming from the Russia-Ukraine war. The benchmark hot-rolled coil (""HRC"") prices cratered to near the $600 per short ton level in November 2022. The downward drift partly reflects weaker demand. Fears of a recession have also impacted prices.Lower selling prices are likely to have weighed on Nucor’s steel mills segment in the to-be-reported quarter.Story continuesNucor Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Nucor Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseNucor Corporation price-eps-surprise | Nucor Corporation QuoteStocks That Warrant a LookHere are some companies in the basic materials space you may want to consider, as our model shows these too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Agnico Eagle Mines Limited AEM, scheduled to release earnings on Feb 16, has an Earnings ESP of +0.84% and sports a Zacks Rank #1.

7,bbd51d0c-0b08-38f9-ac04-0d7dfdc7e6db,NUE,2023-01-24,3 Basic Materials Stocks to Buy Before Earnings This Week,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-basic-materials-stocks-buy-155703371.html,1674489423,STORY,"['STLD', 'NUE', 'FCX']","[Many stocks in the Basic Materials sector outperformed the broader market over the last year and provided a much-needed hedge against inflation.Let’s take a look at three highly ranked Basic Material stocks set to report earnings this week that investors may want to consider buying in 2023 as well.Freeport McMoRan FCX Starting the list is mineral exploration and development miner Freeport McMoRan (FCX).Freeport is set to report fourth-quarter earnings on January 25, with its stock currently sporting a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Freeport McMoRan conducts its operations primarily through its principal subsidiaries’ PT Freeport Indonesia, Freeport-McMoRan Corporation, and Atlantic Copper. It is important to note that PT Freeport Indonesia’s principal asset Papua, is an Indonesia-based mine that contains the world’s largest copper and gold reserves.Londond Metal ExchangeImage Source: Londond Metal ExchangeWith copper prices hitting their highest levels in the last six months on the London Metal Exchange as shown in the above chart, Freeport McMoRan stock is sticking out with earnings estimate revisions trending higher for fiscal 2023 as the company rounds out FY22 with its Q4 report.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchQ4 Preview:  The rise in copper prices, primarily attributed to the reopening of China, which is the world’s largest copper consumer, is great timing as Freeport McMoRan earnings are expected to have dipped year over year during Q4 after a tough prior-year quarter to follow.Fourth-quarter earnings are expected to dip -58% to $0.40 a share compared to $0.96 a share in Q4 2021. On the top line, sales are projected at $5.34 billion, a -13% decrease from the prior year quarter. Still, an earnings beat on the company’s bottom line is not completely out of the picture.Earnings ESP:  The Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction is a useful tool in indicating which stocks could top quarterly earnings estimates by comparing the Zacks Consensus to the Most Accurate Consensus.Story continuesWith the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Freeport McMoRan’s Q4 earnings at $0.40 a share and the Most Accurate Estimate at $0.42 per share, FCX is expected to beat expectations by 6.96%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTakeaway:  Certainly, a strong earnings beat on Freeport McMoRan’s bottom line could lead to more upside in the stock. This could be supported by the company potentially offering better-than-expected guidance in correlation with higher copper prices.Nucor Corporation NUESteel Producer and metal recycler Nucor Corporation (NUE) is another stock investors may want to consider buying ahead of its Q4 earnings on January 26. Nucor stock sports a Zack Rank #1 (Strong Buy) with earnings estimate revisions notably rising for fiscal 2023.Even better, Nucor stock has been one of the top performers out of the basic materials sector over the last year to largely outperform the S&amp;P 500 and is already up 15% to start 2023.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchQ4 Preview:  Following an excellent prior-year quarter, earnings are forecasted at $4.18 per share for Nucor’s fourth quarter compared to $7.97 a share in Q4 2021. Sales for Q4 are expected at $7.91 billion which would be a -23% YoY decline.However, with iron and steel prices remaining higher despite cooling off recently, it is quite possible that Nucor will beat earnings expectations for a fifth consecutive quarter.U.S. Bureau of Labor StatisticsImage Source: U.S. Bureau of Labor StatisticsEarnings ESP:  Nucor stock has an ESP of 3.29% as the Zacks Consensus for Q4 earnings is $4.18 a share and the Most Accurate Estimate is $4.32 per share indicating the company could beat on its bottom line.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTakeaway: Despite the year-over-year quarterly drop in earnings, Nucor stock trades at just 11.8X forward earnings which is well below its decade high of 41.4X and a 23% discount to the median of 15.3X.Nucor’s valuation appears to already support the likelihood that the company’s earnings could decrease as steel prices move lower which still makes the stock attractive at its current levels with earnings estimates going up.Steel Dynamics STLD Rounding out the list is Steel Dynamics (STLD) which is set to report its Q4 earnings on January 25. Also sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Steel Dynamics FY23 earnings estimates have gone up 36% over the last 60 days to $10.82 per share compared to estimates of $7.94 a share two months ago.Steel Dynamics is also a leading steel producer and recycler of metal in the United States and one of the most diversified steel companies in the U.S. with a vast range of specialty products.The performance of Steel Dynamics stock has been incredible over the last year, up +106%, standing out among stocks across any sector. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchQ4 Preview:  Like Nucor, Steel Dynamics follows a stellar prior year fourth quarter. Steel Dynamics Q4 earnings are anticipated at $3.60 per share compared to $5.98 a share in Q4 2021. Sales for Q4 are expected to be $4.73 billion and down -11% YoY.Still, it is quite plausible that Nucor will beat earnings expectations for what would be a 13th consecutive quarter dating back to January of 2020.Earnings ESP: The Zacks ESP for Steel Dynamics indicates the company could once again beat on its bottom line. With the Zacks Consensus for Nucor’s Q4 earnings at $3.60 a share the most accurate estimate of $3.77 per share indicates the possibility of a 4.82% earnings beat.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTakeaway: The top and bottom line growth for Steel Dynamics has been massive over the last few years as steel prices soared, and it is noteworthy that the company has also beaten sales expectations for 12 consecutive quarters.Steel Dynamics also trades attractively relative to its past at just 9.9X forward earnings which is nicely below its decade high of 24.2X and the median of 12.2X.With its valuation also supporting the potential drop in steel prices, Steel Dynamics stock could have more upside especially if the company continues its stellar track record of topping quarterly expectations.Bottom Line After the very impressive top and bottom line growth these basic material stocks had in recent years, investors will definitely want to pay attention to their Q4 earnings. The rising earnings estimate revisions make the possibility of beating Q4 expectations quite plausible for Freeport McMoRan, Nucor, and Steel Dynamic stock and could continue supporting their strong performances.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

It has a trailing four-quarter negative earnings surprise of roughly 6.7%, on average.Freeport’s fourth-quarter results are likely to have been impacted by higher year over year unit net cash costs and lower copper prices. However, the company is likely to have gained from higher mining rates.The stock has gained 13.7% in the past year compared with the industry’s 32.1% rise. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Zacks ModelOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for Freeport this time around.

The same for average realized price for copper is pinned at $3.57 per pound, indicating a 19.2% year-over-year decline and a 2% sequential rise.Story continuesA Few Factors to WatchFreeport’s fourth-quarter results are expected to reflect the impacts of weaker year over year copper prices. Copper prices lost the momentum since the second quarter of 2022. The uncertainties surrounding the global economy and new coronavirus restrictions in China dwindled demand for the red metal, hurting prices. Copper prices headed south from late April 2022 after hitting an all-time high in March driven by concerns over supply-chain disruptions, exacerbated by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, a spike in energy costs and low global inventories.Nevertheless, copper prices have rebounded since October on the back of tight supply and expectations of a demand recovery partly driven by China government's announcement of new measures to ease pandemic restrictions in late 2022.  Notwithstanding the recovery in copper prices in the December quarter, the impacts of lower year over year average realized copper prices are likely to reflect on Freeport’s fourth-quarter revenues and margins. The company is also likely to have witnessed higher year over year unit net cash costs in the quarter partly due to higher energy prices.However, strong performance at PT Freeport Indonesia and efforts to increase operating rates at Cerro Verde and El Abra mines are likely to have aided the company’s copper volumes in the quarter to be reported. The company is expected to have benefited from higher mining rates in South America. FreeportMcMoRan Inc. Price and EPS Surprise FreeportMcMoRan Inc.

This product will be manufactured at Nucor’s $1.7 billion state-of-the-art Brandenburg steel mill at Kentucky. Elcyon has large plate dimensions, improved weldability and excellent toughness when compared to its competing products.Nucor is pursuing certification under LEED v4, which is regarded as the highest standard for sustainable building design, construction and operation, from the U.S. Green Building Council for its Brandenburg steel plant. This has made the Brandenburg steel plant the world’s first steel plant to seek this certification. The steel plant has the capacity to produce 1.2 million tons of steel annually. The new mill is located at the largest steel plate consuming region of the country, strategically placing it to meet domestic demand for plate products.The company is using its recycled scrap-based electric arc furnace to manufacture Elcyon, which is a clean and advanced steel product. This steel making process has greenhouse gas emissions intensity of about one-fifth of the global blast furnace steel making average based on scope 1 and 2 emissions. To meet the need for precise quality standards of offshore wind energy designers, manufacturers and fabricators, Nucor utilizes thermo-mechanical controlled processing (TMCP) at the new mill to manufacture Elcyon, which is a one-of-a-kind steel product made in the United States.The passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, which includes a $300 million investment for clean energy development and climate programs, has aided the Biden Administration’s goal to construct 30 gigawatts of offshore wind power by 2030. Elcyon is seen as an important component of the supply chain to continue building America’s offshore wind power infrastructure.Nucor has been the leader of sustainable steel production, and the launch of Elcyon and the Brandenburg mill has further elevated the company’s position. Nucor has been constantly working toward meeting demand of customers and other stakeholders as seen through the launch of Econiq last year, the world’s first net-zero steel available at scale, to becoming the first industrial company to join the United Nations 24/7 carbon-free energy global impact.Story continuesThe company stated that Elcyon’s larger and thicker plates will help the United States become a leader in offshore wind production and meet rising demand for alternative energy sources. The company also stated that it will continue to invest and build recycled steel facilities to pursue a future of clean energy. The launch of Elcyon will be offered in a wide range of plate grades and sizes to meet the unique and specific needs of its end users.NUE’s shares have gained 61% in the past year, outperforming industry’s growth of 22%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchNucor expects its earnings for the fourth quarter to be between $4.25 and $4.35 per share. This guidance suggests a decline on a sequential basis as well as from the year-ago quarter. Lower shipment volumes, lower average selling prices and seasonal factors are expected to have been headwinds for NUE’s steel mills segment in the fourth quarter. Nucor also said that economic uncertainties and concern for recession could put a dent on future steel demand. Nucor Corporation Price and ConsensusNucor Corporation Price and ConsensusNucor Corporation price-consensus-chart | Nucor Corporation QuoteZacks Rank &amp; Key PicksNucor currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Other top-ranked stocks to consider in the basic materials space include AngloGold Ashanti Limited AU, FMC Corporation FMC and Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.

Furthermore, you'd generally like to see the share price rise faster than the market. But Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (NYSE:ARE) has fallen short of that second goal, with a share price rise of 26% over five years, which is below the market return. Unfortunately the share price is down 20% in the last year.So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress. Check out our latest analysis for Alexandria Real Estate Equities While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Over half a decade, Alexandria Real Estate Equities managed to grow its earnings per share at 28% a year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 5% over the same period. So one could conclude that the broader market has become more cautious towards the stock.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthIt is of course excellent to see how Alexandria Real Estate Equities has grown profits over the years, but the future is more important for shareholders. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on how its financial position has changed over time.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, Alexandria Real Estate Equities' TSR for the last 5 years was 45%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe regret to report that Alexandria Real Estate Equities shareholders are down 17% for the year (even including dividends). Unfortunately, that's worse than the broader market decline of 10%. However, it could simply be that the share price has been impacted by broader market jitters. It might be worth keeping an eye on the fundamentals, in case there's a good opportunity. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 8%, each year, over five years. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.

TMO is slated to release fourth-quarter 2022 results on Feb 1, 2023 before market open.In the last reported quarter, Thermo Fisher’s earnings of $5.08 per share exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 6.28%. Its earnings surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 15.27%.Let's discuss the factors that are likely to get reflected in the upcoming results.Factors at PlayThrough the months of the fourth quarter, Thermo Fisher’s Analytical Instruments segment is expected to have generated strong sales, banking on electron microscopy, chromatography, mass spectrometry, chemical analysis as well as research and safety market channel businesses.The company is expected to have recorded growth, driven by a favorable business mix and new launches. The company advanced its Orbitrap portfolio, launching the Orbitrap Ascend Tribrid mass spectrometer. In electron microscopy, the company introduced the Thermo Scientific Arctis Cryo-Plasma Focused Ion Beam, an automated microscope that streamlines cryoelectron tomography. These are all expected to have contributed to the Q4 top line of Thermo Fisher.However, the industrywide trend of record-level inflation, supply issues and staffing shortages are expected to have deterred growth in several areas within this business.Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseThermo Fisher Scientific Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseThermo Fisher Scientific Inc. price-eps-surprise | Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. QuoteWithin the Life-Science Solutions segment, the company is expected to have registered growth in its bioproduction business, banking on progress with cell culture media, single-use technologies and a rapidly growing purification resins business as well as pharma services business.Further, in terms of performance in high-growth and emerging markets, the company has made major investments in bioproduction of late. It has opened a second facility in Utah and a new facility in Tennessee, both of which are operational now. It has also expanded its Grand Island, New York cell culture media facility and opened a purification facility in Massachusetts. These developments are expected to have contributed to the company’s revenues in Q4.Story continuesHowever, this might have been offset by lower revenues in the genetic sciences business due to a moderation in COVID testing revenues compared to the year-ago period.The Specialty Diagnostics segment (Clinical Diagnostics business from the molecular controls that go into testing kits) is expected to have registered positive contributions in the form of continued growth in the microbiology and transplant diagnostics businesses. Looking at the consistently growing resurgence of virus-led healthcare needs, the Microbiology, Healthcare Market Channel and Clinical Diagnostics businesses are expected to have witnessed growth in Q4. More specifically, the company’s strong underlying growth in the healthcare market channel, transplant diagnostics and clinical diagnostics businesses is expected to have contributed to the to-be-reported quarter’s top line. However, this might have been offset by lower COVID-19 testing revenues and the ongoing macroeconomic headwinds.Within the Laboratory Products and Services segment, the company is expected to have gained from strong productivity and volume leverage within the pharma services business and the research and safety market channel. Also, the PPD business in the research and safety market channel as well as plastics used in testing workflows and cold storage equipment manufactured by the lab products business are expected to have generated strong sales growth in the fourth quarter.Q4 EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues of $10.36 billion for the fourth quarter suggests a 3.2% decline from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure. The consensus mark for earnings of $5.19 per share indicates a 20.6% decline from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.What Our Quantitative Model PredictsPer our proven model, stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) have a good chance of beating estimates.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite continued to progress, rising 0.6% in the week, but the S&amp;P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.7% and 2.7%, respectively.Economic data released through the week, especially from the yet-robust labor market, made investors nervous about the Fed not being satisfied with the current level of economic slowdown. Jobs, being a key indicator of how an economy is doing, can be a game-changing statistic, influencing the Fed to bring interest rates down. On the other hand, fears of a recession were further stoked by industrial production and the retail sector declining much higher than expected.The markets are currently between a rock and a hard place, and investors are unable to make up their minds about what to make of the economic data. Robust numbers mean that the Fed’s inflation alarms might be ringing, and weak numbers suggest that the central bank may have already gone too far. Friday’s rebound from overselling earlier in the week, however, helped the Nasdaq keep its head above water as we go deeper into the earnings season.Regardless of market conditions, we, here at Zacks, provide investors with unbiased guidance on how to beat the market. As usual, Zacks Research guided investors over the past three months with its time-tested methodologies.

USB’s quarterly earnings and revenues are likely to have improved year over year.Before we analyze the factors that are expected to have impacted the fourth-quarter earnings, let’s look at U.S. Bancorp’s performance over the last few quarters.In the last reported quarter, USB’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on an increase in net interest income (NII), average loan growth and higher rates. However, rise in expenses and elevated provisions for credit losses were the offsetting factors.U.S. Bancorp has a decent surprise history. Earnings surpassed estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed the mark once, the average surprise being 1.39%.U.S. Bancorp Price and EPS SurpriseU.S. Bancorp Price and EPS SurpriseU.S. Bancorp price-eps-surprise | U.S. Bancorp QuoteThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings of $1.11 has moved 3.5% south in the past month. Nonetheless, the figure indicates a 3.7% rise from the year-ago reported number.The consensus estimate for revenues is pegged at $6.66 billion, suggesting growth of 17.6%. Management anticipates fourth-quarter total revenue growth of 2% on a sequential basis.Key Development During the QuarterOn Dec 1, 2022, U.S. Bancorp completed the acquisition of MUFG Union Bank’s core retail banking operations from Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group MUFG in a cash-cum-stock transaction. This will bolster U.S. Bancorp’s presence on the West Coast.Under the terms of the deal, announced in September 2021, USB paid $5.5 billion in cash and issued almost 44 million shares of U.S. Bancorp common stock. At closure, MUFG held a minority stake of roughly 3% in U.S. Bancorp.Major Factors to Influence Q4 ResultsLoan Demand &amp; NII: The bank’s NII and margins are likely to have been driven by the 125-basis-point (bp) interest rate hikes. Per the Fed’s latest data, loan growth continued at a decent pace in the to-be-reported quarter. Though loan demand moderated from the third-quarter 2022 level, higher interest rates offered support.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $564.5 billion for the quarterly average interest-earning assets indicates a 4.2% sequential improvement. The estimate for NII suggests a 6.8% sequential increase to $4.09 billion.Non-Interest Income: Heightening volatility, uncertainty, recession fears and geopolitical tensions dampened the equity market performance. Amid this, disruptions in capital market activities are anticipated to have hindered commercial product revenues. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for U.S. Bancorp's commercial product revenues indicates a 4.6% sequential decline to $272 million.Mortgage rates increased sequentially in the to-be-reported quarter, with the rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage remaining above the 6% mark all through the quarter. This is expected to have led to a decline in refinance originations. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for mortgage banking revenues is pegged at $80 million, suggesting a 1.2% fall.The consensus mark for trust and investment management fees is pegged at $575 million, indicating a marginal rise. Also, credit and debit card revenues show a decent improvement on rise in usage of these. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same of $400 million indicates a 2.3% increase.The elimination of certain fees and lower deposit balances are likely to have affected service charges. The consensus mark of $166 million indicates no change in revenues from service charges on deposits.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the total non-interest income is pegged at $2.47 billion, implying no change on a sequential basis.Expenses: As USB continues to invest in digital initiatives, payments capabilities and technology modernization, such costs might have weighed on its expense base to some extent in the to-be-reported quarter and hindered bottom-line growth. Additionally, the acquisition of the MUFG Union Bank is likely to have resulted in higher expenses.Management expects core expenses (excluding merger and integration charges related to the MUFG Union Bank buyout) to rise 2% sequentially.Asset Quality: With the moderate rise in loan balance and expectations of economic slowdown due to geopolitical and macroeconomic headwinds, USB is expected to have built reserves in the fourth quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total non-performing assets of $1.06 billion implies a 57.2% jump from the prior quarter. The consensus estimate for non-performing loans of $995 million suggests surge of 57.9%.Story continues2022 Management GuidanceTotal net revenues are projected increase 5-6%, given the revised interest rate assumptions. Further, fully-taxable equivalent NII is expected to grow in the low to mid-teen range. Fee income is expected to be slightly lower primarily due to a fall in mortgage banking revenues and deposit service charges.A positive core operating leverage of at least 200 bps is anticipated.What the Zacks Model PredictsOur proven model does not predict an earnings beat for U.S. Bancorp for the fourth quarter. This is because the company does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Earnings ESP: U.S. Bancorp has an Earnings ESP of -2.87%.Zacks Rank: U.S. Bancorp currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3.Finance Stocks That Warrant a LookNavient Corporation NAVI and BOK Financial Corporation BOKF are a few finance stocks that you might want to consider, as these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming releases, per our model.The Earnings ESP for NAVI is +0.31% and the company carries a Zacks Rank #3 at present.

The company's shares saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the NYSE. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Edwards Lifesciences’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. View our latest analysis for Edwards Lifesciences Is Edwards Lifesciences Still Cheap?The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to my valuation model. It’s trading around 11.58% above my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Edwards Lifesciences today, you’d be paying a relatively fair price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $71.75, then there isn’t really any room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. Although, there may be an opportunity to buy in the future. This is because Edwards Lifesciences’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company’s shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.What does the future of Edwards Lifesciences look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by 29% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Edwards Lifesciences. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in EW’s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on EW, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.It can be quite valuable to consider what analysts expect for Edwards Lifesciences from their most recent forecasts.

But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors? We'll need to take a closer look to find out.We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.Hologic has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Edwards Lifesciences has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now. This means that HOLX's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.HOLX currently has a forward P/E ratio of 22.83, while EW has a forward P/E of 31.79. We also note that HOLX has a PEG ratio of 1.50. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. EW currently has a PEG ratio of 2.75.Another notable valuation metric for HOLX is its P/B ratio of 4.08. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, EW has a P/B of 7.88.These are just a few of the metrics contributing to HOLX's Value grade of A and EW's Value grade of C.Story continuesHOLX stands above EW thanks to its solid earnings outlook, and based on these valuation figures, we also feel that HOLX is the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230123005575/en/Mother and baby (Photo: Business Wire)As a father of four amazing daughters, my wife and I have had the opportunity to create some incredible memories over the years. From attending their dance and athletic competitions to playing video games and visiting national parks in our RV, I will forever cherish the time spent with my family and being blessed with the opportunity to help see my girls grow into smart, courageous young women. While these memories are fond, none compare to the love forever etched in my heart on the day they each were born. I can vividly recall my first time seeing them open their eyes, their tiny hands grasping my finger, their first feedings and the joy I felt seeing them crack their first smiles – what magical times!For far too many people, their memories surrounding birth is very different. One that many of us could only imagine in our worst nightmares. The United States is the most dangerous place in the developed world to give birth1, particularly if you are a Black woman, according to the March of Dimes. In fact, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that Black women are three times more likely than Caucasian women to die from pregnancy or childbirth-related issues, and there are a multitude of factors, including lack of access to quality healthcare, underlying chronic conditions, institutional racism and implicit bias that led to these disparities. While this issue has plagued the entire country, the University of Georgia reports that Georgia — home to the third-largest Black population in the United States — is the state with the second highest maternal mortality rate.Story continuesSince 1994, more than 30 labor and delivery units have closed in Georgia, and more than half of the state’s counties have no OB-GYN care or services1. To address this issue in Georgia, we have teamed up with J&amp;J Consumer Health, home to an iconic portfolio of consumer brands, and CareSource, a national nonprofit that offers health insurance and innovative programs to address health equity and care access, to expand on a joint commitment to improve maternal health. We are beginning with a multi-pronged pilot program in Georgia to address the communities with the greatest need.Knowing that there are several factors that contribute to the Black maternal health crisis in Georgia, we connected with community members, hospitals and community-based organizations to understand the most pressing issues to address immediately. This pilot is comprised of four pillars:Self-care supportWe are working with J&amp;J Consumer Health to support CareSource’s Mom and Baby Beginnings program, available to CareSource members only, which provides an innovative array of maternity bundles of products, education, and services tailored for Black women and all pregnant people.High touch pregnancy careAn at-home pregnancy support online through georgiamamacare.com, where mothers can use the platform to get their questions answered through one-on-one telehealth visits with care professionals, specialized classes, and support groups.Healthcare professional educationProviding healthcare professionals (HCPs) — including doctors, nurses, doulas, pharmacy technicians — with continuing medical education designed to not only strengthen their clinical skills, but also their patient communication, through CME Outfitters Maternal Health.Health equity researchOur partners at J&amp;J Consumer Health are supporting research led by Morehouse School of Medicine’s Center for Maternal Health Equity to uncover the causes of health inequities among pregnant Black women and how we can further progress community resources to help close the gap.These resources are available now to expecting mothers and healthcare providers across Georgia. If you are an expectant mother in Georgia and are interested in the pilot program, please visit georgiamamacare.com.We are committed to making a difference in the health and wellness of our communities, offering quality care to help our customers and patients live better and healthier, right in their communities. We look forward to taking the learnings from this pilot to potentially expand into more communities in the future.View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230123005575/en/ContactsErica Evanserica.evans0@walmart.com]"

The company's bellwether status and an optimal integrated capital structure that has historically produced industry-leading returns make it a relatively lower-risk energy sector play.Exxon Mobil has made more than 30 discoveries in offshore Guyana since 2015. Exxon Mobil also has a strong presence in the prolific Permian Basin, where it delivered record production in the third quarter. Considering the low cost of production in both assets, it will continue to generate handsome returns. Also, a strong presence in chemicals and refining operations is noteworthy.However, the company has constantly been bearing the brunt of increasing expenses, adversely affecting its income. Also, the integrated energy giant's financials were weakened by years-long significant spending on low-return developments and the coronavirus pandemic.(You can read the full research report on Exxon Mobil here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Fomento Económico Mexicano have outperformed the Zacks Beverages - Soft Drinks industry over the past year (+2.7% vs. +0.5%).

Its bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in Q3, while the revenues lagged.FEMSA's digital initiatives and business expansion endeavors have also been aiding results. Its efforts to expand in the U.S. specialized distribution segment bodes well.

The recent estimate revision trend for 2023 funds from operations (FFO) per share indicates an unfavorable outlook.However, Prologis' fourth-quarter 2022 results reflected healthy leasing activity with solid rent growth. Given its capacity to offer high-quality facilities in key markets, the firm is poised to capitalize on the favorable industrial real estate industry trends.Along with the fast adoption of e-commerce, this asset category is set to gain from a likely rise in inventory levels.

Smith Corporation AOS is scheduled to report fourth-quarter results on Jan 31, before market open.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fourth-quarter earnings has been revised downward by 0.3% in the past 60 days. However, the company has a stellar earnings surprise history, having outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and matching once, the average beat being 4.2%.Let’s see how A.O. Smith has shaped up this earnings season.A. O. Smith Corporation Price and EPS Surprise A. O. Smith Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseA. O. Smith Corporation price-eps-surprise | A. O. Smith Corporation QuoteFactors to NoteA. O. Smith is expected to have gained from its June 2022 acquisition of Atlantic Filter, which boosted its position in the water treatment industry, and strengthened its customer base in Florida and the adjacent regions. Also, the top-line results are expected to reflect the benefits of the acquisitions of Master Water Conditioning Corporation (July 2021) and Giant Factories, Inc. (October 2021). The Master Water Conditioning acquisition has boosted AOS’ water treatment business in North America, while the Giant Factories buyout has broadened its commercial and water heater offerings.However, lower residential water heater volumes are likely to have impacted the North America segment’s performance in the fourth quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for North American segment revenues suggests a 6.7% decrease from the year-ago reported number. For the fourth quarter, we expect the same to decrease 7.1% year over year.Lower consumer demand in China due to coronavirus-related lockdowns is expected to have dented the Rest of the World segment’s performance in the fourth quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues suggests a decline of 9.7% from the year-ago period. We expect the same to decline 10% from the year-ago reported number.High raw material and transportation costs, and cost increases from production inefficiencies are likely to have affected AOS’ margin performance in the fourth quarter. Given the company’s substantial international presence, foreign currency headwinds are expected to have impacted the top line in the to-be-reported quarter.Story continuesWhat Does the Zacks Model Say?Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for A. O. Smith this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of beating estimates, which is not the case here, as elaborated below.Earnings ESP: A.

Smith’s third-quarter 2022 adjusted earnings (excluding 2 cents from non-recurring items) of 69 cents per share were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The bottom line declined year over year in double digits. Net sales of $874.2 million marginally outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $874.1 million. The top line dipped 4.4% year over year due to residential water heater de-stocking activity.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies, which, according to our model, have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings in this reporting cycle.IDEX Corporation IEX has an Earnings ESP of +2.96% and a Zacks Rank of 2 at present.

And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 83% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.As a result, institutional investors endured the highest losses last week after market cap fell by US$673m. The recent loss, which adds to a one-year loss of 5.6% for stockholders, may not sit well with this group of investors. Institutions or ""liquidity providers"" control large sums of money and therefore, these types of investors usually have a lot of influence over stock price movements. Hence, if weakness in Huntington Bancshares' share price continues, institutional investors may feel compelled to sell the stock, which might not be ideal for individual investors.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Huntington Bancshares, beginning with the chart below. See our latest analysis for Huntington Bancshares ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Huntington Bancshares?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.Huntington Bancshares already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Huntington Bancshares' earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Huntington Bancshares. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 12% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 9.7% and 5.3% of the stock.Looking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 50% of the ownership is controlled by the top 14 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Huntington BancsharesThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Huntington Bancshares Incorporated. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$146m worth of shares (at current prices). It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 17% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

Both WTI and Brent now at early December highs with crude closing the day just below $82 a barrel.We want to bring in Stephen Schork, the Schork Group principal. Stephen, it's great to see you again. Certainly the trend has been to the upside when it comes to crude prices. Where are we headed? Are we headed even higher from here?STEPHEN SCHORK: Yes. That's where the current trend is taking us now, Seana. The narratives are winning out, the narrative being that market now is focused on China reopening. Market got a nice boost a few weeks ago when China increased by 1/5 its slated crude-oil imports for the new year. You have growing optimism out of OPEC that demand is going to stay strong.So that narrative is winning over the other narrative. That is demand destruction vis-a-vis economic contraction here in the US with certain macroeconomic signs pointing towards recession. Be that as it may, the China narrative is winning out.To your point, we did stumble out of the gate coming into 2023. We took a significant leg lower in the first week, and that was kind of payback for the significant leg higher we took going into the end of 2022. But we got down into the low $70s.And here is the problem because the White House now has painted itself into a corner. They came out. They depleted the SPR, and yet heating-oil prices this winter are 58% higher. Gasoline prices for next summer are 30% higher. We've depleted the SPR. And then the White House came out and said when oil prices get back into the low $70s, we'll start buying it.So here at the Schork Group, we're calling that the Biden put. Why would anyone want to sell oil in the low $70s or below when you know Uncle Sam is going to step in with the bid on a couple hundred million barrels? So we're looking at a de facto floor in the market at this point. So now you juxtapose that with the positive narrative of China reopening, and you do have the seeds for higher growth in price from here.Story continuesDAVE BRIGGS: Yeah, Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm saying today that Biden has been focused on reducing energy costs. How high do you think we are headed? Are we going back above $100 a barrel, and what about the price of gas? Up $0.10 in a week. Up $0.30 in a month. How high there as well?STEPHEN SCHORK: Right and we're going to that now part of the season where we're slow. We're looking at low inventories. So unless the secretary of energy could take some of her magic pixie dust and float it over the market and increase supplies when supplies are at extremely low levels, you can't happen-- this can't happen. So the only arsenal in this White House's quiver now has been to what? Go into the SPR.And I've just said the SPR, it's been a nonstarter. We're just depleting our emergency supplies of oil. We depleted our forward cover by nearly 40%, and prices again are still significantly higher.So the Biden administration has no tool that it can use to lower price. What it could do is embrace consumption. Stop demagoguing and scapegoating the industry and encourage investment and encourage these producers to come back in full force, but they've been reticent to do that. They've taken a very hawkish stance against their own domestic producers.So this administration does not have any options at this point, hence why we're going to Saudi Arabia or going to Venezuela. We're asking them to increase production. The Biden administration-- President Biden has not stepped foot in the city of Houston to talk to producers, but we are talking to Saudi Arabia and Venezuela.So we do not have a domestic energy policy. Regardless of what the secretary of energy wants to say, we do not have-- and hence why we do look at-- we're looking at higher prices. So right, we are now in the weakest part of the season when it comes to demand, and that is going to remain so for the next couple of weeks. So if we hold at these levels, mid $70s to mid $80s going into the late spring/summer when demand picks up, yes, we'll be looking at national gasoline prices well back above $4 a gallon, oil prices well back above $100 a barrel. That is in the cards.SEANA SMITH: Stephen, we've also got energy earnings coming up over the next couple of weeks. We have Chevron on Friday, Exxon a week from tomorrow. What are you expecting to hear from the oil giants about the past quarter, and have we seen a peak, at least for this cycle?STEPHEN SCHORK: The crack spreads have been great. That is to say the differential between the product price, what the refinery is selling, and the crude-oil price, what the refinery is buying. So that margin, that spread called the crack spread, has been very attractive, and I would suspect that it certainly will help continue to propel profits higher for the most part.So if we're going into the season-- and certainly, again, we're at that weakest part of the season. But the market from the margins, the spreads have only been increasing. And again, this here is a clear telltale of a lack of supply in this market. That is to say the forward curve-- prices on the forward curve are much higher than prices later dated out further out along the curve. This is a clear telltale that demand is outstripping supply, and the spreads are telling this. And if demand is outstripping supply and if you are producing that supply, selling in that demand market, that's a very attractive area to be in right now.SEANA SMITH: We'll be paying very close attention to those earnings reports. Stephen Schork, thanks so much.]"

The institute said its consumer sentiment index rose to -33.9 heading into February from a revised reading of -37.6 in January, but was slightly below forecasts from analysts polled by Reuters of -33.0. ""Falling energy prices, such as for gasoline and heating oil, have ensured that consumer sentiment is less gloomy,"" said GfK consumer expert Rolf Buerkl. Nevertheless, he warned that 2023 will remain difficult for the German economy.

The shares have lost half their value since a late 2021 peak, and were in the bottom 10th of S&amp;P 500 stocks last year.Investors greeted the news Sunday that Elliott had taken a multibillion-dollar stake by sending shares climbing as much as 5.9% Tuesday morning to $160.21. The stock has now recouped most of its losses since co-Chief Executive Officer Bret Taylor’s departure was announced on Nov. 30.Salesforce said earlier in January that it would eliminate about 10% of its workforce, which had increased more than 60% in almost three years to about 80,000 employees by the end of October 2022. Some of that growth came from multiple acquisitions, including the 2021 takeover of business chat application Slack for more than $27 billion. Elliott’s presence as an activist investor reduces concerns that co-founder Marc Benioff might make impulsive mergers to invigorate growth as the sole CEO in the wake of Taylor’s exit, wrote Jordan Klein, an analyst at Mizuho Securities.Activist investors often push for strategic changes and board representation. Salesforce’s directors are particularly vulnerable to shareholder activism since each member is up for reelection this year, and four non-founders have been on the board for more than 15 years, wrote Patrick Walravens, an analyst at JMP Securities. Discussions over potential board candidates are likely to move quickly, because the current nomination window begins in three weeks.Story continuesWhile it has pushed for new CEOs at other companies, Jesse Cohn, managing partner at Paul Singer’s Elliott, said the firm has developed a “deep respect” for Benioff. “It’s a level of support you don’t always see when Elliott discloses a position, which suggests they won’t push for his replacement,” said Victoria Sivrais, senior managing director at Clermont Partners, an investor relations and communications firm. She added that doesn’t mean others on the executive team are safe.Elliott is one of several activists seeking changes at Salesforce. Starboard Value announced a stake in October, saying the company was falling behind peers due to issues with translating growth into profitability. Jeff Ubben’s Inclusive Capital also is a shareholder, CNBC reported earlier.Elliott and Starboard have tried to simultaneously influence companies before. In 2019, each invested in EBay Inc. and helped force out the CEO, appoint new board members, and spin off the StubHub ticketing unit. The two are known as some of the most involved activist investors, said Gregory Rice, who co-leads the shareholder advisory and activism effort at Boston Consulting Group.With both activists pushing for better operating margins, Salesforce may go through “multiple iterations of headcount reductions or restructuring,” said Derrick Wood, an analyst at Cowen &amp; Co. He added that Elliott may have been in conversations with management during the 10% cuts announced earlier, citing similar discussions before the investment firm announced a stake in SAP SE in 2019.Salesforce’s sales and marketing budget is high for the industry and symbolized by massive events like its annual Dreamforce conference. Its expenditures as a share of revenue are well above peers such as Adobe Inc. or Microsoft Corp., according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence. An operating margin focus means that major acquisitions are likely off the table in the near term, as past deals for Slack, Tableau and Mulesoft dented Salesforce’s margins, said Bloomberg Intelligence’s Anurag Rana.Activists may propose spinning off past acquisitions, said Rishi Jaluria, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. Divesting Slack could be margin-boosting, though would likely have to be sold for less than Salesforce paid, he said. Mulesoft, which is now probably worth more than the $6.5 billion acquisition cost, could be divested without disrupting the company’s core cloud products, he added.“This is a critical juncture for Salesforce,” Jaluria said. If they maintain cost discipline and make the right changes, “we could see a stronger company exiting the recession and see 30%-plus margins.”(Updates shares in third paragraph)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekAfter 30 Years, the King of ETFs Faces a Fight for Its CrownHow to Be 18 Years Old Again for Only $2 Million a YearThe US Hasn’t Noticed That China-Made Cars Are Taking Over the WorldEven $370 Billion in US Incentives Won’t Solve All of Solar’s StrugglesGiving Four Months’ Notice or Paying to Quit Has These Workers Feeling Trapped©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

Let's take a look at some of the movers, top movers of the day. First up, we got to talk about Microsoft. Shares closing to the upside after the company officially announcing its extended partnership with OpenAI. That's the parent company of ChatGPT. The gains that we're looking at today is just about 1%. Taking a look at what this could mean for the company down the road here, Dave, this deal we know adding to Microsoft's initial investment of about a billion dollars back in 2019.Analysts are very bullish about this. Dan Ives from Wedbush, we've talked to him about this potential investment when it was just reported. But he's sending out a note today calling it a potential game changer for Microsoft, saying it is a direct shot to Google and other big tech companies, saying that Nadella and co, Satya Nadella is ahead of the rest of big tech. And this investment is a major notch on the AI belt. Doesn't get much more bullish than that.- No, it doesn't. Let's talk about those two things. One, what the threat is to competitors. Well, we know from some ""New York Times"" reporting that Sergey Brin and Larry Page have come back to-- the founders of Google have come back. And they're not back at all because of the threat of ChatGPT. They know how big this is. And the theory is that it's actually a threat to Google's search business, which many have balked at because how significant could Bing be?Well, apparently it's big if you've got the two founders of Google coming back. But what did Satya Nadella say today? We believe large-scale AI-like chat will create transformative impact at the magnitude of the personal computer, the internet, mobile devices, and the cloud. That's a pretty significant statement about what he believes ChatGPT will do. Completely disrupt just about every industry out there.Story continues- Yeah. Exactly. And it's coming at a time-- this investment here, at a time when Office, Azure projected to slow meaningfully. That was the crux of Barclay's note out on this today, saying that it could not have come at a more opportune time. We'll get results from Microsoft tomorrow after the bell, where I'm sure a question or two are going to be on OpenAI.- That call will be interesting. We certainly won't see ChatGPT in the earnings themselves. But some commentary will be fascinating. We also have coming up on this program a young man who is a Princeton student that has already invented an app that would detect cheating by ChatGPT. It can tell if it's written by human or AI. That's coming up. Also, Salesforce has been in focus all day amid activist investor activity. Elliott Investment Management announced that it's taken a stake in the company. And CNBC reporting Inclusive Capital has also taken a position. We spoke to Patrick Gadson, who has dealt with this company in numerous times, Elliott Management. He knows all about Paul Singer and what they are in this industry. Here's what he said.PATRICK GADSON: They are the Godzilla of the space. They make entire countries in South America tremble. So they are known to see things all the way through. And many activists are sort of price sensitive when it comes to running campaigns. Elliott is not. They are completely inelastic when it comes to their budget for any proxy contest, any proxy wars. They'll spend tens of millions.- If you weren't familiar with Paul Singer and Elliott Management, well, now you are. Look at Salesforce, up 3%, I guess because what we just heard there from Mr. Gadson is they don't lose. They have no time frame. And they don't care what they have to spend to win. They're going to get the job done, including with entire countries like Argentina.- Yeah. Exactly. He said when they walk in the room, you sit up straight and you pay attention. That's simply what you have to do when you're dealing with Elliott Management. When you take a look at Salesforce, clearly the stock has been under pressure, as well as many of its competitors out there, over the last several months. That one-year chart, you're looking at losses of nearly 30%. Some key executive changes have happened over the last couple of months. The co-CEO Bret Taylor leaving the company. A lot of people asking Benioff some questions just in terms of what this means for the direction of Salesforce going forward.In terms of what the Street is saying to this, Needham saying that the guess is that the outcome is all about margin expansion, question whether more layoffs could potentially be on the table. We know Salesforce was one of the tech companies to announce a significant amount of layoffs earlier this year. So I think the company is under pressure. More and more activist investors paying more attention, taking stakes reportedly, at least when it comes to the smaller company. Elliott Management, though, confirming that stake today. We had Stauber back in October. So it's getting more attention from activists and investors. We'll see what changes are actually made.- Yeah. And we don't know what they want. But it was an interesting revelation from Gadson. At least his interpretation is that, why do we learn about reports like this? Why are we hearing it? And his theory is it's because something already happened, probably a late Q4 development. In his estimate, that could be a complete breakdown in those talks or they're about to announce something, i.e. board appointments. So his theory is something has happened, either positive or negative, to break that story.- Yeah. And just taking a look at the track record here, when it comes to Elliott Management, they've dealt with PayPal, AT&amp;T, Dell, Pinterest just to name a few in the past, and forcing numerous changes at those companies. So Benioff under a bit of pressure today and likely for a couple of weeks. All right. Let's talk about the chip stocks here. They are among the leaders in the NASDAQ today. Barclays out with a bullish note upgrading AMD, Qualcomm, and reiterating a buy rating on Nvidia They don't see the group of stocks retesting those October lows. A bullish call here from Barclays.The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, that's up more than 30% from a two-year low in mid-October. Analyst Blaine Curtis here of Barclays saying that he's more positive on companies with the data center PC handset exposures. Also, the reopening in China will start benefiting the industry he sees in the second half of the year. You're looking at a one-year chart of the Philly Semiconductor Index. Despite that 30% rally off the lows, still off about 14% this year, with a number of those larger chip stocks in the red over the last 12 months as well.- And you know where I'm going to go with this. ChatGPT. Because there was a number of analysts who said there's one name that's probably going to benefit the most from this. And that is Nvidia. They are poised to benefit the most from the bounce from ChatGPT, including Citi, which said that is why they believe in Nvidia moving forward. As for that Barclays note, they added this is a frown turned upside down. We still see this correlation as the worst since the tech bubble. But we are modeling estimates below for nearly every name in our coverage, even without a macro downturn. Very good day for chip stocks. Look at that. Up almost 8% for NVIDIA.]"

This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. Check out our latest analysis for Sealed Air Step By Step Through The CalculationWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$580.7mUS$628.4mUS$676.0mUS$751.0mUS$800.0mUS$841.3mUS$876.7mUS$907.7mUS$935.6mUS$961.3mGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x7Analyst x7Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 6.53%Est @ 5.16%Est @ 4.21%Est @ 3.54%Est @ 3.07%Est @ 2.74% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.5% US$540US$544US$544US$563US$558US$545US$529US$509US$488US$467(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$5.3bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.5%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$961m× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.5%– 2.0%) = US$18bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$18b÷ ( 1 + 7.5%)10= US$8.6bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$14b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$53.8, the company appears quite undervalued at a 44% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Sealed Air as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.5%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.917. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Sealed AirStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is well covered by earnings.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings growth over the past year is below its 5-year average.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Packaging market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 4 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.Significant insider buying over the past 3 months.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price?

The onset of winter in many regions around the world, which has been milder than anticipated and may continue for an extended period, particularly in the US, is reducing concerns about a potential shortage of natural gas that was forecast to lead to disruptions in service and increased energy costs. Additionally, many countries are now sitting on ample natural gas reserves. Gas storage across Europe is 84% full, far ahead of the five-year seasonal average of 70%, as per Gas Infrastructure Europe.The oil and gas industry entered 2023 with the strongest financial position it has ever had, with a commitment to maintaining financial discipline. This positive outlook is reflected in a survey conducted by Deloitte, in which 93% of oil and gas executives express a positive attitude towards the industry in the upcoming year. This positive momentum could assist companies in addressing the lack of investment in the industry in recent years and support a faster transition to cleaner energy sources. Natural gas will continue to be one of the preferred choices for generating electricity and heat. To benefit from the boom in the natural gas industry, some of the most undervalued stocks preferred by smart investors include Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY), and ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP). Our Methodology We scanned Insider Monkey’s database of holdings of 920 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the third quarter of 2022 and picked the 11 most undervalued natural gas stocks that have P/E ratios of less than or close to 10 as of January 20.

Pioneer stood out recently with a pledge to return a large majority of free cash flow to share owners through dividends and stock buybacks, and ended hedging to give share owners more earnings and dividend potential should oil and gas prices continue to rise.”10. Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 50P/E Ratio as of January 20: 5.61Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC) was founded in 1887 and is headquartered in Findlay, Ohio.

Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE:MRO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 50P/E Ratio as of January 20: 5.31Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE:MRO) is a Texas-based independent exploration and production company that engages in the exploration, production, and marketing of crude oil, condensate, natural gas liquids, and natural gas.

An underweight to communication services and an overweight to energy helped performance, while an underweight to consumer staples and an overweight to materials detracted. Stock selection was strong within healthcare and materials but was weak within information technology and industrials. Marathon Oil (NYSE:MRO) increased its quarterly dividend and executed an impressive share buyback that blew by the target it originally announced.”8. Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 51P/E Ratio as of January 20: 6.75Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) is an Oklahoma-based independent energy company that primarily engages in the exploration, development, and production of oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids in the United States. Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) said it expects Q4 production to be reduced by 2%, or 15,000 boe/day, due to the impact of harsh weather across its operations in December, especially in the Williston Basin.

Here is what the fund said:“Our biggest dollar gainer within this period was Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN), a position which emanated from a takeover in early 2021 of our long-time holding WPX Energy. We are sitting on a material (unrealized) gain from our cost and are now receiving material dividends thanks to Devon’s thoughtful fixed/variable dividend policy. Energy is now a hot sector for investors but we have had material exposure for a long time. We remember a bit too well $40 oil, NEGATIVELY PRICED front-month oil contract, and what it’s like to own a company with leverage and negative free cash flow during such periods. Our desire to have our biggest portfolio exposures be high-return, growing, reasonably predictable and moderately levered companies led us to reduce our Devon exposure in the past. When the recent facts and circumstances for the industry changed and appeared supportive of healthy oil prices, we decided to maintain a sizable holding and more recently added to the position. At Devon’s Q1 dividend rate, which is most variable in nature, the shares now yield approximately 10% and our yield on our average cost is materially higher. In addition, we maintain additional energy exposure through our long-term (and successful) holding in Hess Midstream and less directly through TerraVest and Berkshire Hathaway’s energy investments.”7.

As one of the lowest-cost domestic producers, EQT stands to benefit from its position as a leading supplier of natural gas to a world suffering from critically low energy reserves. The Russian invasion of Ukraine and threats to hold natural gas exports hostage have spurred a surge in European energy prices, generating long-term agreements by European countries to purchase U.S. natural gas.This strong demand and elevated prices have helped EQT strengthen its balance sheet and position it to take advantage as opportunities emerge for natural gas to plug the gaps in the global energy transition from fossil fuels to renewables.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Most Undervalued Natural Gas Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds.  Suggested articles:10 Best Healthcare Stocks for Recession12 52-week Low Dividend Stocks To Consider15 Stocks That Have Increased Dividends for 25 Years Disclosure: None. 11 Most Undervalued Natural Gas Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Motorola Solutions is a leader in mission-critical communications products, solutions, and services for communities and businesses. MSI is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).MSI shares provide exposure to technology paired with an income stream; Motorola Solutions' annual dividend currently yields 1.4%, nicely above its Zacks sector average.Certainly a positive, the company has been committed to increasingly rewarding its shareholders, growing its payout by more than 11% over the last five years.In addition, MSI's growth trajectory shouldn't be ignored; earnings are forecasted to climb nearly 12% in its current fiscal year (FY22) and a further 9% in FY23.The projected earnings growth comes on top of forecasted Y/Y revenue upticks of 9% in FY22 and 6.3% in FY23.Story continuesMongoDBMongoDB provides a developer data platform that offers services and tools necessary to build distributed applications at the performance and scale that users demand.MDB's earnings outlook has shifted notably higher over the last several months, helping land the stock into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Further, MDB carries a strong growth profile; earnings are forecasted to soar more than 150% in its current fiscal year (FY23) and a further 80% in FY24.MDB's top line is also healthy, with estimates suggesting Y/Y growth of 44% in FY23 and 23% in FY24.And for the cherry on top, MongoDB has a stellar earnings track record; MDB has exceeded earnings and revenue estimates in ten consecutive quarters.Impressively, two of the company's last three bottom line beats have been by triple-digit percentages.ZscalerZscaler is one of the world's leading providers of cloud-based security solutions, offering a full range of enterprise network security services.Like the stocks above, the company's earnings outlook has recently improved, helping land ZS into a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Increasing demand for cyber-security solutions has benefitted the company significantly, helping it exceed earnings and revenue estimates in each quarter dating back to 2018.Just in its latest release, Zscaler registered an 11.5% EPS surprise and reported revenue 4.3% above expectations.Bottom LineAs we're all aware, 2022 was packed with volatility, with violent price swings occurring regularly.However, targeting low-beta stocks can help shield investors against volatility, as these stocks are less susceptible to the market's movements.For those who seek exposure to tech, all three low-beta stocks above – Motorola Solutions, MongoDB and Zscaler – fit the criteria.In addition, all three have seen their earnings estimates drift higher as of late, indicating favorable business outlooks.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks? Our 5 best-performing strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's impressive +28.8% gain in 2021. Amazingly, they soared +40.3%, +48.2%, +67.6%, +94.4%, and +95.3%.

This move lagged the S&amp;P 500's daily gain of 1.19%. Elsewhere, the Dow gained 0.76%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 0.29%.Heading into today, shares of the coffee chain had gained 6.89% over the past month, lagging the Retail-Wholesale sector's gain of 8.04% and outpacing the S&amp;P 500's gain of 4.06% in that time.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Starbucks as it approaches its next earnings report date. This is expected to be February 2, 2023. On that day, Starbucks is projected to report earnings of $0.77 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 6.94%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $8.79 billion, up 9.21% from the prior-year quarter.SBUX's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $3.42 per share and revenue of $35.94 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +15.54% and +11.43%, respectively.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Starbucks should also be noted by investors. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.15% lower within the past month. Starbucks currently has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).Digging into valuation, Starbucks currently has a Forward P/E ratio of 30.71. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 22.01, so we one might conclude that Starbucks is trading at a premium comparatively.Story continuesInvestors should also note that SBUX has a PEG ratio of 2.22 right now. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. Retail - Restaurants stocks are, on average, holding a PEG ratio of 2.09 based on yesterday's closing prices.The Retail - Restaurants industry is part of the Retail-Wholesale sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 216, which puts it in the bottom 15% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite continued to progress, rising 0.6% in the week, but the S&amp;P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.7% and 2.7%, respectively.Economic data released through the week, especially from the yet-robust labor market, made investors nervous about the Fed not being satisfied with the current level of economic slowdown. Jobs, being a key indicator of how an economy is doing, can be a game-changing statistic, influencing the Fed to bring interest rates down. On the other hand, fears of a recession were further stoked by industrial production and the retail sector declining much higher than expected.The markets are currently between a rock and a hard place, and investors are unable to make up their minds about what to make of the economic data. Robust numbers mean that the Fed’s inflation alarms might be ringing, and weak numbers suggest that the central bank may have already gone too far. Friday’s rebound from overselling earlier in the week, however, helped the Nasdaq keep its head above water as we go deeper into the earnings season.Regardless of market conditions, we, here at Zacks, provide investors with unbiased guidance on how to beat the market. As usual, Zacks Research guided investors over the past three months with its time-tested methodologies. Given the prevailing market uncertainty, you may want to look at our feats to prepare better for your next action.Here are some of our key achievements:Banco Bilbao, Syndax Pharmaceuticals Soar Following Zacks Rank UpgradeShares of Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria, S.A.

SNDX, which was also upgraded to a Zacks Rank #1 on the same day,  has returned 17.6% since then.Zacks Rank, our short-term rating system, has earnings estimate revisions at its core. Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements. Story continuesThis stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +24.8% since 1988.

PRTS and Tecnoglass Inc.

The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Sysco The ModelWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.09bUS$2.48bUS$2.78bUS$3.00bUS$3.13bUS$3.22bUS$3.31bUS$3.40bUS$3.48bUS$3.56bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x6Analyst x6Analyst x4Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 3.13%Est @ 2.78%Est @ 2.54%Est @ 2.37%Est @ 2.26% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.8% US$2.0kUS$2.2kUS$2.3kUS$2.3kUS$2.2kUS$2.2kUS$2.1kUS$2.0kUS$1.9kUS$1.8k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$21bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.8%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$3.6b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (6.8%– 2.0%) = US$75bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$75b÷ ( 1 + 6.8%)10= US$39bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$60b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$79.3, the company appears quite good value at a 33% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Sysco as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.8%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.806. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for SyscoStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is well covered by earnings.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Consumer Retailing market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Trading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Although the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price?

In that report, analysts expect Sysco to post earnings of $0.83 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 45.61%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $18.73 billion, up 14.78% from the year-ago period.SYY's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $4.14 per share and revenue of $76.5 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +27.38% and +11.45%, respectively.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Sysco.

The company's stock saw a decent share price growth in the teens level on the NASDAQGS over the last few months. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Today I will analyse the most recent data on Monster Beverage’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists. Check out our latest analysis for Monster Beverage What's The Opportunity In Monster Beverage?According to my valuation model, Monster Beverage seems to be fairly priced at around 7.24% above my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Monster Beverage today, you’d be paying a relatively reasonable price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $93.25, then there isn’t really any room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. In addition to this, Monster Beverage has a low beta, which suggests its share price is less volatile than the wider market.What kind of growth will Monster Beverage generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by 74% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Monster Beverage. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder?

Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on MNST, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value.

101,cb5690b2-1a5f-3e3c-abe4-1c470c46423e,HST,2023-01-24,Host Hotels Vs. Apple Hospitality: Which REIT Is The Better Buy Right Now?,Benzinga,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/host-hotels-vs-apple-hospitality-190312505.html,1674500592,STORY,['HST'],"[After terrible performances in 2022, real estate investment trusts (REITs) that own and operate hotels and resorts have been making a solid comeback. Over the past month, 9 of 11 hotel REITs have increased share prices, and all 11 have risen 4% or more in just the last five trading days.But with 11 hotel REITs to choose from, which one should an investor lean toward for a possible purchase? Take a look at two of the most popular hotel REITs to see which one is a better buy right now:Host Hotels and Resorts Inc. (NASDAQ: HST) is a Bethesda, Maryland-based hotel REIT that calls itself “the world’s largest lodging REIT.” It’s an S&amp;P 500 company that owns and operates 42,300 rooms in 73 hotels in 20 of the largest markets across the U.S. and another five hotels in Canada and Brazil. It was formed in 1993 and has a market capitalization of $12.63 billion.Host Hotels and Resorts’ portfolio includes well-known names such as Marriott, Hilton, Sheraton and Hyatt. Many of its properties are upscale in central business districts that are conveniently located near airports.Apple Hospitality REIT Inc. (NYSE: APLE) is a Richmond, Virginia-based hotel REIT, formed in 2007. It has a portfolio of approximately 29,000 rooms in 220 hotels in 87 markets across 37 states. Its portfolio includes 96 Marriott, 119 Hilton and four Hyatt hotels and one independent hotel. It has a market capitalization of $3.84 billion.Size and DiversityDespite Apple Hospitality owning more hotels, give a slight edge to Host Hotels and Resorts in this category. It has been in business longer, operates more rooms, has a much larger capitalization and has the diversity of owning international properties.Performance Over TimeSince 2015, Host Hotels and Resorts’ total return is 7.48%, while Apple Hospitality has a much greater total return of 29.63%. Since the COVID-19 low of March 16, 2020, Host Hotels has a total return of 88.57%, while Apple Hospitality’s total return is 149.57%.Story continuesOver the last three months, Host Hotels and Resorts has had a total return of 0.45%, and Apple Hospitality had a total return of 6.15%. Apple Hospitality is the clear winner in this category, for both short- and long-term performance.Dividend YieldHost Hotels and Resorts pays a quarterly dividend of $0.12 per share, or $0.48 per share annually, for a present yield of 2.7%. Apple Hospitality pays a monthly dividend of $0.08 per share, or $0.96 per share annually, for a present yield of 5.7%. Host Hotels recently paid a bonus dividend of $0.20 per share, while Apple Hospitality paid a bonus dividend of $0.08 per share.Apple Hospitality’s yield is significantly higher and it pays out monthly, so give this category to Apple Hospitality.Dividend Growth and StabilityHost Hotels and Resorts cut its $0.20 per share quarterly dividend to $0.03 per share in March 2020, paid no dividends until March 2022 and has been trying to grow its dividend back since then. But the dividend is still 40% below pre-COVID-19 levels.Apple Hospitality cut its $0.10 per share monthly dividend to $0.01 per share in March 2021, but has since raised it several times and is now only 20% below its pre-COVID-19 level.Although the dividend growth and stability of both companies is not good, Apple Hospitality’s is still better so it prevails in this category as well.Dividend Coverage by FFOHost Hotels and Resorts has forward funds from operation (FFO) of $1.78 and an annual dividend of $0.48, for a payout ratio of 26.9%. Apple Hospitality has a forward FFO of $1.54 which covers the $0.96 dividend with a 62% payout ratio.No contest here – Host Hotels is clearly superior in FFO dividend coverage.FFO Multiple Host Hotels and Resorts has an FFO multiple of 9.77, while Apple Hospitality has an FFO multiple of 10.89. It’s only a slight difference, but Host Hotels gets the better of this category.Debt RatioHost Hotels and Resorts has debt of $4.78 billion and a total debt-to-equity ratio of 68.52. Apple Hospitality has debt of $1.43 billion and a debt-to-equity ratio of 43.97. Score this category in favor of Apple Hospitality.Most Recent Operating ResultsHost Hotels and Resorts had revenue of $1.19 billion in third-quarter operating results, up 40.88% from the third quarter of 2021, and FFO of $0.38, up 36% from $0.20 in the third quarter of 2021, but missed analyst expectations by $0.01.Apple Hospitality’s third-quarter revenue of $341.15 million was 23.09% ahead of the third quarter of 2021. Its FFO of $0.45 was 36.3% better than the $0.33 FFO in the third quarter of 2021 and a penny better than analyst estimates.Both REITs had improved third quarters from the third quarter of 2021. Host Hotels and Resorts improved its revenue by a higher percentage than Apple Hospitality, but the latter’s FFO percentage increase was slightly higher, albeit by a fraction. Additionally, Apple Hospitality’s FFO beat analysts’ expectations by a penny while Host Hotels and Resorts missed Wall Street estimates by a penny.Third-quarter operating results are close so it’s best to call this category a draw.SummaryHost Hotels outperformed Apple Hospitality in size and diversity, dividend coverage by FFO and FFO multiple. Apple Hospitality won the categories of performance over time, dividend yield, dividend growth and stability and debt ratio. The REITs’ most recent operating results were basically a draw.While both of these hotel REITs could greatly outperform 2022 results, Apple Hospitality seems to be a slightly better choice. Its monthly dividend payout and yield, better dividend growth and superior performance over time are hard factors to ignore.Check Out More on Real Estate from BenzingaBezos-Backed Startup Lets You Become A Landlord With $100Analysts Are Bullish On Industrial Real Estate: Here Are 2 Private Market Offerings To Gain ExposureThis Little-Known REIT Is Producing Double-Digit Returns In A Bear Market: How?Don't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!

The Dallas-based carrier has offered millions in bonus pay to its employees for the disruptions, which left many workers as helpless as stranded passengers.Southwest gave approximately $45 million to its pilots union, which works out to about $4,500 per pilot. That’s on top of bonuses that were already given for holidays and flight reassignments. The Dallas Morning News reports that “several [other] operational workgroups” were also offered bonuses for the troubles, but did not detail which groups were included.The bonuses will be given to employees who worked shifts between Dec. 20 and Jan. 3.Southwest suffered an operational meltdown beginning Dec. 22, when a winter storm affected Chicago and Denver, two of the airline’s major hubs. That impacted the carrier’s flight rescheduling software, which was unable to keep up with the changes and eventually lost track of thousands of employees, leaving planes without pilots and flight attendant crews—and stranding workers alongside frustrated passengers.CEO Bob Jordan has repeatedly apologized to both groups, vowing it will not happen again, and hiring a third-party consultant to look into the problem and ensuring the software is updated.The significant payments to workers comes as there is growing unrest among pilots about long-running contract negotiations. For the past three years, Southwest and its pilots’ union have been working on a new deal. And last week, the president of the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association called for a strike authorization vote, which will take place beginning May 1. Votes will be counted at the end of the month.Even if pilots vote to strike, they won’t be able to walk off the job anytime soon. It’s just the first step in a series of actions required before a work stoppage can begin, under a federal law overseeing airline/labor relations.Story continuesMediation between the airline and its pilots is scheduled to resume on Tuesday.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: Air India slammed for ‘systemic failure’ after unruly male passenger flying business class urinated on a woman traveling from New YorkMeghan Markle’s real sin that the British public can’t forgive–and Americans can’t understand‘It just doesn’t work.’ The world’s best restaurant is shutting down as its owner calls the modern fine dining model ‘unsustainable’Bob Iger just put his foot down and told Disney employees to come back into the office]"

With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let’s examine TransDigm Group’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity. Check out our latest analysis for TransDigm Group What's The Opportunity In TransDigm Group?The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to my valuation model. It’s trading around 4.6% below my intrinsic value, which means if you buy TransDigm Group today, you’d be paying a fair price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $717.89, then there’s not much of an upside to gain from mispricing. Is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since TransDigm Group’s share price is quite volatile, we could potentially see it sink lower (or rise higher) in the future, giving us another chance to buy. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.What kind of growth will TransDigm Group generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. TransDigm Group's earnings over the next few years are expected to double, indicating a very optimistic future ahead. This should lead to stronger cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? TDG’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on TDG, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.In light of this, if you'd like to do more analysis on the company, it's vital to be informed of the risks involved.

This takes the annual payment to 1.8% of the current stock price, which is about average for the industry. View our latest analysis for Schlumberger Schlumberger's Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsSolid dividend yields are great, but they only really help us if the payment is sustainable. But before making this announcement, Schlumberger's earnings quite easily covered the dividend. The business is returning a large chunk of its cash to shareholders, which means it is not being used to grow the business.Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 73.0%. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 15%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.historic-dividendDividend VolatilityThe company's dividend history has been marked by instability, with at least one cut in the last 10 years. Since 2013, the dividend has gone from $1.10 total annually to $1.00. Dividend payments have shrunk at a rate of less than 1% per annum over this time frame. Declining dividends isn't generally what we look for as they can indicate that the company is running into some challenges.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowWith a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to evaluate if earnings per share is growing, which could point to a growing dividend in the future. It's encouraging to see that Schlumberger has been growing its earnings per share at 15% a year over the past five years. Schlumberger definitely has the potential to grow its dividend in the future with earnings on an uptrend and a low payout ratio.In SummaryOverall, this is probably not a great income stock, even though the dividend is being raised at the moment. The company hasn't been paying a very consistent dividend over time, despite only paying out a small portion of earnings. This company is not in the top tier of income providing stocks.Story continuesInvestors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company.

Revenues rose on a year-over-year basis but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate.PKG has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 13.2%, on average.Packaging Corporation of America Price and EPS Surprise Packaging Corporation of America Price and EPS SurprisePackaging Corporation of America price-eps-surprise | Packaging Corporation of America QuoteQ4 EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Packaging Corp’s fourth-quarter earnings per share is pegged at $2.24, suggesting a decline of 18.8% from the prior-year quarter’s reported level.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total sales is pinned at $2.05 billion, indicating a 0.6% rise from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.Factors at PlayPackaging Corporation’s fourth-quarter results are expected to reflect the impacts of the weakness in packaging demand as global and domestic economic conditions have been unfavorable due to ongoing inflationary pressures, high interest rates, and supply-chain disruptions. Customers have been working to reduce their high inventory levels, which has been affecting order flow and demand for PKG’s products.Given that packaging products are essential for the distribution of food, beverage and pharmaceutical products, the demand for these products and growth in e-commerce activities are likely to have aided the performance of the packaging segment. The segment generates around 91% of PKG's revenues.The fourth quarter had four fewer shipping days than the third quarter, leading to lower total box shipments. Thus, the company anticipated lower sales volumes for the Packaging segment.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment’s quarterly revenues is pegged at $1,905 million, suggesting growth of 1.7% from the year-ago quarter’s reported number. The consensus mark for the segment’s operating income is pinned at $289 million, indicating a fall of 22% from the prior-year reported figure.Story continuesIn the Paper segment, while the company is likely to have gained from the price increase that took effect in September, volume is likely to have been lower than that in the seasonally stronger third quarter. Scheduled outage expenses are expected to have been higher. Expected higher operating costs, primarily labor and benefit expenses, along with anticipated colder weather resulting in higher energy costs, are expected to have hurt the segment’s profits in the quarter under review.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Paper segment’s revenues is pegged at $152 million for the December-end quarter, suggesting growth of 6.2% from the year-ago reported figure. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment’s operating income is pinned at $28 million, indicating a 33.3% increase from the $21 million reported in the prior-year quarter.What Our Model IndicatesOur proven model doesn’t conclusively predict an earnings beat for Packaging Corp this season.

But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors? We'll need to take a closer look to find out.We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.Hologic has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Edwards Lifesciences has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now. This means that HOLX's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.HOLX currently has a forward P/E ratio of 22.83, while EW has a forward P/E of 31.79. We also note that HOLX has a PEG ratio of 1.50. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. EW currently has a PEG ratio of 2.75.Another notable valuation metric for HOLX is its P/B ratio of 4.08. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, EW has a P/B of 7.88.These are just a few of the metrics contributing to HOLX's Value grade of A and EW's Value grade of C.Story continuesHOLX stands above EW thanks to its solid earnings outlook, and based on these valuation figures, we also feel that HOLX is the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The prince's popularity is at a record low after the release of 'Spare' — but the Duke and Duchess aren't done telling their story yetPrince Harry has set more than one record with his debut memoir. While “Spare” enjoys its title as the fastest-selling nonfiction book of all time, Harry’s popularity — especially in the U.K. — is quickly moving in the opposite direction.A recent poll by YouGov found that Prince Harry’s favorability is at a record low since “Spare” came out.Don't missRich young Americans have lost confidence in the stock market — and are betting on these 3 assets instead.

Gen Z requires a whopping $171K/year — but how do your own expectations compare?Following the highly lucrative PR frenzy around Harry's memoir and his Netflix docuseries with Meghan, critics wonder if the couple’s popularity has hit a peak — and if people are experiencing “Harry and Meghan fatigue.”One critic from The New York Times speculates that despite Americans’ high tolerance for redemptive stories and family dysfunction, the media saturation of the ex-royals’ troubles has grown so tiresome that it may damage their potential future earnings. Forbes calls “Spare” “brand suicide.”But their media empire shows no signs of slowing down. So, what's next for Prince Harry and Meghan?Has “Spare” changed opinions of Harry?The royal tell-all reveals explosive claims about Harry's personal life, including grief after his mother’s passing, his dysfunctional family dynamics, and the hardships he and wife Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, were forced to overcome.The reach of both the Netflix docuseries and the book “Spare” suggests that Harry and Meghan’s audience has grown significantly, but some viewers may be losing interest.Prince Harry’s favorability in the U.K. tumbled to a record low, according to a poll by YouGov. According to a survey of 1,691 British adults, 68% of them have a negative opinion of Harry, a 22% increase since September 2022.Story continuesComparatively, 34% of Americans hold an unfavorable view of Prince Harry, a 6% increase since December 2022.While promoting his book on The Late Show With Stephen Colbert, Harry proclaimed that “America is a great place to live,” and one particularly enthusiastic Twitter user replied “He’s our prince now.”British viewers promptly responded with variations of “America can keep him.”Last week, parody show South Park made headlines by releasing an episode dubbed ""Worldwide Privacy Tour"" that lampooned the couple's recent media moves and fallout with North American audiences.Record breaking numbersHarry and Meghan have generated unparalleled metrics with their recent media content. In Dec. 2022, the “Harry &amp; Meghan” docuseries became Netflix’s highest-viewed documentary ever, recording 81.55 million global viewing hours in its first week of release.The couple then promptly released their second Archewell production, “Live to Lead,” but the traction from their royal drama didn’t carry many viewers to the Nelson Mandela inspired docuseries. “Live to Lead” didn’t make any top 100 list of best TV shows, let alone Netflix’s top 10 where “Harry &amp; Meghan'' remained for four weeks following its release.A PR expert interviewed by The Mirror said the project was “one of the first tests commercially of their brand strategy to pull people in [with] personal drama and hope they stay for philanthropy.” So far it’s looking like that might not work.Now “Spare” is raking in the big numbers. The widely publicized memoir earned the Guiness World Record title for the fastest-selling nonfiction book of all time, having sold more than 1.4 million copies in the U.S., Canada and the U.K. after just one day.According to publisher Penguin Random House, “Spare” brought in the largest first-day sales total for any nonfiction book it had ever published, beating out Barack Obama's ""A Promised Land.""Despite plenty of criticism from British royalists, “Spare” also became the U.K.’s Bestselling Memoir within one week, selling 467,183 copies, according to figures from Nielsen BookData. The only books to have enjoyed higher first-week sales since Nielsen's records began were four Harry Potter novels and Dan Brown's The Lost Symbol.There is historical precedent for the book’s popularity as “Spare” isn’t the only memoir written by a member of the royal family that has done extremely well. It follows in the footsteps of Harry’s late mother Princess Diana who published “Diana: Her True Story in Her Own Words” in 1992. The first edition sold over 5 million copies, according to Forbes.According to Penguin Random House, “Spare” is now on its second round of printing after a first run of two million.Read more: You could be the landlord of Walmart, Whole Foods and CVS (and collect fat grocery store-anchored income on a quarterly basis)Is there anywhere to go from here?Harry and Meghan’s royal drama has been narrativized to the nth degree, previously arriving in the format of a 12-episode Spotify podcast series, and a six-hour Netflix docuseries. Including the book, the couple has earned a total of $138 million from these deals.Chairman of the crisis management firm La Brea Media, Howard Bragman, told The New York Times that finite material like this has limited mileage. His advice to the couple would have been that you can only really tell your story once.Harry and Meghan’s spokeswoman told Vanity Fair however that “these look-back projects have been years in the making, and now that they have been delivered, this chapter is closed.”“Spare” will not mark the end of the couple’s burgeoning content empire, but will likely conclude the personal narrative.What’s next for Harry and Meghan?As a part of Harry and Meghan’s multi-year deal with Netflix, “Heart of Invictus"" — a docuseries about the Invictus Games, an international competition for wounded servicemen and women – is expected to come out this summer.Harry is also expected to produce a book about the subject. According to Entertainment Online, the couple’s deal with Penguin Random House will include a total of four books, including one book about the Invictus Games, and others exploring Harry’s life in public service.Despite rumors circulating in the British press that the publisher is banking on another tell-all memoir from Meghan, a source assured Vanity Fair that she's not working on a book.The book deal was originally thought to be worth $20 million, but Entertainment Tonight reports it will bring in between $35 and $40 million.More Spotify content is forthcoming as well. Though the status of Meghan’s podcast series “Archetypes” is unclear after audio producer Rebecca Sananès stepped down from her season one role, it's clear that something is in the works. Page Six reported that Sananès is replaced by media executive Serena Regan.After the media quotas have been fulfilled, the couple will likely return to their philanthropic work, according to the hosts of Hello Magazine’s podcast series “A Right Royal.""“I think most people would like to see more of that perhaps and less of the looking back to the past, because we’ve heard so much now about this rift.”What to read nextYou can start earning passive income from real estate in minutes — and you don't have to be a landlord to cash inAmericans are paying nearly 40% more on home insurance compared to 12 years ago — here's how to spend less on peace of mindThe US dollar has lost 98% of its purchasing power since 1971 — invest in this stable asset before you lose your retirement fundThis article provides information only and should not be construed as advice.

This will make Ørsted the 100% proprietor of the project, with PSEG supporting the onshore infrastructure construction of the same.The transaction between the two companies is anticipated to close in the first half of 2023.Rationale Behind the DivestmentTo promote clean energy, PSEG acquired a 25% equity interest in Ørsted’s Ocean Wind project in April 2021. Since then, PSEG and Ørsted have teamed up for the development of the project, which is scheduled to be commissioned in 2025.However, for the best interest of the project and New Jersey’s offshore wind goals, PSEG decided to divest its interest in the project to continue to support offshore wind project developments in New Jersey.PSEG’s Clean Energy GoalsPSEG targets to become a carbon-free energy infrastructure company. It intends to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2030, which include direct greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (Scope 1) and indirect GHG emissions from operations (Scope 2) at both PSEG Power and PSE&amp;G.Moreover, as part of its clean energy goal, PSE&amp;G continues to modernize its gas distribution system as part of its Gas System Modernization Program (“GSMP”) to reduce the release of methane. Through GSMP II, from 2018 through 2023, the company expects an approximate 22% reduction in methane, and assuming the continuation of GSMP, an approximate 60% reduction in methane emissions is projected from 2011 through 2030.PEG invested $400 million over the past 10 years to promote clean energy in New Jersey. The company plans to file an extension of GSMP in the first quarter of 2023, which will continue and accelerate these methane reductions.Such strategic investment programs are expected to help PSEG offer more reliable, resilient, cleaner and affordable energy to customers, along with boosting the company’s bottom line over the long term.Story continuesGrowth Prospects &amp; Peer MovesUtilities in the United States are gradually transitioning to renewable sources of energy as they strive to adopt eco-friendly ways to deliver more sustainable and reliable energy to their customers.The latest report from the U.S. Energy Information Administration suggests a rise in the generation of electricity from renewable sources. Per the report, the generation of electricity from utility-scale solar and wind will increase from 16% in 2023 to 18% in 2024.Thus, utilities’ move to carve out a position in the renewable market and diversify their energy portfolio is prudent. Apart from PSEG, utilities that have been looking to decarbonize their operations and provide clean means of energy are as follows:American Electric Power Corp AEP makes incremental investments in renewable generation projects across the United States. The company’s plans include growing its renewable generation portfolio to approximately 50% of the total capacity by 2030. Its 2023-2027 capital investment forecast includes $8.6 billion in the regulated renewable plan.The company has a long-term earnings growth rate of 6.1%. AEP shares have risen 3.5% in the past year.DTE Energy DTE is investing steadily to enhance its renewable generation assets. Over the next 15 years, DTE Electric plans to withdraw a portion of its coal-fired generation and boost the natural gas-fired generation and renewable mix. Per the recent Integrated Resource Plan, DTE aims to develop more than 15,000 MW of renewables to power homes, businesses and industrial facilities over the next two decades.DTE Energy boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 6%. Its shares have increased 6% in the past three months.Duke Energy DUK has taken an initiative to expand the renewable asset base and aims to reach its target of net-zero carbon emissions from electric generation by 2050. The company already lowered its carbon emissions in 2021 by more than 44% since 2005 and is now expanding its 2050 net-zero goals to include Scope 2 and certain Scope 3 emissions.The long-term earnings growth rate of Duke Energy is pegged at 5.5%. Shares of DUK have returned 14.8% in the past three months.Price MovementIn the past three months, shares of PSEG have increased 9.4% compared with the industry’s growth of 8.9%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks RankPSEG currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

In that report, analysts expect NRG Energy to post earnings of $1.35 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 239.18%.Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for NRG Energy. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection has moved 7.56% higher. NRG Energy is holding a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) right now.Investors should also note NRG Energy's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 6.47.

Rising earnings estimates for Fiscal 2023 are especially intriguing as the company rounds out FY22 with its Q4 report.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchQ4 Preview: Halliburton looks poised to post another quarter of impressive growth following a standout Q3 that saw sales increase 39% year over year at $5.35 billion. Continuing this trend, Q4 sales are expected at $5.58 billion which would represent 2% growth from last quarter and 30% year-over-year growth with sales at $4.28 billion in Q4 2021.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOn the bottom line, earnings are forecasted at $0.67 a share which is an 11% increase from last quarter and 96% YoY growth with earnings at $0.36 per share in the prior-year quarter. This would round out fiscal year 2022 seeing 95% YoY growth at $2.11 per share compared to $1.08 a share in FY21.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchEarnings ESP:  The Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction is virtually flat for Halliburton’s Q4 earnings with the Zacks Consensus at $0.67 per share and the Most Accurate Estimate at $0.67 a share as well. Still, Halliburton has beaten earnings expectations by 7.14% and 8.89% respectively in the last two quarters making the likelihood of topping bottom-line estimates more probable considering its somewhat surprising growth over the last few quarters.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTakeaway:  Another impressive quarter could see Halliburton surpassing its 52-week highs of $43.99 a share seen last June as the rising earnings estimate revisions are a positive sign that the company could top Q4 expectations and offer strong guidance for fiscal 2023.NextEra Energy Partners NEP Another company that has received favorable earnings estimate revisions leading up to its fourth-quarter earnings report on January 25 is NextEra Energy Partners (NEP). NextEra Energy stock is also sporting a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) with earnings estimates noticeably up for its current fiscal year 2022 and FY23 as the limited partnership focused on clean energy projects pushes closer to its 52-week highs as well.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchQ4 Preview:  NextEra Energy is expected to have a stellar quarter in regard to year-over-year growth with sales expected at $313.13 million, up 35% from Q4 2021. Earnings are projected at $0.52 per share compared to -$0.12 a share in the prior year quarter.This would round out NextEra’s fiscal 2022 with sales up 28% at $1.26 billion and earning up a very impressive 225% to $5.76 a share compared to $1.77 in 2021.Earnings ESP:  While NextEra is expected to have a strong quarter, the Zacks ESP indicates NEP could miss earnings expectations by -4.46% with the Zacks Consensus for NEP’s Q4 earnings at $0.52 per share and the Most Accurate Consensus at $0.50 per share.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTakeaway:  Despite the probability of NextEra missing Q4 earnings expectations the rising earnings estimate revisions are a positive sign for a company that has beaten bottom-line expectations for three consecutive quarters. Earnings Estimates trending higher for Fiscal 2023 is also significant as NextEra’s FY22 will be very tough to follow and annual earnings are expected to dip -48% year over year.However, trading around $74 a share and 24.7X earnings, NEP stock is still 25% from its decade-long high of 33X earnings and also trades at a slight discount to the median of 25.4X.Bottom Line Halliburton (HAL) and NextEra Energy Partners (NEP) look poised to have strong fourth-quarter earnings reports and the rising earnings estimate revisions are a great sign that both companies may give positive guidance for fiscal 2023. This could be a catalyst that boosts both Halliburton and NextEra stock closer to their 52-week highs and perhaps eclipse these levels.  Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NASDAQ:PDCO) might not be the most widely known stock at the moment, it saw a decent share price growth in the teens level on the NASDAQGS over the last few months. With many analysts covering the mid-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Today I will analyse the most recent data on Patterson Companies’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists. View our latest analysis for Patterson Companies What's The Opportunity In Patterson Companies?The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to my valuation model. It’s trading around 9.86% above my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Patterson Companies today, you’d be paying a relatively reasonable price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $26.31, there’s only an insignificant downside when the price falls to its real value. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that Patterson Companies’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.Can we expect growth from Patterson Companies?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Patterson Companies' earnings growth are expected to be in the teens in the upcoming years, indicating a solid future ahead. This should lead to robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? PDCO’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on PDCO, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.If you want to dive deeper into Patterson Companies, you'd also look into what risks it is currently facing.

Combining predictive analytics to understand their customer base better and improve how dealers connect with them through hyper-relevant marketing gives business leaders a unique advantage to leverage their first-party data to drive positive business outcomes.""Dealers and OEMs have experienced unprecedented market conditions over the last few years,"" said Aaron Baldwin, chief product officer at automotiveMastermind. ""A great example is customers buying out their lease contracts instead of entering new lease agreements. We see buyouts north of 40% in most brands. With our expertise in predictive analytics, we recognized the opportunity for OEMs and dealers to take better control of their first-party data to enable them to proactively navigate difficult and varying macro-economic conditions.""Market ImpactMarket Impact is an analytics dashboard that utilizes registration and loyalty data to give dealers an unbiased view of their market performance. Traditionally, dealers did not have a holistic view of the new and used market relative to their competitors. Market Impact allows dealers to compare their performance with other dealers – as well as across high-level make, model and segment benchmarks – regardless of brand. With this information, dealers can see data on pre-owned sales (in available markets) – information not readily available from OEMs. Since Market Impact sources information from sales and registration data, it gives a more complete view of both new and pre-owned data by standardizing markets across the nation.Story continuesGaining insight into purchase trends in their own backyard enables dealers to reduce defections, boost their customer loyalty, identify critical opportunities and improve inventory mix based on what is selling best in their area – ultimately increasing their profitability.Lease BuyoutWith the new Lease Buyout feature, dealers will have visibility into customers who have purchased their leased vehicle as opposed to turning it in or trading it for another vehicle. From 2019 to 2022, there has been a 275% increase in customers buying their lease out (from 12% in 2019 to 45% in 2022), according to data from dealerships who use Mastermind. Dealers will be able to visualize these customers and view them as a lease intender instead of as a used car customer. This gives dealers and OEMs the opportunity to focus on rebuilding their lease portfolios and resecuring their loyalty potential.""Our commitment to leverage our data ecosystem to create high value sales opportunities remains our core focus,"" said Baldwin. ""Giving dealers insights into their lease buyout customers is another example of how automotiveMastermind is helping the industry solve tomorrow's challenges, today.""Digital AudiencesaM has also integrated its data enabled audience segments into digital advertising networks beginning with Meta. The new Digital Audiences solution is an audience builder that enables dealers to create custom or pre-built audiences from their enriched first-party customer data. These segments are automatically and continuously updated in their Meta Ad Accounts.Digital Audiences extends the value and proven results of aM's proprietary Behavior Prediction Score® (BPS®), which uses data to help dealers identify potential buyers by ranking them on a scale of 1-100 based on how likely they are to be in market for a vehicle, to a new channel.Advertising can be an expensive line item for dealers, and blanket approaches to advertising often waste money by targeting people who are not in-market. Digital Audiences combined with the BPS® and segment activation offers a way to identify an in-market audience accurately and efficiently, while also enabling dealers to target potential customers over multiple channels, increasing touchpoints with loyalty and conquest audiences.aM dealer partners who participated in the Digital Audiences pilot program saw a 48% increase in clicks per unique customer versus only using first-party data.""Whether you need to move cars faster, acquire more vehicles at better prices, drive loyalty, streamline marketing spend or conquest new opportunities, Mastermind has you covered,"" said Baldwin. ""Market Impact, Lease Buyout and Digital Audiences are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to enhancements and integrations we'll introduce this year.""About automotiveMastermindFounded in 2012, automotiveMastermind®, part of S&amp;P Global Mobility, empowers dealers to close more deals by predicting future buyers and consistently marketing to them. Its proprietary automated sales and marketing platform, Mastermind, helps dealerships generate success in loyalty, service and conquest portfolios through a combination of turnkey predictive analytics, proactive marketing and dedicated consultative services.automotiveMastermind is headquartered in New York City.For more information, visit automotiveMastermind.com.About S&amp;P Global MobilityS&amp;P Global Mobility is a division of S&amp;P Global (NYSE: SPGI).

The top line beat the consensus mark by 1.7% and came higher than our estimate of $3,930.2 million.The quarterly results have benefited from a rising loan receivables portfolio paving the way for higher interest and fees on loans. A growing purchase volume, resulting from increased contributions from its five sales platforms, also contributed to the upside.

This week’s list includes Discover Financial DFS, Kimberly Clark KMB, Johnson &amp; Johnson JNJ and Synchrony Financial SYF.Making Sense of Early Q4 Results: Is an Earnings Cliff Coming?We get into the heart of the Q4 earnings season this week, with more than 250 companies on deck to report quarterly results, including 86 S&amp;P 500 members.By the end of this week, we will have seen quarterly results from about 28% of all S&amp;P 500 members and will have a very good sense of whether the earnings-cliff narrative has started unfolding or been further pushed out.This narrative suggests that the combined effects of softening demand resulting from the extraordinary Fed tightening and persistent cost pressures will prompt management teams across many industries to provide downbeat guidance. Related to this fear is the view that current earnings estimates remain elevated and need to get cut significantly to get in-sync with the unfolding economic ground reality.Regular readers of our earnings commentary know that we don't subscribe to this view. We see the 'earnings-cliff' type of world unfolding only in the backdrop of the U.S. economy heading towards a 'hard landing.'We see the risk of such a 'hard landing' as increasing if the Fed persists in its tightening policy beyond what the market has already priced in. But a hard-landing for the U.S. economy isn't our base case, which makes us a lot more sanguine in our earnings outlook given how much estimates have come down already.We find the Q4 results thus far, admittedly a small sample that is weighted towards the Finance sector (11% of S&amp;P 500 members have reported) as largely good-enough, reassuring, and in-line with our overall view of corporate profitability.We are starting to see some early signs of weakness in the consumer, with the Proctor &amp; Gamble (PG) report indicating some pushback to the company's ability to keep raising prices and the Discover Financial report indicating that households may be starting to have difficulty paying back their bills.Story continuesProctor &amp; Gamble experienced -6% decline in sales volume, the biggest in years, even as the +10% price increase during the quarter helped offset the impact of softer unit sales. The -6% decline in sales volume in 2022 Q4 followed -3% decline in the preceding period and -1% decline in 2022 Q2.For Q4, Procter &amp; Gamble's earnings dropped by -6.9% from the year-earlier period on -0.9% lower revenues. P&amp;G's numbers likely provide us with read-through for Kimberly Clark, Johnson &amp; Johnson and others that are on deck to report results this week.Discover Financial handily beat Q4 earnings and revenue estimates, but the card issuer offered disconcerting guidance for the net charge-off (NCO) rate for 2023. Broadly speaking, the charge-off rate is the proportion of the lender's loan portfolio that it expects to be delinquent. Discover's 2022 Q4 charge-off rate of 2.13% was up from 1.37% in the year-earlier period. Discover guided towards NCO rate in the range of 3.5% to 3.9% in 2023. It will be interesting to see if this week's Synchrony Financial report will validate these credit-quality trends.2022 Q4 Earnings Season ScorecardIncluding results from all the banks, we now have Q4 results from 55 S&amp;P 500 members or 11% of the index's total membership. Total earnings for these 55 index members are down -10.8% from the same period last year on +7.4% higher revenues, with 67.3% beating EPS estimates and an equal proportion beating revenue estimates.With 86 index members on deck to report Q4 results this week, we will have seen results from 141 index members or 28% of the index's total membership.The Earnings Big PictureEstimates for 2023 have been steadily coming down, as we have been flagging for some time now.Please note that the $1.955 trillion in expected aggregate earnings for the index in 2023 approximate to an index 'EPS' of $220.02, which compares to $216.89 in 2022.From their peak in mid-April 2022, S&amp;P 500 earnings estimates have been revised down by -10.2% for the index as a whole and by -12.3% on an ex-Energy basis, with much bigger cuts to estimates for the Construction, Consumer Discretionary, Retail, Tech and Aerospace sectors.For more details about the evolving earnings picture, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; A Good Enough Start to the Q4 Earnings Season Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

162,dba653c1-b566-3d5a-a688-f63ccafcdb2a,SYF,2023-01-24,Synchrony (SYF) Q4 Earnings and Revenues Surpass Estimates,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/synchrony-syf-q4-earnings-revenues-121512312.html,1674476112,STORY,['SYF-PA'],"[Synchrony (SYF) came out with quarterly earnings of $1.26 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.12 per share. This compares to earnings of $1.48 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 12.50%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this consumer credit company would post earnings of $1.42 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.47, delivering a surprise of 3.52%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.Synchrony , which belongs to the Zacks Financial - Miscellaneous Services industry, posted revenues of $4.11 billion for the quarter ended December 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.68%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $3.83 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Synchrony shares have added about 7.8% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 3.5%.What's Next for Synchrony?While Synchrony has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Synchrony: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead.

Hedge fund Elliott has built a big stake in Salesforce but says it wants to work with existing management. Rival hedge fund Citadel made a record-breaking profit last year. Synchrony is up premarket after an earnings beat but the rest of the calendar is pretty thin. Germany signals it's willing to let others deliver the Leopard 2 main battle tank to Ukraine as aid, but still isn't ready to do so itself. And crude oil makes a solid start to the week as speculative momentum builds and new sanctions on Russian diesel exports loom. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Monday, January 23.1. Dollar hits nine-month low with rate differentials set to narrowThe dollar fell to a nine-month low on market expectations that the Federal Reserve will only raise interest rates by 0.25 percent when it meets next week.With the European Central Bank still signaling at least one more hike of 50 basis points, the interest rate differential between the euro and the dollar is set to narrow over the next six months. The ECB’s policy-making council also meets next week.The euro rose as high as $1.0927 before retracing after the Deutsche Bundesbank said the German economy likely stagnated in the fourth quarter. Comments from Greek central bank governor Yannis Stournaras urging “more gradual” rate hikes also capped the euro’s gains.2. Elliot targets Salesforce as Citadel makes historySalesforce (NYSE:CRM) stock rose over 4% in premarket trading to a seven-week high after reports saying that hedge fund Elliott has taken a substantial stake in the software provider.The Wall Street Journal quoted Elliott managing partner Jesse Cohn as saying that the group is looking forward to “working constructively with Salesforce to realize the value befitting a company of its stature.”Story continuesSalesforce is one of a number of Big Tech companies to have recently been jolted into major cost-cutting by a revenue slowdown. The stock is up nearly 20% from its December lows but is still trading at only half its peak value.Elliott wasn't the only hedge fund making headlines over the weekend: new research suggested that Ken Griffin's Citadel had made the biggest profit of any hedge fund in history last year with a gain of $16 billion.3. Stocks set for quiet opening; Synchrony up after earnings beatU.S. stocks are set for a quiet opening to the week, in the absence of any major market-moving data and with the Lunar New Year also depressing trading volumes out of Asia.By 06:30 ET, Dow Jones futures were effectively unchanged, while S&amp;P 500 futures were down 0.2% and Nasdaq 100 futures were down 0.1%.The earnings calendar is also relatively thin, with Synchrony Financial (NYSE:SYF) – formerly GE Capital – first out of the gate with a 10% earnings beat. Synchrony stock rose over 3% in premarket in response.Oilfield services company Baker Hughes (NASDAQ:BKR) is also due to report early, with Zions (NASDAQ:ZION) and Brown &amp; Brown (NYSE:BRO) due to report after the bell.4. Germany signals movement on tanks for Ukraine, rails with France against Biden's IRAOnly two days after blocking such a move, Germany signaled it wouldn’t stop other European nations sending modern Leopard 2 battle tanks as military aid to Ukraine.Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said that Germany still isn’t ready to send tanks from its own tanks, but added, “If we were asked, we would not stand in the way.”Baerbock was speaking at a weekend meeting between the French and German governments which also resulted in the two countries complaining again about the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act, which they say discriminates against European companies.5. Oil up as speculative bets gain steamCrude oil prices made a strong start to the week as the market focused on new G7 sanctions that are set to come into force on Russia in the coming days. The U.S., Europe, and Japan are all set to ban imports of diesel from Russia, in an effort to further reduce the Kremlin’s revenue stream for conducting its war in Ukraine.Additionally, the prospect of rebounding Chinese demand has reignited speculative buying, as evidenced by the 7% gain in crude last week. The CFTC’s Commitments of Traders report showed speculative long interest in crude hitting a nine-week high as of Tuesday.By 06:45 ET, U.S. crude futures were up 0.5% at $82.08 a barrel, while Brent futures were up 0.6% at $88.17 a barrel.Related ArticlesRate hopes hit dollar, Elliott targets Salesforce, oil bets - what's moving marketsWHO launches funding appeal to battle health emergenciesYellen says critically important to restructure Zambia debt]"

After falling below $73 a barrel earlier this month, crude oil is gradually clawing back some of those gains. Both WTI and Brent now at early December highs with crude closing the day just below $82 a barrel.We want to bring in Stephen Schork, the Schork Group principal. Stephen, it's great to see you again. Certainly the trend has been to the upside when it comes to crude prices. Where are we headed? Are we headed even higher from here?STEPHEN SCHORK: Yes. That's where the current trend is taking us now, Seana. The narratives are winning out, the narrative being that market now is focused on China reopening. Market got a nice boost a few weeks ago when China increased by 1/5 its slated crude-oil imports for the new year. You have growing optimism out of OPEC that demand is going to stay strong.So that narrative is winning over the other narrative. That is demand destruction vis-a-vis economic contraction here in the US with certain macroeconomic signs pointing towards recession. Be that as it may, the China narrative is winning out.To your point, we did stumble out of the gate coming into 2023. We took a significant leg lower in the first week, and that was kind of payback for the significant leg higher we took going into the end of 2022. But we got down into the low $70s.And here is the problem because the White House now has painted itself into a corner. They came out. They depleted the SPR, and yet heating-oil prices this winter are 58% higher. Gasoline prices for next summer are 30% higher. We've depleted the SPR. And then the White House came out and said when oil prices get back into the low $70s, we'll start buying it.So here at the Schork Group, we're calling that the Biden put. Why would anyone want to sell oil in the low $70s or below when you know Uncle Sam is going to step in with the bid on a couple hundred million barrels? So we're looking at a de facto floor in the market at this point. So now you juxtapose that with the positive narrative of China reopening, and you do have the seeds for higher growth in price from here.Story continuesDAVE BRIGGS: Yeah, Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm saying today that Biden has been focused on reducing energy costs. How high do you think we are headed? Are we going back above $100 a barrel, and what about the price of gas? Up $0.10 in a week. Up $0.30 in a month. How high there as well?STEPHEN SCHORK: Right and we're going to that now part of the season where we're slow. We're looking at low inventories. So unless the secretary of energy could take some of her magic pixie dust and float it over the market and increase supplies when supplies are at extremely low levels, you can't happen-- this can't happen. So the only arsenal in this White House's quiver now has been to what? Go into the SPR.And I've just said the SPR, it's been a nonstarter. We're just depleting our emergency supplies of oil. We depleted our forward cover by nearly 40%, and prices again are still significantly higher.So the Biden administration has no tool that it can use to lower price. What it could do is embrace consumption. Stop demagoguing and scapegoating the industry and encourage investment and encourage these producers to come back in full force, but they've been reticent to do that. They've taken a very hawkish stance against their own domestic producers.So this administration does not have any options at this point, hence why we're going to Saudi Arabia or going to Venezuela. We're asking them to increase production. The Biden administration-- President Biden has not stepped foot in the city of Houston to talk to producers, but we are talking to Saudi Arabia and Venezuela.So we do not have a domestic energy policy. Regardless of what the secretary of energy wants to say, we do not have-- and hence why we do look at-- we're looking at higher prices. So right, we are now in the weakest part of the season when it comes to demand, and that is going to remain so for the next couple of weeks. So if we hold at these levels, mid $70s to mid $80s going into the late spring/summer when demand picks up, yes, we'll be looking at national gasoline prices well back above $4 a gallon, oil prices well back above $100 a barrel. That is in the cards.SEANA SMITH: Stephen, we've also got energy earnings coming up over the next couple of weeks. We have Chevron on Friday, Exxon a week from tomorrow. What are you expecting to hear from the oil giants about the past quarter, and have we seen a peak, at least for this cycle?STEPHEN SCHORK: The crack spreads have been great. That is to say the differential between the product price, what the refinery is selling, and the crude-oil price, what the refinery is buying. So that margin, that spread called the crack spread, has been very attractive, and I would suspect that it certainly will help continue to propel profits higher for the most part.So if we're going into the season-- and certainly, again, we're at that weakest part of the season. But the market from the margins, the spreads have only been increasing. And again, this here is a clear telltale of a lack of supply in this market. That is to say the forward curve-- prices on the forward curve are much higher than prices later dated out further out along the curve. This is a clear telltale that demand is outstripping supply, and the spreads are telling this. And if demand is outstripping supply and if you are producing that supply, selling in that demand market, that's a very attractive area to be in right now.SEANA SMITH: We'll be paying very close attention to those earnings reports. Stephen Schork, thanks so much.]"

Let's take a look at some of the movers, top movers of the day. First up, we got to talk about Microsoft. Shares closing to the upside after the company officially announcing its extended partnership with OpenAI. That's the parent company of ChatGPT. The gains that we're looking at today is just about 1%. Taking a look at what this could mean for the company down the road here, Dave, this deal we know adding to Microsoft's initial investment of about a billion dollars back in 2019.Analysts are very bullish about this. Dan Ives from Wedbush, we've talked to him about this potential investment when it was just reported. But he's sending out a note today calling it a potential game changer for Microsoft, saying it is a direct shot to Google and other big tech companies, saying that Nadella and co, Satya Nadella is ahead of the rest of big tech. And this investment is a major notch on the AI belt. Doesn't get much more bullish than that.- No, it doesn't. Let's talk about those two things. One, what the threat is to competitors. Well, we know from some ""New York Times"" reporting that Sergey Brin and Larry Page have come back to-- the founders of Google have come back. And they're not back at all because of the threat of ChatGPT. They know how big this is. And the theory is that it's actually a threat to Google's search business, which many have balked at because how significant could Bing be?Well, apparently it's big if you've got the two founders of Google coming back. But what did Satya Nadella say today? We believe large-scale AI-like chat will create transformative impact at the magnitude of the personal computer, the internet, mobile devices, and the cloud. That's a pretty significant statement about what he believes ChatGPT will do. Completely disrupt just about every industry out there.Story continues- Yeah. Exactly. And it's coming at a time-- this investment here, at a time when Office, Azure projected to slow meaningfully. That was the crux of Barclay's note out on this today, saying that it could not have come at a more opportune time. We'll get results from Microsoft tomorrow after the bell, where I'm sure a question or two are going to be on OpenAI.- That call will be interesting. We certainly won't see ChatGPT in the earnings themselves. But some commentary will be fascinating. We also have coming up on this program a young man who is a Princeton student that has already invented an app that would detect cheating by ChatGPT. It can tell if it's written by human or AI. That's coming up. Also, Salesforce has been in focus all day amid activist investor activity. Elliott Investment Management announced that it's taken a stake in the company. And CNBC reporting Inclusive Capital has also taken a position. We spoke to Patrick Gadson, who has dealt with this company in numerous times, Elliott Management. He knows all about Paul Singer and what they are in this industry. Here's what he said.PATRICK GADSON: They are the Godzilla of the space. They make entire countries in South America tremble. So they are known to see things all the way through. And many activists are sort of price sensitive when it comes to running campaigns. Elliott is not. They are completely inelastic when it comes to their budget for any proxy contest, any proxy wars. They'll spend tens of millions.- If you weren't familiar with Paul Singer and Elliott Management, well, now you are. Look at Salesforce, up 3%, I guess because what we just heard there from Mr. Gadson is they don't lose. They have no time frame. And they don't care what they have to spend to win. They're going to get the job done, including with entire countries like Argentina.- Yeah. Exactly. He said when they walk in the room, you sit up straight and you pay attention. That's simply what you have to do when you're dealing with Elliott Management. When you take a look at Salesforce, clearly the stock has been under pressure, as well as many of its competitors out there, over the last several months. That one-year chart, you're looking at losses of nearly 30%. Some key executive changes have happened over the last couple of months. The co-CEO Bret Taylor leaving the company. A lot of people asking Benioff some questions just in terms of what this means for the direction of Salesforce going forward.In terms of what the Street is saying to this, Needham saying that the guess is that the outcome is all about margin expansion, question whether more layoffs could potentially be on the table. We know Salesforce was one of the tech companies to announce a significant amount of layoffs earlier this year. So I think the company is under pressure. More and more activist investors paying more attention, taking stakes reportedly, at least when it comes to the smaller company. Elliott Management, though, confirming that stake today. We had Stauber back in October. So it's getting more attention from activists and investors. We'll see what changes are actually made.- Yeah. And we don't know what they want. But it was an interesting revelation from Gadson. At least his interpretation is that, why do we learn about reports like this? Why are we hearing it? And his theory is it's because something already happened, probably a late Q4 development. In his estimate, that could be a complete breakdown in those talks or they're about to announce something, i.e. board appointments. So his theory is something has happened, either positive or negative, to break that story.- Yeah. And just taking a look at the track record here, when it comes to Elliott Management, they've dealt with PayPal, AT&amp;T, Dell, Pinterest just to name a few in the past, and forcing numerous changes at those companies. So Benioff under a bit of pressure today and likely for a couple of weeks. All right. Let's talk about the chip stocks here. They are among the leaders in the NASDAQ today. Barclays out with a bullish note upgrading AMD, Qualcomm, and reiterating a buy rating on Nvidia They don't see the group of stocks retesting those October lows. A bullish call here from Barclays.The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, that's up more than 30% from a two-year low in mid-October. Analyst Blaine Curtis here of Barclays saying that he's more positive on companies with the data center PC handset exposures. Also, the reopening in China will start benefiting the industry he sees in the second half of the year. You're looking at a one-year chart of the Philly Semiconductor Index. Despite that 30% rally off the lows, still off about 14% this year, with a number of those larger chip stocks in the red over the last 12 months as well.- And you know where I'm going to go with this. ChatGPT. Because there was a number of analysts who said there's one name that's probably going to benefit the most from this. And that is Nvidia. They are poised to benefit the most from the bounce from ChatGPT, including Citi, which said that is why they believe in Nvidia moving forward. As for that Barclays note, they added this is a frown turned upside down. We still see this correlation as the worst since the tech bubble. But we are modeling estimates below for nearly every name in our coverage, even without a macro downturn. Very good day for chip stocks. Look at that. Up almost 8% for NVIDIA.]"

We talked about Intel reporting this week, but we've got a call on the chip industry from Barclays, which is upgrading its outlook on AMD and Qualcomm to overweight and downgrading Applied Materials to underweight. And the stocks there are moving accordingly. A blank courtesy analyst here sort of saucy in the note. I enjoyed the tone here.BRIAN SOZZI: Saucy.JULIE HYMAN: Talked about being negative last year on semiconductors broadly and sort of getting attacked by some retail investors, and now finding themselves getting positive here. And they said, we've seen other downturns within chips. They're not quite as cheap as they were in past down terms, but it sounds like that they are cheap enough. We underestimated the amount of money that wanted to move into semis. We don't see the group testing October lows, according to Curtis in this note.BRIAN SOZZI: And the analysts also just doubling down this thesis in the marketplace that AMD will continue to take market share from an Intel, which ties back to what I mentioned earlier on the show. We might see one more reset on guidance from Intel when they report earnings later in the week, I believe it's Thursday after the close. There, Intel is really not expected to be back in a leadership position on chips until 2025. And then even then, that leadership potential may not be as wide as some investors think.BRAD SMITH: Well, it comes back to also something else that we were talking about earlier in AI. And that was part of this as well, saying that for NVIDIA, at least, they're still a leader in GPU/AI, analyst writing there. And then you think about what this would also mean, more broadly, internationally. You look to China. China, the reopening there, they're saying is a big theme for 2023. Qualcomm would be one of the winners in that category here.Story continuesSo even within this kind of wide ranging look at semiconductors, which were battered in 2022, it seems like there's now starting to get some nibbling on that rebound on some of the tailwinds, at least, of what AI could mean for everything from the data center, even to the pieces of technology that we operate within on a daily day in and day out basis, but then also regionally, what this could mean and particularly in China, as they're looking to see Qualcomm as a clear leader at the high end there.BRIAN SOZZI: That was a really nice ratings graphic by our very own Conor Hickey, who gets up very early in the morning to make these things. I think he's on the train after me over in [INAUDIBLE] Long Island. So good to see graphics like that. That's really helpful.JULIE HYMAN: [INAUDIBLE] train at the same time, you know?BRIAN SOZZI: No, we're on the same train. He doesn't want to-- no, he takes, I think, the 10 minute one after me. You know, it comes by [INAUDIBLE].JULIE HYMAN: Oh, I didn't know there were trains that frequent.BRIAN SOZZI: But look, up early and you get great-- we get great graphics like this.JULIE HYMAN: It's true. We had that whole period of time where every chipmaker we talked to was talking about automakers, automakers, automakers, and chips that go into autos. That's still a big part of the conversation, and AI has been a part of the conversation, but it feels like they're really going to be pushing that narrative more and more as it becomes more part of the brunch conversation, for example, Brad. AMD, by the way, reports not tomorrow, but next Tuesday. So we're going to be watching those numbers--BRIAN SOZZI: I'm psyched.JULIE HYMAN: --closely--BRIAN SOZZI: I'm so pumped.JULIE HYMAN: --coming as they will after Intel. He's really pumped. He's always pumped.]"

The outlook assumes continued accelerated payments to suppliers, with a focus on small and at-risk businesses. In addition, the outlook reflects no significant reduction in customer budgets or changes in priorities, continued support and funding of the company's programs, and a statutory tax rate of 21%. It also includes known impacts to the company and broader defense supply chain from the COVID-19 pandemic based on the company's understanding at the time of this news release and its experience to date.2Business segment operating profit and free cash flow are non-GAAP measures. See the ""Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" section of this news release for more information.3Effective Jan. 1, 2023, the company no longer considers amortization expense related to purchased intangible assets in its evaluation of business segment operating performance. As a result, beginning on Jan 1. 2023, purchased intangible asset amortization expense, which was previously included in business segment operating profit, will be reported in unallocated corporate expense within operating income. The financial results for the years ended Dec. 31, 2022 and 2021 reported in the news release do not reflect the impact of this change as the company did not change its evaluation of business segment operating performance until Jan. 1, 2023. However, the 2023 Financial Outlook included in the news release reflects the impact of this change. For further information on the impact of this change, refer to the Pro Forma Business Segment Summary Results included in the supplemental tables of this news release.4The total FAS/CAS pension adjustment is presented as a single amount and includes total expected U.S. Government cost accounting standards (CAS) pension cost of approximately $1.7 billion and total expected financial accounting standards (FAS) pension income of approximately $375 million.  FAS pension income was calculated using a 5.25% discount rate at Dec. 31, 2022, an approximate (18)% return  on plan assets in 2022, and an expected 6.5% long-term rate of return on plan assets in future years. Additionally, the company does not expect to make discretionary contributions to its qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2023. For additional detail regarding the pension amounts reported in operating and non-operating results, refer to the supplemental table included at the end of this news release.Cash Flows and Capital Deployment ActivitiesCash from operations in the fourth quarter of 2022 was $1.9 billion. Capital expenditures were $693 million, resulting in free cash flow of $1.2 billion. The decrease in operating and free cash flows in the fourth quarter of 2022 was primarily due to timing of production and billing cycles impacting contract assets (primarily F-35).Cash from operations in 2022 was $7.8 billion. Capital expenditures were $1.7 billion, resulting in free cash flow of $6.1 billion in 2022. The decrease in operating and free cash flows in 2022 was primarily due to timing of production and billing cycles impacting contract assets and receivables, timing of liquidation of inventories (primarily TLS and Sikorsky helicopter programs in the company's RMS business segment), and higher federal tax payments (including $610 million in payments attributable to the elimination in 2022 of the option to deduct R&amp;D expenses immediately), all of which were partially offset by the deferral of cash payments for accounts payable (primarily Aeronautics).The company's cash activities in the quarter and year end Dec. 31, 2022, included the following:paying cash dividends of $766 million and $3.0 billion during the quarter and year ended Dec. 31, 2022;paying $4.2 billion to repurchase 7.2 million shares, and $7.9 billion to repurchase 18.4 million shares (excluding, in each period, shares to be received upon final settlement of the fourth quarter 2022 accelerated share repurchase agreement (ASR) in the first half of 2023) during the quarter and year ended Dec. 31, 2022;receiving $3.9 billion and $6.2 billion of net proceeds from the issuance of debt during the quarter and year ended Dec. 31, 2022; andrepayment of $2.3 billion of long-term debt during the year ended Dec. 31, 2022.Segment ResultsThe company operates in four business segments organized based on the nature of products and services offered: Aeronautics, Missiles and Fire Control (MFC), Rotary and Mission Systems (RMS) and Space.

(PHM): Here is What You Need to Know",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-pultegroup-inc-140002504.html,1674482402,STORY,['PHM'],"[PulteGroup (PHM) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this homebuilder have returned +10.7% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4.1% change. The Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry, to which PulteGroup belongs, has gained 9.5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, PulteGroup is expected to post earnings of $2.88 per share, indicating a change of +14.7% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.12 points to a change of +38.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -1.1%.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.06 indicates a change of -30.3% from what PulteGroup is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.2%.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for PulteGroup.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for PHM _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For PulteGroup, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $4.6 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +5.6%. For the current and next fiscal years, $15.66 billion and $14.51 billion estimates indicate +12.5% and -7.3% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPulteGroup reported revenues of $3.94 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +13.4%. EPS of $2.69 for the same period compares with $1.82 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.04 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -2.49%. The EPS surprise was -1.47%.Over the last four quarters, PulteGroup surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.PulteGroup is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about PulteGroup. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

200,06efa9bf-5abd-316e-a6e2-aeafcb1b5ac8,MDT,2023-01-24,Surmodics (SRDX) Stock Skids 32% on Negative Regulatory Update,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/surmodics-srdx-stock-skids-32-140402030.html,1674482642,STORY,"['SRDX', 'MDT']","[Shares of Surmodics, Inc. SRDX have declined 31.8% since the close on Jan 18, following disappointing regulatory update related to its SurVeil drug-coated balloon (“DCB”). In fact, the company’s shares have declined 33.3% in the past six months against the industry’s 0.9% increase. The S&amp;P 500 Index has declined 0.4% in the same time period.Regulatory UpdateSurmodics announced last week that it has received a letter from the FDA indicating that a premarket approval (“PMA”) application for its SurVeil DCB is not currently approvable. The company completed the submission of the PMA application for SurVeil DCB in the third quarter of 2021, based on data from clinical trial — TRANSCEND. The study evaluated the safety and efficacy of SurVeil DCB, a next-generation device for the treatment of peripheral artery disease (PAD). The study compared the results with Medtronic’s MDT IN.PACT Admiral DCB, which was evaluated in the comparator-arm, for non-inferiority.TRANSCEND Study DataData from the TRANSCEND study demonstrated compelling performance for SurVeil DCB. Data from the TRANSCEND 12-month pivotal clinical trial showed that SurVeil DCB met both the primary safety and primary efficacy endpoints that were found to be non-inferior compared to Medtronic’s IN.PACT Admiral DCB. SurVeil DCB also delivered a substantially lower drug dose versus MDT’s IN.PACT Admiral DCB. A 24-month data from the TRANSCEND study demonstrated continuous improvement in functional outcomes for treated patients, which was comparable to Medtronic’s IN.PACT Admiral DCB.Per Medtronics website, IN.PACT Admiral DCB is the market-leading DCB that has demonstrated durable, consistent, and safe outcomes across multiple clinical trials.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe FDA LetterThe letter received by Surmodics from the FDA related to SurVeil DCB PMA application stated that it is currently unapprovable, and also provided specific guidance for path forward. The FDA suggested adding certain information within two general categories — biocompatibility and labeling — through an amendment to the company’s PMA application. The new information requested by the FDA to put the PMA application in approvable form will require additional testing and analysis. However, the letter from the FDA did not raise any question on the human clinical data from the TRANSCEND study.Story continuesSurmodics will now perform the required testing and analysis for submitting the requested data. The company is currently evaluating the issues raised in the letter and will meet the agency’s representatives for discussing the letter’s content and conclude the path forward for the PMA application. It will provide additional update on this issue during its upcoming first-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings call.European ApprovalSurmodics gained a CE-mark for SurVeil DCB in 2020, a prerequisite for commercialization in Europe. The company is developing the device candidate under an agreement with Abbott ABT. Per the agreement, ABT has the exclusive worldwide commercialization rights for the SurVeil DCB. Although the device has gained a CE-mark, the timeline for its commercialization in Europe is to be determined at the discretion of Abbott, as per the terms of the agreement between the companies.Surmodics, Inc.

201,3c08aa64-2da5-30c2-a5d7-4af935c0e658,CCI,2023-01-24,What's in Store for Crown Castle (CCI) This Earnings Season?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/whats-store-crown-castle-cci-130501357.html,1674479101,STORY,['CCI'],"[Crown Castle Inc. CCI is scheduled to release fourth-quarter 2022 and full-year results on Jan 25 after the closing bell. Its quarterly results are likely to reflect year-over-year growth in revenues and funds from operations (FFO) per share.In the last reported quarter, this Houston, TX-based real estate investment trust’s (REIT) adjusted FFO per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.09%. The growth in site-rental revenues due to elevated tower space demand aided the top line.Over the preceding four quarters, CCI’s FFO per share surpassed estimates on each occasion, the average being 2.26%. This is depicted in the graph below:Crown Castle Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseCrown Castle Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseCrown Castle Inc. price-eps-surprise | Crown Castle Inc. QuoteFactors to NoteThe advancement in mobile technology, such as 4G and 5G networks, and the proliferation of bandwidth-intensive applications have driven the growth in mobile data usage globally. Also, rampant usage of network-intensive applications for video conferencing and cloud services, and remote-working scenarios have fueled the rise.As a result, during the fourth quarter, tower REITs such as Crown Castle are likely to have capitalized on the growing demand for tower leasing as wireless service providers and carriers continue to expand their networks and deploy additional equipment for existing networks to boost their network coverage and capacity.Amid this soaring demand, Crown Castle’s long-term lease agreements (typically five to 15 years) with the top United States carriers, having a strong credit profile, are anticipated to have aided its site rental revenues in the quarter.The consensus estimate for net revenues from site rentals is pegged at $1.57 billion for the quarter, indicating 6.8% growth from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. Our estimate for the same is $1.57 billion.The consensus estimate for net revenues from the network services and other segment stands at $175 million for the fourth quarter, implying a fall of 2.8% from the year-ago reported figure. Our estimate stands at $185.5 million.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $1.75 billion, indicating an increase of 5.7% year over year. Our estimate for the same stands at $1.75 billion.Moreover, to boost its small cells offerings required to increase the capacity and density of the wireless network for 5G deployment, CCI is likely to have deployed 5,000 nodes by the end of 2022.In October 2022, Crown Castle increased its dividend payment to $1.565 per share from $1.47, denoting a hike of 6.5%.Nonetheless, the rationalization of a portion of Sprint's legacy network by T-Mobile, one of Crown Caste’s key customers, and higher interest expenses are likely to have been headwinds for the company during the fourth quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarterly FFO per share has been unchanged at $1.83 over the past month. However, it suggests a 3.4% increase from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.For the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share has been unrevised at $7.36 over the past month. Nonetheless, the figure indicates a 5.9% increase from the year-ago reported figure.Story continuesWhat Our Quantitative Model PredictsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an FFO beat for Crown Castle this time. The right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — increases the odds of a beat. However, that is not the case here.Earnings ESP: Crown Castle has an Earnings ESP of -1.09%.

203,53e9b1e2-c648-33b1-8539-4bb7c673e414,ROK,2023-01-24,What Awaits Rockwell Automation (ROK) in Q1 Earnings?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/awaits-rockwell-automation-rok-q1-150803763.html,1674486483,STORY,['ROK'],"[Rockwell Automation Inc. ROK is scheduled to report first-quarter fiscal 2023 results before the opening bell on Jan 26.Q4 PerformanceIn the last reported quarter, Rockwell Automation’s earnings and revenues improved year over year and also beat the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate.The company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters while missing on one occasion, the average surprise being a negative 0.33%.Rockwell Automation, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Rockwell Automation, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseRockwell Automation, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Rockwell Automation, Inc. QuoteQ1 EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal first-quarter revenues is pegged at $1.89 billion, indicating growth of 1.9% from the prior-year quarter. The same for earnings is pegged at $1.81, suggesting a decrease of 15.4% from the year-ago quarter. The earnings estimates have moved up 3% in the past 30 days.Factors to NoteRockwell Automation has been witnessing improvement in order levels in the past few quarters. In fiscal 2022, the company reported record order levels of more than $10 billion, which marked 20% growth from the prior fiscal. Low order cancellation rates indicate the solid underlying demand from customers across many industries and regions.Strong demand for software and cyber security services and a robust order backlog of $5 billion are likely to have aided Rockwell Automation’s fiscal first-quarter top line. Per the Federal Reserve, total industrial production rose at an annual rate of 1.7% in the October-December quarter. This might have contributed to the company’s order book in the fiscal first quarter.The company’s bottom-line results are however expected to be hurt by supply-chain challenges and cost inflation that persisted throughout the quarter. The manufacturing supply chain continued to be strained by the sharp rise in demand and the shortages of electronic components. Also, higher logistics costs due to elevated energy costs and constrained air freight lanes are expected to have impacted margins in the quarter. Increased spending on talent and growth, unfavorable mix, as well as unfavorable currency also anticipated to have added pressure on its margin performance.Story continuesSegment ExpectationsFor the Intelligent Devices segment, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter fiscal 2023 revenues is pegged at $922 million, suggesting an improvement of 2% from the prior-year quarter’s levels. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for operating profit in the segment is pegged at $192 million, suggesting a year-over-year decline of 10%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Software &amp; Control segment’s sales for the quarter under review is currently at $539 million, suggesting year-over-year growth of 5%. The consensus mark for the segment’s operating profit is pegged at $94 million, indicating a plunge of 20% from the prior-year quarter’s levels.The consensus mark for the Lifecycle Services segment’s fiscal first-quarter sales is pegged at $452 million, indicating growth of 2% from the year-ago quarter. The segment is expected to generate an operating profit of around $28 million in the quarter, suggesting 14% growth from the prior-year quarter’s $24.5 million.What the Zacks Model IndicatesOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for Rockwell Automation for the first quarter. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. This is precisely the case here.Earnings ESP: Rockwell Automation has an Earnings ESP of +4.76%.

If you want to see more companies in this selection, go to the 5 Biggest Natural Gas Pipeline Companies in the World.In the past five decades, the consumption of energy globally has increased by over 2.5 times from 68,792 terawatt-hours (TWh) in 1971 to 176,431 TWh by 2021. Previously, crude oil and coal were the primary sources of energy as they fulfilled 40.7% and 24.6% of the global energy needs, respectively, 50 years ago. Meanwhile, natural gas was only responsible for fulfilling 15% of the global energy needs. Fast forward five decades, there has been a significant change in the usage of different energy sources due to environmental concerns and a move towards net zero carbon emissions. The contribution of natural gas as a source of energy has increased to 22.9% as of 2021. The change in the energy mix has been due to the swift progression in the sourcing and transporting of natural gas around the globe through pipelines. The contribution of natural gas in the overall energy mix is soon expected to surpass coal usage to become the second biggest energy source in the coming years, with crude oil being the biggest source of energy in the world.The increase in the demand and supply of natural gas around the world has resulted in the expansion of operations of multiple natural gas pipeline companies such as PetroChina, Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), and Saudi Arabian Oil Company (TADAWUL:2222.SR). The top 10 countries of the world have a natural gas pipeline infrastructure of 701,000 kilometers (km) as of 2020. This is nearly equivalent to circling the earth 17 times. North and South America are key hubs for natural gas pipeline infrastructure, with four of the top 10 countries located in this region. The US has the biggest natural gas pipeline infrastructure in the world, covering a distance of 333,000 km. The outlook of pipelines under construction and pre-construction is also bright as China is working on increasing its natural pipeline coverage by nearly 30,000 km. This makes China the biggest builder of natural gas pipelines globally. The expansion of pre-construction and under-construction natural gas and crude oil pipelines is estimated to cost $1 trillion.Story continues15 Biggest Natural Gas Pipeline Companies in the WorldPixabay/Public DomainOur MethodologyWe picked the 15 biggest natural gas pipeline companies in the world based on their revenue. We also analyzed their pipeline coverage, the scale of operations and growth plans. The companies have been ranked in ascending order of their 2021 revenue. The list includes both public limited companies and some distinguished state and privately owned entities.Biggest Natural Gas Pipeline Companies in the World15. The Williams Companies, Inc. (NYSE:WMB)Revenue 2021: $10.63BNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 35The Williams Companies, Inc. (NYSE:WMB) is a Tulsa, Oklahoma-based natural gas processing and transportation company. The  Fortune 500 company claims that it is responsible for handling 30% of the natural gas in the US.On December 16, Gabriel Moreen at Mizuho assigned The Williams Companies, Inc. (NYSE:WMB) a target price of $39 and maintained a Buy rating on the stock after the company announced the takeover of legacy Questar natural gas pipelines operator Southwest Gas for $1.5 billion. The analyst saw the development as a net positive for The Williams Companies, Inc. (NYSE:WMB) as it is acquiring assets that may provide lower growth but offer high quality in the long run.ClearBridge Investments shared its stance on The Williams Companies, Inc. (NYSE:WMB) in its Q4 2021 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“On a regional level, the Strategy’s largest exposure is in the U.S. and Canada (58%) consisting of regulated and contracted utilities (31%) and economically sensitive user-pays infrastructure (27%). During the quarter we initiated new positions in U.S. energy infrastructure company Williams Companies. With supply chain issues, higher housing costs, higher commodity prices and producer price inflation remaining square in the sights for 2022, we think higher inflation is a risk for global markets. We expect growth to slow to trend or below by mid-2022 and U.S. Treasury yields to rise, which will mean a continuation of negative real bond yields. Additional forecast volatility and therefore market uncertainty will arise as new COVID-19 variants appear and circulate. However, with high levels of vaccination across the developed world and less propensity for mobility restrictions and lockdowns, we expect the economic implications to be limited.14. DCP Midstream, LP (NYSE:DCP)Revenue 2021: $10.70BNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 3DCP Midstream, LP (NYSE:DCP) is a Denver, Colorado-based Fortune 500 provider of midstream petroleum and natural gas services.DCP Midstream, LP (NYSE:DCP) claims to process over five billion cubic feet of gas and generate over 400,000 barrels of natural gas liquids (NGLs) on a daily basis.

We enjoy communicating directly with you through this annual letter, and through the annual meeting as well.Our policy is to treat all shareholders equally. Therefore, we do not hold discussions with analysts nor large institutions. Whenever possible, also, we release important communications on Saturday mornings in order to maximize the time for shareholders and the media to absorb the news before markets open on Monday.A wealth of Berkshire facts and figures are set forth in the annual 10-K that the company regularly files with the S.E.C. and that we reproduce on pages K-1 – K-119. Some shareholders will find this detail engrossing; others will simply prefer to learn what Charlie and I believe is new or interesting at Berkshire.Alas, there was little action of that sort in 2021. We did, though, make reasonable progress in increasing the intrinsic value of your shares. That task has been my primary duty for 57 years. And it will continue to be.What You OwnBerkshire owns a wide variety of businesses, some in their entirety, some only in part. The second group largely consists of marketable common stocks of major American companies.

They each deliver meaningful proportions of the overall energy produced and consumed in North America. Their revenues are backed by long-term contracts with high-quality counterparties and have little direct commodity price exposure. Their growth has been driven by the increasing production of North American energy. The advent of unconventional oil and gas production (oil sand and shale) has made North America a low-cost competitor on a global basis. We expect strong North American production to be an enduring feature of global energy supply for decades to come.”7. Plains All American Pipeline, L.P.

And out of all of the metrics and results to consider, earnings is one of the most important.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report.

The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure.The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock.

Specifically, Skibitsky stated that Russia would launch a huge offensive in the spring, adding, “If Russia loses this time around, then Putin will collapse.” And speculating on Russia’s post-Putin future last October, a former Russian diplomat, Boris Bondarev predicted that the country could descend into “political turbulence” or “chaos” in the wake of Putin’s departure. In such a scenario, Moscow would probably have difficulty sustaining the war. Therefore, it’s a good time to start thinking about which stocks to sell if Russia launches a spring offensive that appears to be failing or if Putin appears to be on his way out.Unsurprisingly, energy stocks and defense names would be the best stocks to sell in that scenario. Here are three stocks within those sectors to consider unloading or even shorting if the conflict appears to be entering its final stages.TickerCompanyPriceHALHalliburton$40.19WMBThe Williams Companies$31.93NOCNorthrup Grumman$442.31InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsHalliburton (HAL)The Halliburton (HAL) logo on the website homepage. HAL stock price prediction.Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comMost oil and natural gas producers appear to have rather low valuations at this point, as many investors probably realize that the Russia-Ukrainian War has to end sometime and that energy prices would likely drop tremendously when the conflict is finally terminated. However, the valuations of Halliburton (NYSE:HAL), an oil-service company, are not that low.Indeed, the trailing price-earnings ratio of HAL stock is a rather robust 22, while the shares are trading at five times the company’s book value. Additionally, the shares’ enterprise value/EBITA ratio is nearly 15, which is not very low either.Story continuesAnd if the Russia-Ukraine War ends, triggering much lower oil and natural gas prices, HAL’s top and bottom lines are likely to tumble as energy exploration companies sharply reduce the amount of drilling that they carry out.Also likely to hurt HAL if peace breaks out in Ukraine is its relatively low dividend yield of 1.15%. To the extent that investors hold onto the shares of companies focused on fossil fuels, most would probably prefer names with low valuations and high dividend yields. Since HAL has the opposite characteristics, its shares are likely to tumble when the war ends.The Williams Companies (WMB)The Williams Companies (WMB) logo displayed on a smartphone.Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.comThe Williams Companies (NYSE:WMB) “owns and operates the large Transco and Northwest pipeline systems and associated natural gas gathering, processing, and storage assets.” According to Seeking Alpha columnist Gen Alpha, the bull thesis on WMB stock is based on the company’s ability to benefit from the high demand for U.S. natural gas overseas amid the war in Ukraine. If the conflict ends, that dynamic will obviously be disrupted, as natural gas in many countries is likely to become much cheaper. As a result, importing the fuel from the U.S. will become less economical, lowering, in turn, the extent to which Williams’ gas infrastructure is utilized in the U.S.Additionally, like Halliburton, Williams’ valuation is not very low. In fact, the company’s trailing price-earnings ratio is a relatively high 19.3, while its price-sales ratio is an elevated 3.6.Additionally, Citi on Jan. 18 lowered its rating on WMB stock to “equal weight” from “overweight,” citing valuation and less exuberance surrounding natural gas prices this year compared to 2022.Northrup Grumman (NOC)Northrop Grumman (NOC) logo on a corporate buildingSource: Kristi Blokhin / Shutterstock.comNorthrup Grumman (NYSE:NOC) has benefited from supplying its “Bushmaster automatic cannons and midsized ammunition,” along with its “RQ-4 Global Hawk aircraft” to the Ukrainians, The Financial Times reported last summer. If the war winds down, Ukraine’s orders of those products are likely to drop significantly.Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs last week downgraded NOC stock to “sell” from “neutral.” As reasons for the move, Goldman cited the relatively high valuation of NOC and the possibility of upcoming budget pressures.The investment bank explained that “Northrop trades at the high-end of its long-term historical valuation range relative to the S&amp;P500, which historically tends to correlate with early stages of defense budget growth and/or an accelerating total defense budget.” Noting that NOC is the “most expensive” large defensive stock covered by Goldman, the bank warned that NOC could be hurt by defense budget cuts by Washington going forward.Indeed, Congress’s efforts to make budget cuts amid the debt ceiling debate could, meaningfully, negatively affect NOC’s top and bottom lines.On the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Boeing won immunity from criminal prosecution as part its $2.5 billion January 2021 Justice Department deferred prosecution agreement over a 737 MAX fraud conspiracy charge related to the plane's flawed design.Boeing declined to comment on Monday.The families argued that the Justice Department ""lied and violated their rights through a secret process,"" and asked O'Connor to rescind Boeing's immunity from criminal prosecution.O'Connor ruled in October that people killed in the two Boeing 737 MAX crashes are legally considered ""crime victims,"" and family members had urged him to require Boeing to be arraigned on the felony charge.The crashes in 2018 and 2019 in Indonesia and Ethiopia, which cost Boeing more than $20 billion, led to a 20-month grounding for the best-selling plane and prompted the U.S. Congress to pass legislation reforming airplane certification.Among those who plan to speak at the arraignment is Paul Njoroge, who lost his three children, his wife and mother-in-law in the crash, and Nadia Milleron and Michael Stumo, who lost their daughter, Samya Rose Stumo, according to the filing.Paul G.

Boeing won immunity from criminal prosecution as part its $2.5 billion January 2021 Justice Department deferred prosecution agreement over a 737 MAX fraud conspiracy charge related to the plane's flawed design.Boeing declined to comment on Monday.The families argued that the Justice Department ""lied and violated their rights through a secret process,"" and asked O'Connor to rescind Boeing's immunity from criminal prosecution.O'Connor ruled in October that people killed in the two Boeing 737 MAX crashes are legally considered ""crime victims,"" and family members had urged him to require Boeing to be arraigned on the felony charge.The crashes in 2018 and 2019 in Indonesia and Ethiopia, which cost Boeing more than $20 billion, led to a 20-month grounding for the best-selling plane and prompted the U.S. Congress to pass legislation reforming airplane certification.Among those who plan to speak at the arraignment is Paul Njoroge, who lost his three children, his wife and mother-in-law in the crash, and Nadia Milleron and Michael Stumo, who lost their daughter, Samya Rose Stumo, according to the filing.Paul G. Cassell, a lawyer representing relatives of those killed, said the ""families look forward to addressing the company responsible for their loved ones’ deaths at the hearing.""Both Boeing and the Justice Department oppose reopening the deferred prosecution agreement, which included $500 million in victim compensation, a $243.6 million fine and $1.7 billion in compensation to airlines.Boeing said in November that it opposes any effort to reopen the agreement, calling it ""unprecedented, unworkable, and inequitable"" and noted it has been complying with the agreement for nearly two years.(Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Leslie Adler)]"

QuoteKey Factors to NoteThe impacts of TE Connectivity’s footprint-consolidation plans, stringent cost-cutting strategies and growing momentum across industrial, communications and transportation segments are expected to get reflected in the quarterly results.Strong momentum across factory automation applications is expected to have driven growth in the company’s industrial equipment sales in the fiscal third quarter. Strength across renewable energy applications is anticipated to have aided the energy business. Solid momentum among interventional procedures is likely to have driven its medical sales growth. These factors are expected to have benefited the industrial segment in the quarter under discussion.In the communication segment, strengthening momentum across data and devices is anticipated to have acted as a tailwind in the quarter under review. The growing traction across high-speed solutions for cloud applications is likely to have been another key catalyst.However, weakening momentum across the appliance business might have been a concern.Increasing overall auto production, along with the growing production of hybrid and electric vehicles, is likely to have contributed well to the sales growth of the company’s transportation segment in the to-be-reported quarter. Solid content growth is expected to have driven commercial transportation sales growth in the quarter under review.However, sluggish demand for sensors is likely to have been a headwind for the transportation segment.

""Air"" is about the creation of one of the most successful brands of all time, Air Jordan. Now, the film is being produced by and will star Ben Affleck and Matt Damon. Other stars include Marlon Wayans, Chris Tucker, Viola Davis, Jason Bateman, just to name a few there.A few months ago, Bloomberg reported that Amazon was planning to release 12 to 15 films in theaters and would spend a billion dollars to do so. Dave, I think this is such a smart move by Amazon. They picked the perfect film to do this with. And you talk about people wanting to go back to the theaters, getting that extra exposure. I think it's a huge home run potentially here for Amazon.DAVE BRIGGS: Oh, Affleck and Damon, how about them apples?SEANA SMITH: --two stars.DAVE BRIGGS: I mean, that takes us back to ""Good Will Hunting,"" one of the all-time great films. And tie in Jason Bateman, one of the most underrated actors on the planet--SEANA SMITH: Oh, I love him.DAVE BRIGGS: --quite frankly. And yes, this is the kind of movie coming out of the pandemic that we just don't see very often. We know the ""Avatars"" of the world can succeed. But films that you can go to with your whole family, your kids and the parents want to see together, bravo. Looks like a terrific cast. And obviously, the story of Nike is one related to Michael Jordan that we all relate to and we all want to hear about.But big picture, you can't help but wonder if this is what Amazon is going to do. Going to have a very positive impact on the movie theater and the film industry as a whole. We talked to Richard Gelfond, the IMAX CEO, about that. He was very excited about the prospect for the films that they're going to get in theaters. Right when we see the pipeline of films looking like it's flat-lining, Amazon could be that shocker that the industry needs, 12 to 15 films a year. Very excited for it.Story continuesSEANA SMITH: Yeah, I think it could be huge. And we know we've seen some resistance from Netflix, some of the other streamers, just in terms of releasing their movies, their new content in the theaters, some of that resistance of the traditional model. So the fact that Amazon is taking this leap and releasing so many movies, up to 15 this year, that is a huge win, I think, for the industry. And like you're saying, they're doing anything to get people back into those theaters. So something to be optimistic about.DAVE BRIGGS: Yeah, we were all wondering what they would do with this when they acquired MGM for, what, it was 8.45 billion. Now we're getting a glimpse. We'll see that on Easter weekend. That might--SEANA SMITH: I'm excited.DAVE BRIGGS: --even get you back to the theaters.SEANA SMITH: I was going to say, that might get me--DAVE BRIGGS: No, it won't. It'll get me there.]"

(NYSE:WFC) is one the largest U.S. banks, but, like many of its competitors, had an unsteady year in 2022. To keep itself afloat in the midst of mounting losses, the bank is scaling back its mortgage business and furloughing employees.Putting further pressure on the San Francisco-based bank, the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection imposed a $3.7 billion fine in December as a result of multiple legal violations over the past several years.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 1 Warning Sign with WFC. Click here to check it out. WFC 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of WFCPeter Lynch Chart of WFCRegardless of these developments, the stock has posted a gain of nearly 10% over the past month.Wells Fargo Continues to FlourishWells Fargo reports muted earnings amid a deteriorating economyIn early January, the bank announced dwindling profits for the fourth quarter, which were impacted by a settlement it had to make and the need to allocate more funds toward reserves given the economy's decline.Wells Fargo reported a significant decline in its quarterly net income, which fell 50% year over year to $2.86 billion, or 67 cents per share. The bank disclosed that lower mortgage banking activity and reduced loan originations were the key drivers behind the decline.Revenue dropped 5.5% year over year to $19.66 billion and missed analysts' forecasts.Despite being expected to post around $1.46 in earnings per share, Wells Fargo was unable to do so due to operating losses of $3.3 billion caused by the impairment of equity securities, severance expenses and additional losses stemming from litigation, regulatory and customer remediation.Wells Fargo's net interest income was its saving grace, as 56% of its revenue is generated from the segment. As the company's noninterest income dropped by 46%, the bank recorded a net interest income surge of 45% to $13.43 billion, primarily due to interest rate hikes.For full fiscal 2022, Wells Fargo recorded $72.3 billion in revenue and $12.1 billion in net income, which were down 13% and 40% year over year. Due to lower revenue, the company's profit margin dropped to 17% compared to 24% in 2021.Story continuesWells Fargo's earnings report was disheartening as the bank had previously declared it would pull out from the U.S. mortgage market. Furthermore, the company revealed last month that there would be a $2.8 billion after-tax operating loss connected to legal and compliance expenses.Strategic shift2022 was a challenging year for the mortgage industry due to rising rates, lower home sales and intense competition. Consequently, Wells Fargo decided to scale down its mortgage business and has announced layoffs.According to a warning from the World Bank, we may be heading toward a global recession. This could result in a slowdown of home purchases and increased delinquencies, either of which can have a significant impact on businesses - particularly with extra costs to manage the loans.Wells Fargo, which used to be the mortgage leader, is now moving away from the mortgage industry and focusing more on other aspects of its business.The organization has shifted its focus from reaching out to all Americans to providing home loans for existing bank and wealth management customers and borrowers residing in minority communities.Wells Fargo is shutting down its correspondent business of buying loans from third-party lenders as part of its restructuring process. It will also drastically reduce the size of its mortgage servicing portfolio by selling off assets.In a statement, Kleber Santos, the consumer lending head, noted the decision to cut back on lending activities is because of two main factors - a dismal market due to the Federal Reserve's rate hikes and doubts over the bank's long-term revenue.For CEO Charlie Scharf, it is the biggest strategic change since he joined Wells Fargo in 2019. U.S. households owe a huge debt, with mortgages making up over two-thirds of the $16.5 trillion balance. This is by far the biggest form of lending for American citizens. Before Scharf's tenure, Wells Fargo was proud of its vast share in the home hoan market. As of 2019, this figure reached a whopping $201.8 billion, as per an Inside Mortgage Finance industry newsletter. It also made it the leading lender in the country at that time.However, Wells Fargo's withdrawal from the U.S. mortgage market makes sense as it faces increased scrutiny from regulators while interest rates soar. Moving away from the multitrillion-dollar market will relieve it of the pressure presented by both factors.Solid shareholder returns are a saving graceDespite a tumultuous 2022, Wells Fargo's stock performance has remained resilient. Since the start of the year, the situation has not changed and the share price has remained in the black.The biggest company-specific cause of Wells Fargo's share price increase is its announcement of resuming buybacks during the current quarter. However, the bank has not specified the number of shares it intends to buy back in this instance.In addition, Wells Fargo reported an encouraging decline in its estimates for possible legal losses, which dropped from $3.7 billion in the third quarter of 2022 to $1.4 billion at the year's end, the lowest it has been since 2016. The forecasted potential financial losses associated with the bank include regulatory fines, ongoing litigation and reparation for past compliance issues.Takeaway2022 saw a huge dip in the global economy, and Wells Fargo was also affected by it, as evidenced by its earnings performance. The bank has released muted financials and declared it is scaling back its mortgage business. If a global economic downturn does occur, this could be an advantageous step for the company.However, the strategic shift the company is taking is a massive one. It will take Wells Fargo a while to get all of its ducks in a row. Until that time, investors taking a long-term view will be happy with the stock, but the prospect of quick gains is unlikely.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

The committee will vote on the agency's proposal.Last week, The FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) investigated a ""preliminary signal"" of the likelihood of a stroke among elderly people who received a Covid-19 vaccine booster manufactured by Pfizer Inc (NYSE: PFE) and BioNTech SE (NASDAQ: BNTX).Related: Israel Says No Stroke Risk Associated With Pfizer/BioNTech Updated COVID-19 Shots.Currently, people who want to be fully vaccinated against COVID have first to get their primary vaccinations — two shots of the original vaccine spaced weeks apart, followed by a booster, the bivalent omicron adapted shot.Some immunologists and vaccine researchers say simplifying the process along the lines of the flu vaccine is appropriate at this point in the pandemic.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Most Undervalued Pharma Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds. Fitch Ratings has assigned a ‘Neutral’ outlook to the global pharmaceutical and biotech sector, indicating Fitch’s assumption of an encouraging operating environment in 2023, regardless of inflationary constraints and the skyrocketing interest rates. As per Fitch, there are many positive secular trends in the pharma sector, which will drive growth and innovation, including an increasing and aging population, higher prevalence of chronic diseases, and easier access to healthcare worldwide. 2022 has been a taxing year for mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and life sciences sector, with both deal value and volume at multi-year lows due to the challenging macro environment, combined with larger market dislocation. In 2023, PwC anticipates M&amp;A patterns to resemble the last few years, with total deal value ranging from $225 billion to $275 billion across the pharma industry. Sufficient cash stockpiles, the need for investment to overcome medium-term pipeline gaps, and the revaluation of biotech firms will set the backdrop for a busy year. PwC expects that with the results of the US midterm elections finalized and the impact of the Inflation Reduction Act on pricing more transparent, most of the uncertainty that afflicted the pharma industry in 2022 should settle down. PwC sees higher potential for deals in the $20 billion to $40 billion range before 2023 ends. To benefit from the growth in the pharma industry, some of the most undervalued stocks to buy according to hedge funds include Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), Bausch Health Companies Inc. (NYSE:BHC), and Moderna, Inc.

Syneos Health (NASDAQ:SYNH), a clinical research company that provides clinical trial services to companies in the pharmaceutical, biotech and medical device industries, saw its stock decline after customers delayed scheduling new trials as they navigate the current economic uncertainty. While we continue to remain underweight the sector, we are diligently looking for health care names that align with our focus on high-quality companies with strong balance sheets and long-term value creation opportunities.”   Click to continue reading and see 5 Most Undervalued Pharma Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds.    Suggested articles:10 Dirt Cheap Stocks To Buy13 Cheap New Stocks To Buy11 Tech Stocks with Low PE Ratio Disclosure: None. 12 Most Undervalued Pharma Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

CNCE were up 17.4% last week on its proposed acquisition by India-based Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. On Jan 19, Concert Pharmaceuticals announced a definitive agreement to be acquired by Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., the world's fourth-largest specialty generic pharmaceutical company, for $576 million.The acquisition, if successfully closed, will add Concert Pharmaceutical’s lead product candidate, deuruxolitinib, to Sun Pharma’s global dermatology franchise. Deuruxolitinib is an oral inhibitor of janus kinases JAK1 and JAK2 and is currently under late-stage development for the treatment of alopecia areata. Concert completed its second phase III clinical study, THRIVE-AA, on deuruxolitinib and reported top-line results back in August 2022.Per the terms of the definitive merger agreement, Sun Pharma is expected to initiate a tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Concert for $8.00 per share in cash, upon closing the deal. CNCE is also entitled to receive a non-tradeable contingent value right of up to an additional $3.50 per share in cash, payable when milestones in terms of deuruxolitinib’s net sales are met within specific periods. The transaction is expected to be completed in the first half of 2023.The cash portion (exclusive of the contingent right) of $8.00 per share is a premium of around 16% over Concert’s closing price as of Jan 18, 2023.The primary efficacy endpoint for THRIVE-AA was the percentage of patients achieving an absolute Severity of Alopecia Tool (SALT) score of 20 or less at Week 24 of treatment. This primary endpoint was met with statistical significance against patients treated with a placebo and the candidate was generally well tolerated. The key secondary endpoints of the percentage of responders on a Satisfaction of Hair Patient Reported Outcome scale at Week 24 and the percentage of patients achieving absolute SALT scores of 20 or less at each of Weeks 20, 16, and 12 were also met with statistical significance. The safety profiles of the candidate were also consistent with previous studies, with the most common adverse effects being, COVID-19 infection, nasopharyngitis, increased creatine kinase levels, acne and headache. Concert plans to submit a New Drug Application (NDA) for deuruxolitinib to the FDA in the first half of 2023.Story continuesAlopecia Areata is an autoimmune disease, affecting both men and women, in which the immune system attacks the hair follicles causing partial or complete hair loss on the scalp and body. Approximately 1.5 million Americans may be affected by this disease at any given time and is commonly associated with serious psychological consequences, including anxiety and depression. Treatment options for alopecia areata are extremely limited and represent a clear unmet medical need as a part of quality-of-life improvement.In the past year, the stock of Concert Pharmaceuticals has shot up 172.4% against the industry’s decline of 14%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSun Pharmaceutical’s vision of building a global Dermatology and Ophthalmology franchise will receive a significant boost from the addition of Concert’s late-stage, potential best-in-class treatment for alopecia areata in deuruxolitinib. Sun Pharma’s management claims to be well-positioned to successfully bring the product to market globally.However, Concert, and upon acquisition, Sun Pharma will be facing stiff competition from prominent players in the medical market like Pfizer PFE and Eli Lilly and Company LLY. In September 2022, Pfizer announced that the FDA had accepted its NDA filing for its candidate, ritlecitinib,  a selective JAK3/TEC kinase inhibitor, for adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older with alopecia areata.This acceptance of the NDA by the FDA was based on Pfizer’s previously reported top-line results from the pivotal and dose-ranging phase IIb/III ALLEGRO study and an ongoing phase III ALLEGRO-LT open-label, long-term study. Pfizer expects the FDA to give its decision on the NDA in the second quarter of 2023, which will provide serious competition to Concert’s candidate upon approval.In June 2022, Eli Lilly announced that the FDA had approved its marketed drug, JAK inhibitor, Olumiant (baricitinib) as a first-in-disease systemic treatment for adults with severe alopecia areata. This approval was based on topline results from Lilly’s BRAVE-AA1 and BRAVE-AA2 studies.Zacks Rank and Stock to ConsiderConcert Pharmaceutical currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the same industry is Ardelyx, Inc ARDX, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

The simple act of sending or receiving money electronically isn’t so simple across international borders. In the U.S., bank accounts are identified by routing and account numbers. In Europe, they use international bank account numbers (IBANs), but different IBANs have different prefixes — FR in France, DE in Germany, IT in Italy, etc. Australia, on the other hand, uses BSB codes.See the List: GOBankingRates’ Best Banks of 2023Tips: How To Stay Safe When Using Mobile Banking AppsFind Out: Do You Have Too Much Money in Your Checking Account?If you’re planning on living, studying or even just traveling abroad on vacation, make sure you have a money-management plan beyond just the cash in your fanny pack. The following is a look at the top apps for sending and receiving money, making payments and converting cash securely and safely while outside of your home country.Don’t wait until you’re overseas to plan for how you’ll handle your finances once you get there.WiseFormerly TransferWise, Wise is known for fast and inexpensive transactions to and from just about anywhere — it’s available in 170 countries and supports 50 currencies.In a test transfer of $1,000, Wise is cheaper than banks like Chase and Wells Fargo, wire services like WesternUnion and OFX, and payment facilitators like PayPal. That’s because it uses the real mid-market exchange rate for every transaction. There are no maximums or minimums for transfers and Wise charges just one transparent fee.Around 400,000 businesses rely on Wise, and travelers, students and expats use it to move money across borders for everything from sending money to friends to paying mortgages in other countries.RemitlyWise’s own $1,000 test transfer showed that Remitly was the least expensive out of all the major international money transfer services — including Wise itself. Remitly supports more than 75 currencies and has no hidden fees.Story continuesYou can send and receive money in more than 145 countries, including 40 African countries, Mexico, India and the Philippines.It stands out for its many delivery options for people on the receiving end — you can get your cash as a bank deposit, mobile transfer to your phone, a cash pickup from thousands of locations and even delivery to the recipient’s home.Take Our Poll: How Big of a Sign-Up Bonus Would It Take for You To Change Banks?PayPalPayPal is one of the oldest, most popular and most trusted names in payment facilitation, but familiarity is only one reason that international users flock to it. You can send money through PayPal in nearly every country on Earth — more than 200 in total.The downside is that the pricing and fees can be vague and confusing, but PayPal’s menu of services is tough to match. International users can send and request money, donate and raise funds, deposit checks, sell things and pay with QR codes — PayPal even lets you buy, sell and checkout with cryptocurrency.MoneyGramLike PayPal, MoneyGram is available in more than 200 countries.Also like PayPal, it has a well-established history in the industry — but in that category, the two aren’t even in the same ballpark. PayPal was founded during the Wild West days of the early internet in the late 1990s. MoneyGram, on the other hand, has more than 80 years of history dating back to the Travelers Express days around the time of World War II.The app is available for iOS and Android, and online money transfers, in-person transfers or both are available outside of the many countries where the app is supported.OFXLike every service on the list, OFX can beat the rate your bank is likely to offer you for international transfers. The app supports more than 50 currencies in over 190 countries, and OFX offers unrivaled security. As a listed entity on the Australian Stock Exchange, it’s monitored by more than 50 regulatory bodies across the world.The app lets you check rates before you send money and monitor transfers once they’re in progress. OFX also offers advanced features like fixing FX rates 12 months in advance for future transfers. You can register in less than five minutes and OFX gets high marks for its customer service. You can talk to a real, live person 24/7, unlike the many other services that require you to navigate time zone differences to get a representative on the phone.More From GOBankingRates5 Best Southern Cities To Retire on a Budget of $1,500 a MonthExplore GOBankingRates' 2023 Banking Resource CenterThe 10 Best Rewards Credit Cards for 2023Experts: 4 Safest Places To Keep Your SavingsThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: 5 Best Apps for International Banking Needs]"

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this technology platform and digital payments company have returned +14.6%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Software industry, which Paypal falls in, has gained 9.7%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Paypal is expected to post earnings of $1.19 per share, indicating a change of +7.2% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.3% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.09 points to a change of -11.1% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.3%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.78 indicates a change of +16.9% from what Paypal is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.2%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Paypal is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for PYPL _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Paypal, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $7.39 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +6.9%. For the current and next fiscal years, $27.53 billion and $29.71 billion estimates indicate +8.5% and +7.9% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPaypal reported revenues of $6.85 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +10.7%. EPS of $1.08 for the same period compares with $1.11 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.82 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.4%. The EPS surprise was +13.68%.Over the last four quarters, Paypal surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Paypal is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Paypal. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Here's what IBM Vice Chairman Gary Cohn had to say about the turnaround in Davos.GARY COHN: I think Arvind has laid out a very distinct plan on revenue growth, on free-cash-flow growth, and he continues to execute upon his plan.JULIE HYMAN: That comeback is not going unnoticed among investors. Joining us now is Lisa Ellis, SVB MoffettNathanson analyst. Lisa, thanks so much for being here. And indeed you upgraded IBM to market perform. Is it because you are seeing some of these efforts bearing fruit at the company sort of trying to refocus?LISA ELLIS: Yeah, absolutely. I have to give Arvind Krishna a huge amount of credit. He's been in the seat for about three years now. Of course having to deal right out of the gate with the pandemic, but has had a very clear vision since the beginning and has executed extremely well against that to simplify and streamline the offerings at IBM-- you know, divesting Kyndryl, which was their big, structurally declining IT-outsourcing business. They kind of got that anchor out of the portfolio.And then really importantly, between Red Hat and then opening up the services business, they've made IBM much more technology agnostic. They're working a lot more closely with many other technology providers in cloud, in digital, et cetera, which has helped to trigger the growth now in the company. They're more consistently growing revenues up in the, you know, low to mid single digits.JULIE HYMAN: Lisa, how does a recession this year impact your thesis on IBM?LISA ELLIS: Well, look, you know, they will not be immune to a slowdown in enterprise technology spending, like any one. They aren't-- they tend to actually be, though, a little bit defensive. You know, they're tied to more nondiscretionary spending in tech. And so, you know, if you look back to how they've performed through past downturns, of course they see a slowdown, but it's not as bad as you see in some more discretionary categories.Story continuesBRAD SMITH: We've seen IBM really push the strategic imperatives, these big investments that they've been making in the business, and trying to sure up a portfolio of clients as well in tandem, whether that's anything from AI to blockchain. Do they double down on those investments at this point in time heading into a potential recession, or do they kind of pull back or just kind of remain business as usual, flat on those investments? And how would you evaluate them in that instance?LISA ELLIS: Yeah they're doubling down in a couple of key areas. One which has turned out to be one of the easier ones to execute where they've done fantastically well is actually in the remaining services business. This is the consulting business where it's more nimble because they can move very quickly to work with new partners. And there's a lot of secular growth in that business associated with the adoption of cloud and digital amongst enterprises, and they're continuing to invest in that.A lot of that secular will continue right through-- you know, right through any sort of recession. This is all the adoption of digital like banks closing branches and moving things to mobile banking and online, that type of thing.In addition, over in the software division, as you said, they've really streamlined and focused, but AI and analytics, which has been a hallmark of IBM for decades, you know, continues to be an area of focus for them.JULIE HYMAN: And, Lisa, just quickly, you sound pretty positive on IBM, and yet you just upgraded them to market perform. You didn't do a double upgrade to outperform. What do you still want to see from IBM that would tip you in that direction?LISA ELLIS: Yeah, look, they do still have a challenge, which is that much of the profit of the company is driven by their software businesses, many of which are still traditional software businesses, on premise, you know, license-based software businesses. And so while they're starting to grow, they're still at some level, though, trading lower-profit revenue for higher-profit revenue that's bleeding off.Like, so they haven't-- they have what I would call, like, kind of tipped the Titanic a bit-- you know, gotten their head from below water to now above water.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Most Undervalued Natural Gas Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds. In 2022, the oil and gas industry experienced exceptional financial success, resulting in a significant amount of financial resources available to support the plans for 2023. The onset of winter in many regions around the world, which has been milder than anticipated and may continue for an extended period, particularly in the US, is reducing concerns about a potential shortage of natural gas that was forecast to lead to disruptions in service and increased energy costs. Additionally, many countries are now sitting on ample natural gas reserves. Gas storage across Europe is 84% full, far ahead of the five-year seasonal average of 70%, as per Gas Infrastructure Europe.The oil and gas industry entered 2023 with the strongest financial position it has ever had, with a commitment to maintaining financial discipline. This positive outlook is reflected in a survey conducted by Deloitte, in which 93% of oil and gas executives express a positive attitude towards the industry in the upcoming year. This positive momentum could assist companies in addressing the lack of investment in the industry in recent years and support a faster transition to cleaner energy sources. Natural gas will continue to be one of the preferred choices for generating electricity and heat. To benefit from the boom in the natural gas industry, some of the most undervalued stocks preferred by smart investors include Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY), and ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP). Our Methodology We scanned Insider Monkey’s database of holdings of 920 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the third quarter of 2022 and picked the 11 most undervalued natural gas stocks that have P/E ratios of less than or close to 10 as of January 20.

The company explores for, develops, and produces oil, natural gas liquids, and gas.Mizuho analyst Nitin Kumar on January 9 assumed coverage of Pioneer Natural Resources Company (NYSE:PXD) with a Buy rating and a $294 price target. He believes that the company will improve capital efficiencies and focus on higher return projects in 2023, which should refocus investors on the company's resilient cash return program and large reserve base in U.S. shale.According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 49 hedge funds were long Pioneer Natural Resources Company (NYSE:PXD), compared to 56 funds in the prior quarter. Donald Yacktman’s Yacktman Asset Management is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 686,869 shares worth $148.7 million. Like Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY), and ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP), Pioneer Natural Resources Company (NYSE:PXD) is one of the most undervalued natural gas stocks to invest in. Here is what Carillon Scout Mid Cap Fund has to say about Pioneer Natural Resources Company (NYSE:PXD) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“Pioneer Natural Resources (NYSE:PXD) performed well in a strong energy sector. Pioneer stood out recently with a pledge to return a large majority of free cash flow to share owners through dividends and stock buybacks, and ended hedging to give share owners more earnings and dividend potential should oil and gas prices continue to rise.”10. Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 50P/E Ratio as of January 20: 5.61Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC) was founded in 1887 and is headquartered in Findlay, Ohio. It operates as an integrated downstream energy company primarily in the United States. Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC) provides crude oil, refined products, natural gas, and natural gas liquids. It is one of the most undervalued natural gas stocks to buy according to elite investors. On January 9, Barclays analyst Theresa Chen raised the price target on Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC) to $130 from $126 and kept an Overweight rating on the shares. The analyst expects another quarter of high R&amp;M earnings as a result of an above mid-cycle macro environment.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 50 hedge funds were bullish on Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC) at the end of Q3 2022, and Paul Singer’s Elliott Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with more than 11 million shares worth $1.10 billion. Here is what Clark Street Value has to say about Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC) in its Q4 2021 investor letter:“During the worst of covid, I bought some LEAPs on Marathon Petroleum (MPC) as a proxy for Par Pacific (PARR) since long dated options weren’t available on the later.  Those MPC calls expire next month and I’ll take profits, with PARR I’ve reduced my position throughout the year and might sell the rest early next year, I’ve owned it for 6-7 years and it has gone nowhere, they haven’t touched the NOLs, just a difficult business that I probably don’t understand as well as I should.”9. Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE:MRO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 50P/E Ratio as of January 20: 5.31Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE:MRO) is a Texas-based independent exploration and production company that engages in the exploration, production, and marketing of crude oil, condensate, natural gas liquids, and natural gas. Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE:MRO) is one of the most undervalued natural gas stocks as per elite investors. On January 13, Piper Sandler analyst Mark Lear maintained an Overweight rating on Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE:MRO) but lowered the firm's price target on the shares to $40 from $42. According to Insider Monkey’s data, Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE:MRO) was part of 50 hedge fund portfolios at the end of Q3 2022, compared to 41 in the prior quarter.

An underweight to communication services and an overweight to energy helped performance, while an underweight to consumer staples and an overweight to materials detracted. Stock selection was strong within healthcare and materials but was weak within information technology and industrials. Marathon Oil (NYSE:MRO) increased its quarterly dividend and executed an impressive share buyback that blew by the target it originally announced.”8. Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 51P/E Ratio as of January 20: 6.75Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) is an Oklahoma-based independent energy company that primarily engages in the exploration, development, and production of oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids in the United States. Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) said it expects Q4 production to be reduced by 2%, or 15,000 boe/day, due to the impact of harsh weather across its operations in December, especially in the Williston Basin. Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) estimates that Q4 production will be limited to an average of 636,000 boe/day, including 316,000 bbl/day of oil. It is one of the most undervalued natural gas stocks to invest in. On January 9, Mizuho analyst Nitin Kumar assumed coverage of Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) with a Buy rating and trimmed the price target to $82 from $86.

Here is what the fund said:“Our biggest dollar gainer within this period was Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN), a position which emanated from a takeover in early 2021 of our long-time holding WPX Energy. We are sitting on a material (unrealized) gain from our cost and are now receiving material dividends thanks to Devon’s thoughtful fixed/variable dividend policy. Energy is now a hot sector for investors but we have had material exposure for a long time. We remember a bit too well $40 oil, NEGATIVELY PRICED front-month oil contract, and what it’s like to own a company with leverage and negative free cash flow during such periods. Our desire to have our biggest portfolio exposures be high-return, growing, reasonably predictable and moderately levered companies led us to reduce our Devon exposure in the past. When the recent facts and circumstances for the industry changed and appeared supportive of healthy oil prices, we decided to maintain a sizable holding and more recently added to the position. At Devon’s Q1 dividend rate, which is most variable in nature, the shares now yield approximately 10% and our yield on our average cost is materially higher. In addition, we maintain additional energy exposure through our long-term (and successful) holding in Hess Midstream and less directly through TerraVest and Berkshire Hathaway’s energy investments.”7.

The company reported strong 3Q results beating on the top and bottom lines. The company reported revenue of $1.9B beating the consensus of $1.5B with EPS of $2.94 beating expectations for $2.79. The beat was driven by a combination of higher volumes, higher realizations, and efficiency gains. The company increased its total production guidance for the year to 370-372 mboe/d1 (up from 363-370 mboe/d) while lowering Capital Expenditure (CAPEX) guidance for the second time this year to $1.49-1.53B. The company raised the dividend for the third time this year to $2/share annually while authorizing a new $2B share repurchase program. Starting in 4Q21, the company plans to return 50% of Free Cash Flow to shareholders through the base dividend and a combination of buybacks and special dividends. Finally, the CEO Travis Stice announced plans to reduce methane emissions by 70% as part of the firm’s ESG initiative.”6.

As one of the lowest-cost domestic producers, EQT stands to benefit from its position as a leading supplier of natural gas to a world suffering from critically low energy reserves. The Russian invasion of Ukraine and threats to hold natural gas exports hostage have spurred a surge in European energy prices, generating long-term agreements by European countries to purchase U.S. natural gas.This strong demand and elevated prices have helped EQT strengthen its balance sheet and position it to take advantage as opportunities emerge for natural gas to plug the gaps in the global energy transition from fossil fuels to renewables.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Most Undervalued Natural Gas Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds.  Suggested articles:10 Best Healthcare Stocks for Recession12 52-week Low Dividend Stocks To Consider15 Stocks That Have Increased Dividends for 25 Years Disclosure: None. 11 Most Undervalued Natural Gas Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

""The stock had a pretty bad 2022 in terms of performance. That was based on multiple things, and some would attribute it to Elon Musk's rantings on Twitter. We think it had a lot to do with the demand situation impacting Tesla, first in China and later kind of leaking into other parts of the world, including the United States. People know that. A lot of that seems to be priced into the stock.""The bullish call on Tesla — which has become a rarity in recent months on the Street — runs counter to a host of red flags on the automaker's fundamentals.Tesla reported a delivery growth figure of 39% for 2022, which badly missed analyst estimates and fell below the company's own guidance of 50%.And earlier this month, Tesla cut the price of the Model 3 base version by $3,000 to $43,990 and the Model 3 Performance version by $9,000 to $53,990 in the U.S. As for the Model Y Long Range, the price dropped by $13,000 to $52,990 while the Performance model was cut to $56,990, about $13,000 cheaper than the prior price.The U.S. discounts come hot on the heels of recent price reductions in China, Japan, and South Korea as Tesla looks to reignite demand against growing competitive threats.Gianarikas said he believes the price cuts will stoke demand, even if it weighs on profit margins. The analyst is also bullish on the margin lift to Tesla from selling more software upgrades to customers.Customers remove the cloth covering their new China-made Model Y compact crossover vehicle at a Tesla showroom on January 18, 2021, in Shanghai, China. (Photo by VCG/VCG via Getty Images)Still, Tesla stock has plunged 54% over the past year, not helped by Elon Musk's chaotic tenure as Twitter's owner.""Very simply, this is a fork-in-the-road year ahead for Tesla that will either lay the groundwork for its next chapter of growth OR continue its slide from the top of the perch with Musk leading the way downhill,"" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a more bearish note to clients this month. ""Now is a time for leadership from Musk to lead Tesla through this period of softer demand in a darker macro and NOT the time to be hands-off, which is the perception of the Street.""Story continuesBrian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and anchor at Yahoo Finance.

With this in mind, we are always looking at value, growth, and momentum trends to discover great companies.Of these, perhaps no stock market trend is more popular than value investing, which is a strategy that has proven to be successful in all sorts of market environments. Value investors use fundamental analysis and traditional valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are being undervalued by the market at large.In addition to the Zacks Rank, investors looking for stocks with specific traits can utilize our Style Scores system. Of course, value investors will be most interested in the system's ""Value"" category. Stocks with ""A"" grades for Value and high Zacks Ranks are among the best value stocks available at any given moment.One stock to keep an eye on is American Airlines (AAL). AAL is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as a Value grade of A. The stock is trading with P/E ratio of 8.82 right now. For comparison, its industry sports an average P/E of 12.59. Over the past year, AAL's Forward P/E has been as high as 9,493.45 and as low as -3,032.07, with a median of 11.71.Value investors also frequently use the P/S ratio. This metric is found by dividing a stock's price with the company's revenue. This is a popular metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement, so they are often considered a better performance indicator. AAL has a P/S ratio of 0.23. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 0.52.Finally, investors will want to recognize that AAL has a P/CF ratio of 16.01. This metric focuses on a firm's operating cash flow and is often used to find stocks that are undervalued based on the strength of their cash outlook. AAL's P/CF compares to its industry's average P/CF of 24.30. Over the past year, AAL's P/CF has been as high as 35.74 and as low as -305.42, with a median of 14.26.Story continuesAnother great Transportation - Airline stock you could consider is United Airlines (UAL), which is a # 2 (Buy) stock with a Value Score of A.Furthermore, United Airlines holds a P/B ratio of 3.23 and its industry's price-to-book ratio is 4.81. UAL's P/B has been as high as 4.68, as low as 2.01, with a median of 3 over the past 12 months.These are only a few of the key metrics included in American Airlines and United Airlines strong Value grade, but they help show that the stocks are likely undervalued right now.

263,0b85d696-5e02-3492-a76d-c264b6223948,RF,2023-01-24,Regions Financial (RF) is a Top Dividend Stock Right Now: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/regions-financial-rf-top-dividend-164504009.html,1674492304,STORY,"['RF', 'RF-PC']","[All investors love getting big returns from their portfolio, whether it's through stocks, bonds, ETFs, or other types of securities. But when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.Cash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns.Regions Financial in FocusBased in Birmingham, Regions Financial (RF) is in the Finance sector, and so far this year, shares have seen a price change of 5.24%. The holding company for Regions Bank is paying out a dividend of $0.2 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 3.53% compared to the Banks - Southeast industry's yield of 2.16% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.64%.Looking at dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $0.80 is up 8.1% from last year. Regions Financial has increased its dividend 4 times on a year-over-year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 12.13%. Looking ahead, future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Regions Financial's current payout ratio is 34%, meaning it paid out 34% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Earnings growth looks solid for RF for this fiscal year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $2.50 per share, with earnings expected to increase 5.49% from the year ago period.Bottom LineFrom greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages, investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons. But, not every company offers a quarterly payout.Story continuesFor instance, it's a rare occurrence when a tech start-up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend. It's more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends. Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, RF is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

265,dfc56526-fc49-3b17-9719-bcaafe85ec83,V,2023-01-24,Can Visa's (V) Q1 Earnings Beat Estimates on Higher Volumes?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/visas-v-q1-earnings-beat-144802310.html,1674485282,STORY,"['V', 'FLT']","[Visa Inc. V is set to continue its earnings beat streak in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, the results of which are expected to be released on Jan 26, after the closing bell.In the last reported quarter, the payments technology company’s adjusted earnings per share of $1.93 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.8% primarily due to continued growth in payment volume, cross-border volume and processed transactions. Also, spending on travel and entertainment rose from the year-ago period. However, elevated operating costs partly offset the upside.Now, let’s see how things have shaped up prior to the first-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings announcement.The Trend in Estimate RevisionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings per share of $2 has witnessed one upward revision and one downward movement in the past week. The estimate is indicative of a 10.5% increase from the year-ago reported figure. Our estimate of $1.97 per share indicates 8.6% year-over-year growth. Visa beat earnings estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average of 8.3%. This is depicted in the graph below.Visa Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Visa Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseVisa Inc. price-eps-surprise | Visa Inc. QuoteThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $7.7 billion, suggesting an 8.8% jump from the year-ago reported figure, whereas our estimate predicts an 8% increase.What the Quantitative Model SuggestsOur proven model conclusively predicts an earnings beat for Visa this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat.Earnings ESP: Earnings ESP for the company is +0.79%. The Most Accurate Estimate is pegged at $2.02 per share, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Zacks Rank: Visa currently has a Zacks Rank #3.Story continuesFactors Driving EarningsRising travel and entertainment-related spending are expected to have driven Visa’s performance in the fiscal first quarter. The adoption of digital payments is expected to have continued in the quarter under review.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total volume, which consists of cash volume and payment volume (the primary lever of service revenues), indicates an increase of 5.4% from the year-ago period's reported figure. Our estimate indicates a 9% increase in the metric for the quarter under review.As the company draws revenues as a set percentage of total transaction value every time a customer makes payments with a debit/credit card, higher spending means more revenues in the form of transaction processing fees. The consensus mark and our estimate for total payments transactions both indicate a 12.4% year-over-year increase. The metric for U.S. operations alone is expected to jump 10.7% year over year.We expect data processing revenues to increase 8.4% year over year in the fiscal first quarter. With growth in payment volume and processed transactions, Visa’s operating efficiency is expected to have improved in first-quarter fiscal 2023. This is expected to have positioned the company for year-over-year bottom-line growth and an earnings beat.However, rising expenses are likely to have partially offset the positive impacts of higher volumes. We expect adjusted total operating expenses for the quarter under review to increase 13.5% year over year due to increased Personnel, Network and Processing, and Professional Fees expenses.Other Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other companies from the broader Business Services space that you may also want to consider, as our model shows that these too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this time around:TuSimple Holdings Inc. TSP has an Earnings ESP of +4.09% and is currently a Zacks #2 Ranked player. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for TuSimple’s bottom line for the to-be-reported quarter has been unchanged over the past week. TSP beat earnings estimates in three of the past four quarters and missed once, with an average surprise of 10.6%.Avis Budget Group, Inc. CAR has an Earnings ESP of +10.36% and a Zacks Rank of 3.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Avis Budget Group’s bottom line for the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $6.66 per share, which improved 3.7% in the past 30 days.

But that was still less than half the 558,000 customers the company added in the same period last year.Chief Executive Hans Vestberg also warned Verizon would move away from promotions. ""We believe current promotion incentives are not sustainable for the industry in the long run.""An increase in interest rates and rising costs due to inflation prompted the weak outlook, Morningstar analyst Michael Hodel said.""We're starting to see some normalization in the broader growth rate for the industry,"" Hodel added.Verizon expects adjusted profit between $4.55 per share and $4.85 per share in 2023, below Wall Street estimate of $4.97 per share, according to Refinitiv data.The New York-based company said it expects wireless service revenue to grow between 2.5% and 4.5% in 2023 after posting an 8.6% increase in 2022.Even so, analysts reckon broadband demand would be a bright spot for Verizon, powered by its scale-up of fixed wireless access, which supports 5G technology.

The impact of the 3G network shutdown has been excluded for purposes of calculating wireless retail net additions and wireless churn for the respective periods.4Includes a benefit of approximately 190 basis points from the reallocation from Other revenue to Wireless service revenue. This results from a larger allocation of administrative and telco recovery charges which partly recover network operating costs.5Total wireless service revenue represents the sum of Consumer and Business segments.Verizon Communications Inc.

Let's take a look at some of the movers, top movers of the day. First up, we got to talk about Microsoft. Shares closing to the upside after the company officially announcing its extended partnership with OpenAI. That's the parent company of ChatGPT. The gains that we're looking at today is just about 1%. Taking a look at what this could mean for the company down the road here, Dave, this deal we know adding to Microsoft's initial investment of about a billion dollars back in 2019.Analysts are very bullish about this. Dan Ives from Wedbush, we've talked to him about this potential investment when it was just reported. But he's sending out a note today calling it a potential game changer for Microsoft, saying it is a direct shot to Google and other big tech companies, saying that Nadella and co, Satya Nadella is ahead of the rest of big tech. And this investment is a major notch on the AI belt. Doesn't get much more bullish than that.- No, it doesn't. Let's talk about those two things. One, what the threat is to competitors. Well, we know from some ""New York Times"" reporting that Sergey Brin and Larry Page have come back to-- the founders of Google have come back. And they're not back at all because of the threat of ChatGPT. They know how big this is. And the theory is that it's actually a threat to Google's search business, which many have balked at because how significant could Bing be?Well, apparently it's big if you've got the two founders of Google coming back. But what did Satya Nadella say today? We believe large-scale AI-like chat will create transformative impact at the magnitude of the personal computer, the internet, mobile devices, and the cloud. That's a pretty significant statement about what he believes ChatGPT will do. Completely disrupt just about every industry out there.Story continues- Yeah. Exactly. And it's coming at a time-- this investment here, at a time when Office, Azure projected to slow meaningfully. That was the crux of Barclay's note out on this today, saying that it could not have come at a more opportune time. We'll get results from Microsoft tomorrow after the bell, where I'm sure a question or two are going to be on OpenAI.- That call will be interesting. We certainly won't see ChatGPT in the earnings themselves. But some commentary will be fascinating. We also have coming up on this program a young man who is a Princeton student that has already invented an app that would detect cheating by ChatGPT. It can tell if it's written by human or AI. That's coming up. Also, Salesforce has been in focus all day amid activist investor activity. Elliott Investment Management announced that it's taken a stake in the company. And CNBC reporting Inclusive Capital has also taken a position. We spoke to Patrick Gadson, who has dealt with this company in numerous times, Elliott Management. He knows all about Paul Singer and what they are in this industry. Here's what he said.PATRICK GADSON: They are the Godzilla of the space. They make entire countries in South America tremble. So they are known to see things all the way through. And many activists are sort of price sensitive when it comes to running campaigns. Elliott is not. They are completely inelastic when it comes to their budget for any proxy contest, any proxy wars. They'll spend tens of millions.- If you weren't familiar with Paul Singer and Elliott Management, well, now you are. Look at Salesforce, up 3%, I guess because what we just heard there from Mr. Gadson is they don't lose. They have no time frame. And they don't care what they have to spend to win. They're going to get the job done, including with entire countries like Argentina.- Yeah. Exactly. He said when they walk in the room, you sit up straight and you pay attention. That's simply what you have to do when you're dealing with Elliott Management. When you take a look at Salesforce, clearly the stock has been under pressure, as well as many of its competitors out there, over the last several months. That one-year chart, you're looking at losses of nearly 30%. Some key executive changes have happened over the last couple of months. The co-CEO Bret Taylor leaving the company. A lot of people asking Benioff some questions just in terms of what this means for the direction of Salesforce going forward.In terms of what the Street is saying to this, Needham saying that the guess is that the outcome is all about margin expansion, question whether more layoffs could potentially be on the table. We know Salesforce was one of the tech companies to announce a significant amount of layoffs earlier this year. So I think the company is under pressure. More and more activist investors paying more attention, taking stakes reportedly, at least when it comes to the smaller company. Elliott Management, though, confirming that stake today. We had Stauber back in October. So it's getting more attention from activists and investors. We'll see what changes are actually made.- Yeah. And we don't know what they want. But it was an interesting revelation from Gadson. At least his interpretation is that, why do we learn about reports like this? Why are we hearing it? And his theory is it's because something already happened, probably a late Q4 development. In his estimate, that could be a complete breakdown in those talks or they're about to announce something, i.e. board appointments. So his theory is something has happened, either positive or negative, to break that story.- Yeah. And just taking a look at the track record here, when it comes to Elliott Management, they've dealt with PayPal, AT&amp;T, Dell, Pinterest just to name a few in the past, and forcing numerous changes at those companies. So Benioff under a bit of pressure today and likely for a couple of weeks. All right. Let's talk about the chip stocks here. They are among the leaders in the NASDAQ today. Barclays out with a bullish note upgrading AMD, Qualcomm, and reiterating a buy rating on Nvidia They don't see the group of stocks retesting those October lows. A bullish call here from Barclays.The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, that's up more than 30% from a two-year low in mid-October. Analyst Blaine Curtis here of Barclays saying that he's more positive on companies with the data center PC handset exposures. Also, the reopening in China will start benefiting the industry he sees in the second half of the year. You're looking at a one-year chart of the Philly Semiconductor Index. Despite that 30% rally off the lows, still off about 14% this year, with a number of those larger chip stocks in the red over the last 12 months as well.- And you know where I'm going to go with this. ChatGPT. Because there was a number of analysts who said there's one name that's probably going to benefit the most from this. And that is Nvidia. They are poised to benefit the most from the bounce from ChatGPT, including Citi, which said that is why they believe in Nvidia moving forward.

IDXX is expected to report fourth-quarter 2022 results on Feb 1, before market open.In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings per share of $2.15 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5.4%. Moreover, earnings outpaced the consensus estimate in the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 5.19%.Let’s take a look at how things have shaped up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayThe Companion Animal Group (CAG) business is expected to have gained from consistently strong organic CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues backed by an increasing number of pet patients. Supported by solid global demand for veterinary services, building on a significant step-up in pet ownership and patient visits will lead to substantial CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue gains in Q4.Sales contributions from veterinary software and diagnostic imaging, including the benefits from the ezyVet acquisition, are likely to have been advantageous for the business in the to-be-reported quarter. The company’s veterinary software is also expected to report strong growth for the fourth quarter supported by gains in recurring software and digital imaging revenues and continued strong momentum in cloud-based software placements.IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseIDEXX Laboratories, Inc. price-eps-surprise | IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. Quote IDEXX’s CAG premium instrument placements are expected to have recorded strong growth in Q4 on the continued rise in Catalyst and premium hematology placements. In the prior quarter, consumable gains were supported by 14% year-on-year growth in the global premium instrument installed base, reflecting double-digit increases across catalyst premium hematology and a set of new platforms. The company placed 4,737 CAG premium instrument placements in the third quarter. Strong customer retention backed by ProCyte One momentum and global expansion efforts in premium hematology placements is likely to have benefited the company’s CAG arm in Q4.Story continuesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for CAG revenues is pegged at $736 million, suggesting an improvement of 2.4% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.IDEXX’s Water business is likely to have delivered impressive revenue performance on solid volume gains and strong price gains. The business is expected to have benefited from a continued increase in water testing demand across the world as the effects of the pandemic abate and economies gradually recover from the pandemic.During the third quarter, IDEXX completed the acquisition of Tecta-PDS — an automated microbiology testing platform that complements our existing water offering and expands our capabilities in this highly-attractive business segment. We expect this buyout to have contributed to IDEXX’s revenues in the to-be-reported quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Water revenues is pegged at $38.1 million, suggesting a rise of 2.6% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Within the Livestock, Poultry and Dairy (LPD) arm, we expect revenue growth in Q4 to have been impacted by lower pork prices and changes in government requirements related to livestock infectious disease testing programs.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for LPD revenues is pegged at $30.4 million, suggesting a fall of 28.5% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Q4 EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fourth-quarter 2022 revenues is pegged at $815.7 million, suggesting a rise of 1.8% from the year-ago reported figure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter 2022 net earnings of $1.92 per share indicates a 1.6% improvement from the year-ago reported figure.What Our Model SuggestsOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for IDEXX this time around.

""Results in our commercial businesses were exceptional, with another quarter of strong growth at very attractive margins. Underlying results in Personal Insurance remain challenged by elevated industrywide loss costs. We recorded another quarter of progress with strong pricing and other actions to address these challenges.""Core income for the fourth quarter was $810 million, or $3.40 per diluted share, generating core return on equity of 12.3%. This result includes $459 million of pre-tax catastrophe losses ($362 million after-tax). Core income benefited from record net earned premiums of $8.8 billion, up 10% compared to the prior year period, and a solid underlying combined ratio of 91.4%.""Our best-in-class marketplace execution produced 10% growth in net written premiums this quarter to almost $9 billion, with all three segments contributing. In Business Insurance, net written premiums grew by 11% to $4.4 billion. Renewal premium change remained very strong at an historically high 10.1%, with record-high retention of 88%. New business in Business Insurance of $558 million increased 10% from the prior year period. Given the attractive returns, we are pleased with the very strong retention of our high-quality book of business and the strong new business growth. In Bond &amp; Specialty Insurance, net written premiums increased 5% on a constant currency basis, driven by excellent production in our market-leading surety business. Production was also strong in our management liability business, with renewal premium change of 6.3%, retention of 90% and 23% growth in new business. In Personal Insurance, top-line growth was driven by higher pricing. Renewal premium change was meaningfully higher both year over year and sequentially.""Our full year 2022 results benefited from higher core income from our commercial businesses, driven by record net earned premiums and strong profitability, including our best-ever underlying combined ratio in Business Insurance. Our high-quality investment portfolio generated after-tax net investment income of $2.2 billion for the year. Our underwriting and investment results, together with our strong balance sheet, enabled us to return nearly $3 billion of excess capital to shareholders, including more than $2 billion of share repurchases, while also growing adjusted book value per share and making important investments in our business.""Our results this year cap off a decade of terrific performance. Over that period, we have significantly accelerated premium growth while generating superior returns with industry low volatility.

(BRK.B), Chubb Ltd. CB, The Progressive Corp. PGR, The Travelers Companies Inc. TRV and Everest Re Group RE.Industry: Property &amp; Casualty InsuranceLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2041937/5-property-casualty-insurers-to-gain-despite-catastrophe-lossThe Zacks Property and Casualty Insurance (P&amp;C) industry is likely to benefit from better pricing, prudent underwriting and exposure growth. Industry players like Berkshire Hathaway Inc., Chubb Ltd., The Progressive Corp., The Travelers Companies Inc. and Everest Re Group are poised to grow despite a rise in catastrophic activities. Given an active catastrophe environment, the policy renewal rate should accelerate. Also, the increasing adoption of technology and the emergence of insurtech will help in the smooth functioning of the industry players.Though the industry is witnessing a rate increase, the magnitude has decreased in the last seven quarters. Nonetheless, an improvement in surplus and accelerated economic activities set the stage for a better M&amp;A environment.About the IndustryThe Zacks Property and Casualty Insurance industry comprises companies that provide commercial and personal property insurance, and casualty insurance products and services. Such insurance helps to safeguard property in case of any natural or man-made disasters. Liability coverages are also provided by some industry players. The insurance coverage offered also includes automobiles, professional risk, marine, excess casualty, aviation, personal accident, commercial multi-peril, and professional indemnity and surety.Premiums are the primary source of revenues for these insurers. These companies invest a portion of premiums to meet their commitments to policyholders. The interest rate environment has started to improve. The Fed has already made seven hikes in 2022 with more to come in 2023. An improving rate environment is a boon for insurers, especially long-tail insurersStory continues4 Trends Shaping the Future of the Property and Casualty Insurance IndustryImproved pricing to help navigate claims: Catastrophes are a concern for insurers due to the high degree of losses incurred. They implement price hikes to ensure uninterrupted claims payment. Global commercial insurance prices rose for 20 straight quarters though the magnitude has slowed down over the last seven quarters, per Marsh Global Insurance Market Index.Better pricing will help insurers write higher premiums and address claims payment prudently. Per Deloitte Insights, trends like commercial lines witnessing growth at a faster pace than personal lines and homeowners' premiums improving better than personal auto are likely to continue in 2023. Per Deloitte Insights, gross premiums are estimated to increase sixfold to $722 billion by 2030. China and North America should account for more than two-thirds of the global market, per the report.Catastrophe loss induces volatility in underwriting profits: The property and casualty insurance industry is susceptible to catastrophe events, which drag down underwriting profit. Swiss Re estimated insured losses from natural catastrophes of $35 million for the first half of 2022, while Munich Re estimated losses of $65 billion, with slightly less than half insured.Per a report published in LAW360, AM Best estimated the net income of U.S. property and casualty insurers to decline 17% year over year to $31.4 billion in the first half of 2022. While the third quarter largely suffered the wrath of Hurricane Ian, the fourth quarter faced the wrath of winter storms that impacted much of the United States and Canada in late December.However, exposure growth, better pricing, prudent underwriting and favorable reserve development will help withstand the blow. Also, frequent occurrences of natural disasters should accelerate the policy renewal rate.Merger and acquisitions: Consolidation in the property and casualty industry is likely to continue as players look to diversify their operations into new business lines and geography. Buying businesses along the same lines will also continue as players look to gain market share and grow in their niche areas. With the reopening of the economy, optimistic growth outlook and sturdy capital level, the industry is witnessing a number of mergers, acquisitions and consolidations.Increased adoption of technology: The industry is witnessing increased use of technology like blockchain, artificial intelligence, advanced analytics, telematics, cloud computing and robotic process automation that expedite business operations and save cost. The industry has also witnessed the emergence of insurtech — technology-led insurers — creating competition for incumbent players.The focus of insurtech is mainly on the property and casualty insurance industry. Accelerated digitalization has become the need of the hour and insurers continue to invest heavily in technology to improve basis points, scale and efficiencies. As insurtechs use the latest technologies and concepts that the incumbents are just beginning to experiment with, there remains a huge market risk.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull ProspectsThe group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bleak prospects in the near term.

This company, which is in the Zacks Chemical - Diversified industry, shows potential for another earnings beat.This seller of gases for industrial, medical and other uses has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 2.36%.For the most recent quarter, Air Products and Chemicals was expected to post earnings of $2.77 per share, but it reported $2.89 per share instead, representing a surprise of 4.33%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $2.61 per share, while it actually produced $2.62 per share, a surprise of 0.38%.Price and EPS SurpriseThanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Air Products and Chemicals lately. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesAir Products and Chemicals currently has an Earnings ESP of +2.67%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on February 2, 2023.With the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

This product will be manufactured at Nucor’s $1.7 billion state-of-the-art Brandenburg steel mill at Kentucky. Elcyon has large plate dimensions, improved weldability and excellent toughness when compared to its competing products.Nucor is pursuing certification under LEED v4, which is regarded as the highest standard for sustainable building design, construction and operation, from the U.S. Green Building Council for its Brandenburg steel plant. This has made the Brandenburg steel plant the world’s first steel plant to seek this certification. The steel plant has the capacity to produce 1.2 million tons of steel annually. The new mill is located at the largest steel plate consuming region of the country, strategically placing it to meet domestic demand for plate products.The company is using its recycled scrap-based electric arc furnace to manufacture Elcyon, which is a clean and advanced steel product. This steel making process has greenhouse gas emissions intensity of about one-fifth of the global blast furnace steel making average based on scope 1 and 2 emissions. To meet the need for precise quality standards of offshore wind energy designers, manufacturers and fabricators, Nucor utilizes thermo-mechanical controlled processing (TMCP) at the new mill to manufacture Elcyon, which is a one-of-a-kind steel product made in the United States.The passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, which includes a $300 million investment for clean energy development and climate programs, has aided the Biden Administration’s goal to construct 30 gigawatts of offshore wind power by 2030. Elcyon is seen as an important component of the supply chain to continue building America’s offshore wind power infrastructure.Nucor has been the leader of sustainable steel production, and the launch of Elcyon and the Brandenburg mill has further elevated the company’s position. Nucor has been constantly working toward meeting demand of customers and other stakeholders as seen through the launch of Econiq last year, the world’s first net-zero steel available at scale, to becoming the first industrial company to join the United Nations 24/7 carbon-free energy global impact.Story continuesThe company stated that Elcyon’s larger and thicker plates will help the United States become a leader in offshore wind production and meet rising demand for alternative energy sources.

Moreover, the Galactic Starcruiser is a brand new offering from Disney, so it's rare that it would already be subject to its first promotional discount.Originally offered exclusively to Disney Vacation Club members, this 30% special offer has now been expanded to the general public in another sign that it's not living up to expectations.“Guests have been clamoring for these changes,"" wrote Rick Munarriz, a Florida-based stock analyst focusing on Disney for Motley Fool, on Thursday, ""but it's also a way to woo potentially disgruntled fans back at a time of weaker demand.""Disney did not respond to an inquiry by Fortune for comment.Galactic Starcruiser's journey so farOpening its doors in Orlando last March, the timing of the Galactic Starcruiser's arrival at Walt Disney World couldn’t have been much better.Story continuesFlush with stimulus checks, brimming with optimism after a post-pandemic economic boom and desperate to finally enjoy an actual vacation for once, guests descended by the masses on Disney’s theme parks.In its fiscal year 2022 that ended October 1st, annual operating income for the entertainment giant's tourism segment catapulted to $7.9 billion from just $471 million in the previous period.By comparison its media activities, the other far larger arm that generates about twice as much revenue, saw a 42% drop in profit due mainly to its heavy investments in streaming to better compete with Netflix.Perhaps that outsized earnings gain at its parks business led executives at Disney to believe they had a sure-fire hit on their hands with the Galactic Starcruiser hotel.It is billed as a two-night immersive experience where guests become the hero of their own Star Wars adventure aboard the Halcyon.The stay features its own storylines, lightsaber training, gourmet eating at the fictional ship’s Crown of Corellia dining area, and a spaceport day on the fictional planet of Batuu at Disney’s popular Galaxy’s Edge attraction.Unfortunately, the price of a cabin on the Starcruiser was also out of this world: a packaged deal for two adults and one child started at a combined fee of $5,299 for two nights.Despite the expensive cost, the then-CEO of Disney believed it to be a compelling deal. Characterizing interest in the experience as “phenomenal” two months after it opened its doors, Bob Chapek said the first customer ratings were “incredibly high” during an investor update.“Demand is strong and we expect 100% utilization through the end of Q3,” he said last May.By that point, however, the Federal Reserve found itself in full blown inflation-fighting mode and financial markets were starting to take it in the knee as a result of repeated interest rate hikes.Brokerage accounts once stuffed full of Tesla shares and Bitcoin cryptocurrency now shriveled in value, leaving people feeling poorer.The good news for investors subsequently appears to have dried up there.Never again did Chapek plug the Star Wars-themed hotel or provide data on demand during a quarterly earnings call. Any search in Disney’s 112-page long annual 10-K filing with the SEC dated late November comes up blank.Critical misfiresIt also may be indicative of broader problems stemming from Disney’s stewardship over the once beloved science-fiction franchise.While the wildly successful Mandalorian, a show conceived by Iron Man director Jon Favreau, helped launch Disney’s streaming service in 2019, attempts to expand the rich universe have misfired lately.Series like Obi-Wan Kenobi disappointed despite the return of star Ewan McGregor, for example. Only Andor, the Rogue One spin-off series based around Rebellion spy Cassian Andor, has been a clear critical hit recently.Consequently rumors emerged that Lucasfilm President Kathleen Kennedy, a divisive figure among fans for entrusting J.J. Abrams with the third trilogy, may lose her job once the Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny premieres in theaters this summer.Fortunately, interest in the Star Wars franchise may return with the third season of The Mandalorian, debuting in March. The trailer drew in a record 83 million-plus views in the first 24 hours, according to the Hollywood Reporter.Disney is set to report Q1 results on February 8th, with many analysts keen to see whether the company narrowed quarterly losses that had ballooned by 50% to nearly $1.5 billion.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: Air India slammed for ‘systemic failure’ after unruly male passenger flying business class urinated on a woman traveling from New YorkMeghan Markle’s real sin that the British public can’t forgive–and Americans can’t understand‘It just doesn’t work.’ The world’s best restaurant is shutting down as its owner calls the modern fine dining model ‘unsustainable’Bob Iger just put his foot down and told Disney employees to come back into the office]"

See our latest analysis for Exelon In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During the unfortunate twelve months during which the Exelon share price fell, it actually saw its earnings per share (EPS) improve by 39%. It's quite possible that growth expectations may have been unreasonable in the past.The divergence between the EPS and the share price is quite notable, during the year. So it's easy to justify a look at some other metrics.Exelon managed to grow revenue over the last year, which is usually a real positive. Since we can't easily explain the share price movement based on these metrics, it might be worth considering how market sentiment has changed towards the stock.You can see how earnings and revenue have changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-and-revenue-growthWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. If you are thinking of buying or selling Exelon stock, you should check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Exelon the TSR over the last 1 year was 9.2%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that Exelon has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 9.2% in the last twelve months. Of course, that includes the dividend. However, that falls short of the 13% TSR per annum it has made for shareholders, each year, over five years. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Exelon better, we need to consider many other factors. Take risks, for example - Exelon has   3 warning signs  (and 1 which is a bit concerning)  we think you should know about.There are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares.

The study was commissioned by ComEd to better understand the economic and workforce development challenges and opportunities Illinois will face in the transition to decarbonized energy.  Building upon recent work BW Research has completed in examining the transition to a low or no carbon economy in Massachusetts, New York, and other states, BW Research modeled the projected impacts of two possible decarbonization scenarios. A key finding of the report is that by 2030, the higher paying - what the study identifies as ""tier 1 jobs"", or those which pay at least $37 an hour -  will grow by at least nine percent, while lower paying (""tier 3"" jobs, or those which pay less than $27 an hour) do not grow or even slightly decline in the four key sectors that were most impacted by the transition to clean energy.  The study examines the impacts to regional and statewide employment from two scenarios on the transition to a net zero energy future. It captures initial and secondary employment outputs across four sectors of the economy – electricity, fuels, transportation and buildings – and quantifies employment impacts for growth and areas of displacement across these four sectors to determine outcomes on industries, occupations, and job quality.The first scenario assumes a business-as-usual approach that examines the impact of decarbonization driven by laws such as Illinois' Climate and Equitable Jobs Act (CEJA) and the federal Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) on employment across the state. It assumes no additional efforts to accelerate the electrification of transportation, buildings or industry. Under this scenario, Illinois would see a net increase of 15,000 jobs between 2021 to 2030, and an increase of 38,000 jobs between 2021 to 2050.Story continuesThe second scenario includes those same projections but factors in additional actions beyond CEJA and the IRA that achieve economywide decarbonization by 2050, such as high levels of electrification. This scenario finds a net increase of 41,000 jobs in Illinois between 2021 and 2030 and a net increase of 151,000 jobs between 2021 to 2050.""As evidenced by this foundational study, Illinois stands to gain tens of thousands of good-paying jobs from the transition to a clean energy future – and we must ensure that all communities benefit from this economic opportunity,"" said ComEd CEO Gil Quiniones. ""This research will help ensure that, working with community partners, we can build a diverse pipeline of talent ready to power the state's journey to a cleaner, brighter future.""The full report, Jobs &amp; Equitable Energy Transition Study is available for download at https://bwresearch.com/docs/BW_ComED-Jobs&amp;EquitableEnergyTransitionStudyReport2022.pdfAbout BW Research PartnershipBW Research is a full-service applied research firm and a national leader in economic and workforce impact research.

If you want to see more companies in this selection, go to the 5 Biggest Natural Gas Pipeline Companies in the World.In the past five decades, the consumption of energy globally has increased by over 2.5 times from 68,792 terawatt-hours (TWh) in 1971 to 176,431 TWh by 2021. Previously, crude oil and coal were the primary sources of energy as they fulfilled 40.7% and 24.6% of the global energy needs, respectively, 50 years ago. Meanwhile, natural gas was only responsible for fulfilling 15% of the global energy needs. Fast forward five decades, there has been a significant change in the usage of different energy sources due to environmental concerns and a move towards net zero carbon emissions. The contribution of natural gas as a source of energy has increased to 22.9% as of 2021. The change in the energy mix has been due to the swift progression in the sourcing and transporting of natural gas around the globe through pipelines. The contribution of natural gas in the overall energy mix is soon expected to surpass coal usage to become the second biggest energy source in the coming years, with crude oil being the biggest source of energy in the world.The increase in the demand and supply of natural gas around the world has resulted in the expansion of operations of multiple natural gas pipeline companies such as PetroChina, Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), and Saudi Arabian Oil Company (TADAWUL:2222.SR). The top 10 countries of the world have a natural gas pipeline infrastructure of 701,000 kilometers (km) as of 2020. This is nearly equivalent to circling the earth 17 times. North and South America are key hubs for natural gas pipeline infrastructure, with four of the top 10 countries located in this region. The US has the biggest natural gas pipeline infrastructure in the world, covering a distance of 333,000 km. The outlook of pipelines under construction and pre-construction is also bright as China is working on increasing its natural pipeline coverage by nearly 30,000 km. This makes China the biggest builder of natural gas pipelines globally. The expansion of pre-construction and under-construction natural gas and crude oil pipelines is estimated to cost $1 trillion.Story continues15 Biggest Natural Gas Pipeline Companies in the WorldPixabay/Public DomainOur MethodologyWe picked the 15 biggest natural gas pipeline companies in the world based on their revenue. We also analyzed their pipeline coverage, the scale of operations and growth plans. The companies have been ranked in ascending order of their 2021 revenue. The list includes both public limited companies and some distinguished state and privately owned entities.Biggest Natural Gas Pipeline Companies in the World15. The Williams Companies, Inc. (NYSE:WMB)Revenue 2021: $10.63BNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 35The Williams Companies, Inc. (NYSE:WMB) is a Tulsa, Oklahoma-based natural gas processing and transportation company. The  Fortune 500 company claims that it is responsible for handling 30% of the natural gas in the US.On December 16, Gabriel Moreen at Mizuho assigned The Williams Companies, Inc. (NYSE:WMB) a target price of $39 and maintained a Buy rating on the stock after the company announced the takeover of legacy Questar natural gas pipelines operator Southwest Gas for $1.5 billion. The analyst saw the development as a net positive for The Williams Companies, Inc. (NYSE:WMB) as it is acquiring assets that may provide lower growth but offer high quality in the long run.ClearBridge Investments shared its stance on The Williams Companies, Inc. (NYSE:WMB) in its Q4 2021 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“On a regional level, the Strategy’s largest exposure is in the U.S. and Canada (58%) consisting of regulated and contracted utilities (31%) and economically sensitive user-pays infrastructure (27%). During the quarter we initiated new positions in U.S. energy infrastructure company Williams Companies. With supply chain issues, higher housing costs, higher commodity prices and producer price inflation remaining square in the sights for 2022, we think higher inflation is a risk for global markets. We expect growth to slow to trend or below by mid-2022 and U.S. Treasury yields to rise, which will mean a continuation of negative real bond yields. Additional forecast volatility and therefore market uncertainty will arise as new COVID-19 variants appear and circulate.

The energy major further informed that it has entered into a 10-year contract to supply 800,000 metric tons of liquefied natural gas per year to Oman, beginning 2025. Block 10, where Shell holds a 53.45% operatorship interest, is strategically significant for Oman and is expected to balance the country's gas supply and demand shortfalls.Block 10's license agreement was signed in December 2021, and Shell was later chosen to operate the block.

This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 30, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis oil and gas well-drilling contractor is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.81 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +280%.Revenues are expected to be $689.28 million, up 68.2% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Helmerich &amp; Payne?For Helmerich &amp; Payne, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +8.68%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #1.So, this combination indicates that Helmerich &amp; Payne will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Helmerich &amp; Payne would post earnings of $0.45 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.45, delivering no surprise.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Helmerich &amp; Payne appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter is a profit of $4.27 per share on revenues of $53.6 billion.Let’s delve into the factors that might have influenced the American energy biggie’s performance in the December quarter. But it’s worth taking a look at Chevron’s previous-quarter performance first.Highlights of Q3 Earnings &amp; Surprise HistoryIn the last reported quarter, the San Ramon, CA-based integrated player beat the consensus on robust commodity prices and product margins, which propelled both CVX segments to a better-than-expected bottom line. Chevron had reported adjusted earnings per share of $5.56, eclipsing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 54 cents. Revenues of $66.6 billion had also come in 13% above the consensus mark.Chevron beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the last four quarters and missed in the others, which resulted in an earnings surprise of 1.7%, on average. This is depicted in the graph below:Halliburton Company Price and EPS SurpriseHalliburton Company Price and EPS SurpriseHalliburton Company price-eps-surprise | Halliburton Company Quote Trend in Estimate RevisionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth-quarter bottom line has remained unchanged in the past seven days. The estimated figure indicates a 66.8% improvement year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues, meanwhile, suggests an 11.3% increase from the year-ago period.Factors to ConsiderChevron is expected to have benefited from the strength in upstream segment revenues and cash flows. As a matter of fact, for the to-be-reported quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the upstream unit is pegged at a profit of $6.7 billion, indicating a significant jump from the prior-year quarter’s income of $5.2 billion.CVX is also expected to have reaped the reward of a better macro environment in its downstream (or refining) unit. With margins remaining healthy, the company should see segment earnings surge year over year. Echoing Chevron’s healthy downstream dynamics, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter’s income is projected at $1.7 billion. The number suggests a more than doubling from the profit of $760 million reported in the year-ago quarter.Story continuesWhy a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model predicts an earnings beat for Chevron this season.

The analyst believes 4Q will look similar as the analyst expects elasticities to remain better than historical norms.Hills had an uncharacteristically challenging 3Q due to supply chain constraints and inventory management by retail, but the analyst expects 4Q to see a rebound, helped by the Red Collar acquisition, which is expected to contribute 2 points to Hill’s sales.4Q ad margin is expected to be up y/y, in part due to spending that did not occur in 3Q due to the Hill’s capacity constraints, which is expected to shift into 4Q, said the analyst.Looking to 2023, top considerations in the analyst’s view include the impact of softening consumer sentiment on CL’s ability for further premiumization, with average price in oral care still at a 90% price index to the market but recent toothpaste innovations like Optic White retailing for $10.The analyst said that visibility into pricing, particularly in 2H23, and global category growth expectations would also be important factors.Price Action: CL shares are trading lower by 0.03% at $75.46 on the last check Monday.Latest Ratings for CLDateFirmActionFromToFeb 2022BernsteinUpgradesUnderperformMarket PerformJan 2022Credit SuisseMaintainsOutperformJan 2022Morgan StanleyMaintainsEqual-WeightView More Analyst Ratings for CLView the Latest Analyst RatingsDon't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Most Undervalued Natural Gas Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds. In 2022, the oil and gas industry experienced exceptional financial success, resulting in a significant amount of financial resources available to support the plans for 2023. The onset of winter in many regions around the world, which has been milder than anticipated and may continue for an extended period, particularly in the US, is reducing concerns about a potential shortage of natural gas that was forecast to lead to disruptions in service and increased energy costs. Additionally, many countries are now sitting on ample natural gas reserves. Gas storage across Europe is 84% full, far ahead of the five-year seasonal average of 70%, as per Gas Infrastructure Europe.The oil and gas industry entered 2023 with the strongest financial position it has ever had, with a commitment to maintaining financial discipline. This positive outlook is reflected in a survey conducted by Deloitte, in which 93% of oil and gas executives express a positive attitude towards the industry in the upcoming year. This positive momentum could assist companies in addressing the lack of investment in the industry in recent years and support a faster transition to cleaner energy sources. Natural gas will continue to be one of the preferred choices for generating electricity and heat.

Pioneer stood out recently with a pledge to return a large majority of free cash flow to share owners through dividends and stock buybacks, and ended hedging to give share owners more earnings and dividend potential should oil and gas prices continue to rise.”10. Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 50P/E Ratio as of January 20: 5.61Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC) was founded in 1887 and is headquartered in Findlay, Ohio.

Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE:MRO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 50P/E Ratio as of January 20: 5.31Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE:MRO) is a Texas-based independent exploration and production company that engages in the exploration, production, and marketing of crude oil, condensate, natural gas liquids, and natural gas.

An underweight to communication services and an overweight to energy helped performance, while an underweight to consumer staples and an overweight to materials detracted. Stock selection was strong within healthcare and materials but was weak within information technology and industrials. Marathon Oil (NYSE:MRO) increased its quarterly dividend and executed an impressive share buyback that blew by the target it originally announced.”8. Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 51P/E Ratio as of January 20: 6.75Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) is an Oklahoma-based independent energy company that primarily engages in the exploration, development, and production of oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids in the United States. Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) said it expects Q4 production to be reduced by 2%, or 15,000 boe/day, due to the impact of harsh weather across its operations in December, especially in the Williston Basin. Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) estimates that Q4 production will be limited to an average of 636,000 boe/day, including 316,000 bbl/day of oil. It is one of the most undervalued natural gas stocks to invest in. On January 9, Mizuho analyst Nitin Kumar assumed coverage of Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) with a Buy rating and trimmed the price target to $82 from $86.

Here is what the fund said:“Our biggest dollar gainer within this period was Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN), a position which emanated from a takeover in early 2021 of our long-time holding WPX Energy. We are sitting on a material (unrealized) gain from our cost and are now receiving material dividends thanks to Devon’s thoughtful fixed/variable dividend policy. Energy is now a hot sector for investors but we have had material exposure for a long time. We remember a bit too well $40 oil, NEGATIVELY PRICED front-month oil contract, and what it’s like to own a company with leverage and negative free cash flow during such periods. Our desire to have our biggest portfolio exposures be high-return, growing, reasonably predictable and moderately levered companies led us to reduce our Devon exposure in the past. When the recent facts and circumstances for the industry changed and appeared supportive of healthy oil prices, we decided to maintain a sizable holding and more recently added to the position. At Devon’s Q1 dividend rate, which is most variable in nature, the shares now yield approximately 10% and our yield on our average cost is materially higher. In addition, we maintain additional energy exposure through our long-term (and successful) holding in Hess Midstream and less directly through TerraVest and Berkshire Hathaway’s energy investments.”7.

The company reported strong 3Q results beating on the top and bottom lines. The company reported revenue of $1.9B beating the consensus of $1.5B with EPS of $2.94 beating expectations for $2.79. The beat was driven by a combination of higher volumes, higher realizations, and efficiency gains. The company increased its total production guidance for the year to 370-372 mboe/d1 (up from 363-370 mboe/d) while lowering Capital Expenditure (CAPEX) guidance for the second time this year to $1.49-1.53B.

Despite a ""muted"" outlook for U.S. natural gas prices between 2023 and 2024, EQT Corporation (NYSE:EQT) should be able to offer above-peer free cash flow in 2023 as ""onerous"" hedges roll-off, the analyst told investors in a research note.According to Insider Monkey’s data, EQT Corporation (NYSE:EQT) was part of 57 hedge fund portfolios at the end of September 2022, compared to 52 in the prior quarter.

As one of the lowest-cost domestic producers, EQT stands to benefit from its position as a leading supplier of natural gas to a world suffering from critically low energy reserves. The Russian invasion of Ukraine and threats to hold natural gas exports hostage have spurred a surge in European energy prices, generating long-term agreements by European countries to purchase U.S. natural gas.This strong demand and elevated prices have helped EQT strengthen its balance sheet and position it to take advantage as opportunities emerge for natural gas to plug the gaps in the global energy transition from fossil fuels to renewables.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Most Undervalued Natural Gas Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds.  Suggested articles:10 Best Healthcare Stocks for Recession12 52-week Low Dividend Stocks To Consider15 Stocks That Have Increased Dividends for 25 Years Disclosure: None. 11 Most Undervalued Natural Gas Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

The rotary rig count, issued by BKR, is usually published in major newspapers and trade publications.Baker Hughes’ data, issued at the end of every week since 1944, helps energy service providers gauge the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry. The number of active rigs and its comparison with the prior-week figure indicates the demand trajectory for Baker Hughes’ oilfield services from exploration and production companies.DetailsTotal U.S. Rig Count Falls: The count of rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States was 771 for the week ended Jan 20. The figure is lower than the prior week’s count of 775. The tally increased in seven of the prior 12 weeks. The current national rig count is, however, higher than the year-ago level of 604.The onshore rigs in the week ended Jan 20 totaled 753, lower than the prior week's count of 754. In offshore resources, 16 rigs were operating, also below the prior week’s count of 19.U.S. Oil Rig Count Falls: The oil rig count was 613 in the week ended Jan 20, lower than the prior-week figure of 623. The current number of oil rigs — far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014 — is, however, up from the year-ago figure of 491.U.S. Natural Gas Rig Count Increases: Natural gas rig count of 156 is higher than the prior-week figure of 150. The count of rigs exploring the commodity is higher than the prior-year week’s tally of 113. Per the latest report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is 90.3% lower than the all-time high of 1,606 recorded in 2008.Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs totaled 22 units, lower than the prior-week count of 26. The horizontal/directional rig count (encompassing new drilling technology with the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations) of 749 is unchanged from the prior-week level.Story continuesGulf of Mexico (GoM) Rig Count Falls: GoM rig count was 16 units, all oil-directed. The count was lower than the prior-week number of 19.Rig Count in the Most Prolific BasinPermian — the most prolific basin in the United States — recorded a weekly oil rig tally of 351, lower than the prior week's count of 353. The tally increased in four of the past six weeks.OutlookThe West Texas Intermediate crude price is trading at more than the $80-per-barrel mark, which is highly favorable for exploration and production activities. Solid oil prices will likely pave the way for further rig additions despite a slowdown in drilling activities, as upstream players mainly focus on stockholder returns rather than boosting output.Investors may keep a close eye on energy stocks like EOG Resources EOG and Devon Energy Corporation DVN, as these companies are expected to benefit from the current healthy oil price scenario.EOG Resources, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), is a leading oil and natural gas exploration and production company. It is well-placed to capitalize on the promising business scenario. It has an estimated 11,500 net undrilled premium locations, resulting in a brightened production outlook. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.EOG Resources is strongly committed to returning capital to shareholders. Since it transitioned to premium drilling, the company has returned $10.4 billion in cash to stockholders. With the employment of premium drilling, EOG can reduce its cash operating costs per barrel of oil equivalent, thereby aiding its bottom line.Devon Energy is a well-known upstream energy firm with a strong multi-basin portfolio.

338,6f14942a-65be-31ae-9c44-beb0ff85b679,URI,2023-01-24,"United Rentals, Inc. (NYSE:URI) Shares Could Be 27% Below Their Intrinsic Value Estimate",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/united-rentals-inc-nyse-uri-144600572.html,1674485160,STORY,['URI'],"[Today we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of United Rentals, Inc. (NYSE:URI) as an investment opportunity by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. See our latest analysis for United Rentals Step By Step Through The CalculationWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.07bUS$2.46bUS$2.33bUS$2.75bUS$2.91bUS$3.06bUS$3.18bUS$3.29bUS$3.39bUS$3.48bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x6Analyst x5Analyst x2Analyst x1Est @ 6.13%Est @ 4.89%Est @ 4.02%Est @ 3.40%Est @ 2.98%Est @ 2.68% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 9.5% US$1.9kUS$2.1kUS$1.8kUS$1.9kUS$1.9kUS$1.8kUS$1.7kUS$1.6kUS$1.5kUS$1.4k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$17bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 9.5%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$3.5b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (9.5%– 2.0%) = US$47bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$47b÷ ( 1 + 9.5%)10= US$19bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$36b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$384, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 27% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at United Rentals as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 9.5%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.251. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for United RentalsStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.WeaknessNo major weaknesses identified for URI.OpportunityAnnual revenue is forecast to grow faster than the American market.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.Significant insider buying over the past 3 months.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

340,44db280b-f140-3899-8f5e-c0b86be2ef01,URI,2023-01-24,United Rentals and Huntington Ingalls Industries have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/united-rentals-huntington-ingalls-industries-135301070.html,1674481981,STORY,"['URI', 'FANG', 'DINO', 'XOM', 'HII']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – January 23, 2023 – Zacks Equity Research shares United Rentals URI as the Bull of the Day and Huntington Ingalls Industries HII as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on HF Sinclair DINO, ExxonMobil XOM and Diamondback Energy FANG.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:Bull of the Day:Coming out of the pandemic, there were many newly found shortages. These shortages led to higher prices for consumers across the globe. It also made for some incredible years for several companies. Many were able to charge prices that they will never see again, with unbelievable margins as well. Moving forward, it has become tough to recognize which companies will be able to keep their margins high and keep the profits rolling in.One way to figure it out is by leaning on the Zacks Rank. Stocks in the good graces of our Zacks Rank have the strongest earnings trends, which are most likely to continue on in the future. One such stock is today's Bull of the Day, United Rentals. United Rentals, Inc. is the largest equipment rental company in the world. It provides rental equipment for a diverse range of industries and uses, including construction, manufacturing, transportation, oil and gas, government, and disaster response. The company has an extensive inventory of equipment, including earthmoving equipment, aerial work platforms, power and HVAC equipment, pumps, tools, and more. United Rentals operates through a network of over 1,300 rental locations in North America and 11 other countries.Over the last sixty days, five analysts have increased their earnings estimates for next year. That bullish behavior is the recent why the stock is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). These revisions have also pushed up our Zacks Consensus Estimate for next year from $35.25 to $37.58. That now represents earnings growth of 15.5% for next year. Current year growth is even stronger, at 47.46%.Story continuesThe stock has had one of the strongest Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Charts over the last few years. Earnings bottomed out into the depths of the COVID shutdown. Since then, earnings have consistently grown year-over-year. Not only have earnings been on the rise year-over-year, but estimates have ticked up nearly each and every month.Bear of the Day:The market has been trying to recover after last year's down year. There has been a nice bounce to start the year, with some major technical indicators showing strength in the move. However, that doesn't mean that you should just go out there and load the boat on the first stock you see. That could lead to you adding stocks which have seen their earnings fall into a downtrend.One way to uncover these stocks is by leaning on the Zacks Rank. Stocks which are Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stocks have seen analysts cut earnings estimates. When analysts are predicting dismal futures like this, it may be a stock to avoid in the near-term.Today's Bear of the Day is one of these. It's Huntington Ingalls Industries. Huntington Ingalls Industries is the largest military shipbuilding company in the United States and one of the largest in the world. The company designs and builds ships for the U.S. Navy and Coast Guard, as well as for international customers. HII's portfolio includes aircraft carriers, amphibious warfare ships, surface combatants, and submarines, as well as a wide range of support and auxiliary ships. The company also provides a range of engineering and technical services, including ship design and systems integration, as well as maintenance and modernization services.Over the last sixty days, analysts cut their earnings estimates for both the current year and next year. The bearish sentiments have dropped our Zacks Consensus Estimates for the current year from $15.32 to $14.69 while next year's number is off from $17.98 to $14.92.Additional content:3 Safe Dividend Stocks Worth Considering in the Energy SpaceThe Energy sector is infamous for being notoriously volatile, with sudden positive surprises and crashes. While wild price moves have always been integral to investment in oil and natural gas, the quantum of uncertainty has increased manifold in recent years, especially post-COVID.In an erratic energy market setting, investing in high-quality dividend stocks like HF Sinclair, ExxonMobil and Diamondback Energy might fetch you promising returns.Use Dividend to Shield from Unpredictable Energy PricesFrom the depths of minus $38 a barrel during the height of the pandemic in April 2020 to a 14-year high surge of above $130 per barrel in March last year and finally around $80 now, crude has been on a roller-coaster ride over the past few years. It's not any different for natural gas. The fuel slumped to a 25-year low in June 2020 but hit $10 per MMBtu in 2022 for the first time since 2008 before falling to the current $3 level. Diverse factors ranging from demand/supply fundamentals to economic events to geopolitical/weather shocks influence commodity price realizations. As evident from the energy market story, stocks can take a sudden turn for the good (or bad), making stock picking a risky game. Every good stock also has its bad day, which adds to the risk. With uncertainty ruling the markets, it is not surprising that dividend investing has emerged as one of the most popular investing themes.Dividend stocks are always investors' preferred choices as they provide steady income and cushion against market risks. These stocks are generally less volatile in nature and hence, are dependable when it comes to long-term investment planning. They not only offer higher income but also protect against equity market risks.Dividend stocks are safe bets to create wealth, as the payouts generally act as a hedge against economic uncertainty and simultaneously provide downside protection by offering sizable yields on a regular basis. Finally, dividend growth can also help investors to offset some of the value destruction of the high inflationary environment prevailing at the moment.How to Pick the Best Dividend Stocks?Although the benefits of dividend investing cannot be stressed enough, one should keep in mind that not every company can keep up with its dividend-paying momentum. Hence, a cautious strategy needs to be followed to select the best dividend stocks with the potential for steady returns.To guide investors to the right picks, we recommend stocks with a payout ratio of less than 60 and a dividend yield of at least 2%. Moreover, these companies have hiked their dividends over the past five years.Calculated by dividing dividend per share by earnings per share, the payout ratio indicates how comfortably a firm can pay the dividend from its earnings. It is one of the key metrics that dividend growth investors consider when looking for potential investments. A payout ratio below 60 looks quite sustainable and leaves enough scope for future dividend hikes.With our objective to build a dividend income portfolio, we look for companies that at least have better yields than the S&amp;P 500. A representative of the broader market, the index currently yields 1.59%. While our yield criterion isn't very high, it's at a level where the company can weather all kinds of commodity price environments and provide a reliable income stream to investors.Finally, we only consider stocks that have a consistent dividend, i.e., paying and increasing offerings over the past five years. It also acts as an indicator of what to expect from the company in the next few years on the payout front.Our ChoicesWe have used the above criteria to narrow down three dividend-paying energy stocks.HF Sinclair Corp.: A producer and marketer of gasoline, diesel fuel and other specialty products, HF Sinclair pays out a quarterly dividend of 40 cents ($1.60 annualized) per share that gives it a 3% yield at the current stock price. The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company's payout ratio is 14, with a five-year dividend growth rate of 4.78%. (Check HF Sinclair's dividend history here)You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.DINO is valued at some $10.7 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for HF Sinclair's 2022 earnings has been revised 5.5% upward over the past 90 days. The downstream operator has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of roughly 695.8%, on average. DINO shares have gained 61.5% in a year.ExxonMobil: ExxonMobil is one of the largest publicly traded oil and gas companies in the world, which participates in every aspect related to energy — from oil production to refining and marketing. XOM's dividend of 91 cents per share ($3.64 annualized) represents a 3.29% yield. The Zacks #3 Ranked ExxonMobil's payout ratio is 28, with a five-year dividend growth rate of 2.17%. (Check ExxonMobil's dividend history here)ExxonMobil is valued at some $455.5 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for XOM's 2022 earnings has been revised 5.4% upward over the past 90 days. ExxonMobil, headquartered in Irving, TX, has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of roughly 5.1%, on average. XOM shares have gained 54.2% in a year.Diamondback Energy: Diamondback Energy is an independent oil and gas exploration &amp; production company with its primary focus on the Permian Basin. FANG's dividend of $2.26 per share comprises 75 cents ($3 annualized) in regular payout, plus a variable cash component of $1.51 apiece. The regular component represents a 2.08% yield. The #3 Ranked Diamondback's payout ratio is 13, with a five-year dividend growth rate of 55.31%. (Check Diamondback Energy's dividend history here)Diamondback is valued at some $25.4 billion. For 2022, FANG has a projected earnings growth rate of 115.1%. Diamondback, headquartered in Midland, TX, has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of roughly 5.7%, on average. FANG shares have gained 24.1% in a year.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks? Our 5 best-performing strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's impressive +28.8% gain in 2021.

Considering the low cost of production in both assets, it will continue to generate handsome returns.

354,4dcb2792-7bcb-32ab-8368-2ba98a08864f,STX,2023-01-24,Confluent (CFLT) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/confluent-cflt-expected-beat-earnings-150003144.html,1674486003,STORY,"['CFLT', 'STX']","[Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Confluent (CFLT) reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 30, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis data infrastructure software maker is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.15 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +21.1%.Revenues are expected to be $162.39 million, up 35.4% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.18% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Confluent?For Confluent, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +2.17%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Confluent will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Confluent would post a loss of $0.17 per share when it actually produced a loss of $0.13, delivering a surprise of +23.53%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Confluent appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAnother stock from the Zacks Technology Services industry, Seagate (STX), is soon expected to post earnings of $0.13 per share for the quarter ended December 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -94.6%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $1.82 billion, down 41.5% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Seagate has been revised 7.3% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -153.16%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Seagate will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Let's check out some trading tickers on the Yahoo Finance platform.Add another one to the list of layoffs, Newell Brands has announced a restructuring and savings initiative called Project Phoenix that is expected to result in 13% of office positions being cut. The company will begin the process of reducing headcount in Q1. It will continue throughout the year. When fully implemented, Newell expects to realize annualized pretax savings in the range of $220 to $250 million.And this one seems to be focused on consolidating international operations. I think just running a more lean and efficient operation has been a focus of CEO Ravi Saligram, who we've talked to a lot in recent years since he joined the company. So I can't say I'm surprised by this initiative.And also it comes in the context of a lot of these retailers ending the holiday season too high on inventory, notably in the home and furnishing category. And I'll put Newell Brands' products under home furnishings.BRAD SMITH: Well, for some of the other simplification that they're talking about within this restructuring plan, it sounds like they're gonna go from five operating segments now down to three operating segments. And consolidation is really gonna take place between this commercial solutions, home appliances, home solutions segment, as well there.And so perhaps within that, trying to make sure that it at least looks a little bit more-- a little bit more, for lack of a better word, has more well-roundedness, perhaps, in that segment itself, as they kind of redefine exactly where they're gonna allocate some of the other headcount based on the people that are being retained as part of this, too.JULIE HYMAN: So it's not just tech.BRAD SMITH: Yeah.JULIE HYMAN: We should make that clear, right? When we talk about all these layoffs that are happening, a lot of it's happening in tech, the preponderance is happening in tech. But we're gonna see other companies, as we head into a rockier period, you know, as they batten down the hatches or prepare for what's coming, they're gonna do this also.Story continuesI'm just looking at the sales numbers for Newell. It's had two consecutive quarters of declining sales. And analysts are predicting that it's gonna have two more, at least, of declining sales. So it makes sense then, also, that it is making this kind of move in that backdrop there. So, you know, preparing for the worst after what's already been not great. I mean, the stock is down something like 36% over the past year.BRIAN SOZZI: If you're looking for good tell on the economy, it's not necessarily these tech layoffs. It's a company like Newell that sells affordable bowls at a Target. They sell baby strollers. They sell pens at Staples. And all these products, the prices on these everyday products have gone up significantly. Not just for Newell, really across the board for consumer products.And this might be consumers just cutting back for whatever reason. They cannot go and buy that stroller. They're sticking with the pens they have. To me, this is a big red flag on the economy more broadly.BRAD SMITH: The pens last too long.BRIAN SOZZI: Yes.BRAD SMITH: There's just too good.BRIAN SOZZI: [LAUGHS]]"

However, the company's fundamentals look pretty decent, and long-term financials are usually aligned with future market price movements. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Occidental Petroleum's  ROE today.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. Check out our latest analysis for Occidental Petroleum How To Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Occidental Petroleum is:45% = US$13b ÷ US$29b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.45 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.Occidental Petroleum's Earnings Growth And 45% ROETo begin with, Occidental Petroleum has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Additionally, the company's ROE is higher compared to the industry average of 32% which is quite remarkable. Given the circumstances, we can't help but wonder why Occidental Petroleum saw little to no growth in the past five years. We reckon that there could be some other factors at play here that's limiting the company's growth. Such as, the company pays out a huge portion of its earnings as dividends, or is faced with competitive pressures.Story continuesNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that the industry grew its earnings by 7.3% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if Occidental Petroleum is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.Is Occidental Petroleum Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?Occidental Petroleum has a low LTM (or last twelve month) payout ratio of 3.1% (or a retention ratio of 97%) but the negligible earnings growth number doesn't reflect this as high growth usually follows high profit retention.In addition, Occidental Petroleum has been paying dividends over a period of at least ten years suggesting that keeping up dividend payments is way more important to the management even if it comes at the cost of business growth. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company is expected to rise to 19% over the next three years. Therefore, the expected rise in the payout ratio explains why the company's ROE is expected to decline to 19% over the same period.ConclusionOn the whole, we do feel that Occidental Petroleum has some positive attributes. Yet, the low earnings growth is a bit concerning, especially given that the company has a high rate of return and is reinvesting ma huge portion of its profits. By the looks of it, there could be some other factors, not necessarily in control of the business, that's preventing growth. Additionally, the latest industry analyst forecasts show that analysts expect the company's earnings to continue to shrink in the future.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Most Undervalued Natural Gas Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds. In 2022, the oil and gas industry experienced exceptional financial success, resulting in a significant amount of financial resources available to support the plans for 2023. The onset of winter in many regions around the world, which has been milder than anticipated and may continue for an extended period, particularly in the US, is reducing concerns about a potential shortage of natural gas that was forecast to lead to disruptions in service and increased energy costs. Additionally, many countries are now sitting on ample natural gas reserves. Gas storage across Europe is 84% full, far ahead of the five-year seasonal average of 70%, as per Gas Infrastructure Europe.The oil and gas industry entered 2023 with the strongest financial position it has ever had, with a commitment to maintaining financial discipline. This positive outlook is reflected in a survey conducted by Deloitte, in which 93% of oil and gas executives express a positive attitude towards the industry in the upcoming year. This positive momentum could assist companies in addressing the lack of investment in the industry in recent years and support a faster transition to cleaner energy sources. Natural gas will continue to be one of the preferred choices for generating electricity and heat. To benefit from the boom in the natural gas industry, some of the most undervalued stocks preferred by smart investors include Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY), and ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP). Our Methodology We scanned Insider Monkey’s database of holdings of 920 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the third quarter of 2022 and picked the 11 most undervalued natural gas stocks that have P/E ratios of less than or close to 10 as of January 20. The list is arranged in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders in each firm. Story continues11 Most Undervalued Natural Gas Stocks To Buy According To Hedge FundsPhoto by Robin Sommer on UnsplashMost Undervalued Natural Gas Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds11. Pioneer Natural Resources Company (NYSE:PXD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 49P/E Ratio as of January 20: 8.44 Pioneer Natural Resources Company (NYSE:PXD) is a Texas-based company that operates as an independent oil and gas exploration and production company in the United States. The company explores for, develops, and produces oil, natural gas liquids, and gas.Mizuho analyst Nitin Kumar on January 9 assumed coverage of Pioneer Natural Resources Company (NYSE:PXD) with a Buy rating and a $294 price target. He believes that the company will improve capital efficiencies and focus on higher return projects in 2023, which should refocus investors on the company's resilient cash return program and large reserve base in U.S. shale.According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 49 hedge funds were long Pioneer Natural Resources Company (NYSE:PXD), compared to 56 funds in the prior quarter. Donald Yacktman’s Yacktman Asset Management is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 686,869 shares worth $148.7 million. Like Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY), and ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP), Pioneer Natural Resources Company (NYSE:PXD) is one of the most undervalued natural gas stocks to invest in. Here is what Carillon Scout Mid Cap Fund has to say about Pioneer Natural Resources Company (NYSE:PXD) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“Pioneer Natural Resources (NYSE:PXD) performed well in a strong energy sector. Pioneer stood out recently with a pledge to return a large majority of free cash flow to share owners through dividends and stock buybacks, and ended hedging to give share owners more earnings and dividend potential should oil and gas prices continue to rise.”10. Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 50P/E Ratio as of January 20: 5.61Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC) was founded in 1887 and is headquartered in Findlay, Ohio. It operates as an integrated downstream energy company primarily in the United States. Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC) provides crude oil, refined products, natural gas, and natural gas liquids. It is one of the most undervalued natural gas stocks to buy according to elite investors. On January 9, Barclays analyst Theresa Chen raised the price target on Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC) to $130 from $126 and kept an Overweight rating on the shares. The analyst expects another quarter of high R&amp;M earnings as a result of an above mid-cycle macro environment.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 50 hedge funds were bullish on Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC) at the end of Q3 2022, and Paul Singer’s Elliott Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with more than 11 million shares worth $1.10 billion. Here is what Clark Street Value has to say about Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC) in its Q4 2021 investor letter:“During the worst of covid, I bought some LEAPs on Marathon Petroleum (MPC) as a proxy for Par Pacific (PARR) since long dated options weren’t available on the later.  Those MPC calls expire next month and I’ll take profits, with PARR I’ve reduced my position throughout the year and might sell the rest early next year, I’ve owned it for 6-7 years and it has gone nowhere, they haven’t touched the NOLs, just a difficult business that I probably don’t understand as well as I should.”9. Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE:MRO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 50P/E Ratio as of January 20: 5.31Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE:MRO) is a Texas-based independent exploration and production company that engages in the exploration, production, and marketing of crude oil, condensate, natural gas liquids, and natural gas. Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE:MRO) is one of the most undervalued natural gas stocks as per elite investors. On January 13, Piper Sandler analyst Mark Lear maintained an Overweight rating on Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE:MRO) but lowered the firm's price target on the shares to $40 from $42. According to Insider Monkey’s data, Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE:MRO) was part of 50 hedge fund portfolios at the end of Q3 2022, compared to 41 in the prior quarter. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is the largest position holder in the company, with 8.3 million shares worth $188 million. Here is what Carillon Tower Advisers had to say about Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE:MRO) in its “Carillon Clarivest Capital Appreciation Fund” first-quarter 2022 investor letter:“Stock selection contributed the most while sector allocation was also positive. An underweight to communication services and an overweight to energy helped performance, while an underweight to consumer staples and an overweight to materials detracted. Stock selection was strong within healthcare and materials but was weak within information technology and industrials. Marathon Oil (NYSE:MRO) increased its quarterly dividend and executed an impressive share buyback that blew by the target it originally announced.”8. Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 51P/E Ratio as of January 20: 6.75Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) is an Oklahoma-based independent energy company that primarily engages in the exploration, development, and production of oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids in the United States. Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) said it expects Q4 production to be reduced by 2%, or 15,000 boe/day, due to the impact of harsh weather across its operations in December, especially in the Williston Basin. Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) estimates that Q4 production will be limited to an average of 636,000 boe/day, including 316,000 bbl/day of oil. It is one of the most undervalued natural gas stocks to invest in. On January 9, Mizuho analyst Nitin Kumar assumed coverage of Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) with a Buy rating and trimmed the price target to $82 from $86. The stock is trading at a slight premium to its large-cap peers, the company's ""fixed plus variable"" dividend is both ""sustainable and differentiated, which merits the premium valuation,"" the analyst wrote in a research note.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 51 hedge funds were bullish on Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) at the end of the third quarter of 2022, compared to 57 funds in the prior quarter. Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 10.7 million shares worth $642 million. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, GoodHeaven Capital Management, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Our biggest dollar gainer within this period was Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN), a position which emanated from a takeover in early 2021 of our long-time holding WPX Energy. We are sitting on a material (unrealized) gain from our cost and are now receiving material dividends thanks to Devon’s thoughtful fixed/variable dividend policy. Energy is now a hot sector for investors but we have had material exposure for a long time. We remember a bit too well $40 oil, NEGATIVELY PRICED front-month oil contract, and what it’s like to own a company with leverage and negative free cash flow during such periods. Our desire to have our biggest portfolio exposures be high-return, growing, reasonably predictable and moderately levered companies led us to reduce our Devon exposure in the past. When the recent facts and circumstances for the industry changed and appeared supportive of healthy oil prices, we decided to maintain a sizable holding and more recently added to the position. At Devon’s Q1 dividend rate, which is most variable in nature, the shares now yield approximately 10% and our yield on our average cost is materially higher. In addition, we maintain additional energy exposure through our long-term (and successful) holding in Hess Midstream and less directly through TerraVest and Berkshire Hathaway’s energy investments.”7. Diamondback Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:FANG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 55P/E Ratio as of January 20: 5.98Diamondback Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:FANG) is a Texas-based independent oil and natural gas company, focused on the acquisition, development, and exploration of onshore oil and natural gas reserves in the Permian Basin in West Texas. On November 29, Diamondback Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:FANG) priced an offering of $650 million 6.250% senior notes due March 15, 2053. The price to the public for the notes is 99.985% of the principal amount. The offering concluded on December 13, 2022. It is one of the most undervalued natural gas stocks to buy according to hedge funds. On January 9, Mizuho analyst Nitin Kumar initiated coverage of Diamondback Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:FANG) with a Buy rating and a price target of $195, down from $211. The company has focused on low-cost operations since its inception, which has enabled it to be a consolidator in the basin, the analyst wrote in a research note. He believes Diamondback Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:FANG)’s ""low-cost advantage should continue to shine through.""According to Insider Monkey’s Q3 data, 55 hedge funds were long Diamondback Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:FANG), compared to 54 funds in the prior quarter. Donald Yacktman’s Yacktman Asset Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 1.26 million shares worth $152 million. In its Q1 2021 investor letter, Miller Value Partners, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Diamondback Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:FANG) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Diamondback Energy (FANG) returned 14.4% in the quarter as the oil price rose and fell during the quarter ending the period largely in the same place that it started. The company reported strong 3Q results beating on the top and bottom lines. The company reported revenue of $1.9B beating the consensus of $1.5B with EPS of $2.94 beating expectations for $2.79. The beat was driven by a combination of higher volumes, higher realizations, and efficiency gains. The company increased its total production guidance for the year to 370-372 mboe/d1 (up from 363-370 mboe/d) while lowering Capital Expenditure (CAPEX) guidance for the second time this year to $1.49-1.53B. The company raised the dividend for the third time this year to $2/share annually while authorizing a new $2B share repurchase program. Starting in 4Q21, the company plans to return 50% of Free Cash Flow to shareholders through the base dividend and a combination of buybacks and special dividends. Finally, the CEO Travis Stice announced plans to reduce methane emissions by 70% as part of the firm’s ESG initiative.”6. EQT Corporation (NYSE:EQT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 57P/E Ratio as of January 20: 5.73EQT Corporation (NYSE:EQT) was founded in 1878 and is headquartered in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It operates as a natural gas production company in the United States. Debt and cost reduction have resulted in the outperformance of EQT Corporation (NYSE:EQT) stock since the current management took over. It is one of the most undervalued natural gas stocks to buy according to hedge funds. On January 9, Mizuho analyst Nitin Kumar assumed coverage of EQT Corporation (NYSE:EQT) with a Buy rating and a price target of $64, up from $61. Despite a ""muted"" outlook for U.S. natural gas prices between 2023 and 2024, EQT Corporation (NYSE:EQT) should be able to offer above-peer free cash flow in 2023 as ""onerous"" hedges roll-off, the analyst told investors in a research note.According to Insider Monkey’s data, EQT Corporation (NYSE:EQT) was part of 57 hedge fund portfolios at the end of September 2022, compared to 52 in the prior quarter. Eric W.

As one of the lowest-cost domestic producers, EQT stands to benefit from its position as a leading supplier of natural gas to a world suffering from critically low energy reserves. The Russian invasion of Ukraine and threats to hold natural gas exports hostage have spurred a surge in European energy prices, generating long-term agreements by European countries to purchase U.S. natural gas.This strong demand and elevated prices have helped EQT strengthen its balance sheet and position it to take advantage as opportunities emerge for natural gas to plug the gaps in the global energy transition from fossil fuels to renewables.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Most Undervalued Natural Gas Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds.  Suggested articles:10 Best Healthcare Stocks for Recession12 52-week Low Dividend Stocks To Consider15 Stocks That Have Increased Dividends for 25 Years Disclosure: None. 11 Most Undervalued Natural Gas Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

That is the opinion of the analysts at Citi, who in a recent note claimed the bellwether index is reaching a valuation level that will stunt further upside.Going by present rates and various “macro inputs” like growth and inflation, the high end of Citi’s fair value framework suggests an S&amp;P 500 price-to earnings multiple of 18.5x. With the S&amp;P 500’s trailing price-to-earnings ratio currently hovering near the 18.2x mark, the firm’s experts see little room for gains from here.“For now,” the analysts wrote, “we suspect valuation could put a near-term cap on upside momentum. Based on our fair value framework, valuations much above current levels are unsustainable unless there is a significant change in the macro backdrop.”This is not great news for investors hoping for a proper shift in sentiment. However, that doesn’t mean the upside for all stocks is capped. In fact, the stock experts at the banking giant have pinpointed an opportunity in two names they think could outperform in the current climate. Let's take a closer look.Mobileye Global Inc. (MBLY)We’ll start with one of last year’s hottest IPOs. Mobileye is a leader in ADAS (advanced driver assistance systems) and was spun off from parent company Intel in October in an IPO that exceeded its targeted range; the shares made a big splash on the first day of trading, closing out the session up by 38% from its listing price.Founded in 1999, the Israeli company’s driver-assistance tech has already been utilized in over 125 million vehicles. By 2030, the company expects 270 million more vehicles will be making use of its products. While Mobileye already claims a dominant position in ADAS, it has also set its sights on being the leader in the autonomous vehicle market of self-driving cars, although it could be a while until such offerings become widespread.On the financial front, the company released its fiscal third-quarter earnings in December (for the quarter ending October 1). Mobileye generated revenue of $450 million, amounting to a 38% year-over-year increase while delivering EPS of -$0.06. Both metrics beat Street expectations. Promisingly, for FQ4, the company is calling for revenue between $527 million to $545 million, exceeding the $483 million Wall Street predicted. For the full year, the company anticipates revenue north of $1.83 billion, above the $1.78 billion forecast, and operating income of at least $637 million.Story continuesFor Citi analyst Itai Michaeli, the bull case for the ADAS leader is clear. “Mobileye is at the center of what we have long viewed as the most virtuous cycle of incremental content to ever occur in the industry,” the analyst said. “We believe the company’s competitive advantages have only grown in recent years, led by an innovation-data loop and a highly scalable ADAS-AV product suite. We see 2030E revenue of &gt;$50bln (vs. ~$2bln now) and expect a domino effect of ADAS/AV adoption to create a catalyst-rich environment for the stock.”Michaeli's long term outlook is bright for MBLY stock, and he backs it with a Buy rating and a $77 price target that implies a one-year upside potential of ~123% for the stock. (To watch Michaeli’s track record, click here)Michaeli is the Street’s most prominent MBLY bull but plenty of others are backing its case. The stock claims a Strong Buy consensus rating, based on 14 Buys vs. 3 Holds. The average target stands at $43, implying the shares have room for 12-month growth of 25%. (See MBLY stock forecast)Boston Scientific (BSX)Next on our Citi-backed list is Boston Scientific, a global medical device company focused on developing, manufacturing and bringing to market products designed to improve patients’ health. The products run the gamut of indications, from cardiovascular to endoscopy, gynecology to neuro, urology and others. The result of Its ongoing R&amp;D research efforts is a wide portfolio of products which are sold to companies across the globe. This is a big operation with 40,000 employees and a market cap north of $65 billion.In its latest quarterly report, for 3Q22, BSX reported revenue of $3.17 billion, for an 8.2% year-over-year gain, whilst beating the Street’s forecast by $30 million. The company just missed on the bottom-line, delivering EPS of $0.43, below analyst expectations of $0.44.The guidance was a bit of a letdown, too, with the company revising both top-and bottom-line forecasts downwards. Nevertheless, the stock still managed to significantly beat the market last year, delivering returns of 9% over the course of 2022.The company has also been a serial acquirer and most recently announced it will buy MedTech company Apollo Endosurgery for close to $615 million - or $10 per share. The all-cash deal is anticipated to close in this year’s first half.Along with exceeding targets over the past year, the potential for further acquisitions is one of the reasons Citi's Joanna Wuensch thinks investors should take note. The 5-star analyst writes, “Management’s strategy benefited BSX in 2022, delivering 9.2% organic revenue growth YTD and 11.5% in 3Q22, versus its 2022 guidance for 8-10% and its LRP of 6-8%. Some of this may simply be attributed to its end markets, which have largely recovered from the pandemic, or that ~70% of its products are sold in ASCs which have less staffing issues than hospitals, but it is also likely successful management execution.”“Looking into 2023,” Wuensch further added, “the pipeline chart for BSX is among the most robust in our coverage and that is likely no coincidence. Thus, we anticipate that while we will be spending time thinking about the macro for BSX, we will also be thinking about the pipeline (still) particularly as it relates to Structural Heart, CRM, its next-generation Watchman, and the continuation of tuck-in acquisitions.”To this end, Wuensch rates BSX shares a Buy while her $54 price target implies one-year share appreciation of 18%. (To watch Wuensch’s track record, click here)Wuensch’s thesis gets almost full support on Wall Street; one skeptic aside, all 13 other recent reviews are positive, making the consensus view here a Strong Buy. Going by the $51 average target, the shares will generate returns of 11% over the coming year.

Robust performance of the WATCHMAN device instills investors’ optimism. However, unfavorable currency movements and stiff competition raise apprehension.In the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has gained 7% against 37.5% fall of the industry and 11.1% fall of the S&amp;P 500.The renowned manufacturer of medical devices and products has a market capitalization of $65.34 billion. The company’s long-term projected growth of 10.3% compares with the industry’s growth projection of 13%.Let’s delve deeper.Factors At PlayImpressive Value-Adding Acquisitions: We are impressed with Boston Scientific’s several recent acquisitions that have added numerous products (though many are under development) with immense potential. These are likely to boost the top line in the long term.The acquisition of Lumenis expands Boston Scientific’s Urology portfolio with its differentiated laser technology. Moreover, the acquisition of Preventice Solutions offers new-generation detection algorithms, a broad portfolio with BodyGuardian MINI and establishes a strong position for Boston Scientific in the field of cardiac diagnostics.WATCHMAN, a Long-Term Growth Component: The company’s structural heart programs are fast building momentum banking on strong performance of the WATCHMAN left atrial appendage closure device. In this regard, WATCHMAN has recently received reimbursement in Japan. This apart, the next generation WATCHMAN FLX is strongly capturing the European market.In the third quarter 2022, BSX noted that, WATCHMAN’s organic sales grew 26% year over year. Global growth remained strong supported by the FDA approval of an expanded label to include dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT). This is giving physicians and patients choice of DAPT or Oral anticoagulation in the first 45 days post implant.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStory continuesIn terms of innovation, Boston Scientific is optimistic about Trusteer, the new steerable sheath and the next-generation FLX device, WATCHMAN FLX PRO.Long-Term Growth Goals Look Impressive: In 2019, the company provided a review of its long-term growth strategy, and offered plans for product pipeline and strategic investments. According to BSX, this is aimed at improving its clinical and economic outcomes, sustaining category leadership in served markets and expanding into high-growth, adjacent markets.The plan focuses on spaces like category leadership strategy, product diversification into faster-growth markets, and expansion of portfolio and capabilities across geographies. Backed by the plan, the company expects to introduce approximately 75 products by 2022.DownsidesExposure to Currency Movement: With Boston Scientific recording 47% of its sales from the international market, it remains highly exposed to currency fluctuations. Unfavorable currency movements have been a major dampener over the last few quarters, as in the case of other important MedTech players too.Competitive Landscape: The presence of a large number of players has made the medical devices market highly competitive. The company participates in several markets, including Cardiovascular, CRM, Endosurgery and Neuromodulation, where it faces competition from large, well-capitalized companies such as Johnson &amp; Johnson, Abbott, Medtronic, Stryker, Smith &amp; Nephew and Edwards Lifesciences, apart from several other smaller companies.Estimate TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Boston Scientific’s 2022 earnings is pegged at $1.73 per share, indicating a 6.1% increase from the 2021 reported number.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 revenues is pegged at $12.68 billion, suggesting a 6.6% rise from the 2021 figure.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. AMN, Orthofix Medical Inc. OFIX and Merit Medical Systems, Inc. MMSI.AMN Healthcare, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present, has an estimated long-term growth rate of 3.3%.

While defaults remain rare, those signs of uneven demand are drawing attention.One business jet executive said he has seen a few distressed planes and customers who are late on payments due to financial hardships, some of whom are from parts of Eastern Europe or Latin America where economic growth is expected to slow.""We're watching to see if it will level off as a soft landing versus something else,"" said the executive, who asked not to be identified.Investors will be watching for clues when Gulfstream-maker General Dynamics Corp and Cessna business jet maker Textron Inc report earnings on Wednesday. Private jet makers have assured investors their billion-dollar backlogs and ongoing demand would cushion any blow from a possible recession.Planemakers rarely disclose cases of distressed planes, but argue they can easily resell unwanted models.""If, for any reason, the final sale of an aircraft does not occur, the sales team works to match the aircraft with a similar customer's mission, location and timeline,"" said Lannie O'Bannion, a senior vice president at Textron's aviation unit.HUNT FOR PLANESDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, surging wealth, access to cheap cash, and demand from elite travelers fueled a sellers' market for business jets that left planemakers with swollen backlogs and long waits for certain models.But rising interest rates that have hiked borrowing costs and growing signs of a looming recession have led some buyers to delay purchases.With demand still strong for the moment, some eager buyers are hunting for distressed assets as a way to short-circuit the still-long wait for new planes, industry officials said. Some buyers also scrambled late last year to find distressed planes to qualify for favorable taxation rules.Story continuesBrian Proctor, chief executive of aviation advisory and brokerage firm Mente Group, said he has two buyers that would look at a distressed new plane ""even if it wasn't 100% perfect.""Meanwhile, aviation attorney Stewart Lapayowker said he knew of a few buyers ""waiting on the sidelines ready to jump into a delivery that's in default"" given that some vulnerable customers were rethinking earlier orders.At the same time, the speed of sales has slowed, with preowned aircraft now taking weeks to sell instead of hours or days during late 2021, Proctor said.In another sign the market may be calming, inventory levels of listed preowned planes for sale grew more than 40% during the back half of 2022, said aviation analyst Brian Foley, citing data from industry specialist AMSTAT.Research consultancy WINGX said branded charter activity in North America fell 2% last year. WINGX sees 2023 flight activity falling from pandemic levels, but still ahead of 2019.EMISSIONS BACKLASHAnother factor giving buyers pause is the growing backlash over emissions, with countries like Belgium planning to tax corporate aircraft and the labeling of some U.S. celebrities who own jets as ""climate criminals.""Zipporah Marmor, vice president at business aviation services company ACASS, recalled one deal for a preowned business jet that fell apart following proposals in Europe to ban, tax or regulate private aircraft. The European company's board discouraged the deal.Montreal business jet maker Bombardier, which reports earnings on Feb. 9, has said it was able to resell four or five airplanes originally destined for buyers in Russia before the war in Ukraine to other customers.Aerospace analyst Richard Aboulafia said the key is avoiding a crash in demand as in 2008.""My issue is if things get 2008-bad, then the backlog is a false sense of security,"" he said, adding such a crash is unlikely.For now, one company's collapsed deal is another buyer's good fortune. Marmor turned the failed deal with the European company into a sale to a U.S. buyer two weeks later at a higher price.""Buyers are willing to be more flexible to get an airplane,"" she said.

377,ea2f29f2-972c-3a59-82f2-c4a1caff64f3,TXT,2023-01-24,Is Textron Inc.'s (NYSE:TXT) Recent Stock Performance Influenced By Its Financials In Any Way?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/textron-inc-nyse-txt-recent-150236010.html,1674486156,STORY,['TXT'],"[Most readers would already know that Textron's (NYSE:TXT) stock increased by 5.4% over the past three months. As most would know, long-term fundamentals have a strong correlation with market price movements, so we decided to look at the company's key financial indicators today to determine if they have any role to play in the recent price movement. In this article, we decided to focus on Textron's  ROE.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. View our latest analysis for Textron How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Textron is:12% = US$843m ÷ US$6.8b (Based on the trailing twelve months to October 2022).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.12.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.Textron's Earnings Growth And 12% ROETo start with, Textron's ROE looks acceptable. On comparing with the average industry ROE of 10% the company's ROE looks pretty remarkable. Given the circumstances, we can't help but wonder why Textron saw little to no growth in the past five years. Therefore, there could be some other aspects that could potentially be preventing the company from growing. These include low earnings retention or poor allocation of capital.Story continuesWe then compared Textron's net income growth with the industry and found that the company's growth figure is lower than the average industry growth rate of 7.4% in the same period, which is a bit concerning.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is TXT fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is Textron Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?Textron's low three-year median payout ratio of 2.5% (implying that the company keeps98% of its income) should mean that the company is retaining most of its earnings to fuel its growth and this should be reflected in its growth number, but that's not the case.Moreover, Textron has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more suggesting that management must have perceived that the shareholders prefer dividends over earnings growth. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 1.6% over the next three years. Despite the lower expected payout ratio, the company's ROE is not expected to change by much.ConclusionOn the whole, we do feel that Textron has some positive attributes. Yet, the low earnings growth is a bit concerning, especially given that the company has a high rate of return and is reinvesting ma huge portion of its profits. By the looks of it, there could be some other factors, not necessarily in control of the business, that's preventing growth. Having said that, looking at the current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings are expected to gain momentum.

QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for Alaska Air this earnings season.Q4 ExpectationsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Alaska Air’s fourth-quarter 2022 revenues is pegged at $2.50 billion, indicating 31.88% growth year over year. The top line is likely to have been aided by the continued recovery in air-travel demand and an improvement in passenger revenues.On the back of upbeat air-travel demand and favorable pricing, ALK has updated its fourth-quarter 2022 guidance. The company now expects fourth-quarter 2022 total revenues to increase 13-14% from the fourth quarter of 2019 actuals (the previous guidance had hinted at a 12-15% increase).  Load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) is now expected in the 84-86% band (earlier guidance was in the 83-86% range).Meanwhile, with oil prices coming down in the latter half of the December quarter, fuel price per gallon is now expected in the range of $3.50-$3.60 (earlier guidance was in the $3.50-$3.70 band) for fourth-quarter 2022. Although fuel cost guidance in the higher end has been lowered, escalating operating expenses, primarily due to fuel prices, continue to bother Alaska Air’s bottom line.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ALK’s fourth-quarter 2022 earnings has been revised downward by 12% in the past 90 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for economic fuel cost per gallon is pegged at $3.62 for the fourth quarter, indicating 60.1% growth year over year.What Our Model SaysOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Alaska Air this time around.

At the same time, the Dow added 0.76%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 0.29%.Heading into today, shares of the seller of Coca-Cola drinks in Europe had gained 1.38% over the past month, outpacing the Consumer Staples sector's loss of 0.76% and lagging the S&amp;P 500's gain of 4.06% in that time.Investors will be hoping for strength from Coca-Cola European as it approaches its next earnings release.CCEP's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $3.83 per share and revenue of $19.6 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +14.33% and +20.37%, respectively.Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Coca-Cola European. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves.

It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

381,760f9897-f538-3bf0-b139-988bf7cd0d8a,KO,2023-01-24,Warren Buffett Ditched His Flip Phone for an iPhone in 2020 and Drinks 5 Cans of Coke a Day — That's What Makes Him One of the Greatest Investors of All Time,Benzinga,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/warren-buffett-ditched-flip-phone-171609170.html,1674494169,STORY,['KO'],"[Business magnate Warren Buffett is widely regarded as one of the greatest investors of the modern-day world. His seemingly unmatched and consistent value-investing strategies have earned him the title of Oracle of Omaha.Many of his investing strategies are known, but there is one that is often overlooked yet incredibly important. It’s a lot more prevalent in the startup investing world — one customer can mean all the difference for a startup but not necessarily for public companies.What happened: Buffett is one of the best investors in the world, so there are many lessons to be learned. He loves Coke and decided long ago to invest in the Coca-Cola Co. That ended up being one of his best investments ever. Now, he is acquiring Apple Inc. stock and recently switched from a flip phone to an iPhone.So what strategy is this, and how does that relate to Buffett’s love for Coca-Cola? It’s called value-added investing, and the general idea behind it is that you should be investing in startups you use, are a customer of and can provide additional value to the company.For Buffett, one of his longest-held positions is Coca-Cola, which he has owned for over 34 years. He publicly supports the company and is said to drink as much as five cans of Coke a day.To stay updated with top startup investments, sign up for Benzinga’s Startup Investing &amp; Equity Crowdfunding NewsletterBuffett’s' firm Berkshire Hathaway Inc. began buying shares of Apple in 2016 and is now the company’s second-largest shareholder, owning over 5% of the tech giant. Later in 2020, Buffett ditched his $20 flip phone for an iPhone and now also has an iPad. The idea likely wasn’t the need for a new phone but rather a statement to support Berkshire Hathaway’s largest investment.This idea can be an effective method of investing. In the public markets, investing in companies you use likely is more effective because if you like the company, the odds are that others will, too. But your individual purchase won’t move the needle more than likely.Story continuesIn startups, that certainly is not the case. Startups often rely on funding like venture capital (VC) to keep the company going until it can be profitable. The first customers can be expensive because the brand isn’t established, and people will be more hesitant to spend their money. But if you become a buyer and unofficial brand ambassador of a startup you like, that can mean all the difference.If you regularly buy a product from a startup for a few hundred dollars, then recommend it to a few friends and family, that might produce a few thousand dollars in profitable revenue for them because it didn’t cost them money in marketing. That could be the difference between follow-on funding, paying rent that month or just rolling forward the profits to get a few more customers. If you like the product, it’s likely others will, and this can strengthen your investment thesis in the startup.As of a few years ago, it wasn’t possible for everyday investors to invest in startups, but that’s not the case anymore. Now, anyone can go on sites like StartEngine and invest in top startups, including StartEngine itself. StartEngine makes money when you invest on the site, so if you invested in StartEngine and continued to invest in other startups on the site, you’re effectively using the same principles as Buffett by using and supporting your investments. Supporting these startup investments helps them and you share in the upside.Buffett isn’t the only investor using this approach. It’s popular among startup investors and there are entire firms dedicated to this type of investing. Many VCs will reach out to companies when they find a new product they like to try to invest in, and it has produced some wildly successful results. While some people can apply this to startups that sell to other businesses, most investors will be looking toward consumer-focused companies like Apple and Coke.MaxTracker is another startup raising on StartEngine. It makes money selling GPS trackers that are used through an app on your phone. They can help you can keep your kids, car, bike and other belongings safe, and every time you purchase one, it helps get the startup off the ground. The company is valued at under $10 million right now, so if it becomes a unicorn, or billion-dollar company, that could result in substantial gains.With all of these investments, it’s important to note they are speculative and illiquid so don’t invest more than you can afford to lose. Still, startup investing can be a great way to diversify a portfolio or simply invest in a company you like.See more on startup investing from Benzinga.This Unexpected Economic Safe Haven Might Be Your Best Bet To Weather The Current StormGaming Skins Just Became A $50 Billion IndustryOriginal story found here.Don't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!

Given that the market rewards strong financials in the long-term, we wonder if that is the case in this instance. In this article, we decided to focus on Weyerhaeuser's  ROE.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. See our latest analysis for Weyerhaeuser How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Weyerhaeuser is:21% = US$2.3b ÷ US$11b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.21 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.Weyerhaeuser's Earnings Growth And 21% ROETo begin with, Weyerhaeuser seems to have a respectable ROE. Especially when compared to the industry average of 6.8% the company's ROE looks pretty impressive. This certainly adds some context to Weyerhaeuser's exceptional 42% net income growth seen over the past five years. We believe that there might also be other aspects that are positively influencing the company's earnings growth. For instance, the company has a low payout ratio or is being managed efficiently.Story continuesNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Weyerhaeuser's growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 12% in the same period, which is great to see.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Is Weyerhaeuser fairly valued compared to other companies? These 3 valuation measures might help you decide.Is Weyerhaeuser Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?Weyerhaeuser has a really low three-year median payout ratio of 17%, meaning that it has the remaining 83% left over to reinvest into its business. So it seems like the management is reinvesting profits heavily to grow its business and this reflects in its earnings growth number.Moreover, Weyerhaeuser is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 84% over the next three years. Accordingly, the expected increase in the payout ratio explains the expected decline in the company's ROE to 8.2%, over the same period.SummaryOn the whole, we feel that Weyerhaeuser's performance has been quite good. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. Having said that, on studying current analyst estimates, we were concerned to see that while the company has grown its earnings in the past, analysts expect its earnings to shrink in the future. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

Quarterly adjusted earnings and net sales, however, decreased 30% and 2.9% year over year, respectively.Weyerhaeuser’s earnings beat the consensus mark in all the last four quarters, the average surprise being 5.8%.Trend in Estimate RevisionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter’s earnings has decreased to 18 cents from 19 cents per share over the past 30 days. The estimate figure indicates a decrease of 63.3% from the year-ago reported level. The consensus mark for revenues is pegged at $1.88 billion, suggesting a 14.6% year-over-year decline.Weyerhaeuser Company Price and EPS Surprise Weyerhaeuser Company Price and EPS SurpriseWeyerhaeuser Company price-eps-surprise | Weyerhaeuser Company QuoteFactors to NoteSlow construction activities are expected to have weighed on Weyerhaeuser’s fourth-quarter 2022 performance. In late December 2022, the company updated guidance for the fourth quarter, reflecting the downside in Wood Products, partly offset by the upside in Timberland. Also, the company highlighted that its forestry operations recovered quickly post end of work stoppages.The company expects adjusted EBITDA for Wood Products to be $75 million lower than that reported in the third quarter of 2022, excluding the effect of changes in average sales realizations for lumber and oriented strand board (OSB). WY had earlier expected Wood Products adjusted EBITDA to be lower than that reported in third-quarter 2022.WY expects Timberland’s adjusted EBITDA to be $25 million lower sequentially. It previously expected Timberlands adjusted EBITDA to be significantly lower sequentially (approximately $50 million lower).Meanwhile, WY has retained the guidance for its Real Estate, Energy &amp; Natural Resources businesses. Weyerhaeuser’s earnings and adjusted EBITDA are expected to be lower than those reported in the third quarter of 2022.Overall, lower lumber and OSB prices are expected to have weighed on Weyerhaeuser’s fourth-quarter 2022 performance despite operational excellence improvements and disciplined capital allocation moves of the company.Meanwhile, transportation and resin shortages have been a headwind for the Wood business. Higher raw material costs for OSB web stock, resin and veneer are anticipated to have also been concerning.Other ProjectionsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Wood Products segment revenues (contributing approximately 78% to revenues) is pegged at $1,536 million, implying a decrease from $1,718 million reported in the year-ago period and $1,767 million in the third quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Timberland segment revenues (contributing approximately 26% to revenues) is pegged at $349 million, implying a decrease from $565 million reported in the year-ago period and $574 million in the third quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources segment revenues is pegged at $52 million, implying a decline from $59 million reported a year ago.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Weyerhaeuser this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat, which is not the case here.

This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 30. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis timberland owner and wood products company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.19 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -67.8%.Revenues are expected to be $234.43 million, down 5.6% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 8.57% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Potlatch?For Potlatch, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -36.84%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #5.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Potlatch will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Potlatch would post earnings of $0.69 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.74, delivering a surprise of +7.25%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Potlatch doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate.

In addition, the U.S. economy is cooling, business surveys showed, clouding the corporate outlook for the coming year.In an interview, Chief Executive Larry Culp said that while demand for freight carriers was slowing, the company was confident a recovery in the aerospace industry and the need to reduce carbon emissions would underpin demand for GE's products.""We probably have a level of resiliency that will serve us well,"" Culp told Reuters.GE's shares were down about 0.5% in morning trade.Culp said the company was still wrestling with inflationary and supply-chain pressures. He expects inflation to be a ""test"" for GE even as it adjusts its prices to offset higher costs.GE is not alone. Raytheon expects labor and material inflation to cost it about $2 billion in 2023, while 3M said inflation was boosting the cost of raw materials and logistics.Culp said while GE had not seen any material improvement in supply-chain problems, it has sought to work around them.

(BRK.B), Chubb Ltd. CB, The Progressive Corp. PGR, The Travelers Companies Inc. TRV and Everest Re Group RE.Industry: Property &amp; Casualty InsuranceLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2041937/5-property-casualty-insurers-to-gain-despite-catastrophe-lossThe Zacks Property and Casualty Insurance (P&amp;C) industry is likely to benefit from better pricing, prudent underwriting and exposure growth. Industry players like Berkshire Hathaway Inc., Chubb Ltd., The Progressive Corp., The Travelers Companies Inc. and Everest Re Group are poised to grow despite a rise in catastrophic activities. Given an active catastrophe environment, the policy renewal rate should accelerate. Also, the increasing adoption of technology and the emergence of insurtech will help in the smooth functioning of the industry players.Though the industry is witnessing a rate increase, the magnitude has decreased in the last seven quarters. Nonetheless, an improvement in surplus and accelerated economic activities set the stage for a better M&amp;A environment.About the IndustryThe Zacks Property and Casualty Insurance industry comprises companies that provide commercial and personal property insurance, and casualty insurance products and services. Such insurance helps to safeguard property in case of any natural or man-made disasters. Liability coverages are also provided by some industry players. The insurance coverage offered also includes automobiles, professional risk, marine, excess casualty, aviation, personal accident, commercial multi-peril, and professional indemnity and surety.Premiums are the primary source of revenues for these insurers. These companies invest a portion of premiums to meet their commitments to policyholders. The interest rate environment has started to improve. The Fed has already made seven hikes in 2022 with more to come in 2023. An improving rate environment is a boon for insurers, especially long-tail insurersStory continues4 Trends Shaping the Future of the Property and Casualty Insurance IndustryImproved pricing to help navigate claims: Catastrophes are a concern for insurers due to the high degree of losses incurred. They implement price hikes to ensure uninterrupted claims payment. Global commercial insurance prices rose for 20 straight quarters though the magnitude has slowed down over the last seven quarters, per Marsh Global Insurance Market Index.Better pricing will help insurers write higher premiums and address claims payment prudently. Per Deloitte Insights, trends like commercial lines witnessing growth at a faster pace than personal lines and homeowners' premiums improving better than personal auto are likely to continue in 2023. Per Deloitte Insights, gross premiums are estimated to increase sixfold to $722 billion by 2030. China and North America should account for more than two-thirds of the global market, per the report.Catastrophe loss induces volatility in underwriting profits: The property and casualty insurance industry is susceptible to catastrophe events, which drag down underwriting profit. Swiss Re estimated insured losses from natural catastrophes of $35 million for the first half of 2022, while Munich Re estimated losses of $65 billion, with slightly less than half insured.Per a report published in LAW360, AM Best estimated the net income of U.S. property and casualty insurers to decline 17% year over year to $31.4 billion in the first half of 2022. While the third quarter largely suffered the wrath of Hurricane Ian, the fourth quarter faced the wrath of winter storms that impacted much of the United States and Canada in late December.However, exposure growth, better pricing, prudent underwriting and favorable reserve development will help withstand the blow. Also, frequent occurrences of natural disasters should accelerate the policy renewal rate.Merger and acquisitions: Consolidation in the property and casualty industry is likely to continue as players look to diversify their operations into new business lines and geography. Buying businesses along the same lines will also continue as players look to gain market share and grow in their niche areas. With the reopening of the economy, optimistic growth outlook and sturdy capital level, the industry is witnessing a number of mergers, acquisitions and consolidations.Increased adoption of technology: The industry is witnessing increased use of technology like blockchain, artificial intelligence, advanced analytics, telematics, cloud computing and robotic process automation that expedite business operations and save cost. The industry has also witnessed the emergence of insurtech — technology-led insurers — creating competition for incumbent players.The focus of insurtech is mainly on the property and casualty insurance industry. Accelerated digitalization has become the need of the hour and insurers continue to invest heavily in technology to improve basis points, scale and efficiencies. As insurtechs use the latest technologies and concepts that the incumbents are just beginning to experiment with, there remains a huge market risk.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull ProspectsThe group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bleak prospects in the near term.

This move can be attributable to notable volume with a higher number of shares being traded than in a typical session. This compares to the stock's 17.5% gain over the past four weeks.Par Pacific stock extended its rally for the seventh straight day, driven by optimism over oil prices spurred by the potential demand boost from the easing of coronavirus restrictions in China. The recent strength in crude prices (at above $80 a barrel) and robust demand for energy has lifted the fuel refining space and contributed to the share price movement in Par Pacific. Besides, an improving macro environment prompted Piper Sandler analyst Ryan Todd to upgrade the rating on Par Pacific to Outperform from Neutral with a higher price target.This independent oil and gas company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.46 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +763.6%. Revenues are expected to be $1.9 billion, up 46.7% from the year-ago quarter.While earnings and revenue growth expectations are important in evaluating the potential strength in a stock, empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For Par Petroleum, the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 5.6% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. And a positive trend in earnings estimate revision usually translates into price appreciation.

408,2519f14f-5d84-3fbc-969a-131c16faec66,PG,2023-01-24,"These are some of the strategies Chipotle, Disney, and P&G are using to retain pricing power",Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/strategies-chipotle-disney-p-g-115548192.html,1674474948,STORY,"['DIS', 'PG', 'CMG']","[Good morning,“Companies have to think very carefully and very strategically about how they approach pricing strategy,” EY Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco tells me. “We're no longer in the 2021 or 2022 environment where demand was quite robust and companies were being rewarded for exercising pricing power because everybody was doing so.”Procter &amp; Gamble (P&amp;G), the maker of consumer goods like Tide, Pampers, and Charmin, has a strategy to offset higher material costs and supplier inflation by continuing price hikes and showing product innovation. Prices across categories increased by 10%, but sales volume decreased by 6% from the year prior, according to the latest earnings report for the period ending Dec. 31. More price increases will go into effect in February, Andre Schulten, CFO at P&amp;G, said on the Jan. 19 earnings call. The drop in sales volume was consumption-driven, and the other half was due to inventory reductions in China and Russia, Schulten said. P&amp;G net sales for the quarter ($20.77 billion) were down 1%, but surpassing analysts’ average projections of $20.73 billion. The higher pricing resulted in organic revenues increasing by 5%.Regarding product innovation, P&amp;G chairman, president, and CEO Jon Moeller pointed to Dawn Powerwash dish spray. The product creates suds inside the spray chamber, letting you apply those directly to the dishes. Compared to non-ultra Dawn, the company claims Powerwash is five times faster at cutting through grease. Powerwash hit the market in January 2020. It was at a premium price, Moeller said on the earnings call. “The brand has grown at 50% since that introduction, and Dawn has driven 90% of category growth in that situation,” he said. “We've got a lot of innovation coming.”Meanwhile, in 2022, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE: CMG) increased menu prices at least three times. That’s due to factors such as inflation in ingredient costs, wage inflation, and energy prices, CFO Jack Hartung told me late last year. ""When we look at our menu prices compared to competitors, we’re still a terrific value,” Hartung said. “Our food cost and our people cost are by far the largest items on the P&amp;L,"" he said. ""We don’t want to cut back on our food. We’ve never tried to reduce the quality of our fresh ingredients. We want to invest more in food and our people.”Story continuesChipotle's total revenue increased 13.7% to $2.2 billion in Q3 2022. In-restaurant sales rose 22.1% year-over-year. However, that’s less than the second quarter, when in-restaurant sales increased 35.9% compared to the year prior. During our talk, Hartung told me that in Q4, prices could increase 15% year over year until it drops down to 11% in the first quarter of 2023. Chipotle's Q4 earnings are scheduled to be released on Feb. 7. On Oct. 25 (when Q3 earnings were announced), CMG closed at $1,584.02. It closed at $1,555.19 on Jan. 20.Then there's Disney. Under returning CEO Robert Iger, The Walt Disney Company is trying to get back into the good graces of loyal customers by reversing some park-related fees from former CEO Bob Chapek's era. However, they're not exactly lowering ticket prices across the board.Disney’s parks chief, Josh D’Amaro, said in a blog post on Jan. 10 that customers of Disneyland resort in Anaheim will have greater access to the lowest priced tickets—""nearly two months worth of $104 park ticket dates."" After a price increase in October, a one-day Disneyland ticket now ranges from $104 to $179, based on the day. Other perks include, beginning on Feb. 4, customers can access photos taken at rides for free instead of paying for a photo pass.At Disney World Resort in Orlando, guests with annual passes are now able to enter the parks after 2 p.m. without first securing a reservation. (With the exception of weekends at the Magic Kingdom park.) Overnight self-parking will once again be complimentary to guests staying at Disney resort hotels. Guests buying the Disney Genie+ service will also get digital downloads of their attraction photos.“While this doesn’t address everyone’s feedback, these changes will increase flexibility and add value to our guests’ experience,” D’Amaro said in the blog post. Disney's latest earnings report is scheduled for Feb. 8.In order to create the most effective price strategy, “every company has to evaluate its market position, brand position, and client base,"" Daco says. “There's no one formula for every company,"" he says.*Quick note: I have a question for finance chiefs: What is the most important thing you did before landing your first CFO position?

413,54bfe083-37a5-340e-a01d-9b664b5dd6c5,DHI,2023-01-24,3 Key EPS Reports to Watch this Week,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-key-eps-reports-watch-162504926.html,1674491104,STORY,"['HAL', 'MSFT', 'DHI']","[Thus far, earnings season has been a pleasant surprise on Wall Street. Earnings reactions have been strong, and stocks like United Airlines UAL provided impressive guidance moving forward. However, later this week, Wall Street awaits some of the biggest names on the street to report first-quarter results. Today we will look at 3 key earnings reports to monitor this week:Microsoft Corp MSFT is the largest report of the week and will move the tech sector and the entire U.S. market when it reports Q1 EPS Tuesday night. Though the stock has corrected in line with the tech sector in general, Microsoft’s valuation is the most attractive it has been in years. The current P/E of 25.89x matches the P/E ratio the software juggernaut saw at the lows of the pandemic correction in early 2020.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAn attractive valuation is not the only potential catalyst the stock has moving forward. Earlier this morning, the company announced it will invest $10 billion in OpenAI in the next ten years. OpenAI is the creator behind the wildly popular ChatGPT Artificial Intelligence (AI) service. Over the weekend, plans to transition the service into a “freemium” were announced. Power users can pay $42 per month to avoid delays and reap other premium ChatGPT benefits.Sentiment in housing remains poor as mortgage rates have doubled in recent months and home prices have begun to cool. However, the recent action in homebuilders suggests that something else may be happening beneath the surface. Perhaps supply is drying up, or housing is not as weak as initially anticipated by investors. Either way, housing stocks are at the top of the list for contrarian-minded speculators. Texas-based D.R. Horton DHI is one of the leading homebuilders nationwide. Like MSFT, DHI is becoming attractive on a valuation basis. Its P/E of 5.71x is lower than its valuation at the COVID-19 lows. DHI is expected to report earnings Tuesday.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStory continuesHalliburton Co HAL and stocks of the same feather have been the undisputed market leaders over the past few years. Last quarter HAL reported stellar earnings growth of 114% on revenue of 39%. The stock holds a strong Zack’s Ranking of 2. While investors expect strong EPS, the critical factor to watch is how the stock reacts to those earnings. Is the strong earnings performance baked into shares already, or is there more gas in the tank? Earnings are due Tuesday for Halliburton. Industry group peer Chevron CVX also reports earnings later in the week on Friday.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

TOST builds software which helps restaurants manage online orders and dine-in order, operate an on-demand delivery network and integrate payments. There has been increasing optimism among analysts lately about the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher. And that could be a legitimate reason to expect an upside in the stock. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 5.6%, as one estimate has moved higher compared to no negative revision. Moreover, TOST currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on four factors related to earnings estimates.American Airlines Group Inc. AAL was formed following the December 2013 merger between AMR (American Airlines' parent group, which was founded in 1934) and U.S. Airways. Improved air-travel demand, particularly on the domestic front, is aiding American Airlines. Owing to upbeat air-travel demand, Operating revenues in third-quarter 2022 increased 50.1% year over year. Buoyant air-travel demand is also reflected by the total operating revenue increase of 13% from the third-quarter 2019 (pre-coronavirus) levels despite 9.6% lower capacity. Driven by soaring demand on healthy bookings, management expects total revenues in the fourth quarter of 2022 to be roughly 11-13% higher than the level recorded in fourth-quarter 2019. The carrier's debt-reduction efforts are impressive as well. AAL is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as a Value grade of A. American Airlines will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release, which is expected to be January 26, 2023.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

417,8d12b99c-a6b9-37b4-a7b0-a44eb2688b8a,AAL,2023-01-24,"Washington Reagan’s Traffic Is Booming, But Not With the Right Travelers",Skift,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/washington-reagan-traffic-booming-not-190343741.html,1674500623,STORY,['AAL'],"[Washington Reagan’s Traffic Is Booming, But Not With the Right TravelersTravelers enjoying a pie from Washington, D.C.’s local favorite, Timber Pizza, while waiting for a flight to, say, Syracuse at Washington Reagan National Airport will enjoy one of America’s newest airport facilities. Opened in 2021, the new E Gates sport floor-to-ceiling windows with comfortable wingback chairs where flyers can take in the view of the Capitol city’s monuments across the Potomac River.What they won’t see are unpopular and inefficient 50-seat regional jets waiting to fly them to their destinations. American Airlines, which uses the E Gates and maintains a hub at Washington National, replaced all of their flights on the small jets with larger models, like the Embraer E175, that sport multiple classes and are more popular with both passengers and airlines. That has meant more seats overall at the D.C.-area airport even as National’s bread-and-butter local business traffic has yet to return.“American [is] now able to better utilize a strategically located airport as a north-south hub for passenger flow,” said Paul Bobson, vice president of airline business development at operator Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority (MWAA), during a recent board meeting. He added that the traffic increase was one of the “long-term benefits of Project Journey.”Passenger numbers at Washington Reagan National Airport from January-November 2022 compared to 2019. (MWAA)Project Journey is the $1 billion expansion of Washington National that included the new concourse and security checkpoints in Terminal 2. Most of the work was completed in 2021, though some last pieces are still underway. The E Gates, specifically, were built to improve the customer experience and increase capacity by replacing the widely derided Gate 35X, which was compared by some to a bus station. The ground-level gate served as the gateway to 14 remote aircraft parking positions used by American for regional jet flights.But the opening of Project Journey in 2021 came as air travel was still recovering from the pandemic. Leisure travelers were back in force but the return of corporate flyers lagged well behind those on holiday trips. Add to that, the Federal Aviation Administration ended pandemic-era slot usage waivers for domestic flights at U.S. airports in late 2021, which forced American and other airlines to operate nearly their full schedules at National even where demand remained weak.Story continuesAmerican, flying larger planes and its full schedule despite lower demand, had to fill its planes at Washington National somehow. Enter connecting traffic.In the third quarter, American carried 108 percent more transfer passengers at National than it did in 2019, Bobson said. That represented a far greater increase than the number of additional seats that the airline was flying, which were up on average 11 seats per departure.Connecting passengers typically, though not always, pay lower fares than local ones. This makes the shift for American not necessarily a good one financially. However, as the carrier does not break out profitability or yields by hub or airport, it is difficult to determine the financial impact of the shift to more connecting passengers at National as its overall domestic profitability has improved.An American spokesperson declined to comment, citing the airline’s scheduled fourth-quarter earnings call on Thursday.Domestic passenger revenue per available seat mile, or PRASM, at American was up 20 percent year-over-three-years in the third quarter, the airline’s latest financial results show. Overall corporate revenues exceeded 2019 levels driven largely by more travel from small- and medium-sized businesses, while revenues from so-called managed business accounts — in other words, large corporations — were still down roughly 20 percent.Data from trade group Airlines for America (A4A) show that the volume of corporate tickets sold in the U.S. was down roughly 24 percent from 2019 levels during the week ending January 15.Higher passenger numbers at Washington National do benefit MWAA. The increase directly correlates to higher airport revenues, both in terms of fees and concessions. MWAA’s airline revenues at its two airports — Dulles and National — exceeded its budget forecast by 5 percent during the first 11 months of 2022, its latest financial report shows. This occurred even as passenger numbers at Dulles — the D.C. region’s main international gateway and a hub for United Airlines — still lagged 2019 levels by a good margin.MWAA can also claim a larger share of FAA funding to airports that is allocated based on passenger numbers. The busiest airports receive the largest amounts. The FAA’s competitive grant programs, including the $5 billion included in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, are separate from this.Travel patterns at Washington National, and American’s hub there, are likely in a transition moment. Travel patterns shifted during the pandemic with people traveling in new ways, for example the surge in blended travel that include aspects of both leisure and business trips. However, given National’s unique role as the main domestic gateway to the U.S. capital and slot limits that bar any growth in flight numbers, it is likely that business travelers will regain some of their historic share on flights to and from the airport. The question is really what transfer volumes look like once the recovery dust settles.This story is from Skift's Airline Weekly. For more aviation industry news visit airlineweekly.com.]"

With this in mind, we are always looking at value, growth, and momentum trends to discover great companies.Of these, perhaps no stock market trend is more popular than value investing, which is a strategy that has proven to be successful in all sorts of market environments. Value investors use fundamental analysis and traditional valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are being undervalued by the market at large.In addition to the Zacks Rank, investors looking for stocks with specific traits can utilize our Style Scores system. Of course, value investors will be most interested in the system's ""Value"" category. Stocks with ""A"" grades for Value and high Zacks Ranks are among the best value stocks available at any given moment.One stock to keep an eye on is American Airlines (AAL). AAL is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as a Value grade of A. The stock is trading with P/E ratio of 8.82 right now. For comparison, its industry sports an average P/E of 12.59. Over the past year, AAL's Forward P/E has been as high as 9,493.45 and as low as -3,032.07, with a median of 11.71.Value investors also frequently use the P/S ratio. This metric is found by dividing a stock's price with the company's revenue. This is a popular metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement, so they are often considered a better performance indicator. AAL has a P/S ratio of 0.23. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 0.52.Finally, investors will want to recognize that AAL has a P/CF ratio of 16.01. This metric focuses on a firm's operating cash flow and is often used to find stocks that are undervalued based on the strength of their cash outlook. AAL's P/CF compares to its industry's average P/CF of 24.30. Over the past year, AAL's P/CF has been as high as 35.74 and as low as -305.42, with a median of 14.26.Story continuesAnother great Transportation - Airline stock you could consider is United Airlines (UAL), which is a # 2 (Buy) stock with a Value Score of A.Furthermore, United Airlines holds a P/B ratio of 3.23 and its industry's price-to-book ratio is 4.81. UAL's P/B has been as high as 4.68, as low as 2.01, with a median of 3 over the past 12 months.These are only a few of the key metrics included in American Airlines and United Airlines strong Value grade, but they help show that the stocks are likely undervalued right now.

PFG is slated to report fourth-quarter 2022 earnings on Jan 30, after market close. PFG delivered an earnings surprise in each of the last four quarters, the average being 14.18%.Factors at PlayPrincipal Financial fourth-quarter results are likely to reflect growth in the Specialty Benefits insurance business, higher sales of single premium group annuities with life contingencies and lower expenses.Premiums in the Retirement and Income Solutions segment are likely to have increased because of higher sales of single premium group annuities with life contingencies.Investment income is likely to have been affected by impacts of the Reinsurance Transaction in 2022 and lower market performance on alternative assets. The downside is likely to have been partially offset by higher inflation-based investment returns on Latin America average invested assets and cash. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for net investment income is pegged at $949 million, suggesting a decline of 23.4% from the year-ago reported figure. We expect net investment income to be $950 million.Growth in the Specialty Benefits insurance business and increase in Individual Life insurance premiums related to the retrocession of ceded premiums as a result of the Reinsurance Transaction are likely to have benefited revenue growth in the to-be-reported quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter 2022 revenues is pegged at $3.3 billion, indicating a decline of 20.8% from the year-ago quarter reported figure. We expect total revenues to be $3.2 billion.Assets under management is likely to have benefited from favorable market performance, higher net customer cash flow and positive market returns.Expenses are likely to have decreased due to lower benefits, claims and settlement expenses and dividends to policyholders. We expect total expenses to be $2.9 billion.Operating expenses are likely to have decreased due to favorable impact associated with actuarial assumption updates and model refinements in 2022 as well as decrease in amounts credited to employee accounts in a nonqualified defined contribution pension plan. We expect operating expenses to be $1.1 billion.Continued share buybacks are likely to have provided additional upside to the bottom line.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter 2022 earnings stands at $1.52 per share, indicating a decline of 17.8% from the year-ago reported figure.Story continuesWhat Our Quantitative Model PredictsOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for Principal Financial this time around.

421,6068817b-fd17-380f-9b93-9a35f370a917,PFG,2023-01-24,Principal Financial (PFG) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: What to Know Ahead of Q4 Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/principal-financial-pfg-expected-beat-150003939.html,1674486003,STORY,"['PFG', 'TROW']","[Principal Financial (PFG) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 30, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis financial services company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.52 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -17.8%.Revenues are expected to be $3.26 billion, down 20.8% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.06% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Principal Financial?For Principal Financial, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.33%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Principal Financial will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Principal Financial would post earnings of $1.45 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.69, delivering a surprise of +16.55%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success.

Amid this environment, Federal Realty FRT is well-poised to benefit from its portfolio of premium assets in the United States.This retail real estate investment trust’s (REIT) properties are located in the first-ring suburbs of the nine major metropolitan markets of the United States, mainly in the key coastal markets from Washington DC to Boston, San Francisco and Los Angeles. The markets have high barriers to entry and strong demographics, and the infill nature of its properties allows FRT to enjoy high occupancy.The company has a well-diversified tenant base of retailers, including TJX Companies, Kroger and CVS Corporation. This minimizes the risks related to any particular retail industry and assures a stable source of rental revenues.Federal Realty’s efforts to explore the mixed-use development option, which has gained immense popularity in recent years, will enable it to tap growth opportunities in areas where people prefer to live, work and play. Moreover, FRT’s expansion efforts into premium markets and initiatives to redevelop and reposition its assets seem encouraging.On the balance sheet front, at closing in October 2022, Federal Realty had $1.4 billion of total liquidity in cash, including complete availability on its $1.25 billion facility. Further, its investment-grade credit ratings render the company favorable access to the debt market. With a strong balance sheet, FRT is well-positioned to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities.Analysts seem bullish about this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2022 funds from operations (FFO) per share has moved marginally upward over the past month to $6.30, indicating a favorable outlook for FRT.Shares of Federal Realty have risen 5.2% over the past month, outperforming its industry’s growth of 5.1%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHowever, given the conveniences of online shopping, rising e-commerce adoption is concerning for Federal Realty. Online retailing will remain a popular choice among customers, adversely impacting the market share for brick-and-mortar stores.A slowdown in the economy, an inflationary environment and interest rate hikes could limit consumers’ willingness to spend to some extent in the coming quarters. Also, rising interest rates might increase the company's borrowing costs, affecting its ability to purchase or develop real estate.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the retail REIT sector are National Retail Properties NNN and Tanger Factory Outlet Centers SKT, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present.

It posted an earnings surprise of 8.9% in the last reported quarter.Higher segment net sales resulting from strong demand and good cost control initiatives taken by the company are expected to have supported SHW’s fourth-quarter performance. However, elevated input and labor costs and weak demand in Europe and China are likely to have posed a headwind for the company.

The same for SHW’s Americas Group is $3,145 million, which suggests an increase of 18.5% from the year-ago reported number.Some Factors to WatchSherwin-Williams is expected to have benefited from higher net sales across its segments in the fourth quarter due to solid demand built-up. The company’s Americas Group is expected to have witnessed solid demand across its pro-architectural markets, including the new residential market. The company’s Performance Coatings Group is expected to have witnessed strong demand in North America, the company’s largest market.

The company is expected to have realized the benefits of cost savings as part of the cost initiative taken in the Performance Coatings Group and Consumer Brands Group.Story continuesIn addition, higher year-over-year raw material costs are expected to have unfavorably impacted the company’s fourth-quarter performance.

Wall Street clearly dives into all of the other metrics and management's input, but the EPS figure helps cut through all the noise.We know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report. The idea is relatively intuitive as a newer projection might be based on more complete information. The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure.The final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. Dominion Energy (D) earns a Zacks Rank #3 16 days from its next quarterly earnings release on February 8, 2023, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $1.07 a share.D has an Earnings ESP figure of 1.22%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $1.07 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.05.D is part of a big group of Utilities stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at American Water Works (AWK) as well.American Water Works is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on February 15, 2023. AWK's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $0.76 a share 23 days from its next earnings release.For American Water Works, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.76 is 0.66%.Because both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, D and AWK could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Story continuesFind Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earning beat.Earnings ESP: Earnings ESP for Nucor is +3.29%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter is currently pegged at $4.18. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Nucor currently carries a Zacks Rank #1.What do the Estimates Say?Nucor, last month, issued its earnings guidance for the fourth quarter. It anticipates fourth-quarter earnings to be between $4.25 and $4.35 per share.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter consolidated revenues for Nucor is currently pegged at $7,910.3 million, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 23.7%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter average sales price per ton for the company’s steel mills unit stands at $1,077, suggesting a 27.1% year-over-year decline and a 16.9% sequential decrease. The same for total steel mill shipments is pegged at 4,677,000 tons, reflecting a roughly 20.3% sequential decline.A Few Factors to WatchThe company’s fourth-quarter results are likely to reflect weaker steel prices. Profitability in its steel mills and steel products segments are expected to have been dented by lower selling prices and seasonally lower shipment volumes.Nucor, in December, said that it expects earnings to decline significantly in the steel mills segment on a sequential comparison basis in the fourth quarter. The expected decline is due to lower average selling prices, margin contraction and lower shipment volumes.The biggest decline in profitability has been forecast at its sheet mills. The company expects shipments for its bar mills to be lower in the fourth quarter due to seasonal factors with customers lowering inventories as year-end approaches.Nucor also expects earnings for its steel products segment to decline modestly on a sequential comparison basis on reduced selling prices and volumes. Earnings for the raw materials unit are forecast to decline significantly in the fourth quarter compared with the third quarter due to lower profitability of the company’s DRI facilities and reduced selling prices for raw materials. Planned outages impacted the DRI facilities during the fourth quarter.U.S. steel prices tumbled after surging to roughly $1,500 per short ton in April 2022 due to supply concerns stemming from the Russia-Ukraine war. The benchmark hot-rolled coil (""HRC"") prices cratered to near the $600 per short ton level in November 2022. The downward drift partly reflects weaker demand. Fears of a recession have also impacted prices.Lower selling prices are likely to have weighed on Nucor’s steel mills segment in the to-be-reported quarter.Story continuesNucor Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Nucor Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseNucor Corporation price-eps-surprise | Nucor Corporation QuoteStocks That Warrant a LookHere are some companies in the basic materials space you may want to consider, as our model shows these too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Agnico Eagle Mines Limited AEM, scheduled to release earnings on Feb 16, has an Earnings ESP of +0.84% and sports a Zacks Rank #1.

429,bbd51d0c-0b08-38f9-ac04-0d7dfdc7e6db,FCX,2023-01-24,3 Basic Materials Stocks to Buy Before Earnings This Week,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-basic-materials-stocks-buy-155703371.html,1674489423,STORY,"['STLD', 'NUE', 'FCX']","[Many stocks in the Basic Materials sector outperformed the broader market over the last year and provided a much-needed hedge against inflation.Let’s take a look at three highly ranked Basic Material stocks set to report earnings this week that investors may want to consider buying in 2023 as well.Freeport McMoRan FCX Starting the list is mineral exploration and development miner Freeport McMoRan (FCX).Freeport is set to report fourth-quarter earnings on January 25, with its stock currently sporting a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Freeport McMoRan conducts its operations primarily through its principal subsidiaries’ PT Freeport Indonesia, Freeport-McMoRan Corporation, and Atlantic Copper. It is important to note that PT Freeport Indonesia’s principal asset Papua, is an Indonesia-based mine that contains the world’s largest copper and gold reserves.Londond Metal ExchangeImage Source: Londond Metal ExchangeWith copper prices hitting their highest levels in the last six months on the London Metal Exchange as shown in the above chart, Freeport McMoRan stock is sticking out with earnings estimate revisions trending higher for fiscal 2023 as the company rounds out FY22 with its Q4 report.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchQ4 Preview:  The rise in copper prices, primarily attributed to the reopening of China, which is the world’s largest copper consumer, is great timing as Freeport McMoRan earnings are expected to have dipped year over year during Q4 after a tough prior-year quarter to follow.Fourth-quarter earnings are expected to dip -58% to $0.40 a share compared to $0.96 a share in Q4 2021. On the top line, sales are projected at $5.34 billion, a -13% decrease from the prior year quarter. Still, an earnings beat on the company’s bottom line is not completely out of the picture.Earnings ESP:  The Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction is a useful tool in indicating which stocks could top quarterly earnings estimates by comparing the Zacks Consensus to the Most Accurate Consensus.Story continuesWith the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Freeport McMoRan’s Q4 earnings at $0.40 a share and the Most Accurate Estimate at $0.42 per share, FCX is expected to beat expectations by 6.96%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTakeaway:  Certainly, a strong earnings beat on Freeport McMoRan’s bottom line could lead to more upside in the stock. This could be supported by the company potentially offering better-than-expected guidance in correlation with higher copper prices.Nucor Corporation NUESteel Producer and metal recycler Nucor Corporation (NUE) is another stock investors may want to consider buying ahead of its Q4 earnings on January 26. Nucor stock sports a Zack Rank #1 (Strong Buy) with earnings estimate revisions notably rising for fiscal 2023.Even better, Nucor stock has been one of the top performers out of the basic materials sector over the last year to largely outperform the S&amp;P 500 and is already up 15% to start 2023.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchQ4 Preview:  Following an excellent prior-year quarter, earnings are forecasted at $4.18 per share for Nucor’s fourth quarter compared to $7.97 a share in Q4 2021. Sales for Q4 are expected at $7.91 billion which would be a -23% YoY decline.However, with iron and steel prices remaining higher despite cooling off recently, it is quite possible that Nucor will beat earnings expectations for a fifth consecutive quarter.U.S. Bureau of Labor StatisticsImage Source: U.S. Bureau of Labor StatisticsEarnings ESP:  Nucor stock has an ESP of 3.29% as the Zacks Consensus for Q4 earnings is $4.18 a share and the Most Accurate Estimate is $4.32 per share indicating the company could beat on its bottom line.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTakeaway: Despite the year-over-year quarterly drop in earnings, Nucor stock trades at just 11.8X forward earnings which is well below its decade high of 41.4X and a 23% discount to the median of 15.3X.Nucor’s valuation appears to already support the likelihood that the company’s earnings could decrease as steel prices move lower which still makes the stock attractive at its current levels with earnings estimates going up.Steel Dynamics STLD Rounding out the list is Steel Dynamics (STLD) which is set to report its Q4 earnings on January 25. Also sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Steel Dynamics FY23 earnings estimates have gone up 36% over the last 60 days to $10.82 per share compared to estimates of $7.94 a share two months ago.Steel Dynamics is also a leading steel producer and recycler of metal in the United States and one of the most diversified steel companies in the U.S. with a vast range of specialty products.The performance of Steel Dynamics stock has been incredible over the last year, up +106%, standing out among stocks across any sector. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchQ4 Preview:  Like Nucor, Steel Dynamics follows a stellar prior year fourth quarter. Steel Dynamics Q4 earnings are anticipated at $3.60 per share compared to $5.98 a share in Q4 2021. Sales for Q4 are expected to be $4.73 billion and down -11% YoY.Still, it is quite plausible that Nucor will beat earnings expectations for what would be a 13th consecutive quarter dating back to January of 2020.Earnings ESP: The Zacks ESP for Steel Dynamics indicates the company could once again beat on its bottom line. With the Zacks Consensus for Nucor’s Q4 earnings at $3.60 a share the most accurate estimate of $3.77 per share indicates the possibility of a 4.82% earnings beat.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTakeaway: The top and bottom line growth for Steel Dynamics has been massive over the last few years as steel prices soared, and it is noteworthy that the company has also beaten sales expectations for 12 consecutive quarters.Steel Dynamics also trades attractively relative to its past at just 9.9X forward earnings which is nicely below its decade high of 24.2X and the median of 12.2X.With its valuation also supporting the potential drop in steel prices, Steel Dynamics stock could have more upside especially if the company continues its stellar track record of topping quarterly expectations.Bottom Line After the very impressive top and bottom line growth these basic material stocks had in recent years, investors will definitely want to pay attention to their Q4 earnings. The rising earnings estimate revisions make the possibility of beating Q4 expectations quite plausible for Freeport McMoRan, Nucor, and Steel Dynamic stock and could continue supporting their strong performances.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

FCX is set to release fourth-quarter 2022 results before the opening bell on Jan 25.The mining giant’s earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters, while beat once. It has a trailing four-quarter negative earnings surprise of roughly 6.7%, on average.Freeport’s fourth-quarter results are likely to have been impacted by higher year over year unit net cash costs and lower copper prices. However, the company is likely to have gained from higher mining rates.The stock has gained 13.7% in the past year compared with the industry’s 32.1% rise. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Zacks ModelOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for Freeport this time around.

You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Freeport currently carries a Zacks Rank #2.What do the Estimates Indicate?For the fourth quarter of 2022, Freeport expects sales volumes to be 1 billion pounds of copper, 420,000 ounces of gold and 20 million pounds of molybdenum.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Freeport’s fourth-quarter consolidated revenues is currently pegged at $5,365.4 million, which suggests a year-over-year decline of 13%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter consolidated net cash costs per pound of copper is currently pegged at $1.65, which calls for roughly 27.9% increase on a year-over-year basis and a 5.7% sequential decline.The consensus mark for consolidated copper sales for the fourth quarter is pegged at 1,020 million pounds, flat year over year and down around 3.8% sequentially. The same for average realized price for copper is pinned at $3.57 per pound, indicating a 19.2% year-over-year decline and a 2% sequential rise.Story continuesA Few Factors to WatchFreeport’s fourth-quarter results are expected to reflect the impacts of weaker year over year copper prices. Copper prices lost the momentum since the second quarter of 2022. The uncertainties surrounding the global economy and new coronavirus restrictions in China dwindled demand for the red metal, hurting prices. Copper prices headed south from late April 2022 after hitting an all-time high in March driven by concerns over supply-chain disruptions, exacerbated by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, a spike in energy costs and low global inventories.Nevertheless, copper prices have rebounded since October on the back of tight supply and expectations of a demand recovery partly driven by China government's announcement of new measures to ease pandemic restrictions in late 2022.  Notwithstanding the recovery in copper prices in the December quarter, the impacts of lower year over year average realized copper prices are likely to reflect on Freeport’s fourth-quarter revenues and margins. The company is also likely to have witnessed higher year over year unit net cash costs in the quarter partly due to higher energy prices.However, strong performance at PT Freeport Indonesia and efforts to increase operating rates at Cerro Verde and El Abra mines are likely to have aided the company’s copper volumes in the quarter to be reported. The company is expected to have benefited from higher mining rates in South America. FreeportMcMoRan Inc. Price and EPS Surprise FreeportMcMoRan Inc.

It houses airlines, railroads, shipping and trucking companies, to name a few.Only a handful of transportation companies (three S&amp;P 500 members, to be exact) have reported their fourth-quarter 2022 numbers so far.The gradual uptick in the economic scenario implies that trading volumes are consistently rising. This bodes well for the entire sector. The latest Earnings Preview indicates that the total earnings of transportation companies belonging to the S&amp;P 500 universe are likely to increase 36.8% in fourth-quarter 2022 from the third-quarter reported levels, mainly on ramped-up economic activities.However, headwinds like supply-chain woes, inflationary pressure and high fuel costs are likely to have hurt the fourth-quarter performance of transportation companies.Fuel expenses represent a key input cost for any transportation player. High oil price is augmenting fuel costs. Even though oil price declined from their multi-year highs, they remain high. Oil price was up 6.7% in the October-December period.Given this backdrop, investors interested in the Zacks Transportation sector keenly await the results of Union Pacific Corporation UNP, GATX Corporation GATX and Canadian National Railway CNI, scheduled to be released on Jan 24.Our quantitative model predicts an earnings beat for a company if it has a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). This combination increases the chances of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Let’s delve deeper.Union Pacific’s results are likely to be boosted by impressive freight revenues as economic activities gain pace. Overall volumes are likely to have improved owing to the easing of labor woes. However, economic uncertainty and high operating expenses, mainly due to elevated fuel costs, are likely to have impacted the fourth-quarter performance. High operating expenses are likely to have led to a deterioration in the operating ratio (operating expenses as a percentage of revenues).Story continuesOur proven model does not predict an earnings beat for Union Pacific this season as UNP has an Earnings ESP of -0.20% and a Zacks Rank #3 at present. Notably, our model had not predicted a positive surprise for UNP earlier as well, when its fourth-quarter earnings preview article was issued.

As a result, lease revenues are likely to have improved year over year.However, the inflation-induced economic woes and high operating costs, mainly due to elevated fuel costs are likely to have affected the fourth-quarter performance.

Owing to favorable revenues, operating ratio is likely to have improved on a year-over-year basis in the December quarter. On the flip side, the bottom-line growth is likely to have been restricted due to elevated operating expenses, driven by high fuel price.Our proven model predicts an earnings beat for Canadian National this season as CNI has an Earnings ESP of +0.61% and a Zacks Rank #3 at present.

Aimed to empower Americans to take ownership of their health in the new year, the survey highlights how the U.S. adult population prioritizes their health, where they go for medical advice, and how proactive they are with staying on top of their overall well-being. With an influx of conflicting health and wellness information, where opinion is often presented as fact, lab work offers an individualized look at your wellness and is the first step to a healthier you.Quest Diagnostics Incorporated logo. (PRNewsFoto/Quest Diagnostics Incorporated)The Information We Know (or Don't)From pop culture to our finances, Americans are fixated on being on top of this information all day, every day. But could this abundance of information keep us from prioritizing our health? Quest commissioned a survey conducted online by The Harris Poll among over 2,000 U.S. adults, which reveals that more Americans know their horoscope sign (66%) and credit score (58%) than their blood type (51%) or cholesterol level (20%). This becomes even more apparent when broken down by generation, with less than half (47%) of Millennials (ages 26-41) and only one-third (32%) of Gen Z (ages 18-25) reporting being aware of their blood type.""For example, having high cholesterol levels may not have any symptoms, but it increases your risk for heart disease and stroke,"" said Nick Bellos, MD, National Medical Director Extended Care Services, Quest Diagnostics. ""Knowing where you stand through diagnostic testing, whether it be your cholesterol level or other markers, will help you manage your health today to hopefully stave off disease and costly treatments in the future.""Sources of InformationWhen seeking out health information, Americans are inundated with noise which can lead to challenges in knowing what advice or data is helpful or accurate. While the majority of Americans (63%) get health advice from healthcare professionals (HCPs), roughly 2 in 5 of Gen Z (44%) get health advice from an HCP, while more than half (52%) utilize Internet searches. Nearly 1 in 4 Americans (22%) get health advice from social media influencers, highest among Gen Z (40%) and Millennials (39%) vs. just 18% of Gen X (ages 42-57) and 3% of Boomers (ages 58-76).Story continues""Unfortunately, there's no one-size-fits-all diet or wellness routine, as everyone's body is different,"" said Dr. Bellos. ""The single best way to assess what's truly going on inside your body is through a simple, laboratory test that offers the essential knowledge and actionable diagnostic insights.""Self-Testing / Self CareAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, consumers have become more open to re-imagining their healthcare. For instance, while over half of Americans (57%) say they have procrastinated scheduling a routine check-up, the majority of Americans (69%) are comfortable with telehealth visits. Americans are getting comfortable with lab testing without first visiting a doctor. The prevalence of COVID-19 brought self-initiated testing to the forefront, with 4 in 5 (81%) claiming they're comfortable using at-home covid tests. As awareness grows, Americans may become more aware of the possibility of purchasing other lab tests (thyroid, cholesterol, food allergies, etc.) without a prior in-person doctor's visit – currently, just over one-third (37%) know it's possible.""Now more than ever, consumers are interested in convenient and individualized healthcare that puts the power back in their hands. Being proactive in seeking out personal diagnostics offers consumers the capacity to help them avoid potential health complications in the future and live a healthier life,"" said Dr. Bellos.Quest's consumer-initiated test service is designed to empower people with the information and data they need about their health, with access to the same quality tests used by doctors and hospitals. With over 55 tests available, including a food allergy panel, complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and many more, consumers can conveniently shop online and choose their own lab tests, schedule appointments for tests, and access results securely from a phone or computer.

440,4fb35ed6-b04a-3473-ac39-105491974115,AMP,2023-01-24,3 Asset Management Stocks Set to Pull Off Earnings Beat in Q4,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-asset-management-stocks-set-131801958.html,1674479881,STORY,"['AMP', 'IVZ', 'BLK', 'APAM']","[One of the largest and well-known asset management stocks – BlackRock Inc. BLK – kicked off fourth-quarter earnings on Jan 13. Amid a challenging operating environment, BLK handily surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Lower total expenses more than offset decline in revenues and assets under management (AUM) balance. Further, due to the expected economic slowdown, BlackRock announced layoffs.The fourth quarter of 2022 was among the toughest operating periods for asset managers globally. So, it won’t be easy for the industry players to overcome challenges and beat the estimates. But we are using our proprietary methodology to find stocks that are poised to surpass the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the fourth quarter. By using the Zacks Stock Screener, we have identified three such asset management stocks -- Artisan Partners Asset Management Inc. APAM, Ameriprise Financial, Inc. AMP and Invesco Ltd. IVZ.  These stocks have the ideal combination of the two key ingredients — positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to surpass expectations. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Our proprietary methodology, Earnings ESP, shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. And research shows that for stocks with this combination of rank and ESP, chances of a positive earnings surprise are as high as 70%.Before we go into the details regarding above-mentioned asset managers, let’s first understand the factors that are likely to have influenced quarterly performance.The performance of the equity markets during the fourth quarter was extremely volatile. Though the S&amp;P 500 Index gained 7% in the quarter, it was marked by huge volatility as the investors continued to be cautious about the recession risk. Thus, market value of assets witnessed a decline, hurting the performance fees.Further, as the U.S. dollar gained strength, FX unfavorably impacted the asset managers performance. All these headwinds hurt the asset price and also resulted in net outflows.On the cost front, as the asset managers continued to optimize operations by digital initiatives, expenses are likely to have been manageable. But fears of recession are likely to have driven cost cutting among many industry players, which might have led to one-time restructuring expenses.Story continuesQ4 Earnings ExpectationsThe Zacks Finance sector’s (of which investment management is part) earnings are projected to decline 9.2% year over year in the fourth quarter. This compares with 10.8% fall recorded in third-quarter 2022.(For a detailed look at the earnings growth projections for this sector and others, please read our Earnings Preview.)3 Potential Safe BetsArtisan Partners, based in Milwaukee, WI, is focused on providing high-value added, active investment strategies to clients globally. APAM’s investment teams manage a broad range of U.S., non-U.S. and global investment strategies that are diversified by asset class, market cap and investment style.Similar to other industry players, APAM is facing a tough operating environment, which is likely to have hampered net inflows and AUM growth in the fourth quarter. Further, weak equity market performance and huge volatility are headwinds. Thus, these are expected to have hurt the company’s revenues in the to-be-reported quarter.Artisan Partners is scheduled to announce results on Jan 31, after market close. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its fourth-quarter earnings of 62 cents per share implies a plunge of 51.9% from the year-ago reported figure. APAM has an Earnings ESP of +2.44% and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Artisan Partners Asset Management Inc.

QuoteHeadquartered in Minneapolis, MN, Ameriprise, owns, manages and administers assets worth almost $1 trillion. Apart from providing asset management services, the company offers certain insurance services.AMP’s operations are majorly dependent on the performance of the equity markets and client activities. Hence, increased market volatility due to several geopolitical and macroeconomic concerns, is likely to have marred the company’s quarterly performance in the to-be-reported quarter. Ameriprise is scheduled to announce fourth-quarter and full-year 2022 numbers on Jan 25, after the closing bell.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings of $6.35 indicates a rise of 3.3% from the year-ago reported figure.

The industry-wide headwinds of poor equity market performance and fears of recession are the main reasons for this.Invesco is slated to announce results on Jan 24, before market opens. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at 36 cents, implying a plunge of 58.1% year over year.

The sixth annual global survey investigates professionals' perspectives on data privacy strategies. This year's study finds that despite a difficult economic environment, organizations continue to invest in privacy, with spending up significantly from $1.2 million just three years ago to $2.7 million this year. Yet, 92 percent of respondents believe their organization needs to do more to reassure customers about their data. The survey also finds that organizations' privacy priorities differ from those expressed by consumers.Disconnect between consumers' expectations and organizations' privacy strategies The study finds a significant disconnect between data privacy measures by companies and what consumers expect from organizations, especially when it relates to how organizations apply and use Artificial Intelligence (AI).The Cisco 2022 Consumer Privacy Survey showed 60 percent of consumers are concerned about how organizations apply and use AI today, and 65 percent already have lost trust in organizations over their AI practices. Consumers also said the top approach for making them more comfortable would be to provide opportunities for them to opt out of AI-based solutions. Yet, the privacy benchmark shows providing opt-out opportunities was selected least (22 percent) among the options organizations would put in place to reassure consumers.Story continues""When it comes to earning and building trust, compliance is not enough,"" said Harvey Jang, Cisco Vice President and Chief Privacy Officer. Transparency was the top priority for consumers (39 percent) to trust companies, whilst organizations surveyed felt compliance was the number one priority for building customer trust (30 percent).Even though 96 percent of organizations believe they have processes in place to meet the responsible and ethical standards that customers expect for AI-based solutions and services, 92 percent of respondents believe their organization needs to do more to reassure customers about their data.2023 Cisco Data Privacy Benchmark StudyPrivacy's return on investmentDespite a difficult economic environment, organizations continue to invest in privacy, with spending up from $1.2 million three years ago to $2.7 million this year. Over 70 percent of organizations surveyed indicated they were getting ""significant"" or ""very significant"" benefits from privacy investments, such as building trust with customers, reducing sales delays, or mitigating losses from data breaches. On average, organizations are getting benefits estimated to be 1.8 times spending, and 94 percent of all respondents indicated they believe the benefits of privacy outweigh the costs overall.With privacy as a critical business priority, more organizations recognize that everyone across their organization plays a vital role in protecting data. This year, 95 percent of respondents said that ""all of their employees"" need to know how to protect data privacy. ""An organization's approach to privacy impacts more than compliance,"" said Dev Stahlkopf, Cisco Executive Vice President and Chief Legal Officer. ""Investment in privacy drives business value across sales, security, operations, and most importantly, trust.""Costs of data localization and greater trust in global providersPrivacy legislation plays an important role in enabling governments to hold organizations accountable for how they manage personal data, and 157 countries (up from 145 last year) now have privacy laws in place. Even though complying with these laws involves significant effort and cost, 79 percent of all corporate respondents said privacy laws have had a positive impact.Although 88 percent of respondents believe their data would be safer if stored only within their country or region, research indicates this does not hold up once costs, security and other trade-offs are considered. Remarkably, 90 percent also said that a global provider, operating at scale, can better protect the data compared to local providers.
