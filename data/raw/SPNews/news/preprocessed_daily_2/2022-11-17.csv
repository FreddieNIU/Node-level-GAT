The revenue climbed 7.7% year-over-year to $5.31 billion but missed market forecasts by $30 million. Deutsche Bank analyst Emmanuel Rosner on November 2 maintained a Hold rating on The Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Company (NASDAQ:GT) but lowered the price target on the shares to $10 from $14.

(NYSE:JWN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 31Fisher Asset Management’s Stake Value: $28,921,000Nordstrom, Inc. (NYSE:JWN) is a Washington-based fashion retailer that manufactures and markets apparel, footwear, beauty products, accessories, and home goods through Nordstrom branded stores and online channels. In Q3 2022, Ken Fisher purchased 1.7 million shares of Nordstrom, Inc. (NYSE:JWN) worth about $29 million. In mid-October, Nordstrom, Inc. (NYSE:JWN) reiterated its previously forecast FY22 adjusted EPS of $2.30 to $2.60 and revenue growth of 5% to 7%. Market consensus for EPS stood at $2.34 and $15.58 billion for sales.On November 14, Deutsche Bank analyst Gabriella Carbone reaffirmed a Hold rating on Nordstrom, Inc. (NYSE:JWN) but trimmed the price target on the shares to $22 from $23 ahead of the Q3 results. The analyst believes investor sentiment will remain largely negative on the apparel retail sector until there is improved visibility around inventory and consumer demand heading into fiscal 2023.Among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, Nordstrom, Inc. (NYSE:JWN) was part of 31 public stock portfolios at the end of Q2 2022, compared to 29 in the prior quarter.

(NYSE:JWN) in its second quarter 2022 investor letter:“The second thought experiment comes from my own personal experience in the period around the financial crisis. In 2006 I made an investment in the shares of Nordstrom, Inc. (NYSE:JWN). Over the following three-and-a-half years, the stock was up by 36%, outperforming the S&amp;P 500 by a very respectable 41.4%. A fund made up of a single holding in Nordstrom would have ranked in the top 1% of all funds in the Morningstar database.However, Nordstrom stock declined by a very painful 80% during 2008. A single-stock fund would have almost certainly liquidated during that drawdown, taking investors out of the game and ending any hope of them ever realizing the return. But because my portfolio was diversified, it held its value a bit better (it declined by 25% while the market was down by 38%), allowing me to sell some holdings and redeploy money into investments like Nordstrom that had declined severely.”8. KB Financial Group Inc. (NYSE:KB)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 6Fisher Asset Management’s Stake Value: $30,393,000KB Financial Group Inc. (NYSE:KB) is headquartered in Seoul, and the company provides banking and financial services to consumers and enterprises in South Korea and internationally.

Peter Rathjens, Bruce Clarke, and John Campbell’s Arrowstreet Capital is the biggest position holder in the company, with 774,872 shares valued at $28.8 million.7. Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 35Fisher Asset Management’s Stake Value: $34,995,000Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH) is headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio, and the company manufactures and sells motion and control technologies and systems for various mobile, industrial, and aerospace markets worldwide.

The analyst expects less earnings volatility compared to past cycles, but said it will likely take some time for Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH) to prove this to investors. Further weakening in manufacturing data may result in a more attractive entry point for the stock, the analyst told investors in a research note.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 35 hedge funds were bullish on Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH) at the end of Q2 2022, compared to 39 funds in the prior quarter. Andreas Halvorsen’s Viking Global is the leading position holder in the company, with more than 3 million shares worth $755.5 million. Here is what Oakmark Fund specifically said about Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH) in its second quarter 2022 investor letter:“Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH), a U.S. company that specializes in motion and control technologies, is suffering from what we believe are investor misunderstandings and misjudgments, despite the efforts of the company’s unusually strong management team. In our opinion, since his promotion in 2015, CEO Thomas Williams has vastly improved operations and shifted the product portfolio to longer cycled, higher growth, higher margin and higher return end markets. The results are impressive. Margins, returns and earnings have increased substantially. With the expected closing of the Meggitt acquisition in the September quarter, the highly depressed aerospace segment will be its largest end market. We anticipate a rebound in aerospace revenue, which—combined with the company’s strong position in attractive businesses, including clean technologies and factory automation—should accelerate revenue growth. Parker Hannifin trades at a discount to other high-quality industrials, which we believe is unwarranted since its growth and returns should be similar or better. At a low-teens multiple of next year’s normalized cash earnings, Parker Hannifin is an attractive investment, in our view.”6. The Gap, Inc. (NYSE:GPS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 27Fisher Asset Management’s Stake Value: $40,212,000The Gap, Inc. (NYSE:GPS) is a California-based apparel retail company that sells its products under the Old Navy, Gap, Banana Republic, and Athleta brands. Ken Fisher added The Gap, Inc.

The dividend is payable on January 25, 2023 to shareholders of the company as of January 4. The Gap, Inc. (NYSE:GPS)’s dividend yield on November 15 came in at 4.67%. Citi analyst Paul Lejuez on November 11 raised the price target on The Gap, Inc. (NYSE:GPS) to $8 from $7 and kept a Sell rating on the shares. The analyst expects the company's Q3 results to miss the consensus comp estimate of 3% and deliver a softer than expected gross margin.Among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 27 funds reported owning stakes worth $234.3 million in The Gap, Inc. (NYSE:GPS) at the end of June 2022, compared to 23 funds in the earlier quarter worth $247.7 million. Richard S.

Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Schwab Q3 Earnings Top Estimates, Revenues Jump Y/YSchwab’s third-quarter 2022 adjusted earnings of $1.10 per share handily beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.05. The bottom line soared 31% from the prior-year quarter.Results benefited from higher rates, which led to a rise in net interest income (NII). Thus, revenues witnessed an improvement despite higher volatility hurting trading income. Also, the absence of fee waivers and solid brokerage account numbers acted as tailwinds during the quarter.

4,ed7c718d-7eea-30de-b6b0-4f65db551eb8,TXN,2022-11-17,Selling US$9.0m worth of Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) stock at high prices would have gotten insiders a handsome reward,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/selling-us-9-0m-worth-110012303.html,1668682812,STORY,['TXN'],"[Despite the fact that Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) stock rose 5.1% last week, insiders who sold US$9.0m worth of stock in the previous 12 months are likely to be better off. Selling at an average price of US$176, which is higher than the current price, may have been the wisest decision for these insiders as their investment would have been worth less now than when they sold.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for Texas Instruments Texas Instruments Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Chairman, Richard Templeton, sold US$5.9m worth of shares at a price of US$178 per share. So we know that an insider sold shares at around the present share price of US$173. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. Given that the sale took place at around current prices, it makes us a little cautious but is hardly a major concern.Texas Instruments insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Texas Instruments Insiders Are Selling The StockThe last quarter saw substantial insider selling of Texas Instruments shares. Specifically, Senior VP &amp; CTO Ahmad R. S. Bahai ditched US$200k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Insider Ownership Of Texas InstrumentsI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Texas Instruments insiders own 0.1% of the company, currently worth about US$171m based on the recent share price. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Texas Instruments Tell Us?An insider hasn't bought Texas Instruments stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. On the plus side, Texas Instruments makes money, and is growing profits. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. You'd be interested to know, that we found 2 warning signs for Texas Instruments and we suggest you have a look.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

(NASDAQ:TXN) is a technology company closely monitored by both analysts and investors to gauge the prospects for the tech sector. The company is one of the world's largest and most profitable semiconductor manufacturers.Despite double-digit growth in both revenue and earnings in each of the last five quarters, Texas Instruments' stock has declined close to 7% in the last 12 months. The company has lost more than 6% of its market value this year alone, though it has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 handsomely, which is down 17% in 2022.TXN 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of TXNPeter Lynch Chart of TXNTexas Instruments Is Still Attractive Despite Bleak ProjectionsThe company recently issued lackluster guidance for the fourth quarter, which may spook investors, but it doesn't negate the company's long-term potential. In this analysis, we will review the prospects for the company to determine whether Texas Instruments could still offer good value despite short-term pain.Business basicsTexas Instruments designs and manufactures semiconductors and analog chips for use in a variety of industries, including consumer electronics, automotive, communications and industrial equipment. The company operates under two main segments: Analog and Embedded Processing. The segments focus on developing analog and digital signal processing integrated circuits (ICs) that are engineered for a wide range of applications, including smartphones, tablets, cameras, infotainment systems, medical equipment and more. The company also provides display and projection products that offer high-resolution images for display applications.The slowdown in personal equipment demand is a major concern Texas Instruments has been very profitable in recent years. The company reported record revenue of $5.24 billion in its most recent quarter, an increase of 13% from the previous year. The company also earned over $2 billion in net income in the same period. However, despite the strong financial performance over the past few years, shares of Texas Instruments have been in steady decline recently because of a few concerns regarding the demand outlook.Story continuesOne big concern is that Texas Instruments is seeing slower demand for its products due to slowing economic growth in China. The companys Analog segment has experienced a significant drop in revenue in China, which is dire because the region accounts for 25% of revenue.According to the Semiconductor Industry Association, global semiconductor sales fell 3% year-over-year in September, the first monthly decline since January 2020, with China suffering the most, falling 14%.As a result, revenue from the Analog segment increased by only 13% year-over-year in the third quarter. Meanwhile, sales in Embedded Processing increased by 11%.Exhibit 1: Segment-wise year-over-year revenue growthTexas Instruments Is Still Attractive Despite Bleak ProjectionsSource: Texas Instruments nvestor presentationAccording to the company, the slowdown in growth is due to weakness in the demand for personal electronics that is broadening across the industrial market. Europe is also experiencing a decline in demand, and in the third quarter, the demand for PCs and smartphones remained low. According to Canalys, the global smartphone market fell 9% year-over-year in the third quarter of 2022 - the third consecutive decline and the worst third quarter since 2014. Furthermore, Gartner reports that worldwide PC shipments fell 19.5% in the third quarter, totaling 68 million units. This is the steepest decline since the mid-1990s and marked the fourth consecutive quarter of shipment declines.The last two years have brought significant changes for technology companies with the rise of remote working and distant learning. Mobility restrictions, social distancing measures and growing public health concerns boosted the industry's growth as tech companies relied on innovation to cater to the growing demand for digital workflows. As the world went online, employees and students splurged on smartphones and computers, and shoppers resorted to online shopping.However, with the reopening of the economy, it is proving difficult for tech companies to maintain the pandemic-induced increase in revenue and earnings. Smartphone and computer sales are slowing globally as the economy worsens as well. Furthermore, as consumers' purchasing power deteriorates, they are cutting back on discretionary spending.GuidanceGiven the current economic situation, Texas Instruments expects revenue to fall between 1% and 9% year-over-year in the fourth quarter and earnings per share to fall between 7% and 19%.Based on these trends, some analysts believe the companys profit margins could suffer significantly in the coming years if economic conditions in China and other major economies continue to worsen. Texas Instruments also has significant exposure to the automotive and industrial markets, which accounted for more than half of its revenue last year. Challenging macroeconomic conditions are expected to have an impact on automotive and data center businesses in the coming year, which in return will be an obstacle for Texas Instruments .The chip shortage may be coming to an endThe global semiconductor shortage caused by the pandemic tilted the odds in favor of chip manufacturers as demand far exceeded the supply of semiconductors. This anomaly helped Texas Instruments see margin improvements. The company serves the industrial market, and based on third-quarter data, the demand for chips in this sector is declining rapidly, bringing the market into equilibrium. Although demand for chips still seems to exceed supply in the automotive sector, things could turn around in the coming quarters as automakers look to curb spending in light of the recession woes expected next year.The companys strengthsTexas Instruments is one of the few semiconductor companies that has historically weathered market challenges well because of its strong industrial business. The company has a diversified portfolio in the analog and embedded markets, giving it a competitive advantage. Texas Instruments may well be able to weather the industry's ongoing ""dark winter.""Additionally, its shareholder distributions make the company more attractive to income and value investors. The company has raised the dividend for 19 consecutive years so far, which goes on to highlight that its business is not as cyclical as some of its semiconductor peers. The dividend yield sits at 2.68% as of this writing.Texas Instruments manufactures its analog chips in-house and has a strong U.S. manufacturing footprint, unlike most of its fellow U.S. semiconductor companies, allowing it to benefit from the CHIPS Act, which aims to boost semiconductor manufacturing in the U.S.As the leader of the analog semiconductors market in the U.S., Texas Instruments enjoys competitive advantages stemming from its proven expertise and switching costs. For a client, it would be difficult to replace Texas Instruments with a competitors product as it requires substantial investments, expertise and time to change the architecture of an electronic device.TakeawayTexas Instruments showed consistent growth in the last couple of years. The guidance for the fourth quarter indicates that there could be a significant slowdown in growth in 2023. The industry is grappling with the slowing demand for PCs and declining disposable income around the world. However, the company benefits from its exposure to the industrial sector. An industry-wide slowdown in the demand for chips will negatively affect Texas Instruments in the coming quarters, but I believe the company has what it takes to recover due to its strong competitive advantages.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

But one can do better than that by picking better than average stocks (as part of a diversified portfolio). To wit, the Unum Group (NYSE:UNM) share price is 55% higher than it was a year ago, much better than the market decline of around 21% (not including dividends) in the same period. So that should have shareholders smiling. Looking back further, the stock price is 39% higher than it was three years ago.Since the long term performance has been good but there's been a recent pullback of 9.3%, let's check if the fundamentals match the share price. Check out our latest analysis for Unum Group To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During the last year Unum Group grew its earnings per share (EPS) by 51%. This EPS growth is reasonably close to the 55% increase in the share price. This makes us think the market hasn't really changed its sentiment around the company, in the last year. It looks like the share price is responding to the EPS.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Unum Group has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? Check if analysts think Unum Group will grow revenue in the future.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for Unum Group the TSR over the last 1 year was 61%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that Unum Group shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 61% over the last year. That's including the dividend. That certainly beats the loss of about 1.5% per year over the last half decade. The long term loss makes us cautious, but the short term TSR gain certainly hints at a brighter future. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Unum Group better, we need to consider many other factors.

But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.Right now, PVH is sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while LVMHMoet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). Investors should feel comfortable knowing that PVH likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than LVMUY has recently. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.PVH currently has a forward P/E ratio of 7.79, while LVMUY has a forward P/E of 25.26. We also note that PVH has a PEG ratio of 0.82. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. LVMUY currently has a PEG ratio of 1.62.Another notable valuation metric for PVH is its P/B ratio of 0.77. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, LVMUY has a P/B of 6.29.These metrics, and several others, help PVH earn a Value grade of A, while LVMUY has been given a Value grade of D.PVH has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than LVMUY, so it seems like value investors will conclude that PVH is the superior option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The Federal Reserve has already raised the interest rates by 375 basis points so far this year and more hikes are expected to control the red-hot inflation. Banks are well poised to capitalize on this.The recently concluded earnings season for banks also indicated support from higher interest rates and improving loan demand. This resulted in a solid increase in net interest income (NII) and an expansion in net interest margin (NIM). Also, banks guided for further improvement in NII for the year and into 2023 driven by favorable rates and lending scenario.

With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let’s take a look at Cintas’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. See our latest analysis for Cintas Is Cintas Still Cheap?Cintas is currently expensive based on my price multiple model, where I look at the company's price-to-earnings ratio in comparison to the industry average. In this instance, I’ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock’s cash flows. I find that Cintas’s ratio of 36.2x is above its peer average of 18.57x, which suggests the stock is trading at a higher price compared to the Commercial Services industry. But, is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since Cintas’s share price is quite volatile, this could mean it can sink lower (or rise even further) in the future, giving us another chance to invest. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.What does the future of Cintas look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. However, with a relatively muted profit growth of 4.1% expected over the next couple of years, growth doesn’t seem like a key driver for a buy decision for Cintas, at least in the short term.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has well and truly priced in CTAS’s outlook, with shares trading above industry price multiples. However, this brings up another question – is now the right time to sell? If you believe CTAS should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards the industry PE ratio can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on CTAS for a while, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its industry peers, which means it is likely that there is no more upside from mispricing. However, the positive growth outlook may mean it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.In light of this, if you'd like to do more analysis on the company, it's vital to be informed of the risks involved.

17,5aa0259c-60ed-3f3f-80cf-3e6bd53dc7b6,EW,2022-11-17,Could The Market Be Wrong About Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (NYSE:EW) Given Its Attractive Financial Prospects?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/could-market-wrong-edwards-lifesciences-182413069.html,1668623053,STORY,['EW'],"[It is hard to get excited after looking at Edwards Lifesciences' (NYSE:EW) recent performance, when its stock has declined 24% over the past three months. However, stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financial performance over the long term, which in this case looks quite promising. Specifically, we decided to study Edwards Lifesciences'  ROE in this article.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. See our latest analysis for Edwards Lifesciences How To Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Edwards Lifesciences is:23% = US$1.5b ÷ US$6.2b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.23 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.Edwards Lifesciences' Earnings Growth And 23% ROEFirst thing first, we like that Edwards Lifesciences has an impressive ROE. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 12% the company's ROE is quite impressive. This likely paved the way for the modest 20% net income growth seen by Edwards Lifesciences over the past five years. growthAs a next step, we compared Edwards Lifesciences' net income growth with the industry and found that the company has a similar growth figure when compared with the industry average growth rate of 18% in the same period.Story continuespast-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Has the market priced in the future outlook for EW? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. Is Edwards Lifesciences Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?Given that Edwards Lifesciences doesn't pay any dividend to its shareholders, we infer that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits to grow its business.SummaryOverall, we are quite pleased with Edwards Lifesciences' performance. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings. Having said that, the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down, as forecasted in the current analyst estimates.

You can skip our detailed analysis of Dalio's investment strategy and his hedge fund's performance in the past, and go directly to read Billionaire Ray Dalio's Top 5 Dividend Stocks.Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates is one of the largest hedge funds in the world. The firm uses a principled-based approach and focuses on distinctive approaches for experienced institutional investors around the globe. Dalio’s investment strategy revolves around the diversification of portfolios, as investments in different industries and asset classes reduce risks in different market situations. His ‘All Weather’ strategy is a testament to the fluctuating market conditions, like the one we are facing today. Recently, Dalio stepped down from running Bridgewater Associates and announced to remain on the fund’s board and public research team. As of November, the billionaire’s real-time net worth stands at $19.1 billion, according to Forbes.The continuous hike in interest rates this year has seasoned as well as retail investors worried about the future of the market. In one of his interviews with Business Insider this September, Dalio spoke about the trend of interest rate hikes. He said that higher interest rates will result in the slowdown of the economy in 2023, with the S&amp;P 500 falling about another 20%. He further asserted that a well-balanced portfolio is one of the most reliable ways to ride out the stock market downturn.Over the years, Bridgewater Associates has delivered solid returns to shareholders. According to a report by Bloomberg, the firm’s flagship fund Pure Alpha II delivered an annual average return of 11.4% since its inception in 1991 through June 2022. In the first half of the year, the flagship fund returned 32% due to increased economic volatility. Another report by Business Insider revealed that Bridgewater Associates gained 25% this year through September.Story continuesAs of the end of Q3 2022, Bridgewater Associates’ 13F portfolio had a value of over $19.7 billion, down from $23.5 billion in the preceding quarter. The hedge fund invested in several sectors, with services, healthcare, and consumer goods making up the major portions of the portfolio. Some of the firm’s major holdings in Q3 include Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). In this article, we will discuss the fund’s top dividend stocks.Billionaire Ray Dalio's Top 10 Dividend StocksRay Dalio of Bridgewater AssociatesOur Methodology:For this list, we selected stocks from Bridgewater Associates' 13F portfolio as of the third quarter of 2022.

The company has been a strong dividend payer for years and has raised its payouts for 12 years in a row. It currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.53 per share and has a dividend yield of 2.17%, as of November 16.Bridgewater Associates has been investing in Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) since the fourth quarter of 2010, purchasing shares worth $690,000. At the end of Q3 2022, the hedge fund owned roughly 3 million SBUX shares, worth over $252.5 million. The company represented 1.27% of billionaire Ray Dalio's portfolio. The company is the fund's important holding alongside Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META).Appreciating the company's strong fiscal Q4 earnings, Street analysts presented a positive outlook on Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) in November. Both Evercore ISI and Citigroup raised their price targets on the stock to $97 and $93, respectively.At the end of Q2 2022, Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) was a part of 55 hedge fund portfolios, compared with 58 in the previous quarter. The stakes owned by these hedge funds have a total value of over $1.43 billion.Polen Capital mentioned Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) in its Q2 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Starbucks, which garners a lower weighting in the Portfolio, had slightly better than average three-month performance. Samestore sales were up double-digits in the U.S. and International exChina, with solid revenue growth across those regions. The company is experiencing cost pressures from wages and input costs though, and China same-store sales were down 23% due to zero-COVID policy restrictions and lockdowns.”9. CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS)Bridgewater Associates’ Stake Value: $293,711,000 Dividend Yield as of November 16: 2.25%CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) is an American healthcare company that owns retail pharmacies and also provides health insurance services to its consumers. The company has been a part of Bridgewater Associates' portfolio since the third quarter of 2012 when the hedge fund opened its position with shares worth $2.7 million. During Q3 2022, the fund reduced its position in the company by 3% which takes its total CVS stake worth $293.7 million. The company represented 1.48% of billionaire Ray Dalio's portfolio.On September 22, CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.55 per share, in line with its previous dividend. As of November 16, the stock has a dividend yield of 2.25%.In November, Raymond James reiterated its Outperform rating on CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) with a $115 price target, following the company's strong Q3 earnings.

The collective value of these stakes is over $2.03 billion.Vltava Fund mentioned CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“CVS is a leader in the provision of healthcare services in the USA. It has three main businesses: an enormous network of pharmacies, a health insurance company, and “prescription benefit management”, which is a kind of intermediary between insurance companies and pharmacies. This is the result of large acquisitions over the past 15 years – most notably of Caremark (2007) and Aetna (2018). The markets had deemed its acquisition of health insurer Aetna too expensive (and we agree), so CVS stock then fell into disfavour for a few years.We took advantage of this in the summer of 2020 and brought the stock into our portfolio at a time when its price was pressed down still further by the coronavirus pandemic. CVS is a giant. It has revenues of USD 300 billion, making it one of the largest companies in the world. It is a relatively stable and highly profitable company with strong free cash flow. Over the past few years, CVS has focused primarily on reducing debt.This is already much lower than it had been after the Aetna acquisition, and most of the cash is now likely to go to shareholders through share buybacks or be used for smaller acquisitions to grow the company further. CVS trades at about 11 times annual earnings, which is a very appealing valuation given the expected future growth in profitability and overall modest cyclicality in its business.”8. Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT)Bridgewater Associates’ Stake Value: $298,016,000 Dividend Yield as of November 16: 1.81%Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is a Chicago-based medical device company that also offers other medical services to its patients across the globe.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Also among our bottom contributors were health care products manufacturer Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), global pharmaceutical company Pfizer, media and technology giant Alphabet, and insurance company American International Group (AIG).Abbott has been working through a recall of its infant formula brand Similac in the US, which has continued to pressure its share price. Although the recall will impact near-term revenues, we are not concerned about any long-term impacts. We remain optimistic about the company given it is one of the highest quality names in health care, in our view, with a talented management team that makes smart capital allocation decisions. Abbott also has leading health care and consumer franchises with a particularly strong competitive position in its medical device business. The company continues to launch innovative products in key strategic areas (such as diabetes, structural heart, and diagnostics), which should help drive not only revenue growth but margin expansion.”7.

(NYSE:WMT) in its Q3 2022 investor letter.

I referenced a Reuters article that reported, as of June 17, Wall Street expected S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022, which was up from 8.8% in April and from 8.4% in January. That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6%[2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.” Click to continue reading and see Billionaire Ray Dalio's Top 5 Dividend Stocks. Suggested articles:20 Biggest Electric Vehicle Companies in the WorldTop 10 Hospitality Companies in the World15 Biggest Movie Production Companies in the WorldDisclosure.

21,8a2a3c26-ceaf-37cb-9a88-3d97fc2091a5,WMT,2022-11-17,"FOCUS-First TVs, now tortillas: U.S. companies set minimum prices to halt discounting",Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/focus-first-tvs-now-tortillas-120000643.html,1668686400,STORY,"['WMT', 'AMZN']","[By Jessica DiNapoliNEW YORK, Nov 17 (Reuters) - Makers of everything from toys to tortillas are increasingly setting minimum prices on their goods to maintain profits and limit price cutting as retailers like Walmart Inc and Amazon.com Inc try to grab sales from each other online.As a result, shoppers face fewer discounts for everyday purchases at a time when inflation is around 8%, and as retailers look to unload hundreds of billions of dollars of excess inventory.For many years manufacturers set the lowest price at which retailers could advertise certain big-ticket items like TVs. They wanted to stop shoppers who scoped out an item on the showroom floor, and then went online to find it advertised by another retailer at a lower price, from buying it there.Now, as shoppers stick with the pandemic habit of buying more household basics online, companies such as Colgate-Palmolive Co have in recent months used what are known as minimum advertised price policies on less expensive products like its Optic White Pro Series toothpaste on Amazon, a person familiar with the matter said.The Pro Series toothpaste, now advertised for about $9.96 on Amazon, is a higher-margin product where Colgate wants to protect its profits amid soaring costs. As a result, consumers have struggled to find a lower advertised price anywhere else.Toymaker Hasbro Inc requires retailers to keep any advertised prices above its specified levels ranging from $6.99 to $33.99 on Monopoly, Twister, Chutes &amp; Ladders and 21 other games and toys, except during the holiday shopping season, according to a company memo seen by Reuters.Online shopping for consumer staples, coupled with Amazon's cut-throat competition with Walmart Inc, have driven makers of many consumer products to put price floors on low-cost products, e-commerce consultants said.Mr. Tortilla, which makes diet-friendly tortillas sold online by Walmart and Amazon, decided to set a minimum price as it expanded sales, aiming to keep prices level across e-commerce retailers, said Ron Alcazar, the company's chief operating officer.Story continues""We're seeing categories adopt (these floors) that never had, like food and beverage,"" said Jack Gale, an account executive at PriceSpider, which has seen 120% year-over-year growth in the number of brands using its products that help enforce these price floors since 2018.NOT LEGAL IN EUROPEWhile legal in the United States, these policies are illegal in many countries, including across Europe in most cases.Agreements dictating the for-sale price between retailer and manufacturer are also not legal in some states including California and Maryland.Amazon's part in these pricing floors stems from its pledge to offer products priced as low as, or lower than, rivals like Walmart. This compels brands that sell huge volumes of goods on Amazon to set, and then enforce, a minimum price. Otherwise, they face shrinking profits.Wholesalers to Amazon and sellers on its platform can be penalized by poor placement on Amazon.com, among other practices, if the company finds lower prices on the goods elsewhere, the e-commerce consultants said.""We have no role in creating them or in their continued adoption,"" the Amazon spokesperson said when asked about minimum advertised pricing policies. ""Like any store, we reserve the right not to highlight prices that are uncompetitive compared to other major retailers. We always set our prices independently.""A lawsuit California has filed against Amazon claims suppliers have to agree to rules set by Amazon that ultimately lead brands to adopt and enforce minimum advertised price policies.U.S. Representative David Cicilline, who is working on proposed antitrust legislation aimed at bringing down prices said, ""Amazon routinely abuses its monopoly power to coerce sellers and suppliers, preventing them from offering cheaper prices elsewhere.""Amazon said in response that it does not prevent sellers from offering lower prices elsewhere.A 2007 United States Supreme Court decision permitting agreements ""within reason"" on for-sale prices between retailers and suppliers helped set the stage for the expansion of these price policies.(Reporting by Jessica DiNapoli; Editing by Vanessa O'Connell and Chris Sanders)]"

You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods, please click here&gt;&gt;&gt;Here are the key points: For the 469 S&amp;P 500 members that have reported Q3 results already, total earnings are up +2.2% from the same period last year on +11.9% higher revenues, with 69.1% beating EPS estimates and 67.8% beating revenue estimates.Looking at 2022 Q3 as a whole, total S&amp;P 500 earnings are currently expected to be up +1.5% from the same period last year on +11.6% higher revenues. Excluding contributions from the Energy sector, Q3 earnings for the rest of the index would be -5.9% below the year-earlier level.Looking at the calendar-year picture, total S&amp;P 500 earnings are expected to be up +4.9% in 2022 and +3.1% in 2023. On an ex-Energy basis, total 2022 index earnings would be down -2.1% (instead of +4.9%, with Energy).Full-year 2023 earnings estimates have been coming down after peaking in mid-April, with the aggregate total down -8.4% from the peak for the index as a whole and -11.3% on an ex-Energy basis.As the Q3 earnings season enters its final phase, we continue to see the overall earnings picture as more stable and resilient than many were willing to acknowledge ahead of the start of this reporting cycle. We are not suggesting that corporate earnings are great, but they aren’t bad either.Many in the market feared an earnings cliff that would force management teams across many industries to provide downbeat guidance. We got some of those downbeat reports, with Target TGT as the latest to come out with disappointing results and guidance. But we also had Walmart WMT and Lowe’s LOW which impressed Wall Street.Story continuesNot much growth was expected given where we are in the economic cycle. But the actual growth coming through the results is ever so slightly better than expected. It is this performance relative to expectations rather than the absolute level of earnings or the growth pace that is of relevance to the market.Looking at expectations for 2022 Q4 and beyond, they are getting reset lower, as we have been pointing out for a while now. Analysts have been steadily cutting their estimates for some time. We saw this in the run up to the start of the Q3 earnings season and the trend continues with respect to estimates for the current period (2022 Q4) and full-year 2023.As we have consistently been pointing out, aggregate S&amp;P 500 earnings outside of the Energy sector peaked in mid-April and have been steadily trending down ever since. In fact, S&amp;P 500 earnings estimates in the aggregate outside of the Energy sector have declined more than -11% since mid-April, with much bigger declines in Retail, Construction, Consumer Discretionary, Tech, Industrial Products and the Aerospace sectors. On the whole, estimates are down for 13 of the 16 Zacks sectors.The Overall Earnings PictureEarnings next year are expected to be up only +3.1%. This magnitude of growth can hardly be called out-of-sync with a flat or even modestly down economic growth outlook. Don’t forget that headline GDP growth numbers are in real or inflation-adjusted terms while S&amp;P 500 earnings discussed here are not.As mentioned earlier, 2023 aggregate earnings estimates on an ex-Energy basis are already down by more than -11% since mid-April. Perhaps we see a bit more downward adjustments to estimates over the coming weeks, after we have seen Q3 results. But we have nevertheless already covered some ground in taking estimates to a fair or appropriate level.This is particularly so if whatever economic downturn lies ahead proves to be more of the garden variety rather than the last two such events. Recency bias forces us to use the last two economic downturns, which were also among the nastiest in recent history, as our reference points. But we need to be cautious against that natural tendency as the economy’s foundations at present remain unusually strongWhy Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Our 5 best-performing strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's impressive +28.8% gain in 2021.

The company manufactures, distributes, and sells various lines of tires for automobiles, trucks, buses, aircrafts, motorcycles, earthmoving equipment, and mining and industrial equipment under the Goodyear, Cooper, Dunlop, Kelly, Debica, Sava, Fulda, Mastercraft, and Roadmaster brands. Story continuesSecurities filings for the third quarter of 2022 reveal that Ken Fisher added The Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Company (NASDAQ:GT) to his portfolio by acquiring 2.80 million shares worth $28.3 million, representing 0.02% of the total holdings. On October 31, The Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Company (NASDAQ:GT) reported Q3 non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.07, beating Wall Street estimates by $0.52. The revenue climbed 7.7% year-over-year to $5.31 billion but missed market forecasts by $30 million. Deutsche Bank analyst Emmanuel Rosner on November 2 maintained a Hold rating on The Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Company (NASDAQ:GT) but lowered the price target on the shares to $10 from $14. The analyst sees the ""sharp negative market"" reaction to The Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Company (NASDAQ:GT)’s Q3 print as justified, in light of the ""increasingly challenging operating environment ahead for the company.""According to Insider Monkey’s data, 30 hedge funds were bullish on The Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Company (NASDAQ:GT) at the end of Q2 2022, compared to 33 funds in the prior quarter.

We sold our position in Goodyear due to the cavalcade of concerns including the company’s elevated debt levels, inflationary pressures from higher input prices, continued manufacturing challenges in the auto industry and complications with the company’s manufacturing volume. With substantial exposure to the automotive industry through other portfolio holdings, we elected to consolidate our exposure within those higher-conviction holdings.""9. Nordstrom, Inc. (NYSE:JWN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 31Fisher Asset Management’s Stake Value: $28,921,000Nordstrom, Inc. (NYSE:JWN) is a Washington-based fashion retailer that manufactures and markets apparel, footwear, beauty products, accessories, and home goods through Nordstrom branded stores and online channels. In Q3 2022, Ken Fisher purchased 1.7 million shares of Nordstrom, Inc. (NYSE:JWN) worth about $29 million. In mid-October, Nordstrom, Inc. (NYSE:JWN) reiterated its previously forecast FY22 adjusted EPS of $2.30 to $2.60 and revenue growth of 5% to 7%. Market consensus for EPS stood at $2.34 and $15.58 billion for sales.On November 14, Deutsche Bank analyst Gabriella Carbone reaffirmed a Hold rating on Nordstrom, Inc. (NYSE:JWN) but trimmed the price target on the shares to $22 from $23 ahead of the Q3 results. The analyst believes investor sentiment will remain largely negative on the apparel retail sector until there is improved visibility around inventory and consumer demand heading into fiscal 2023.Among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, Nordstrom, Inc. (NYSE:JWN) was part of 31 public stock portfolios at the end of Q2 2022, compared to 29 in the prior quarter. Paul Marshall and Ian Wace’s Marshall Wace LLP is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 5.4 million shares worth $115.70 million. Here is what Mayar Capital specifically said about Nordstrom, Inc. (NYSE:JWN) in its second quarter 2022 investor letter:“The second thought experiment comes from my own personal experience in the period around the financial crisis. In 2006 I made an investment in the shares of Nordstrom, Inc. (NYSE:JWN). Over the following three-and-a-half years, the stock was up by 36%, outperforming the S&amp;P 500 by a very respectable 41.4%. A fund made up of a single holding in Nordstrom would have ranked in the top 1% of all funds in the Morningstar database.However, Nordstrom stock declined by a very painful 80% during 2008. A single-stock fund would have almost certainly liquidated during that drawdown, taking investors out of the game and ending any hope of them ever realizing the return. But because my portfolio was diversified, it held its value a bit better (it declined by 25% while the market was down by 38%), allowing me to sell some holdings and redeploy money into investments like Nordstrom that had declined severely.”8. KB Financial Group Inc. (NYSE:KB)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 6Fisher Asset Management’s Stake Value: $30,393,000KB Financial Group Inc. (NYSE:KB) is headquartered in Seoul, and the company provides banking and financial services to consumers and enterprises in South Korea and internationally. The company operates through Corporate Banking, Retail Banking, Other Banking Services, Securities Business, Non-life Insurance Business, Credit Card Business, and Life Insurance Business segments. On October 25, KB Financial Group Inc. (NYSE:KB) reported a Q3 net profit of WON1.2 trillion and a net interest income of WON2.89 trillion.As per the 13F filings for the third quarter of 2022, Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management added KB Financial Group Inc. (NYSE:KB) to its portfolio by purchasing over 1 million shares worth $30.3 million, representing 0.02% of the total securities. According to the second quarter database of Insider Monkey, 6 hedge funds reported owning stakes worth $51.4 million in KB Financial Group Inc. (NYSE:KB), compared to 7 funds in the prior quarter worth $43.7 million. Peter Rathjens, Bruce Clarke, and John Campbell’s Arrowstreet Capital is the biggest position holder in the company, with 774,872 shares valued at $28.8 million.7. Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 35Fisher Asset Management’s Stake Value: $34,995,000Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH) is headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio, and the company manufactures and sells motion and control technologies and systems for various mobile, industrial, and aerospace markets worldwide. In the third quarter of 2022, Ken Fisher opened a new position in Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH) by purchasing 144,423 shares worth nearly $35 million. On October 26, Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH) declared a quarterly dividend of $1.33 per share, in line with previous. The dividend is distributable on December 2, to shareholders of record on November 14. Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH)’s dividend yield on November 15 came in at 1.71%. Citi analyst Timothy Thein on October 14 resumed coverage of Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH) with a Neutral rating and a $285 price target, suggesting 12% total return potential. The analyst expects less earnings volatility compared to past cycles, but said it will likely take some time for Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH) to prove this to investors. Further weakening in manufacturing data may result in a more attractive entry point for the stock, the analyst told investors in a research note.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 35 hedge funds were bullish on Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH) at the end of Q2 2022, compared to 39 funds in the prior quarter. Andreas Halvorsen’s Viking Global is the leading position holder in the company, with more than 3 million shares worth $755.5 million. Here is what Oakmark Fund specifically said about Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH) in its second quarter 2022 investor letter:“Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH), a U.S. company that specializes in motion and control technologies, is suffering from what we believe are investor misunderstandings and misjudgments, despite the efforts of the company’s unusually strong management team. In our opinion, since his promotion in 2015, CEO Thomas Williams has vastly improved operations and shifted the product portfolio to longer cycled, higher growth, higher margin and higher return end markets. The results are impressive. Margins, returns and earnings have increased substantially. With the expected closing of the Meggitt acquisition in the September quarter, the highly depressed aerospace segment will be its largest end market. We anticipate a rebound in aerospace revenue, which—combined with the company’s strong position in attractive businesses, including clean technologies and factory automation—should accelerate revenue growth. Parker Hannifin trades at a discount to other high-quality industrials, which we believe is unwarranted since its growth and returns should be similar or better. At a low-teens multiple of next year’s normalized cash earnings, Parker Hannifin is an attractive investment, in our view.”6. The Gap, Inc. (NYSE:GPS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 27Fisher Asset Management’s Stake Value: $40,212,000The Gap, Inc. (NYSE:GPS) is a California-based apparel retail company that sells its products under the Old Navy, Gap, Banana Republic, and Athleta brands. Ken Fisher added The Gap, Inc.

The dividend is payable on January 25, 2023 to shareholders of the company as of January 4. The Gap, Inc. (NYSE:GPS)’s dividend yield on November 15 came in at 4.67%. Citi analyst Paul Lejuez on November 11 raised the price target on The Gap, Inc. (NYSE:GPS) to $8 from $7 and kept a Sell rating on the shares. The analyst expects the company's Q3 results to miss the consensus comp estimate of 3% and deliver a softer than expected gross margin.Among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 27 funds reported owning stakes worth $234.3 million in The Gap, Inc. (NYSE:GPS) at the end of June 2022, compared to 23 funds in the earlier quarter worth $247.7 million. Richard S. Pzena’s Pzena Investment Management held the biggest stake in the company, comprising approximately 10 million shares valued at $82.3 million. Like The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW), Johnson Controls International plc (NYSE:JCI), and GSK plc (NYSE:GSK), The Gap, Inc.

However, total losses seen by insiders are still US$9.7k but in since the time of purchase.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Marsh &amp; McLennan CompaniesOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider purchase was by insider Marc Oken for US$837k worth of shares, at about US$167 per share. That means that an insider was happy to buy shares at above the current price of US$166. While their view may have changed since the purchase was made, this does at least suggest they have had confidence in the company's future. In our view, the price an insider pays for shares is very important. It is encouraging to see an insider paid above the current price for shares, as it suggests they saw value, even at higher levels.

The Federal Reserve has already raised the interest rates by 375 basis points so far this year and more hikes are expected to control the red-hot inflation. Banks are well poised to capitalize on this.The recently concluded earnings season for banks also indicated support from higher interest rates and improving loan demand. This resulted in a solid increase in net interest income (NII) and an expansion in net interest margin (NIM). Also, banks guided for further improvement in NII for the year and into 2023 driven by favorable rates and lending scenario. Amid such favorable developments, bank stocks continue to be in the spotlight.Nonetheless, investors must be cautious while choosing bank stocks for generating solid returns. The operating environment is gradually turning grim with recessionary fears taking hold, and banks will not be untouched by the economic headwinds. So, we picked five banks – Citigroup C, Truist Financial TFC, U.S. Bancorp USB, Huntington Bancshares HBAN and Citizens Financial Group CFG – that are part of the S&amp;P 500 Index and have been regularly paying dividends.To select these banks, we ran the Zacks Stocks Screener to find stocks with a dividend yield in excess of 4% and a five-year historical dividend growth of more than 6%.

They must also take into account company fundamentals to find compelling investment opportunities.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Not only can it impact your investment portfolio, but it can also help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.The fear of missing out, or FOMO, also plays a factor in investing, especially with particular tech giants, as well as popular consumer-facing stocks.What if you'd invested in Microchip Technology (MCHP) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to MCHP for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?Microchip Technology's Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at Microchip Technology's main business drivers.Microchip Technology Inc. develops and manufactures microcontrollers, memory and analog and interface products for embedded control systems, which are small, low-power computers designed to perform specific tasks.Chandler, AZ-based, Microchip reported total revenues of $6.821 billion in fiscal 2022.Beginning from calendar year 2021, the company reports FPGA revenues combined with its licensing, memory and other or LMO segment revenues under a new revenue category referred to as “other.” The company has now three major product lines:Microcontrollers (54.4% of fiscal 2022 revenues): This product portfolio comprises 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit PIC microcontrollers and 16-bit dsPIC digital signal controllers. Microchip's expanding product portfolio driven by new microcontrollers’ roll outs aids it in expanding customer base and sustain its leading position in the market.Analog (28%): These products consist of several families with approximately 800 power management, linear, mixed-signal, thermal management, RF Linear drivers, safety and security, and interface products. The line of mixed-signal products primarily includes data converters that convert data from analog to digital or vice versa.Other (17.6%): The product line now comprises revenues from FPGA and LMO segments. LMO segment constitutes a combination of license fees and royalties related to SuperFlash technology, and fees for engineering services. Microchip licenses its SuperFlash technology to foundries, integrated device manufacturers and design partners across the world.FPGA product line was primarily acquired as part of Microsemi acquisition.In fiscal 2022, Americas, Europe and Asia contributed 25.5%, 19.2% and 55.3%, respectively to net sales.Story continuesBottom LineWhile anyone can invest, building a lucrative investment portfolio takes research, patience, and a little bit of risk. If you had invested in Microchip Technology ten years ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today.According to our calculations, a $1000 investment made in November 2012 would be worth $5,196.89, or a gain of 419.69%, as of November 16, 2022, and this return excludes dividends but includes price increases.In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 gained 194.96% and the price of gold went up -0.23% over the same time frame.Analysts are forecasting more upside for MCHP too.Microchip is riding on consistent strength in its analog and microcontroller businesses. The company’s dominance in 8,16 and 32-bit microcontrollers is driving top-line growth. Strategic acquisitions like Microsemi and Atmel have expanded the product portfolio. It is gaining from recovery in demand across industrial, automotive and consumer end-markets, on reopening of economies, globally. Collaboration with the likes of AWS is positive. Shares have outperformed the industry year to date. Nevertheless, supply-chain constraints related to semiconductors has been a headwind. The company could not meet demand with adequate supply as shipping of products were facing increasing backlogs. Microchip expects wafer fab, as well as assembly and test constraints, will persist through 2023 and beyond. Leveraged balance sheet is a concern for investors.The stock is up 29.81% over the past four weeks, and no earnings estimate has gone lower in the past two months, compared to 10 higher, for fiscal 2022. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

Employees say having more women in STEM is critical to moving the needle on this. Yet, many women in STEM continue to struggle with barriers to their career progression. This comes on the heels of MetLife’s 2021 and 2020 research which found women left the workforce at an alarming rate during the pandemic and faced roadblocks when trying to return.To discuss the opportunities around women in STEM, on November 30 and December 1, MetLife’s 4th annual Triangle Tech X Conference, ""Inspiring the Next Innovation Wave"", will convene top technology and business leaders, including companies such as IBM, Microsoft, Dell, SAS, and Cisco. The event is free and will be keynoted by global cultural icon Serena Williams, who along with being widely considered among the greatest tennis players of all time, has been successful in business, venture capital and fashion. Other thought leaders presenting at TTX include: futurist Amy Webb, Project Include CEO Ellen Pao and Emmy-nominated TV host Emily Calandrelli.""There’s a tremendous opportunity for employers to forge a more equitable path forward,"" said Bill Pappas, head of Global Technology and Operations at MetLife. ""Industry leaders and STEM workers believe it could take 20 years or more for women to be equally represented in these fields, but we don’t have nearly that long. Women are critical to inspiring the next wave of innovation.""Story continuesUncertainty for women in STEMWhile the industry has seen some progress over the past year, obstacles for STEM equality remain. STEM women are almost twice as likely as non-STEM women to say they are considering leaving the workforce. Top reasons cited in the research include a lack of diversity at their companies; stress and burnout; and others getting promoted ahead of them.Compounding the issue, there are fewer women in STEM leadership positions today than just a year ago. The MetLife survey found women in STEM leadership ranks – including people managers, team leaders, and executive leadership – fell 14% over the past year, indicating a widening representation gap.An opportunity for employersDespite these challenges, nearly half of women see STEM as an innovative and impactful field that can contribute to solving major societal challenges. This presents a significant opportunity for employers to improve how they attract, develop and retain female STEM talent.""Often, women are simply overlooked,"" said Serena Williams, who has faced many barriers in her various careers. ""It starts with just giving women opportunities, because we’ve had to work harder for what we achieve and we won’t disappoint.""The MetLife research shows there are several different ways employers can encourage women to continue pursuing careers in STEM, including: increased flexibility; career progression opportunities; a purpose-driven culture; and creating a more inclusive workplace.""The time to act is now,"" said Robin Gordon, Chief Data and Analytics Officer at MetLife. ""It’s clear that bringing more women into STEM will have a profound impact on changing our world, which is why it’s so critical women are given the opportunities and support they need to thrive at every stage of their careers.""Research MethodologyMetLife’s 2022 Women in STEM Study was conducted in September 2022. The study was fielded by Rainmakers CSI – an international strategy, insight and planning consultancy. The Study consists of two surveys. The employer survey includes 310 interviews with HR and benefit decision-makers at organizations with STEM employees.

In October, EIA data showed the US only had 25 days' supply of diesel left in reserves — a low not seen since 2008.As well as hitting American drivers, high diesel prices are squeezing supermarkets and retailers that rely on freight transportation, as truckers pass on costs.

And in our experience, buying the right stocks can give your wealth a significant boost. For example, the Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO) share price is up 100% in the last 5 years, clearly besting the market return of around 46% (ignoring dividends).Since the stock has added US$5.8b to its market cap in the past week alone, let's see if underlying performance has been driving long-term returns. View our latest analysis for Moody's In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Over half a decade, Moody's managed to grow its earnings per share at 24% a year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 15% over the same period. Therefore, it seems the market has become relatively pessimistic about the company.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthBefore buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, Moody's' TSR for the last 5 years was 109%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.A Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market lost about 20% in the twelve months, Moody's shareholders did even worse, losing 25% (even including dividends). However, it could simply be that the share price has been impacted by broader market jitters. It might be worth keeping an eye on the fundamentals, in case there's a good opportunity. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 16% per year over half a decade. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Take risks, for example - Moody's has   2 warning signs  (and 1 which is significant)  we think you should know about.Story continuesOf course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

That sort of return is as solid as granite. It's also good to see the share price up 19% over the last quarter.

View our latest analysis for PG&amp;E While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During three years of share price growth, PG&amp;E moved from a loss to profitability. That kind of transition can be an inflection point that justifies a strong share price gain, just as we have seen here.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthIt is of course excellent to see how PG&amp;E has grown profits over the years, but the future is more important for shareholders. If you are thinking of buying or selling PG&amp;E stock, you should check out this FREE detailed report on its balance sheet.A Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that PG&amp;E shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 17% over one year. Notably the five-year annualised TSR loss of 12% per year compares very unfavourably with the recent share price performance. We generally put more weight on the long term performance over the short term, but the recent improvement could hint at a (positive) inflection point within the business. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.

But if you choose individual stocks with prowess, you can make superior returns. For example, the News Corporation (NASDAQ:NWSA) share price is up 41% in the last three years, clearly besting the market return of around 25% (not including dividends).After a strong gain in the past week, it's worth seeing if longer term returns have been driven by improving fundamentals. View our latest analysis for News While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.News became profitable within the last three years. That would generally be considered a positive, so we'd expect the share price to be up.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthIt is of course excellent to see how News has grown profits over the years, but the future is more important for shareholders. You can see how its balance sheet has strengthened (or weakened) over time in this free interactive graphic.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of News, it has a TSR of 46% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.A Different PerspectiveThe total return of 23% received by News shareholders over the last year isn't far from the market return of -21%. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 4%, each year, over five years. If the fundamental data remains strong, and the share price is simply down on sentiment, then this could be an opportunity worth investigating. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for News   you should know about.Story continuesOf course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

51,64e54adf-affb-3f64-8935-5357d7f64501,NWS,2022-11-17,Realtor.com® October Rental Report: Rent Growth Hits Slowest Pace in 18 Months,PR Newswire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/realtor-com-october-rental-report-110000641.html,1668682800.0,STORY,"['NWS', 'NWSA', 'NWSAL']","[Nearly 70% of renters surveyed are considering moving to save money as rent increases cut into monthly budgets and hinder savingsSANTA CLARA, Calif., Nov. 17, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Renters throughout the country are finally seeing a bit of relief when it comes to the seemingly relentless pace of rent growth. The Realtor.com® October Rental Report shows that nationally rent growth slowed to 4.7% year-over-year, its slowest pace in 18 months, with the median U.S. rent hitting $1,734. Additionally, The Avail, by Realtor.com®, 2022 Fall Landlord and Renter Survey found that while tenants are still struggling with affordability, the majority of landlords are planning increases in the next 12 months, albeit less than before.""With soaring inflation and recession fears a huge concern for many consumers, finding affordable housing remains a priority for families. Our data indicates that we are finally starting to see a bit of relief from the double-digit pace of rent growth that we experienced during the height of the pandemic,"" said Danielle Hale, Chief Economist at Realtor.com®. ""While it's still a bit early to say that we're officially on a downward trajectory for rent prices, the data shows a promising return toward normal seasonal slowdowns and suggests that the astronomical price gains of the past several years may be behind us.""October 2022 Rental Metrics – NationalUnit SizeMedian RentChange since Oct. 2021Change since Oct. 2019Overall$1,7344.7 %23.5 %Studio$1,4576.7 %18.3 %1-bed$1,6114.5 %23.2 %2-bed$1,9013.7 %24.7 %Rent prices slowly falling from historic highsThe median rent in the top 50 U.S. metros in October was $1,734, down $25 from last month and $47 from the peak in July. This marks the third consecutive month of single-digit growth and the ninth consecutive month of slowing. However, the pace of growth was still nearly 1.5 times faster than it was in March 2020, just before the pandemic hit. During the late-fall and early-winter, rental demand typically slows, as it's a less popular time for households to make a move. This year is showing a return to a normal seasonal slowdown that we didn't see the last two years. Despite these cooling prices, renters are still feeling the sting of the sharp increases of the past several years.Story continuesRenters seek affordability after recent rent hikesThe Avail 2022 Fall Landlord and Renter Survey found that:Nearly two-thirds (63.2%) of renters who have been in their current unit for 12-24 months have seen their rent increase, up from 52.2% in July.The median monthly rent increase reported by survey respondents was $138 for lease renewals (compared to $160 in July) and $300 for new leases (the same as in July).Despite lower increases, affordability is still a major concern, as 69.5% who had experienced an increase are considering moving to a more affordable rental, up from 66.2% in July.Those considering moving are looking for a 12.5% cost reduction, or about $200 per month for the median renter. This is up from 10.3%, or about $125, in July.Lower rent prices might not be easy to find, as most landlords plan to continue increasing rentMore than two thirds (70.4%) of landlords plan to raise the rent of at least one unit within the next 12 months (down from 72.1% in July).However, there is some good news. The number of landlords planning to increase rent more than 10% shrunk from 25.4% of landlords in April to 18.3% in October.""While it's encouraging to see smaller price increases, it's important to understand that many renters have already absorbed large increases in their monthly rental costs over the past several years, which is impacting their ability to save,"" said Ryan Coon, VP of Rentals at Realtor.com®. ""High inflation and the cost of upkeep and repairs are hitting landlords, who have had to raise rents to cover their higher cost of owning the properties and making it unlikely that they'll be open to negotiating with new tenants.""Little room for negotiation as landlords feel the pinchThe increasing cost of ownership and market conditions have impacted landlords. However, there is a bit more room to negotiate for renewing tenants:While 34.7% of renters attempted to negotiate a smaller rent increase when their rent was most recently raised, only 6% of all renters were successful in doing so.Landlords surveyed were not likely to be open to negotiating, but were more likely with renewing tenants. Just 17% of landlords report being somewhat likely (14.4%) or extremely likely (2.6%) to allow a new renter to negotiate over the price of rent. But for renewing tenants, that increased to 21.9% being somewhat likely (17.5%) or extremely likely (4.4%) to negotiate.Increasing cost of ownership has led 80% of landlords to increase rent over the past 12 months. Among these landlords, 80.1% indicate that changes in rental market prices in their area influenced their decision to raise rent.High rent prices impact the ability to save for a homeThe typical renter reported being able to save just $100 per month, so it's not surprising that:Just 32.3% of renters are considering purchasing a home in the next 12 months, down from 34.6% in July.The biggest reasons cited were not having enough savings for a down payment (44.4%) and believing they would not qualify for a mortgage (19.6%).Among renters considering purchasing a home, 83.9% said that rising interest rates and inflation have impacted their plans to buy a home, up from 80.8% in July.Avail provides informational resources for both renters and landlords via its rental resource center at: https://www.avail.co/education/resourcesOctober 2022 Rental Metrics – 50 Largest U.S. Metro AreasMetroOverallMedian RentOverallRent YYStudioMedian RentStudioRent YY1-br  Median Rent1-brRent YY2-br Median Rent2-brRent YYAtlanta-Sandy  Springs-Roswell, Ga.$1,703-0.8 %$1,6612.8 %$1,596-1.1 %$1,859-0.4 %Austin-Round Rock, Texas$1,7032.0 %$1,4956.4 %$1,551-0.5 %$1,8692.3 %Baltimore-Columbia-Towson,  Md.$1,7552.9 %$1,363-1.0 %$1,6723.1 %$1,8944.0 %Birmingham-Hoover, Ala.$1,1373.1 %$952-9.9 %$1,0551.8 %$1,1997.6 %Boston-Cambridge-Newton, Mass.-N.H.$2,89412.8 %$2,70625.0 %$2,73812.2 %$3,15211.0 %Buffalo-Cheektowaga-Niagara Falls, N.Y.$1,1640.0 %$8567.3 %$1,20210.6 %$1,1903.6 %Charlotte-Concord-Gastonia, N.C.-S.C.$1,6063.4 %$1,5118.6 %$1,5283.4 %$1,7252.4 %Chicago-Naperville-Elgin,  Ill.-Ind.-Wisc.$2,03223.7 %$1,72051.0 %$1,95122.4 %$2,18320.9 %Cincinnati, Ohio-Ky.-Ind.$1,2737.0 %$1,1828.6 %$1,2126.5 %$1,4447.6 %Cleveland-Elyria, Ohio$1,1694.6 %$8927.9 %$1,0960.3 %$1,2879.0 %Columbus, Ohio$1,2375.8 %$9627.0 %$1,1767.4 %$1,3193.5 %Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington, Texas$1,5955.8 %$1,3475.7 %$1,4454.5 %$1,8545.1 %Denver-Aurora-Lakewood, Colo.$1,9071.1 %$1,6071.3 %$1,7810.3 %$2,2111.0 %Detroit-Warren-Dearborn, Mich.$1,2478.6 %$1,17114.6 %$1,0997.7 %$1,3796.7 %Hartford-West Hartford-East Hartford, Conn.$1,7269.4 %$1,60718.4 %$1,5084.8 %$1,8942.7 %Houston-The Woodlands-Sugar Land, Texas$1,3762.9 %$1,2682.7 %$1,2672.7 %$1,5132.9 %Indianapolis-Carmel-Anderson, Ind.$1,2769.4 %$1,1148.7 %$1,1609.0 %$1,3414.3 %Jacksonville, Fla.$1,4631.3 %$1,11610.7 %$1,3411.2 %$1,555-4.6 %Kansas City, Mo.-Kan.$1,2748.7 %$1,0198.8 %$1,20910.2 %$1,4798.9 %Las Vegas-Henderson-Paradise, Nev.$1,533-2.5 %$1,0480.0 %$1,428-2.1 %$1,645-3.7 %Los Angeles-Long Beach-Anaheim, Calif.$2,9214.5 %$2,2887.1 %$2,7204.1 %$3,3814.3 %Louisville/JeffersonCounty, Ky.-Ind.$1,0893.3 %$9463.5 %$1,0184.7 %$1,1463.8 %Memphis, Tenn.-Miss.-Ark.$1,270-0.7 %$1,107-6.5 %$1,246-4.3 %$1,346-1.6 %Miami-Fort Lauderdale-West Palm Beach, Fla.$2,6868.4 %$2,3339.5 %$2,3848.4 %$2,9605.0 %Milwaukee-Waukesha-West Allis, Wisc.$1,5305.4 %$1,2638.1 %$1,4155.8 %$1,7040.3 %Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington, Minn.-Wisc.$1,5272.7 %$1,2411.3 %$1,4522.1 %$1,8082.2 %Nashville-Davidson–Murfreesboro–Franklin, Tenn.$1,6254.1 %$1,600-1.1 %$1,5323.2 %$1,6813.6 %New Orleans-Metairie, La.$1,393-3.7 %NANANANANANANew York-Newark-JerseyCity, N.Y.-N.J.-Pa.$2,77912.7 %$2,48612.6 %$2,3958.9 %$3,0459.3 %Oklahoma City, Okla.$9469.7 %$7686.9 %$8394.8 %$1,03213.3 %Orlando-Kissimmee-Sanford, Fla.$1,8055.9 %$1,63210.6 %$1,6796.2 %$2,0305.1 %Philadelphia-Camden-Wilmington, Penn.-N.J.-Del.-Md.$1,7344.1 %$1,44112.3 %$1,6424.2 %$1,844-0.8 %Phoenix-Mesa-Scottsdale, Ariz.$1,625-1.6 %$1,309-0.3 %$1,489-2.7 %$1,746-4.4 %Pittsburgh, Penn.$1,4403.7 %$1,19813.3 %$1,4705.0 %$1,4751.0 %Portland-Vancouver-Hillsboro, Ore.-Wash.$1,7745.1 %$1,4473.5 %$1,6783.4 %$1,9352.6 %Providence-Warwick,R.I.-Mass.$2,02013.6 %NANANANANANARaleigh, N.C.$1,5383.6 %$1,4123.6 %$1,4395.2 %$1,6824.0 %Richmond, Va.$1,3715.6 %$1,24314.6 %$1,2568.5 %$1,5234.5 %Riverside-San Bernardino-Ontario, Calif.$2,171-4.7 %$1,492-14.6 %$1,920-4.6 %$2,188-2.9 %Rochester, N.Y.$1,3508.0 %$1,03518.1 %$1,31412.7 %$1,4599.3 %Sacramento–Roseville–Arden-Arcade, Calif.$1,876-3.4 %$1,586-9.4 %$1,740-2.6 %$2,012-0.5 %San Antonio-New Braunfels, Texas$1,3244.7 %$1,1130.0 %$1,1993.7 %$1,4902.9 %San Diego-Carlsbad, Calif.$2,7933.1 %$2,2856.4 %$2,5312.3 %$3,0760.9 %San Francisco-Oakland-Hayward, Calif.$3,0315.8 %$2,4888.9 %$2,7673.5 %$3,4504.5 %San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara, Calif.$3,2689.6 %$2,5829.0 %$2,9438.5 %$3,6209.1 %Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue,Wash.$2,1612.7 %$1,8416.6 %$2,1131.4 %$2,5114.0 %St. Louis, Mo.-Ill.$1,2203.8 %$9474.1 %$1,1413.8 %$1,2831.4 %Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater, Fla.$1,784-2.5 %$1,476-2.8 %$1,650-2.2 %$1,968-4.6 %Virginia Beach-Norfolk-Newport News, Va.-N.C.$1,4633.9 %$1,38619.5 %$1,3863.0 %$1,480-2.4 %Washington-Arlington-Alexandria, D.C.-Va.-Md.-W.V.$2,1264.9 %$1,7715.1 %$2,0083.0 %$2,4544.6 % MethodologyRental data as of October 2022 for units advertised as for-rent on Realtor.com®.

Well, Microsoft thinks so, the software giant adding four games to Microsoft Teams. You heard that right. Now Microsoft citing a study by Brigham Young University, BYU, that says teams that play short video games together were 20% more productive than those who participated in more traditional team building activities.Rachelle, the results of that study caught me a little bit by surprise. I guess the fact that they were 20% more productive, that's a pretty big jump there. It lets people-- it lets you go head to head with a coworker. To me, I just think it's distracting. But from the results of the study, maybe there is a point there.RACHELLE AKUFFO: I mean, it's interesting. Even some of the games that they talk about-- Solitaire, Minesweeper, Wordament, and Microsoft Icebreakers-- those last two, I have no idea what they even are. But it's supposed to be about team building. And I guess if it helps with that, then that would translate into the productivity because otherwise, it does seem like just another distraction.But I mean, they have these-- on the Microsoft blog, they say that these are quick interactive multiplayer games from between two to 250 players. I can't even imagine if we had, like, a 250-people game on Yahoo and all of us on there. It would just be pandemonium. But I mean, if the results show that it'll make you more productive as a team, you never know, right? You try something, you never know. Maybe it'll work.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, and I think it's also an example of these companies just trying everything they can to differentiate their products. We know competition in this space has become very fierce over the last several months, really since the start of the pandemic.So maybe they're thinking that this is something that's going to separate themselves from the competitors out there. I don't know. It might be a tough sell to some of the businesses that their employees are, I guess, good use of their time, playing some of these games.]"

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at Billionaire Ray Dalio's Top 5 Technology Stock Picks.Ray Dalio is an American billionaire investor, former hedge fund manager, and philanthropist. He is the founder of Bridgewater Associates, a Connecticut-based hedge fund with over $126 billion in assets under management. Bridgewater Associates is made up of three hedge funds: The flagship Pure Alpha fund, the All Weather fund, and the Pure Alpha Major Markets fund. According to an article by The New York Times, Ray Dalio is stepping down from his role as hedge fund manager of Bridgewater Associates after 47 years. Ray Dalio is being succeeded by co-CEOs of Bridgewater Associates Nir Bar Dea and Mark Bertolini and will continue to serve as the Chief Investment Officer of Bridgewater Associates. According to the article, Bridgewater Associates' flagship fund, Pure Alpha, is up 35% year to date and is outperforming all major market indices.Ray Dalio's Macro AnalysisOn October 12, Ray Dalio appeared in an interview on Bloomberg where he discussed the current macroeconomic trends. According to Mr. Dalio, we will not be having a ""sustainable interest rate that is going to be a real adequate interest rate"", and so he is steering clear of debt instruments. Mr. Dalio said that according to his analysis and estimates, the interest rate that will equalize the inflation rate sits between 4% and 5% and that brings the ""real bond yield"" to ""four and a half percent"" and ""the economy cannot take an interest rate much higher than that before it is going to be negative"".Bridgewater Associates' Stock PortfolioIn the third quarter of 2022, Bridgewater Associates increased its exposure to 300 previously held positions, reduced its stakes in 498 securities, initiated 61 new positions, and exited 180 positions. As of September 30, Bridgewater Associates has a portfolio value of $19.75 billion. This article will look at some of Ray Dalio's top technology stock picks, which include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB), and Alphabet Inc.

AMD designs leading high-performance central and graphics processing units (known as CPUs and GPUs) and integrates them with hardware and software to build differentiated solutions for customers.AMD has been gaining meaningful share in personal computing and server end markets over the past several years driven by the performance of its processors and technology and strong execution against its technology roadmap, and we believe share gains will continue over the coming years from a combination of AMD’s continued advancements and Intel’s stumbles in developing its leading-edge technology.Additionally, the recently closed acquisitions of Xilinx and Pensando enhance AMD’s positioning within the data center, a key growth engine for the semiconductor industry, and Xilinx specifically opens up several new growth opportunities in new end markets like industrial, automotive, and communications. The company also generates significant cash flow, giving it capital allocation optionality for further M&amp;A and returning capital to shareholders.”Some of Ray Dalio's top technology stock picks include big tech names such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms, Inc.

If you want to read about some more active stocks, go directly to 5 Most Active Stocks to Buy Now.The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the United States registered modest growth during the third quarter of 2022, per latest figures by the US government, even as consumer spending slowed due to soaring inflation. The latest numbers add to fears of a looming recession but are also encouraging with regards to claims by top economic experts that the US economy might avoid a full-blown crisis despite rising rates and slowed growth. The Fed has indicated it will continue to hike rates till inflation is brought under control. These uncertain conditions have made the stock market more volatile, with even established names like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB) featuring among the most active stocks as investors dump growth for value. Michael Gapen, the chief US economist for Bank of America, recently told The New York Times that growth rates were slowing and “it wouldn’t take much further slowing from here to tip the economy into a recession”. Photo by Chris Liverani on UnsplashOur MethodologyThe companies that have high volumes were selected for the list. The analyst ratings of these firms and the latest updates related to them are also discussed to provide some additional context. Data from around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the second quarter of 2022 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm.Most Active Stocks to Buy Now12. SoFi Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SOFI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 22   Volume as of November 14: 46.25 millionSoFi Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SOFI) provides digital financial services. It is one of the most active stocks to buy now. On November 1, The company posted earnings for the third quarter of 2022, reporting losses per share of $1.05, beating market estimates by $0.01. The revenue over the period was $424 million, up 55.9% compared to the revenue over the same period last year and beating market estimates by $32.22 million.Story continuesOn September 14, BofA analyst Mihir Bhatia upgraded SoFi Technologies (NASDAQ:SOFI) stock to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $9, up from $8, noting that the company has a potential growth path over the next few quarters through high profile national football league marketing.  At the end of the second quarter of 2022, 22 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $337.6 million in SoFi Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SOFI), compared to 22 in the preceding quarter worth $475 million. Just like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB), SoFi Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SOFI) is one of the most active stocks to invest in.In its Q4 2021 investor letter, Altron Capital Management, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and SoFi Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SOFI) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“We have been building our position in SoFi over the last two quarters but have not yet written about our thesis until now. SoFi Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SOFI) is an online financial technology company that started off refinancing student loans. This segment remains a big part of the company’s business, but they have more recently expanded their products to offer an entire suite of financial services including personal banking, investing, and credit. While their collection of products is still evolving and not yet complete, we believe the company is in the early stages of its inflexion. The company nearly doubled its member count over the past year and is growing 50%+ despite its loan refinancing business taking a hit due to the COVID-related loan moratorium. Furthermore, the company is close to obtaining a bank charter through its acquisition of Golden Pacific Bancorp, a community bank based in Sacramento. A bank charter would allow SoFi to take in its customer deposits, lowering its cost of capital and expanding the company’s breadth of financial offerings.While SoFi is not the only online banking platform out there, we believe it could take a decent share of the financial services market. Banking is a notoriously sticky business, as the inconvenience and hassle of switching banks prevent consumers from jumping to competitors regardless of cost. This is one of the reasons that traditional banks are one of the few businesses to have truly been disrupted by technology. We think SoFi is well on its way to changing that and creating a new paradigm for the future of consumer banking and financial services (read more)11. NIO Inc. (NYSE:NIO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 25   Volume as of November 14: 66.94 million  NIO Inc. (NYSE:NIO) designs, develops, manufactures, and sells smart electric vehicles in China. It is one of the most active stocks to buy now. On October 27, Nio strengthened its strategic cooperation with SKF Automotive. SKF will be the preferred supplier of ceramic ball bearings and provide wide-ranging technical expertise to support NIO’s global expansion and product development plans.On October 28, investment advisory Barclays maintained an Overweight rating on NIO Inc. (NYSE:NIO) stock and lowered the price target to $19 from $34. Analyst Jiong Shao issued the ratings update. At the end of the second quarter of 2022, 25 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $873.9 million in NIO Inc. (NYSE:NIO), compared to 26 in the previous quarter worth $716 million.In its Q1 2022 investor letter, Horos Asset Management, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and NIO Inc. (NYSE:NIO) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“At the beginning of April, the CSRC (China Securities Regulatory Commission) announced possible changes in its regulation that would allow this inspection by foreign auditors, provided that the companies previously communicate to this body the state secrets that would be exposed, as well as the sensitive information that they might have to hand over, and the subsequent audit is carried out in a framework of collaboration with the CSRC. In short, a move in the direction desired by the SEC, although still far from the optimal result, that is, unrestricted access to information. While these negotiations between the two regulatory bodies are progressing, Chinese companies have to decide how best to preserve their interests. Other entities, such as the electric vehicle manufacturer NIO Inc. (NYSE:NIO), have just started trading on this stock market.”10. Vale S.A. (NYSE:VALE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 27    Volume as of November 14: 51.76 million    Vale S.A. (NYSE:VALE) produces and sells iron ore and iron ore pellets for use as raw materials in steelmaking. It is one of the most active stocks to buy now. On November 1, Vale disclosed that it has signed a memorandum of understanding with Saudi Arabia’s National Development Center to study the development of a 4 million metric tons per year iron ore pellet plant in Ras Al Khair.On October 5, Deutsche Bank analyst Liam Fitzpatrick maintained a Hold rating on Vale S.A. (NYSE:VALE) stock and lowered the price target to $19 from $20, noting that the reduced targets in the prices and earnings estimates of metals and mining reflect weakening demand and macro risks.At the end of the second quarter of 2022, 27 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $1.8 billion in Vale S.A. (NYSE:VALE), compared to 27 in the previous quarter worth $2.4 billion.9. Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 44 Volume as of November 14: 58.82 million      Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP) operates as a camera company in North America, Europe, and internationally. It is one of the most active stocks to buy now. On October 27, Snapchat said that it is giving users more powerful video tools through a new feature called Director Mode. The mode is available for all iOS users and with limited Android availability. People can use Director Mode to make content to share with friends and post in the spotlight.On October 21, Canaccord analyst Maria Ripps maintained a Hold rating on Snap Inc.

(NYSE:SNAP), compared to 54 in the previous quarter worth $2.7 billion.In its Q3 2022 investor letter, RiverPark Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP) shares were our top detractor for the quarter on its July decline from weaker revenue growth relative to guidance (which had been reduced in May) and the fact that management did not provide an outlook for 3Q. Shares subsequently rebounded somewhat as the company announced better-than-expected near-term revenue growth while announcing a broad-based cost restructuring.Although the company continues to face near-term macro headwinds and difficult year-over-year comparisons from COVID-fueled quarters last year, we believe SNAP can reaccelerate its revenue growth to greater than 20% annually over the next several years. With TTM revenue of $4.5 billion (as compared with Meta’s $120 billion), 347 million daily average users (about 1/10 of Meta’s), and $14 TTM ARPU (about 1/3 of Meta’s), we believe SNAP has a long runway for both revenue growth and expanded profitability as it improves its platform functionality, continues to grow its audience (daily active users continue to grow at a double-digit rate), and expands its monetization.”8. Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 46  Volume as of November 14: 66.59 million        Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) designs, manufactures, markets, and services a range of Ford vehicles.

Here is what the fund said:“Ford (NYSE:F) is another example of a typical industrial manufacturing business executive mindset. April 18, 2022, Bloomberg Businessweek cover story features Ford CEO Jim Farley behind the wheel of an electrified Ford F-150 Lightning. The article is titled, “Hey Elon, THIS is a truck.” I thought the article was terrific. One idea especially stood out to me. Since the F-150 is such a popular vehicle, it “argued for a gradual approach to electrification. Essentially the company retrofitted an existing F-150 with an electric powertrain rather than develop an entirely new truck.” No all-in financial and operation bet by this company on electrification.”7. Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 69    Volume as of November 14:  19.36 millionMicron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) designs, manufactures, and sells memory and storage products worldwide. It is one of the most active stocks to buy now. On September 12, Sanjay Mehrotra, the CEO of the firm, told news agency Reuters that the company was breaking ground on the newly announced $15 billion factory in Idaho and would unveil another US-based plant soon.

(NASDAQ:MU) stock lowered the price target to $75 from $90, noting the setup into the fourth quarter results of the firm was negative. At the end of the second quarter of 2022, 69 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $2.2 billion in Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU), compared to 78 in the preceding quarter worth $3.4 billion.In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Meridian Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) is a leader in the production of DRAM and NAND memory. We invested in the stock in the third quarter of 2019 during a cyclical downturn in the memory industry. Our rationale was that, while the memory industry is cyclical, we believed there are strong secular drivers in place that will lead to higher peaks and long-term growth. Our secular thesis is based on our conviction that the quest for ever-increasing compute speeds will increasingly rely on memory to solve bottlenecks and that increased memory content in nearly everything from mobile phones to automobiles will drive demand. Micron’s stock traded lower during the quarter due to macroeconomic concerns that led to lower earnings expectations. We increased our stake in the company, as we believe our secular thesis remains intact. We wanted to take advantage of what we view as temporary cyclical concerns that caused the stock to trade at less than 10x reasonable trough earnings per share (EPS) estimates and less than 7x recent peak EPS.”6. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 72    Volume as of November 14: 87.11 millionTesla, Inc.

(NASDAQ:TSLA), compared to 80 in the preceding quarter worth $11.3 billion. Alongside Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB), Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is one of the most active stocks to invest in.In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Baron Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“In 2014, before we began to invest in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), I called Roger to ask whether he thought Elon Musk’s electric car business would succeed. I did not believe that Roger, an owner of dealerships that sell cars powered by internal combustion engines (ICE) would likely have a favorable opinion of Tesla’s prospects. That was principally for two reasons:First, automobile manufacturing and distribution is unusually complicated, capital intensive, and highly regulated, which makes profitability problematic;second, cars with ICE motors require extensive annual maintenance, and dealer services revenues, not profits from automobile sales, are the most important contributor to profits of perpetual licensed ICE car dealerships.Penske Automotive Group is principally an ICE car dealer. Since electric cars are powered by batteries and need little service, franchised dealerships are incented to sell ICE, not EV automobiles. Further, Roger had been a long-term director of General Motors. General Motors’ ICE automobile business would be disrupted if Tesla were successful.

That would be a yield of 5%.Some argued that a 5% yield was too difficult to obtain and he would either make less or need a bigger portfolio in order to get it.Is it really that difficult to get a yield of 5% through stock investments?What’s a Dividend Aristocrat?There are ways to screen for stocks that pay dividends over 4% or 5%. But that doesn’t tell you the whole story. If an investor is looking to get income, they want to be sure that the income is going to be paid consistently every quarter, or year, and that the dividend won’t be cut.One way to cut through the noise, is to search for “dividend aristocrats.” This is a category of companies that pay dividends, but are called aristocrats, because they are among the elite few who have paid the dividend, uninterrupted for more than a decade, AND who have also increased the dividend payout during that time period.Story continuesThis isn’t easy to do, especially with events like the financial crisis and the coronavirus pandemic throwing the economy into a tailspin.There are no “sure things” in investing, but the companies who have paid, and grown, their dividends over the last two decades have proven their commitment to their shareholders.5 Dividend Aristocrats Still Raising Their Payouts1.       Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.

You can skip our detailed analysis of Dalio's investment strategy and his hedge fund's performance in the past, and go directly to read Billionaire Ray Dalio's Top 5 Dividend Stocks.Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates is one of the largest hedge funds in the world. The firm uses a principled-based approach and focuses on distinctive approaches for experienced institutional investors around the globe. Dalio’s investment strategy revolves around the diversification of portfolios, as investments in different industries and asset classes reduce risks in different market situations. His ‘All Weather’ strategy is a testament to the fluctuating market conditions, like the one we are facing today. Recently, Dalio stepped down from running Bridgewater Associates and announced to remain on the fund’s board and public research team. As of November, the billionaire’s real-time net worth stands at $19.1 billion, according to Forbes.The continuous hike in interest rates this year has seasoned as well as retail investors worried about the future of the market. In one of his interviews with Business Insider this September, Dalio spoke about the trend of interest rate hikes. He said that higher interest rates will result in the slowdown of the economy in 2023, with the S&amp;P 500 falling about another 20%. He further asserted that a well-balanced portfolio is one of the most reliable ways to ride out the stock market downturn.Over the years, Bridgewater Associates has delivered solid returns to shareholders. According to a report by Bloomberg, the firm’s flagship fund Pure Alpha II delivered an annual average return of 11.4% since its inception in 1991 through June 2022. In the first half of the year, the flagship fund returned 32% due to increased economic volatility. Another report by Business Insider revealed that Bridgewater Associates gained 25% this year through September.Story continuesAs of the end of Q3 2022, Bridgewater Associates’ 13F portfolio had a value of over $19.7 billion, down from $23.5 billion in the preceding quarter.

The company is the fund's important holding alongside Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META).Appreciating the company's strong fiscal Q4 earnings, Street analysts presented a positive outlook on Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) in November. Both Evercore ISI and Citigroup raised their price targets on the stock to $97 and $93, respectively.At the end of Q2 2022, Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) was a part of 55 hedge fund portfolios, compared with 58 in the previous quarter.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Starbucks, which garners a lower weighting in the Portfolio, had slightly better than average three-month performance. Samestore sales were up double-digits in the U.S. and International exChina, with solid revenue growth across those regions. The company is experiencing cost pressures from wages and input costs though, and China same-store sales were down 23% due to zero-COVID policy restrictions and lockdowns.”9. CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS)Bridgewater Associates’ Stake Value: $293,711,000 Dividend Yield as of November 16: 2.25%CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) is an American healthcare company that owns retail pharmacies and also provides health insurance services to its consumers. The company has been a part of Bridgewater Associates' portfolio since the third quarter of 2012 when the hedge fund opened its position with shares worth $2.7 million. During Q3 2022, the fund reduced its position in the company by 3% which takes its total CVS stake worth $293.7 million. The company represented 1.48% of billionaire Ray Dalio's portfolio.On September 22, CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.55 per share, in line with its previous dividend.

The collective value of these stakes is over $2.03 billion.Vltava Fund mentioned CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“CVS is a leader in the provision of healthcare services in the USA. It has three main businesses: an enormous network of pharmacies, a health insurance company, and “prescription benefit management”, which is a kind of intermediary between insurance companies and pharmacies. This is the result of large acquisitions over the past 15 years – most notably of Caremark (2007) and Aetna (2018). The markets had deemed its acquisition of health insurer Aetna too expensive (and we agree), so CVS stock then fell into disfavour for a few years.We took advantage of this in the summer of 2020 and brought the stock into our portfolio at a time when its price was pressed down still further by the coronavirus pandemic. CVS is a giant. It has revenues of USD 300 billion, making it one of the largest companies in the world. It is a relatively stable and highly profitable company with strong free cash flow. Over the past few years, CVS has focused primarily on reducing debt.This is already much lower than it had been after the Aetna acquisition, and most of the cash is now likely to go to shareholders through share buybacks or be used for smaller acquisitions to grow the company further. CVS trades at about 11 times annual earnings, which is a very appealing valuation given the expected future growth in profitability and overall modest cyclicality in its business.”8. Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT)Bridgewater Associates’ Stake Value: $298,016,000 Dividend Yield as of November 16: 1.81%Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is a Chicago-based medical device company that also offers other medical services to its patients across the globe.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Also among our bottom contributors were health care products manufacturer Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), global pharmaceutical company Pfizer, media and technology giant Alphabet, and insurance company American International Group (AIG).Abbott has been working through a recall of its infant formula brand Similac in the US, which has continued to pressure its share price. Although the recall will impact near-term revenues, we are not concerned about any long-term impacts. We remain optimistic about the company given it is one of the highest quality names in health care, in our view, with a talented management team that makes smart capital allocation decisions. Abbott also has leading health care and consumer franchises with a particularly strong competitive position in its medical device business. The company continues to launch innovative products in key strategic areas (such as diabetes, structural heart, and diagnostics), which should help drive not only revenue growth but margin expansion.”7.

That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6%[2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.” Click to continue reading and see Billionaire Ray Dalio's Top 5 Dividend Stocks. Suggested articles:20 Biggest Electric Vehicle Companies in the WorldTop 10 Hospitality Companies in the World15 Biggest Movie Production Companies in the WorldDisclosure.

In the past, the promotion has led to long lines and stores quickly running out of the cups.The workers say they are underpaid and don't have consistent schedules. They are also protesting firings, store closures and other actions they say are illegal retaliation by Starbucks against them for unionizing.""They're working us to the bone because we're so understaffed,"" said barista Aaron Cirillo, 23, as he marched with at least a dozen others outside of a combined Starbucks Pickup and Amazon Go location in New York City's midtown Manhattan.Starbucks has nearly 9,000 corporate-owned U.S. locations. On ""Red Cup Day"" in November 2021, visits to U.S. Starbucks stores jumped 87% over the daily average for the full year, according to exclusive data from location analytics firm Placer.ai.Starbucks has said it respects employees' right to organize, that store closings were due to safety concerns and that fired employees violated company policies. The company and union have accused each other of stalling bargaining.The Seattle-based chain did not respond to a request for comment.In August, the National Labor Relations Board ordered Starbucks to rehire some fired baristas who were union activists. Earlier this week, the labor board also asked a federal judge for an injunction to prohibit Starbucks from interfering with union elections.In just over the past year, about 260 U.S. locations have voted to join the union. Dozens of them began bargaining last month.Outside the Manhattan location, striking workers held signs reading ""no contract, no coffee"" and chanted ""two jobs, one worker"" to protest having to staff both the Starbucks and Amazon Go areas at their location.Story continuesCirillo, who makes $17.05 an hour and has worked at the store for over a year, said his store petitioned to unionize last month and is slated to vote on Dec. 8.He said he initially did not want to unionize out of fear of retaliation but became angry after waiting in vain for the company to boost benefits and fix equipment in the store.""This is a hostile environment and we have to do something about it,"" he said.(Reporting by Hilary Russ; Editing by Leslie Adler, Jonathan Oatis and Deepa Babington)]"

The company manufactures, distributes, and sells various lines of tires for automobiles, trucks, buses, aircrafts, motorcycles, earthmoving equipment, and mining and industrial equipment under the Goodyear, Cooper, Dunlop, Kelly, Debica, Sava, Fulda, Mastercraft, and Roadmaster brands. Story continuesSecurities filings for the third quarter of 2022 reveal that Ken Fisher added The Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Company (NASDAQ:GT) to his portfolio by acquiring 2.80 million shares worth $28.3 million, representing 0.02% of the total holdings. On October 31, The Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Company (NASDAQ:GT) reported Q3 non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.07, beating Wall Street estimates by $0.52. The revenue climbed 7.7% year-over-year to $5.31 billion but missed market forecasts by $30 million. Deutsche Bank analyst Emmanuel Rosner on November 2 maintained a Hold rating on The Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Company (NASDAQ:GT) but lowered the price target on the shares to $10 from $14.

With substantial exposure to the automotive industry through other portfolio holdings, we elected to consolidate our exposure within those higher-conviction holdings.""9. Nordstrom, Inc. (NYSE:JWN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 31Fisher Asset Management’s Stake Value: $28,921,000Nordstrom, Inc. (NYSE:JWN) is a Washington-based fashion retailer that manufactures and markets apparel, footwear, beauty products, accessories, and home goods through Nordstrom branded stores and online channels. In Q3 2022, Ken Fisher purchased 1.7 million shares of Nordstrom, Inc. (NYSE:JWN) worth about $29 million. In mid-October, Nordstrom, Inc. (NYSE:JWN) reiterated its previously forecast FY22 adjusted EPS of $2.30 to $2.60 and revenue growth of 5% to 7%. Market consensus for EPS stood at $2.34 and $15.58 billion for sales.On November 14, Deutsche Bank analyst Gabriella Carbone reaffirmed a Hold rating on Nordstrom, Inc. (NYSE:JWN) but trimmed the price target on the shares to $22 from $23 ahead of the Q3 results. The analyst believes investor sentiment will remain largely negative on the apparel retail sector until there is improved visibility around inventory and consumer demand heading into fiscal 2023.Among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, Nordstrom, Inc. (NYSE:JWN) was part of 31 public stock portfolios at the end of Q2 2022, compared to 29 in the prior quarter. Paul Marshall and Ian Wace’s Marshall Wace LLP is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 5.4 million shares worth $115.70 million. Here is what Mayar Capital specifically said about Nordstrom, Inc. (NYSE:JWN) in its second quarter 2022 investor letter:“The second thought experiment comes from my own personal experience in the period around the financial crisis. In 2006 I made an investment in the shares of Nordstrom, Inc. (NYSE:JWN). Over the following three-and-a-half years, the stock was up by 36%, outperforming the S&amp;P 500 by a very respectable 41.4%. A fund made up of a single holding in Nordstrom would have ranked in the top 1% of all funds in the Morningstar database.However, Nordstrom stock declined by a very painful 80% during 2008. A single-stock fund would have almost certainly liquidated during that drawdown, taking investors out of the game and ending any hope of them ever realizing the return. But because my portfolio was diversified, it held its value a bit better (it declined by 25% while the market was down by 38%), allowing me to sell some holdings and redeploy money into investments like Nordstrom that had declined severely.”8. KB Financial Group Inc. (NYSE:KB)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 6Fisher Asset Management’s Stake Value: $30,393,000KB Financial Group Inc. (NYSE:KB) is headquartered in Seoul, and the company provides banking and financial services to consumers and enterprises in South Korea and internationally.

Peter Rathjens, Bruce Clarke, and John Campbell’s Arrowstreet Capital is the biggest position holder in the company, with 774,872 shares valued at $28.8 million.7. Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 35Fisher Asset Management’s Stake Value: $34,995,000Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH) is headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio, and the company manufactures and sells motion and control technologies and systems for various mobile, industrial, and aerospace markets worldwide. In the third quarter of 2022, Ken Fisher opened a new position in Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH) by purchasing 144,423 shares worth nearly $35 million. On October 26, Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH) declared a quarterly dividend of $1.33 per share, in line with previous. The dividend is distributable on December 2, to shareholders of record on November 14. Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH)’s dividend yield on November 15 came in at 1.71%. Citi analyst Timothy Thein on October 14 resumed coverage of Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH) with a Neutral rating and a $285 price target, suggesting 12% total return potential. The analyst expects less earnings volatility compared to past cycles, but said it will likely take some time for Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH) to prove this to investors. Further weakening in manufacturing data may result in a more attractive entry point for the stock, the analyst told investors in a research note.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 35 hedge funds were bullish on Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH) at the end of Q2 2022, compared to 39 funds in the prior quarter. Andreas Halvorsen’s Viking Global is the leading position holder in the company, with more than 3 million shares worth $755.5 million. Here is what Oakmark Fund specifically said about Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH) in its second quarter 2022 investor letter:“Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH), a U.S. company that specializes in motion and control technologies, is suffering from what we believe are investor misunderstandings and misjudgments, despite the efforts of the company’s unusually strong management team. In our opinion, since his promotion in 2015, CEO Thomas Williams has vastly improved operations and shifted the product portfolio to longer cycled, higher growth, higher margin and higher return end markets. The results are impressive. Margins, returns and earnings have increased substantially. With the expected closing of the Meggitt acquisition in the September quarter, the highly depressed aerospace segment will be its largest end market. We anticipate a rebound in aerospace revenue, which—combined with the company’s strong position in attractive businesses, including clean technologies and factory automation—should accelerate revenue growth. Parker Hannifin trades at a discount to other high-quality industrials, which we believe is unwarranted since its growth and returns should be similar or better. At a low-teens multiple of next year’s normalized cash earnings, Parker Hannifin is an attractive investment, in our view.”6. The Gap, Inc. (NYSE:GPS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 27Fisher Asset Management’s Stake Value: $40,212,000The Gap, Inc. (NYSE:GPS) is a California-based apparel retail company that sells its products under the Old Navy, Gap, Banana Republic, and Athleta brands. Ken Fisher added The Gap, Inc.

(NYSE:GPS) to $8 from $7 and kept a Sell rating on the shares. The analyst expects the company's Q3 results to miss the consensus comp estimate of 3% and deliver a softer than expected gross margin.Among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 27 funds reported owning stakes worth $234.3 million in The Gap, Inc. (NYSE:GPS) at the end of June 2022, compared to 23 funds in the earlier quarter worth $247.7 million. Richard S.

Stocks that can weather storms and offer dividends are a bonus. In relation to trading and investing in this year’s market environment, most want to know how the company’s stock can hold up amid higher inflation.Let’s take a look at three highly ranked Zacks stocks that are also Dividend Aristocrats, raising their dividends for at least 25 consecutive years. These stocks should help investors fight back against inflation and a market downturn.Archer Daniels Midland ADMArcher Daniels is a leading producer of food and beverage ingredients and goods made from agricultural products. Commodity prices have been high along with inflation, making companies that produce them the beneficiaries. To that note, Archer Daniels produces oilseeds, corn, wheat, cocoa, and more. The company also engages in the manufacturing, sale, and distribution of natural flavor ingredients, flavor systems, natural colors, proteins, emulsifiers, soluble fiber, polyols, hydrocolloids, and natural health and nutrition products.Dividend History: ADM has a 1.69% annual dividend yield at $1.60 a share. The annualized dividend growth over the last five years is 4.12%. ADM currently has a 22% payout ratio and has raised its dividend for 49 consecutive years.ADM sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) with EPS estimates on the rise, and the Agriculture-Operations Industry currently ranks in the top 27% of Zacks industries.Archer Daniels earnings are expected to climb 42% to $7.40 a share in 2022, based on Zacks estimates. Fiscal 2023 earnings are expected to decline -14% after a tough-to-follow year but estimate revisions are largely up at $6.33 a share compared to $5.96 per share 90 days ago. Sales are set to jump 19% this year and slightly decline by -1% in FY23 to $100.50 billion.Year to date, ADM is up +41% to crush the S&amp;P 500’s -17%. ADM has also outperformed its Zacks Sub Industry, which is up +31% YTD.  Over the last five years, ADM is up an impressive +177% when including its dividend to also outperform the benchmark and its Zacks Sub Industry’s +84%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchArcher Daniels has been a leader in its industry. Trading around $95 a share, ADM has a forward P/E of 12.7X and below the industry average of 20.1X. Even better, ADM trades nicely below its decade-high of 20.5X and the median of 14.6X.ADM has beaten EPS expectations for 14 consecutive quarters. The Average Zacks Price Target still suggests 5% upside from current levels in addition to a reliable dividend.Genuine Parts GPCThe Automotive-Replacement Parts Industry is in the top 35% of all Zacks industries making Genuine Parts worth a look for dividend seekers. The dividend aristocrat is a leader in its space, distributing automotive and industrial replacement parts and materials. Despite the challenging sales environment for the auto industry, GPC should have pricing power during high inflation with auto parts and materials always needed for the industry in some form.Dividend History: GPC has a 1.97% annual dividend yield at $3.58 a share. Genuine Parts’ dividend growth over the last five years is 5.13% with a payout ratio of 44%. GPC has raised its dividend for 66 consecutive years.GPC stock is up an impressive 29% YTD vs its peer groups -17% drop. Over the last five years, GPC’s total return is +143% outperforming the benchmark and its peer group at +2%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTrading around $180 a share GPC recently hit 52-week highs. GPC has a forward P/E of 22.3X, above the industry average of 14.2X. However, GPC has been a leader in its industry and trades slightly below its decade-high of 23.4X. What is intriguing for the stock is the rising earnings estimates.According to Zacks estimates, GPC earnings are expected to jump +18% to $8.16 a share in 2022. Fiscal 2023 earnings are expected to be up another 6%. Top line growth is expected as well with sales up 16% this year and another 2% in FY23 to $22.42 billion.GPC sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) with rising EPS revisions and solid growth expected despite a tougher operating environment. GPC has also beaten EPS expectations for 10 consecutive quarters.Exxon Mobil XOMOil conglomerate Exxon Mobil (XOM) is well known for its dividend and has the highest yield on this Aristocratic list as well. Exxon Mobil is a premier integrated energy company with three main segments: Upstream (oil &amp; production), Downstream (refining), and Chemical (manufacturing &amp; marketing petrochemicals).With the price of oil staying near $90 a barrel, XOM should be able to offer some defensive protection for investors during stretches of high volatility. This has been the case for most of the year.Dividend History: XOM has a 3.19% annual dividend yield at $3.64 a share. Exxon Mobil’s annualized dividend growth over the last five years is 2.43% with a payout ratio of 28%. Exxon Mobil has raised its dividend for 40 consecutive years.Exxon Mobil’s YTD performance has continued to impressively outperform the benchmark and its peers. XOM’s total return is a stellar +91% YTD vs. the Oil-Gas- International Integrated Markets +59%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTrading around $112 a share, XOM shares recently hit 52-week highs as well. XOM has a forward P/E of 8.2X. This is above its industry average of 4.7X, but still below the S&amp;P 500 at 18.4X. And XOM is a proven industry leader. Better still, XOM is trading at a discount to its decade median of 17.7X and well off its highs of 349.5X.According to Zacks estimates, XOM earnings are now expected to jump 159% to $13.92 a share in 2022. Fiscal 2023 earnings are expected to be down -21%, but earnings estimate revisions are rising once again. Exxon Mobil’s sales are projected to be up 49% this year, but down -7% in FY23 to $396.28 billion following an excellent year.  With top and bottom line growth continuing to increase for the current year, XOM is sporting a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Exxon Mobil’s Oil and Gas -Integrated- International Industry is also in the top 15% of over 250 Zack Industries.Bottom LinePositive earnings estimate revisions, along with reliable income from these Dividend Aristocrats make them suitable investments to consider. These stocks are having strong YTD performances despite the challenging economic environment and may be able to sustain these runs. Outside of income investing, these three Dividend Aristocrats could also be an option for diversification in the portfolio.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Archer Daniels Midland ADM, Carter Bankshares CARE, W.R. Berkley WRB, Lamb Weston LW and AeroVironment AVAV.Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:5 Stocks to Play a Topsy-Turvy Wall StreetMajor stock indexes in the United States posted their biggest gains in months last week on signs of inflation moderating. Soft inflation data, undeniably, bolstered expectations among investors that there could be a shift in the Federal Reserve’s present hawkish stance, which is unfavorably impacting consumers’ spending habits and deterring economic growth.For the week, the broader S&amp;P 500 jumped almost 6%, while the tech-laden Nasdaq climbed around 8%. Similarly, the Dow notched a gain of more than 5% for the week and is apparently on track to register its best October on record. After all, the consumer price index, a primary inflation barometer, logged its smallest 12-month jump last month since January.However, stocks at large snapped last week’s winning streak, with all the major bourses closing in the negative territory on Nov 14. This is because Fed governor Christopher J. Waller cautioned that the Fed’s fight to curb inflation has “ways to go.”Waller believes that investors have overreacted to the inflation data. And rightly so, since prices of household staple items like food, shelter and energy continue to rise at a record pace, as mentioned by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics last week.A New York Fed’s monthly survey also added that inflation is projected to rise to 5.9% on worries that there can be an unforeseen jump in gasoline prices in the near term. Respondents expect gas prices to jump 4.8% next year. In fact, the survey’s three-year as well as five-year inflation outlook also accelerated.Story continuesThus, the Fed could easily tighten its monetary policy further, leading to higher borrowing costs and further gyration in the stock market. Lest we forget, the stock market did rally in the months of July and August on hopes that the Fed may slow down its rate hikes.However, Fed Chair Jerome Powell had clarified that the Fed isn’t going to back down on its commitment to fight inflation, which is anyhow way ahead of its target of 2%. This eventually led to higher bouts of market volatility.Hence, with the broader stock market struggling for direction as investors continue to gauge the Fed’s policy path, it’s prudent to invest in stocks that offer risk-adjusted returns at this point in time. Stocks that are less volatile than the markets they trade in, or in other words, low beta stocks (ranges from 0 to 1) have been considered.But low-beta stocks provide fewer returns. Therefore, stocks that offer positive earnings estimate revisions, predominantly in the past two-month period, have also been well thought-out.

The award, one of Field to Market’s Sustainability Leadership Awards, recognizes an outstanding collaboration and cross-sector partnership in advancing continuous improvement in sustainable agriculture at the field and landscape level.The project, ""Supporting Nebraska Farmers to Boost Resiliency Via Cover Cropping,"" provides farmers with technical assistance, peer support networks and cost share payments for implementing cover crops. Since the start of the project in 2021, farmers participating in the project have planted more than the partnership’s goal of 15,000 acres of cover crops. This initiative not only supports the agricultural communities financially, but also the overall health of the direct and surrounding ecosystems; cover crops are used to prevent erosion, improve soil and water quality, maintain high nutrient levels in soil, eliminate weeds, and serve as livestock nourishment.""ADM unites the entire supply chain. Through major regenerative agriculture partnerships and on-the-ground engagement with growers and suppliers, ADM is committed to building a more sustainable food system,"" said Alison Taylor, Chief Sustainability Officer at ADM. ""ADM is also committed to reducing our Scope 3 emissions as part of a holistic approach to addressing climate challenges. Because the majority of our Scope 3 emissions come from the farming that happens upstream – and from the ingredient processing that occurs by our customers downstream – it is important to collaborate with our growers and customers to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.""In total, ADM has initiated 18 Field to Market projects that span across 13 U.S. states and 2 Canadian provinces, focused on corn, soy, and wheat production.

These projects are part of ADM’s broader sustainable agriculture initiatives, which have enrolled over 750,000 total acres of land in the U.S. in the transition to regenerative agriculture practices and are creating long-term market opportunities for farmers.Story continuesFarmers have always been stewards of the land, and ADM is proud to partner with them and other companies to do more to advance regenerative agricultural practices that sequester carbon, promote biodiversity, support a holistic approach to ecological health, and increase farm resiliency to feed the world more sustainably.About ADMADM unlocks the power of nature to enrich the quality of life.

77,97acfd7a-04ad-3e74-aa61-9dd10b3ffb8b,SNPS,2022-11-17,We Ran A Stock Scan For Earnings Growth And Synopsys (NASDAQ:SNPS) Passed With Ease,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ran-stock-scan-earnings-growth-175110335.html,1668621070,STORY,['SNPS'],"[Investors are often guided by the idea of discovering 'the next big thing', even if that means buying 'story stocks' without any revenue, let alone profit. Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like Synopsys (NASDAQ:SNPS), which has not only revenues, but also profits. Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide Synopsys with the means to add long-term value to shareholders. See our latest analysis for Synopsys How Quickly Is Synopsys Increasing Earnings Per Share?The market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so you'd expect share price to follow earnings per share (EPS) outcomes eventually. That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. Shareholders will be happy to know that Synopsys' EPS has grown 17% each year, compound, over three years. If the company can sustain that sort of growth, we'd expect shareholders to come away satisfied.Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. The good news is that Synopsys is growing revenues, and EBIT margins improved by 5.0 percentage points to 24%, over the last year. Ticking those two boxes is a good sign of growth, in our book.You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. For finer detail, click on the image.earnings-and-revenue-historyIn investing, as in life, the future matters more than the past. So why not check out this free interactive visualization of Synopsys' forecast profits?Story continuesAre Synopsys Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Owing to the size of Synopsys, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$296m. This comes in at 0.6% of shares in the company, which is a fair amount of a business of this size. So despite their percentage holding being low, company management still have plenty of reasons to deliver the best outcomes for investors.It's good to see that insiders are invested in the company, but are remuneration levels reasonable? Well, based on the CEO pay, you'd argue that they are indeed. The median total compensation for CEOs of companies similar in size to Synopsys, with market caps over US$8.0b, is around US$13m.Synopsys offered total compensation worth US$10.0m to its CEO in the year to October 2021. That is actually below the median for CEO's of similarly sized companies. While the level of CEO compensation shouldn't be the biggest factor in how the company is viewed, modest remuneration is a positive, because it suggests that the board keeps shareholder interests in mind. It can also be a sign of a culture of integrity, in a broader sense.Does Synopsys Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?You can't deny that Synopsys has grown its earnings per share at a very impressive rate. That's attractive. If that's not enough, consider also that the CEO pay is quite reasonable, and insiders are well-invested alongside other shareholders. Everyone has their own preferences when it comes to investing but it definitely makes Synopsys look rather interesting indeed. You should always think about risks though. Case in point, we've spotted   1 warning sign for Synopsys  you should be aware of.Although Synopsys certainly looks good, it may appeal to more investors if insiders were buying up shares.

80,2784e012-1729-3636-ae37-eec8be5274a4,LUV,2022-11-17,Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE:LUV) institutional owners may be pleased with recent gains after 19% loss over the past year,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/southwest-airlines-co-nyse-luv-152938794.html,1668612578,STORY,['LUV'],"[If you want to know who really controls Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE:LUV), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 76% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Last week's US$713m market cap gain would probably be appreciated by institutional investors, especially after a year of 19% losses.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Southwest Airlines. See our latest analysis for Southwest Airlines ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Southwest Airlines?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Southwest Airlines. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Southwest Airlines' historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Southwest Airlines. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 11%. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 8.9% and 6.8% of the stock.Story continuesAfter doing some more digging, we found that the top 12 have the combined ownership of 50% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Southwest AirlinesThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Southwest Airlines Co.. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$79m worth of shares (at current prices). In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 24% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Southwest Airlines. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Southwest Airlines better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 1 warning sign  with Southwest Airlines , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.If you would prefer discover what analysts are predicting in terms of future growth, do not miss this free report on analyst forecasts.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

(NYSE:PM) boasts of strong institutional backing",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/77-ownership-philip-morris-international-130025923.html,1668603625,STORY,['PM'],"[Every investor in Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 77% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Philip Morris International, beginning with the chart below. See our latest analysis for Philip Morris International ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Philip Morris International?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Philip Morris International. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Philip Morris International's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Philip Morris International. Capital Research and Management Company is currently the company's largest shareholder with 15% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 8.5% and 6.5% of the stock.Story continuesLooking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 51% of the ownership is controlled by the top 17 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Philip Morris InternationalWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our information suggests that Philip Morris International Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$242m of stock. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 23% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. For example, we've discovered 1 warning sign for Philip Morris International that you should be aware of before investing here.Ultimately the future is most important.

Rising household energy bills and food prices pushed British inflation to a 41-year high. That's according to data published a day before finance minister, Jeremy Hunt is expected to announce tax hikes and spending cuts, to control price growth.Consumer prices rose 11.1% from the prior year. That is the biggest increase since October, 1981, and a big jump from September as well. That's according to the UK's Office for National Statistics. Energy prices could have been even higher if former Prime Minister Liz Young didn't cap energy bills to no more than 2,500 pounds per year.NASA launched its multibillion dollar next generation Artemis One rocket from Florida, for its debut test flight just today at 1:47 AM Eastern time. The launch comes 50 years after the final Apollo moon mission, and kicks off the next chapter for NASA. That's the Artemis exploration program. The goal is to return astronauts to the moon as early as 2025, to establish a long-term lunar base and staging ground for manned missions to Mars. The program has enlisted commercial partners like Elon Musk's SpaceX, and space agencies of Europe, Canada, and Japan.And Goldman Sachs paid over $12 million in a settlement with a veteran executive who complained internally about a toxic workplace for women in the upper ranks of the Wall Street firm. This, according to ""Bloomberg."" The executive alleged that senior executives-- including CEO, David Solomon-- made vulgar comments about women. Goldman Sachs has disputed the reporting, claiming there are factual errors. However, ""Bloomberg"" says that it stands by that report.]"

(NASDAQ:MAT) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:""Toy and IP company Mattel, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAT) was also a detractor in the quarter. There was very little Mattel-specific news in the quarter beyond another solid quarter of execution. No news was bad news, however, as previous rumors of a sale of the company have not yet come to fruition. This is understandable in the current environment where deals are harder to get done. As the overall macro picture deteriorated, the market also came to doubt that Mattel can generate the $2+/share of free cash flow that it believes is possible in the near term. The good news is that Mattel remains a historically defensive business, and there is zero in the stock price today for IP monetization success, which is closer than ever with items like a new Barbie movie in 2023 and multiple projects in the pipeline.""Photo by Arunachal Art on UnsplashMattel, Inc.

96,f51bc623-2da6-3920-9065-f3136178027c,NFLX,2022-11-17,"An Intrinsic Calculation For Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) Suggests It's 22% Undervalued",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intrinsic-calculation-netflix-inc-nasdaq-110039438.html,1668682839,STORY,['NFLX'],"[Today we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) as an investment opportunity by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. View our latest analysis for Netflix The ModelWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$1.98bUS$3.30bUS$4.80bUS$6.63bUS$8.04bUS$9.29bUS$10.4bUS$11.2bUS$12.0bUS$12.6bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x17Analyst x14Analyst x10Analyst x4Est @ 21.28%Est @ 15.49%Est @ 11.44%Est @ 8.6%Est @ 6.61%Est @ 5.22% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.2% US$1.8kUS$2.9kUS$3.9kUS$5.0kUS$5.7kUS$6.1kUS$6.4kUS$6.5kUS$6.4kUS$6.3k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$51bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.2%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$13b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.2%– 2.0%) = US$248bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$248b÷ ( 1 + 7.2%)10= US$124bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$175b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$306, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 22% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Netflix as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.012. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Moving On:Whilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price?

The company expects this threat to persist in the upcoming quarters as well and since the Roku channel’s revenues are solely dependent on ads, it might hurt its top line.It also faces immense competition from existing local traditional pay-TV services and products, including those provided by incumbent pay-TV service providers and mobile streaming platforms.Roku, which currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), has lost 74.1% of its share price year to date compared with the Zacks Consumer Discretionary Sector, which declined 34.5% in the same time frame.Roku also faces stiff competition from Netflix NFLX and Disney DIS, which have extensive content portfolios and strong brand identities.Netflix was down 48.5% whereas Disney lost 38.3% year to date. Both Disney and Netflix are set to launch their ad-tier subscriptions for customers by the end of this year. This low-cost subscription is expected to gain traction with consumers.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks hereWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

A copy of the same can be downloaded here. In the third quarter, the fund underperformed its benchmark index. Its Investor Class fund ARTLX returned -7.04%, Advisor Class fund APDLX posted a return of -7.07%, and Institutional Class fund APHLX returned -7.06% in the quarter, compared to a -5.62% return for the Russell 1000 Value Index. In addition, please check the fund’s top five holdings to know its best picks in 2022.In the third-quarter letter, Artisan Partners discussed stocks like Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX). Headquartered in Los Gatos, California, Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) is an entertainment services company. On November 14, 2022, Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)  stock closed at $299.27 per share. One-month return of Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) was 22.10% and its shares lost 55.95% of their value over the last 52 weeks. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) has a market capitalization of $133.181 billion.Artisan Partners made the following comment about Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:""Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals were two of our top contributors. Shares of Netflix got some relief after being under pressure in the first half of 2022. Media and entertainment stocks in general have been out of favor as investors grapple with the long-term economics of streaming services and slowing subscriber growth—what should be viewed as a normal feature of a maturing market. Our view is streaming is a scale and intellectual property business that will result in a few large winners, and we believe Netflix will be among this group. We initiated our position in Netflix in Q1 after shares fell by more than half due to concerns about subscriber growth and increasing competition from streaming upstarts. The stock then suffered a second down leg in April after the company reported subscriber losses for the first time in its history. Then in July, the company reported its second consecutive quarter of subscriber losses, but the nearly 1 million subscribers lost were much lower than the 2 million that management had forecast, and shares rallied on the news. For patient investors, there is reason for optimism that subscriber growth will turn around. The company has plans to crack down on password sharing and is launching a lower cost advertising supported tier. Our investment case is focused on an undemanding valuation, massive scale, a continued shift in time and attention from linear TV to streaming, and a financial condition which gives management the flexibility to operate unconstrained during a transition period for the business. We also believe Netflix can leverage its massive global scale of 200+ million subscribers into positive free cash flow though steady pricing increases and content spending controls.""Story continuesPhoto by Thibault Penin on UnsplashNetflix, Inc.

104,5f4e23cc-d51a-350f-9796-0f434ebe1f39,PSX,2022-11-17,Delek US Holdings (DK) Stock Rises 2% Despite Q3 Earnings Lag,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/delek-us-holdings-dk-stock-112411079.html,1668684251,STORY,"['DLEKG.TA', 'DK', 'PSX']","[Delek US Holdings’ DK stock has gone up 2.1% since its third-quarter 2022 results were announced on Nov 7. Despite the bottom-line lag, the rise could be attributed to better-than-expected sales in the reported quarter and a small hike in DK’s dividend.What Did Delek's Earnings Unveil?Delek US Holdings reported a third-quarter 2022 adjusted net income of 2 cents per share, underperforming the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 31 cents and also lower than the year-earlier profit of 13 cents. The underperformance could be attributed to unfavorable inventory valuation impacts.The diversified downstream energy company said that its adjusted EBITDA was $135.8 million compared with $101.9 million in the year-earlier period.Meanwhile, Delek’s revenues of $5.3 billion surged 80.1% year over year and beat the consensus mark by $1.25 billion, primarily due to soaring sales from its key Refining segment. Revenues from the unit came in at almost $4 billion, up 53.2% from the third quarter of 2021 and 21.2% more than the Zacks Consensus Estimate.In good news for investors, DK’s board of directors approved an increase of 1 cent per share in the regular dividend, bringing the quarterly dividend to 21 cents per share. The dividend will be paid out on Dec 2, 2022 to shareholders of record on Nov 18, 2022.Delek US Holdings, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseDelek US Holdings, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseDelek US Holdings, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Delek US Holdings, Inc. QuoteSegment DetailsRefining: The segment’s contribution margin (the refining margin minus operating expenses) increased from $82.1 million in the third quarter of 2021 to $106 million. However, the same lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $317 million.On a year-over-year basis, the refining segment’s results were negatively impacted by $225.1 million of inventory valuation impacts in the third quarter of 2022 compared with a $2.7 million unfavorable impact in the third quarter of 2021.In the third quarter of 2022, Delek’s benchmark crack spreads were up an average of about 79.3% from prior-year levels. However, the ongoing burden of the Renewable Fuel Standard program continues to negatively impact small refineries' ability to fully capture the crack spread.Story continuesLogistics: This unit represents Delek’s majority interest in Delek Logistics Partners, L.P., a publicly traded master limited partnership that owns, operates, develops and acquires pipelines and other midstream assets.The Logistics unit’s margin of $90.5 million was higher than the year-ago period’s income of $66.9 million and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $88 million. The segment benefited from robust refinery utilization and contributions from the 3Bear Energy acquisition.Retail: In the third quarter of 2022, the Retail segment — formed by the acquisition of Alon USA Energy in 2017 — had a contribution margin of $17.4 million compared with $17.9 million a year ago. Further, the margin failed to match the consensus mark of $19.12 million.Meanwhile, merchandise sales of $84.2 million were more than the third-quarter 2021 sales of $81.7 million and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 6.6%. However, the merchandise margin of 32.6% worsened from 33.7% in the year-ago period.In the third quarter, DK’s retail stations sold 44,729 thousand gallons of gasoline compared with 41,912 thousand gallons a year ago. There was a 6% rise in the retail fuel margin to 35 cents per gallon. However, these factors were more than offset by a lower store count (248 versus 250).Costs &amp; Balance SheetThe company’s total operating costs and expenses were $5.27 billion in the third quarter of 2022, up 80.6% from the year-ago quarter. This rise was primarily due to the higher cost of sales, which surged 82.7%.As of Sep 30, Delek US Holdings had cash and cash equivalents of $1.15 billion and long-term debt of $2.67 billion, with debt-to-total capital of about 67.5%.GuidanceDelek projects the fourth-quarter 2022 crude oil throughput to average between 280,000 and 290,000 barrels per day or roughly 94% utilization at the midpoint.For full-year 2022, the company expects capital expenditures of approximately $300 million. DK expects additional repurchases of approximately $75 to $100 million of its common stock in the fourth quarter of 2022.Zacks Rank &amp; Other Stocks to ConsiderDelek US Holdings currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Maxx, Marshalls, and Sierra banners in the U.S., were up 3% in the quarter to $7.455 billion, driven mostly by apparel. This gain was offset by a 14% decline to $1.948 billion in the company’s HomeGoods division. These results brought total net sales for the U.S. down 1% to $9.403 billion in Q3.As for the company’s international divisions, TJX Canada posted a 1% decline in net sales to $1.285 billion in the quarter, while TJX International – which includes Europe and Australia – saw a 16% decrease to $1.479 billion.But this sales miss didn’t discourage the street. At the time of press, shares for TJX were up 4.94%.On the company’s earnings call on Wednesday, president and CEO Ernie Herrman was confident that the retailer is well positioned for the holiday season. “The marketplace is absolutely loaded with quality branded merchandise across good, better and best brands,” he told investors. “Importantly, this has set us up very well to offer an excellent assortment of branded gifts this holiday season that we believe will excite and inspire our shoppers.”Herrman also noted that the company is focusing even more this holiday season on fresh flowing branded goods that are gift-oriented coming in later than normal, which, he said, is going to “bode well” for Q4 sales, especially in the last week or two right before Christmas.Story continuesMoving to inventory, Herrman noted that the company’s balance sheet inventory was up 26% versus the third quarter last year. Total inventories as at the end of Q3 were $8.3 billion, compared with $6.6 billion at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2022. “This is higher than we expected due to early receipts of merchandise as the supply chain continued to improve,” the CEO said.Looking ahead, TJX is now planning total sales in the range of $49.3 billion to $49.5 billion.

If you want to read about some more clothing companies, go directly to Top 5 Clothing Companies in the World in 2022.In the backdrop of the increasing uncertainty in the global economic environment, the clothing industry has managed to hold itself together successfully and is forecasted to grow even faster in future. With intense competitive rivalry in the industry, the leading companies have continued to provide product differentiation with a dynamic approach to meet the changing trends. The clothing or apparel industry in the world has been one of the most important industries for trade, investments, employment and revenue generation globally. The industry revolves around short product life cycles, changing consumer demands due to fashion dynamics, product differentiation and brand image building.The consumers in the clothing industry have high bargaining power as they have increased demand for more variety, more functionality and more new styles to meet the changing fashion needs worldwide.  In recent years, the clothing industry has faced multiple challenges due to the economic downturn globally. These challenges had different impacts on different markets. In emerging markets, growth potential increased. There was a slow-paced recovery in the US markets, and a decline in Western Europe. The top leading clothing brands in the world all have to work rigorously to maintain the position and compete to gain larger market share every year. The top 10 clothing brands in the world based on their brand value ranking in 2022 are Nike, Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Chanel, Adidas, Hermès, Zara, H&amp;M, Cartier and UNIQLO.The clothing industry, also known as the apparel market, includes clothing ranging from sportswear to business wear to daily wear to luxury products. During the pandemic, the companies in the apparel industry were hit badly. However, they have managed to rise again with increasing sales revenue and brand value. The revenue of the global clothing industry was recorded at approximately $1.5 trillion as of 2021. It is notably the U.S. and China which have the highest demands for clothing than any other country. Nevertheless, emerging markets have fueled the sales revenue of the leading clothing companies in the recent years. More interestingly, according to Statista, it is expected the global clothing industry’s revenue will hit $1.9 trillion target by 2025 and reach $2 trillion by year 2026. Some of the top firms in the sector include The TJX Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TJX), American Eagle Outfitters, Inc. (NYSE:AEO), and NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE). Story continuesOur MethodologyThese companies were picked after a careful assessment of the clothing industry.

UNIQLO’s fleece jackets are very popular for their high-quality casual wear.

Online sales have risen in recent years, jumping by 77% in year 2021, representing a third of all sales. Digital transformation has helped Zara achieve its growth targets and meet the changing demands of the global markets.

(NASDAQ:AMGN) Trading At A 33% Discount?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amgen-inc-nasdaq-amgn-trading-140015382.html,1668607215,STORY,['AMGN'],"[Today we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Amgen The MethodWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$10.4bUS$11.0bUS$11.2bUS$11.6bUS$11.9bUS$12.2bUS$12.5bUS$12.8bUS$13.0bUS$13.3bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x5Analyst x5Analyst x3Analyst x3Est @ 2.68%Est @ 2.47%Est @ 2.32%Est @ 2.22%Est @ 2.15%Est @ 2.1% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.9% US$9.7kUS$9.6kUS$9.2kUS$8.9kUS$8.6kUS$8.2kUS$7.9kUS$7.5kUS$7.2kUS$6.9k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$84bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.9%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$13b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (6.9%– 2.0%) = US$278bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$278b÷ ( 1 + 6.9%)10= US$143bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$227b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$284, the company appears quite good value at a 33% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Amgen as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.951. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Looking Ahead:Although the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price?

You're not going to Kohl's for dresses,"" she said.Shares of Macy's rose 10%. On Wednesday, the stock fell 8% as a holiday sales warning from Target Corp pummeled retail stocks.Inventories at Macy's were up just 4% in the third quarter from a year ago, thanks to heavy discounts to clear excess stocks of casual and athleisure apparel. Kohl's inventories ballooned 34%.Macy's warned of more promotions heading into the holidays and reversed its earlier position that Christmas shopping would start early, saying consumers were holding out in the hope of getting discounts.""(Consumers) are under a tighter budget, feeling the impact of inflation on non-discretionary items and beginning to deplete their savings.

The company strategically brought in seasonal merchandise earlier to strengthen its competitive position for Holiday and has the added capacity to chase in-season trends.Gross margin for the quarter was 38.7%, down from 41.0% in the third quarter of 2021.Merchandise margin decline was driven by a year-over-year increase in promotional and permanent markdowns within the Macy’s brand, as the company sold through slower moving categories including casual apparel, soft home, and warmer weather seasonal goods.Delivery expense as a percent of net sales was relatively consistent with the prior year. Higher fuel costs more than offset the impact of a 2-percentage point decline in digital penetration and reductions in cost-per-package.Selling, general and administrative (""SG&amp;A"") expense of $2.1 billion, a $84 million increase.SG&amp;A expense as a percent of sales was 39.3%, 300 basis points higher compared to the third quarter of 2021 and an improvement of 330 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2019.The prior year quarter benefited from a significant number of open positions due to the tight labor market.

Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the elevated P/E.Recent times haven't been advantageous for General Dynamics as its earnings have been rising slower than most other companies. It might be that many expect the uninspiring earnings performance to recover significantly, which has kept the P/E from collapsing. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason. View our latest analysis for General Dynamics peIf you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report on General Dynamics.How Is General Dynamics' Growth Trending?There's an inherent assumption that a company should outperform the market for P/E ratios like General Dynamics' to be considered reasonable.Retrospectively, the last year delivered a decent 3.5% gain to the company's bottom line. However, due to its less than impressive performance prior to this period, EPS growth is practically non-existent over the last three years overall. Accordingly, shareholders probably wouldn't have been overly satisfied with the unstable medium-term growth rates.Looking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to climb by 11% per annum during the coming three years according to the analysts following the company. With the market only predicted to deliver 9.0% per year, the company is positioned for a stronger earnings result.With this information, we can see why General Dynamics is trading at such a high P/E compared to the market. Apparently shareholders aren't keen to offload something that is potentially eyeing a more prosperous future.The Final WordWhile the price-to-earnings ratio shouldn't be the defining factor in whether you buy a stock or not, it's quite a capable barometer of earnings expectations.Story continuesAs we suspected, our examination of General Dynamics' analyst forecasts revealed that its superior earnings outlook is contributing to its high P/E. Right now shareholders are comfortable with the P/E as they are quite confident future earnings aren't under threat. It's hard to see the share price falling strongly in the near future under these circumstances.Before you settle on your opinion, we've discovered 1 warning sign for General Dynamics that you should be aware of.Of course, you might also be able to find a better stock than General Dynamics. So you may wish to see this free collection of other companies that sit on P/E's below 20x and have grown earnings strongly.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content?

The increased defense spending is mainly for upgrading and improvising defense systems with technologically advanced features.

The collaborations include three, large-format wallscape murals, an animated short film from award-winning creative studio Art Camp, and two artistic decks of cards from leading illustrator and comic artist Jen Bartel.""The Awakening"" wallscape by Allison Hueman, located at 5th and Tehema Street in San Francisco through January 2023. Photo Credit: Masaki Omori.""As Awakening came together, we realized the power of what we were working on and were inspired to extend the artistry beyond the walls of the theater,"" said Craig Billings, CEO of Wynn Resorts. ""We commissioned these beautiful pieces of art with no restraints on this talented group of artists because that is what Wynn does best – we let amazing talent create beauty.""Allison Hueman, also known as ""Hueman,"" is one of three artists tapped to recreate the artistic theme of the show with a large-scale wallscape. Located in the SOMA neighborhood at 5th and Tehema Street in San Francisco, the mural is reminiscent of Awakening's prismatic stage made of dichroic glass and showcases multiple components of the show's narrative. Hueman's work, titled ""The Awakening,"" will be on display through January 2023.Based in Oakland, CA, Hueman is a multidisciplinary artist specializing in a distinctly gauzy art style she refers to as ""etherealism,"" a blend of ethereal realism. Whether creating delicate visions on canvas or augmenting reality through video projections and other digital media, Hueman often draws on the human condition to create colorful mash-ups of the abstract and figurative. Seen on streets and in galleries worldwide and having collaborated with major brands such as the Golden State Warriors, Nike, and Google, her pieces explore themes of time, memory, trauma and healing.Hueman is joined by multimedia powerhouse Kentaro Yoshimura, a qualified muralist through the Department of Cultural Affairs. He has produced immersive pieces for individuals and entities ranging from LEGO to Britney Spears and has been appointed as a cultural ambassador for the upcoming Los Angeles Olympics.  Most recently, Yoshimura completed two 2,500 square foot murals in downtown L.A. commemorating the first Asian-American astronaut in space.Story continuesYoshimura's work, titled ""Chiaroscuro,"" will be featured in L.A. along the I-10 Santa Monica Freeway through January 2023.Rounding out the trio is graffiti artist Clyde Thompson, known as ""Clyde."" An artist born and based out of Phoenix, Clyde is known for his fine-art approach to street-art. Influences from the Phoenix graffiti scene and an interest in architecture led to a career in large-scale murals. His passion lies in creating an exciting and new experience for the viewer, while also contributing to the existing elements of a mural's surrounding space. Clyde is inspired by architectural details, the surrounding environment, and the opportunity to create a unique landmark for the local community.Clyde's design, titled ""IO,"" will appear downtown near Jefferson Street in Phoenix through December 2022. The murals were commissioned in collaboration with visual art curators and producers, Building 180.In addition to the installations, Wynn Las Vegas is debuting an animated short film that is intended to appear at festivals in 2023. Awakening's writer Kelly Sue DeConnick crafted a compelling companion piece in collaboration with Santiago Carrasquilla and Jose Diaz Contreras, the founders of Art Camp.Art Camp is a creative studio dedicated to storytelling in a variety of different formats and is known for working with musicians such as Tom Yorke, Mitski and Bright Eyes.  Kelly Sue DeConnick is one of the most sought-after writers in the industry, with work spanning stage, comics, film, and television. DeConnick first came to prominence as a comics writer, where she is best known for reinventing the beloved character of Carol Danvers as ""Captain Marvel"" for Marvel Entertainment, and for the Eisner Award-winning DC book Wonder Woman Historia: The Amazons; her screen work includes Captain Marvel and 2023's The Marvels with Marvel Studios.Wynn Las Vegas also engaged in an artistic collaboration with two-time Eisner®-award-winner Jen Bartel to design two custom decks of playing cards exclusively for Awakening. The cards offer a vivid interpretation of Awakening's characters as Jacks, Queens and Kings, brought to life through Bartel's colorful and bold illustrations.Bartel is an illustrator and comic artist who is best known for depicting strong leading characters, particularly women. Her use of color is signature to her designs: bold, thematic, and often moody. Bartel creates a world within her illustrations that makes her one of the most sought-after cover artists for clients like Marvel, Disney and Chronicle Books. She also routinely collaborates with partners like Puma and Adidas and is the co-creator and artist of ""BLACKBIRD"" from Image Comics.These works join Wynn's existing collection of art that is prominently displayed throughout public areas of its resorts including, Jeff Koons' Tulips and the century-old Eiffel Chandelier by Gustave Eiffel at Wynn Las Vegas; three 20-foot stainless steel sculptures known as Plensa Trio in Encore Boston Harbor's Harborwalk, by artist Jaume Plensa; and a group of unique and culturally significant Chinese porcelain baluster vases from the Jiaqing period at Wynn Macau. Wynn Resorts' collection among its four resorts totals more than 100 paintings, drawings, tapestries, pieces of sculpture and objects d'art.With the launch of Awakening, Wynn is evolving its signature ethos of elegance and artfulness and shepherding a new era of artistic expression helmed by up-and-coming multidisciplinary artists.Conceived and created by Bernie Yuman, Baz Halpin and Michael Curry, and narrated by two-time Academy Award®-winner Anthony Hopkins, Awakening is an unprecedented spectacle that immerses audiences in a custom-designed 360-degree theater.Awakening at Wynn Las Vegas premiered on Monday, Nov. 7.

(NYSE:ZTS) stock rose 11% last week, insiders who sold US$863k worth of stock in the previous 12 months are likely to be better off. Selling at an average price of US$198, which is higher than the current price, may have been the wisest decision for these insiders as their investment would have been worth less now than when they sold.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. View our latest analysis for Zoetis The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At ZoetisIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the CEO &amp; Director, Kristin Peck, sold US$562k worth of shares at a price of US$225 per share. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. The good news is that this large sale was at well above current price of US$148. So it is hard to draw any strong conclusion from it.In the last year Zoetis insiders didn't buy any company stock. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Insider OwnershipFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. It appears that Zoetis insiders own 0.07% of the company, worth about US$49m. While this is a strong but not outstanding level of insider ownership, it's enough to indicate some alignment between management and smaller shareholders.What Might The Insider Transactions At Zoetis Tell Us?The fact that there have been no Zoetis insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. Still, the insider transactions at Zoetis in the last 12 months are not very heartening. But we do like the fact that insiders own a fair chunk of the company. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. To assist with this, we've discovered 1 warning sign that you should run your eye over to get a better picture of Zoetis.Story continuesOf course Zoetis may not be the best stock to buy.

(NYSE:NEE) insiders who purchased shares in the last 12 months were richly rewarded last week. The stock climbed by 7.8% resulting in a US$12b addition to the company’s market value. Put another way, the original US$6.5m acquisition is now worth US$7.3m.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. Check out our latest analysis for NextEra Energy NextEra Energy Insider Transactions Over The Last YearThe insider James Robo made the biggest insider purchase in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$5.0m worth of shares at a price of US$77.26 each. So it's clear an insider wanted to buy, at around the current price, which is US$84.32. Of course they may have changed their mind. But this suggests they are optimistic. While we always like to see insider buying, it's less meaningful if the purchases were made at much lower prices, as the opportunity they saw may have passed. Happily, the NextEra Energy insiders decided to buy shares at close to current prices.NextEra Energy insiders may have bought shares in the last year, but they didn't sell any. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeThere are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares. You probably do not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Insider Ownership Of NextEra EnergyLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. NextEra Energy insiders own about US$280m worth of shares (which is 0.2% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The NextEra Energy Insider Transactions Indicate?There haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much. However, our analysis of transactions over the last year is heartening. With high insider ownership and encouraging transactions, it seems like NextEra Energy insiders think the business has merit. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. At Simply Wall St, we've found that NextEra Energy has 2 warning signs (1 doesn't sit too well with us!) that deserve your attention before going any further with your analysis.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

136,bcf1c628-ea5a-3dd0-8557-9180dd0bed4c,NEE,2022-11-17,"Investors Heavily Search NextEra Energy, Inc. (NEE): Here is What You Need to Know",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-nextera-energy-140002769.html,1668607202,STORY,"['NEE', 'NEE-PR']","[NextEra Energy (NEE) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this parent company of Florida Power &amp; Light Co. Have returned +10.5% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +11.4% change. The Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry, to which NextEra belongs, has gained 9.4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.NextEra is expected to post earnings of $0.54 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +31.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -5.9%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.90 points to a change of +13.7% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.1%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.14 indicates a change of +8.3% from what NextEra is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.2%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for NextEra.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for NEE _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of NextEra, the consensus sales estimate of $5.76 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +14.1%. The $20.4 billion and $26.65 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +19.5% and +30.7%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryNextEra reported revenues of $6.72 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +53.8%. EPS of $0.85 for the same period compares with $0.75 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.35 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +5.77%. The EPS surprise was +7.59%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.NextEra is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about NextEra. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The requirement ""generally improved our ability to operate our business effectively in fiscal 2022,"" the report said.The virus now presents a lower threat than when Tyson decided in August 2021 to require that employees be vaccinated by that November, company spokesman Derek Burleson told Reuters on Wednesday.""The risk of severe infection has decreased significantly, with many resources readily available including vaccines and boosters, testing, and improved treatment options,"" Burleson said.America's largest meatpacking union, the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, said it negotiated an agreement with Arkansas-based Tyson to end the mandate.Tyson ""worked to get the unions' support to end the requirement, which was achieved,"" Burleson said. He added that Tyson kept other safety protocols like requiring workers to self-screen for COVID-19 symptoms.Some Tyson workers remain worried about catching COVID-19 in chicken plants, said Magaly Licolli, director of Venceremos, an organization that advocates for poultry workers in Arkansas.""There is still the pandemic,"" said Licolli, who has criticized Tyson for not protecting plant employees. ""Workers are getting sick over and over of COVID.""Tyson runs slaughterhouses in rural areas where some residents were reluctant to get vaccinated.

To avail this option, MA cardholders need to follow a definite process at one go by inserting their card details and a one-time password on the Google Wallet app. Following this set-up, they can save the Mastercard cards on their Android phones and Wear OS devices.Soon after activation, the cardholders can utilize the wallet to conduct seamless and secure payments through their Android phones or Wear OS devices across stores that approve contactless payments. Apart from in-store payments, they can engage in web or app-based transactions.While Malaysia’s consumers can currently enjoy the benefit of hassle-free payments attached to their Google Wallet, the provision to store other items in the same app, such as loyalty cards, will be available to them shortly. In addition to extending the e-wallet payments facility across Malaysia, Mastercard will utilize tokenization technology to protect the country’s consumers from the perils of online payment frauds.Mastercard Digital Enablement Service (MDES) provides a digital token to secure transactions through digital wallets with the added advantage of zero compromises on safeguarding the card details by not sharing the same.The recent decision to launch Google Wallet in Malaysia reflects Mastercard’s efforts to offer expanded digital payment options to simplify the daily payments of the country’s consumers and gradually march toward a cashless society. The move also indicates MA’s target to occupy a significant share of the rapidly-growing digital payments market in the country. Story continuesAccording to the e-Conomy SEA 2022 report, the fast-evolving digital payments are anticipated to reach a gross transaction value of $200 billion within 2025. Further, the recent unveiling seems perfectly timed as the growing adoption of digital wallets gains pace with the ease and security brought along. This August, Mastercard introduced Google Wallet in South Africa, which continues to witness a higher uptake of digital payments spurred by elevated Internet penetration and increased smartphone usage.Shares of Mastercard have lost 4.3% in a year compared with the industry’s decline of 19.4%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank &amp; Key PicksMastercard currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) is designed to address the increasing demand for higher memory performance and lower energy consumption across a wide array of markets, including automotive, client personal computers (PCs) and networking systems built for fifth-generation (5G) and artificial intelligence applications.Micron's latest LPDDR5X offers peak speeds at 8.533 gigabits per second (Gbps), which is 33% faster than the previous-generation LPDDR5 and 24% more power efficient. This enables users to create, share and enjoy their mobile experiences longer between daily charging. It further helps to achieve up to a 50% increase in night-mode resolution for crisper, clearer photos and shoot speeds up to 35% faster. It also enables bringing features like portrait and low-light modes to video, letting a user shoot high-definition video as stunning as photographs even in low-light conditions.Micron Technology, Inc.

QuoteCurrently, Micron is shipping LPDDR5X mobile memory in mass production with an assurance that the mobile ecosystem will innovate a new generation of devices and emerging apps beyond imagination. This DRAM solution, which complements the unparalleled speed and energy efficiency needs of Qualcomm Snapdragon chipsets, will ensure that the manufacturers who design smartphones using this chipset receive significant benefits.Micron is witnessing growing demand for memory chips from cloud-computing providers and acceleration in fifth-generation cellular network adoptions. A rising mix of high-value solutions, adoption of 5th Gen in the Internet of Things devices and wireless infrastructure, enhancement in customer engagement and improvement in cost structure are the company’s growth drivers.Story continuesA few days ago, the company announced the availability of its DDR5 memory for the data center that is validated for the Advanced Micro Devices AMD EPYC 9004 Series processors. Collaborating with AMD, Micron assessed high-performance computing workloads: OpenFOAM, Weather Research and Forecasting (“WRF”) and CP2K, with DDR4 memory on 3rd Gen AMD EPYC processors and with DDR5 memory on 4th Gen AMD EPYC processors. The combination of Micron DDR5 and AMD’s 4th Gen processor enhanced the performances of OpenFOAM, WRF and CP2K dynamics by 2.4x, 2.1x and 2.03x, respectively.The combination of Micron’s DDR5 and AMD’s 4th Gen EPYC processors is likely to transform the data center operations of AMD enterprise customers while accelerating their time to value, reducing their total ownership costs and aiding to address their sustainability targets. DDR5 stands as a significant enhancement in system memory capabilities that are required to enable increasingly memory-bound algorithms, boding well for the next generation of data center infrastructure.For fourth-quarter fiscal 2022, Micron reported Dynamic random access memory revenues of $4.81 billion, which represented 72% of the total top line.Zacks Rank &amp; A Key PickMicron currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) while both Qualcomm and Advanced Micro Devices hold a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).

Sourced from the company's first-party data, and from custom research of thousands of travelers and industry professionals across 17 countries, these top travel trends prove there is no ""one-size-fits-all"" approach to travel in 2023.i Instead, these trends point to a year defined by the ""no-normal.""Experience the full interactive Multichannel News Release here: https://www.multivu.com/players/English/9084351-expedia-2023-travel-trends/Edinburgh, Scotland""When we look at Expedia, Hotels.com, and Vrbo data together, we see a detailed and robust picture of travel into 2023,"" said Jon Gieselman, president, Expedia Brands. ""We're seeing a surge in trips to culture capitals, a new wave of interest in wellness retreats and a spike in demand for outdoor destinations beyond just beaches and mountains — not a new normal but people branching out to unexpected trends in what we're calling the 'no normal'.""Unexpected Travel Trends in 2023Expedia: Set-JettersBooking a trip after binging a popular new series will become serious business in 2023. Expedia research confirms that streamed movies and TV shows are now the top sources of travel inspiration (40%), outpacing the influence of social media (31%). Furthermore, the small screen is now considered on par with recommendations from friends and family when it comes to travel inspiration.In the US, more than two-thirds (68%) of travelers considered visiting a destination after seeing it in a show or movie on a streaming platform, and a whopping 61% booked a trip. The top set-jetter destinations include New Zealand, with its landscapes featured in one of this year's most epic series, followed by the UK, Paris, New York and the stunning beach resorts of Hawaii.Expedia: Culture CapitalsNational parks and rural retreats have had big moments these past two years. Now, it's time for cities to see a comeback. Based on traveler demand, most of the destinations seeing the largest increases are culture-rich cities where art and culture festivities are getting back to full swing. Check out the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in Scotland, plan a trip to WorldPride in Sydney or bask in the cherry blossoms in Tokyo. In the Expedia app, culture capitals are calling:1Story continuesEdinburgh, ScotlandLisbon, PortugalTokyo, JapanDublin, IrelandNew York, USSydney, AustraliaDubai, UAEMontreal, CanadaMunich, GermanyBangkok, ThailandHotels.com: Three-star SuperstarsTravelers are seeking smarter ways to see the world, without compromising on comfort or cool factor. In the US, nearly a third (32%) of travelers are more concerned with value for money than ever before. Hotels.com data shows interest is up more than 20% globally in three-star hotels.2In 2023, 40% of US travelers plan to stay in 1–3-star hotels and 34% plan to book a vacation with added value inclusions, such as free parking or breakfast. Showing a shift in mindset from the post-pandemic bucket-list mentality and moving towards a more spontaneous approach, one-third of travelers would rather go on more trips in three-star properties than splurge on one big luxury getaway. Fewer stars do not mean lower standards, however. Many properties, such as Una Vida in Mexico or Mama Shelter in Paris, offer excellent amenities, stylish interiors and unique vibes as a standard.Hotels.com: New Wave WellnessAccording to Hotels.com, more than half (53%) of Americans are seeking wellness breaks but cite boredom for traditional retreats and want to experience something more exciting in 2023. Millennials are the top drivers of this, as 60% of 25-34-year-olds are seeking out alternative wellness getaways. Most travelers want to explore new offerings in the US. However, Gen Z has a different view and would prefer to book an adventure to Norway, Turkey, Switzerland, Iceland and Sri Lanka.To capture this awakened market, hotels such as the Loire Valley Lodge in France and Whitepod in Switzerland are offering advanced rejuvenation programs and hands-on activities that encourage travelers to get up close and personal with nature. The quirkier the activity the better. Sylvotherapy, forest bathing and fruit harvesting are more popular than classic activities like cooking courses, sport holidays and meditation sessions.Hotels.com: Hot new hotel openings around the worldNew hotels that cater to evolving traveler needs are opening around the world. These properties offer far more than a place to sleep, with destination restaurants, co-working spaces, and beautiful interiors as standard. From an art-filled social hub in London to unbridled luxury in Rome, these are the most exciting hotels to have on your radar in the year ahead, according to Hotels.com:La Palma | Capri, Italy100 Princes Street | Edinburgh, UKIkos Odisia | Corfu, GreeceCelestial Suites | Kefalonia, Greece1 Hotel Hanalei Bay | Princeville, KauaiFour Seasons Resort Tamarindo | Tamarindo, MexicoAlila Kothaifaru Maldives | Maldives, Indian OceanSix Senses | Rome, ItalyAtlantis The Royal | Dubai, UAEart'otel London Battersea Power Station | London, Great BritainVrbo: Foodie-menitiesKitchen credentials are a must, with travelers looking to plate up at their own convenience in a private Vrbo vacation home. Outdoor kitchens, pizza ovens and air fryers are the top three foodie-menities travelers crave. Additionally, nearly half of US travelers (43%) are using cooking to cut down on costs. Travelers are looking for preferred amenities in their whole home vacation rentals rather than focusing on location. In fact, more than half (57%) of travelers would rather book a unique vacation home to be with their people in a lesser-known destination than a less interesting, less equipped vacation home in a popular area.Vrbo: Cowboy-cationsRustic getaways are on the rise, as travelers crave private vacation homes with abundant space and exhilarating views. Cue the cowboy-cation, offering an intimate escape in the rugged wilderness. Demand for Vrbo homes in US western destinations increased by more than 30% from September 2021 to August 2022, as travelers seek to reconnect with nature.3 Plus, 42% of US travelers find inspiration in outdoorsy destinations and mind-blowing landscapes. Think log-lined cabins, flickering fires and sweeping vistas.Travelers can live out their western fantasies by booking a luxurious lodge, ranch retreat or farmhouse that fits the whole crew. Destinations across Montana, Colorado and other western states spring readily to mind, but the cowboy-cation is not confined to the US. For a home on the range in Europe, travelers are booking converted barns and farmhouses in the countryside of Italy, Spain, France and the UK. Thrill-seekers can also embrace their inner cowboy in Australia, where farmhouses in the outback overlook acres of wineries and wild brush.Vrbo: Hidden GemsTravelers are also exploring unassuming locales and new places. Top hidden gems in the US have one thing in common: beautiful lakes, where travelers can take in tranquil views. Demand for Vrbo's private vacation homes in each of these unconventional destinations has increased by 30% or more since September 2021:4Nampa, IdahoGreensboro, North CarolinaLayton, UtahIrmo, South CarolinaOneonta, New YorkHampton, VirginiaBristol, Rhode IslandSpokane, WashingtonLas Cruces, New MexicoMissoula, MontanaTravel in 2023 will be about saying ""no"" to normal, breaking routines and searching for experiences without compromises. Whether it's flying to those once-in-a-lifetime events or hosting group celebrations at a holiday home, travelers are no longer adapting to the next new normal, but creating their own status quo altogether.An optimistic industry pushes forwardFor the first time, the 2023 travel trends are being released at the same time as insights from industry professionals, from airlines to hotels to vacation rental hosts and more. In a tailored report for travel partners, Expedia Group reveals the ways that the pandemic forever changed travel. The research shows the highest levels of optimism since 2020. Most professionals expect leisure (71%) and business (70%) travel to return to pre-2020 levels within two years. While travelers looking for a change of scenery kept the industry afloat during the pandemic, all eyes are on the return of international and business travel. In fact, more than half (51%) in the industry say business is their organization's highest priority in 2023.Another insight from industry professionals shows travelers are choosing options aligned with their personal values such as sustainability, inclusivity and accessibility. Most travel businesses (60%) made changes in the last year to ensure their services are inclusive and accessible. In fact, sustainability is tied with marketing as the highest area of investment for 2023, with one in five industry professionals saying they plan to invest in sustainability next year.For the full industry report on insights and actions for travel partners, download the Traveler Value Index 2023 here.For the full consumer report on The No-Normal; Unexpected Travel Trends in 2023, go to https://www.expedia.com/2023traveltrends.About Expedia GroupExpedia Group, Inc. companies power travel for everyone, everywhere through our global platform.

Source: Skift. Dylan Pacholek / SkiftAirlines used to lean on online travel agencies to find customers. But now in something of a turnabout, airlines have enough loyalists that online travel companies are, in some cases, providing services to airlines to help them sell upsells and packages directly.Executives from Expedia Group and JetBlue discussed the changed dynamic on Wednesday at Skift Aviation Forum 2022 in Dallas-Fort Worth in a conversation with Seth Borko, senior research analyst at Skift Research.Expedia Group has been attempting to take the sales and distribution knowledge it’s built up in its consumer business and apply that to business-to-business services, as Skift has reported. The online travel giant helps airlines learn how to better put together and sell upsells and packages to the airline’s customers.“If an airline thinks, ‘Hey let’s put this in there, and if you build it, they will come,’ it probably won’t work,” said Julie Kyse, vice president, global air partnerships — who leads the team responsible for Expedia Group’s relationships with airlines.“You need to make sure you’ve got the right placements with the right discoverability on the website,” Kyse said. “We have a lot of expertise along these lines.”JetBlue does get some non-air supply from Expedia to help create packages to sell to its customers. But in the past few years, it has built JetBlue Travel Products — a collection of ventures to try to create its own institutional knowledge on selling direct.The business unit relaunched JetBlue Vacations, launched Paisly — which “offers travelers trip add-ons such as rental cars, hotels, and theme park tickets, tied to their JetBlue reservations“) — and this year debuted Troupe, a group trip booking planner app.JetBlue Travel Products is small but growing. It’s on track to generate about $100 million in earnings before interest and taxes this year. That pales compared to the billions in revenue the parent airline company forecasts to make this year, but it’s a significant profit in an often thin-margin sector.Story continuesExpedia, set to generate billions in revenue this year, doesn’t feel threatened by the direct selling efforts of airlines such as JetBlue. The company instead sees direct airline sales of non-air products as one segment as part of a bigger pie, with the overall pie getting larger.“There are customers that have a natural affinity for JetBlue, and we appreciate that JetBlue has a relationship with them, and we want to help them grow that relationship,” Kyse said. “It’s up to us to build in a certain amount of stickiness on our own sites by investing in loyalty programs and things that drive people to continue to come to Expedia’s brands.”Expedia can also provide broader insights for its partners about shifts in market demand. For example, the company’s survey data has revealed “greater price sensitivity” among consumers, Kyse said.JetBlue Pushes DirectJetBlue is using several methods to help sell more non-air products directly to customers. If a person buys a vacation package from JetBlue and they have the airline’s co-branded credit card, they will get the annual fee back as a statement credit.Any purchase of travel through JetBlue counts toward status in the carrier’s loyalty program, too, which is relatively rare as a perk in the sector.“Yes, Expedia is one of the sources for some of the lodging we offer, but, again, we’re the ones who service the customer, and we’ve seen a lot of success so far,” said Andres Barry, president, JetBlue Travel Products.”Get breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.]"

The aerospace and defense giant posted $1.78 billion in net income on $16.58 billion in revenue, beating the analyst consensus estimates handily. The market was clearly impressed by Lockheeds earnings beat, rewarding its stock with its biggest post-earnings jump in more than two years.Lockheed Martin: Riding High on Heightened Geopolitical TensionsList of 52-Week LowsList of 3-Year LowsList of 5-Year LowsWhile Lockheeds third quarter was undeniably solid, a closer look at the company reveals a number of things investors should not ignore.Earnings and guidance in focusOn the surface, there is little bad to say about Lockheeds third quarter. Net income was up nearly 190% from the same quarter of fiscal 2021. Things look even better on a per-share basis, with earnings per share of $6.87 representing a spike of 204% from the same period last year. Lockheeds top line performance was somewhat less impressive, however, with revenue growing just 3.5% year over year. Indeed, the companys $16.58 billion in revenue actually fell short of analysts estimates by just over $100 million. As a result, Lockheeds profit margin actually contracted slightly on a sequential basis, from 10.9% in the second quarter to 10.7% in the third quarter.It is also important to understand how Lockheed managed to book such a strong third quarter profit despite missing on revenue. Perhaps the biggest driver was buybacks, as aerospace analyst Dhierin Bechai explained on Oct. 19:What I found interesting is that bridge from the Q3 2021 adjusted EPS of $6.44 to $6.71 in Q3 2022. 10% of that growth is driven by operational performance and 90% of it is driven by share count reductions. That is not necessarily bad, but EPS growth is apparently driven by the company buying back its shares and not so much by operational volumes, mix and efficiency improving.Reducing the number of shares in order to boost per-share earnings is hardly new or strange, but it is important to recognize when it is happening.Story continuesGeopolitical tailwindsBack in September 2021, I wrote an article highlighting Lockheeds dependence on the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program as a key vulnerability. More than a year later, this vulnerability is still an issue. As Bichai observed on Sep. 26, 2022 started quite poorly for the next-generation fighter program:The F-35 program started the year in a somewhat disappointing fashion. While the war in Ukraine unleashed just a month earlier, the Pentagon slashed its budget request by 33 F-35 stealth fighters from a previously planned 94, setting the program back by around $5.8 billion, according to my calculations, from the procurement that was initially anticipated.While Lockheeds F-35 contract with the U.S. and Nato carries a projected long-term price of $1.1 trillion, delays and runaway costs have served to dampen buyer confidence in recent years, at least to a degree. However, the situation has improved significantly over the course of the year, as Fitch Ratings reported on Oct. 19:In mid-2022 LMT received a contract to deliver an incremental 129 F-35 aircraft for $7.6 billion under lot 15 of the program. The company also reached a handshake agreement with the Department of Defense (DoD) to deliver around 375 between lots 15 and 17, though Fitch believes the final agreement could include up to 450 aircraft. This excludes international orders, which are significant at around 900 and expected to grow over time. LMT will likely trend towards producing around 150 aircraft per year for the foreseeable future.The F-35s prospects have seen further improvement thanks to the recent escalation of geopolitical tensions in Europe and Asia. Fears about Russian aggression in Ukraine and Eastern Europe, as well as mounting anxiety over Chinas military buildup in Southeast Asia, have convinced a number of fence-sitters to place orders for the F-35. Germany, for example, announced in March that it would buy 35 F-35s, an order that will gross Lockheed approximately $8.4 billion in total. The German deal is a major win for Lockheed, which had previously been frozen out of German plans to update its fighter aircraft complement.Geopolitical headwindsWhile Lockheeds future remains highly dependent on the success of the F-35, such success has been made considerably more certain thanks to the surge in demand from allied governments. At the same time, however, it is important to recognize that rising geopolitical tensions can cut both ways. Specifically, Lockheed may find itself exposed to enhanced competition from, and retaliation by, rival powers. Zacks Equity Research raised this fear in a Nov. 4 investor note:Steady contract flows and subsequent backlog growth bolster its long-term revenue prospects. The budgetary provisions tend to boost its business. Yet, America and Turkey's tiff as a result of the latter accepting Russian products might hurt its component supply from TurkeyAlso, an uncertainty revolving around the possible sanction by China on Lockheed might impact the latter.Thus far, the tailwinds from heightened demand from allied powers have been more than enough to compensate for any potential issues arising from the likes of Russia and China. In my view, this state of affairs seems likely to persist barring a major escalation of trade conflict between the U.S. and China. Even so, it is a risk investors ought to keep on their radar given the present volatility of the international stage.My takeIn my assessment, Lockheed Martin is looking pretty solid right now overall. Rising geopolitical tensions have served as a powerful tailwind for its most important program, the F-35, and these seem poised to persist for the foreseeable future. At the same time, I think it is important to recognize that Lockheeds own guidance calls for a fairly flat performance in 2023, followed by another ramp up in 2024. Investors should prepare and set their expectations accordingly.Trade carefully!This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

(NYSE:WEC) recently shelled out US$91k to buy stock, at US$91.39 per share. Even though that isn't a massive buy, it did increase their holding by 63%, which is arguably a good sign. See our latest analysis for WEC Energy Group WEC Energy Group Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn fact, the recent purchase by Glen Tellock was the biggest purchase of WEC Energy Group shares made by an insider individual in the last twelve months, according to our records. That means that an insider was happy to buy shares at around the current price of US$94.41. Of course they may have changed their mind. But this suggests they are optimistic. We do always like to see insider buying, but it is worth noting if those purchases were made at well below today's share price, as the discount to value may have narrowed with the rising price. The good news for WEC Energy Group share holders is that an insider was buying at near the current price. Glen Tellock was the only individual insider to buy during the last year.The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeThere are always plenty of stocks that insiders are buying. So if that suits your style you could check each stock one by one or you could take a look at this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insider Ownership Of WEC Energy GroupI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. It appears that WEC Energy Group insiders own 0.1% of the company, worth about US$41m. We've certainly seen higher levels of insider ownership elsewhere, but these holdings are enough to suggest alignment between insiders and the other shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The WEC Energy Group Insider Transactions Indicate?It is good to see the recent insider purchase. We also take confidence from the longer term picture of insider transactions. Insiders likely see value in WEC Energy Group shares, given these transactions (along with notable insider ownership of the company). So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out Billionaire Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates 13F Portfolio: Top 5 Stock Picks.Ray Dalio founded Bridgewater Associates from his apartment in Manhattan back in 1975 and turned it into one of the biggest hedge funds in the world, with an asset under management (AUM) of over $150 billion as of 2022. Mr. Dalio achieved this milestone by developing a deep understanding of market forces and macroeconomic factors. As Mr. Dalio progressed, he established an ethos that made Bridgewater Associates one of the five most important private companies in the US, according to the renowned Fortune magazine. Given Mr. Dalio’s comprehension of macroeconomics and his unique investing perspective, some analysts have labeled him as the Steve Jobs of investing.Mr. Dalio’s investing expertise can also be gauged by the fact that the flagship Pure Alpha fund of Bridgewater Associates is up 22% YTD, while the broader markets have been heavily in the red due to global macroeconomic concerns. Some of the popular stocks held by Mr. Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates include The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NYSE:PEP), as of Q3 2022.BRIDGEWATER ASSOCIATESRay Dalio of Bridgewater AssociatesOur MethodologyIn this article, we discuss the top 10 stock picks of billionaire Ray Dalio’s 13F portfolio. These stocks have been picked from the Q3 portfolio of Mr. Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates. We have ranked these stocks in terms of the fund’s stake in them. The majority of these stocks appear to be defensive in nature and reflect that Mr. Dalio’s hedge fund is bracing for a possible recession.Billionaire Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates 13F Portfolio: Top 10 Stock Picks10. CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 65Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates’ Holdings: $293,711,000Percentage of Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates’ Portfolio: 1.48%CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) is a Rhode Island-based healthcare solution provider through its retail pharmacy chain, pharmacy benefits manager (PBM), and healthcare benefits (HCB) segment. The company covers various touchpoints in the healthcare segment through its divisions.Story continuesIn a research note issued on November 6, John Ransom at Raymond James gave CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) stock a target price of $115, along with an Outperform rating. The development occurred after the company reported better-than-anticipated Q3 2022 results that were driven by the stellar performance of the HCB business. Meanwhile, the performance of the pharmacy retail and pharmacy benefits management businesses was also in line with expectations. Furthermore, CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) is considered among the defensive stocks expected to hold its ground in case of a recession. CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) has an annual forward dividend yield of 2.26% as of November 14.Vltava Fund shared its bullish outlook on CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“CVS is a leader in the provision of healthcare services in the USA. It has three main businesses: an enormous network of pharmacies, a health insurance company, and “prescription benefit management”, which is a kind of intermediary between insurance companies and pharmacies. This is the result of large acquisitions over the past 15 years – most notably of Caremark (2007) and Aetna (2018). The markets had deemed its acquisition of health insurer Aetna too expensive (and we agree), so CVS stock then fell into disfavour for a few years.We took advantage of this in the summer of 2020 and brought the stock into our portfolio at a time when its price was pressed down still further by the coronavirus pandemic. CVS is a giant. It has revenues of USD 300 billion, making it one of the largest companies in the world. It is a relatively stable and highly profitable company with strong free cash flow. Over the past few years, CVS has focused primarily on reducing debt.This is already much lower than it had been after the Aetna acquisition, and most of the cash is now likely to go to shareholders through share buybacks or be used for smaller acquisitions to grow the company further. CVS trades at about 11 times annual earnings, which is a very appealing valuation given the expected future growth in profitability and overall modest cyclicality in its business.”9. Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 61Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates’ Holdings: $298,016,000Percentage of Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates’ Portfolio: 1.5%Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is a Chicago, Illinois-based healthcare and medical devices company.On October 21, Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) stock was assigned an Overweight rating and a target price of $114 by Matt Miksic at Barclays. The analyst believes that the sell-off following the Q3 2022 results has been overdone and has taken the stock price to levels seen in early October. Miksic highlighted that there were positives in the company’s results, as reflected by the encouraging performance of the cardio devices, diabetes instruments, and established pharmaceutical division (EPD). Experts believe that Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) has a strong balance sheet and can capitalize well on the fast-growing medical technology markets. The stock offers an annual forward dividend yield of 1.81% as of November 14.Despite the earnings beat and raised guidance, the stock price plummeted as investors believed that the results were primarily driven by the strong performance of the COVID testing services as opposed to the performance of the core business segments that fell short of consensus estimates.Diamond Hill Capital shared its outlook on Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“Also among our bottom contributors were health care products manufacturer Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), global pharmaceutical company Pfizer, media and technology giant Alphabet, and insurance company American International Group (AIG).Abbott has been working through a recall of its infant formula brand Similac in the US, which has continued to pressure its share price. Although the recall will impact near-term revenues, we are not concerned about any long-term impacts. We remain optimistic about the company given it is one of the highest quality names in health care, in our view, with a talented management team that makes smart capital allocation decisions. Abbott also has leading health care and consumer franchises with a particularly strong competitive position in its medical device business. The company continues to launch innovative products in key strategic areas (such as diabetes, structural heart, and diagnostics), which should help drive not only revenue growth but margin expansion.”8. Pinduoduo Inc. (NASDAQ:PDD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 41Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates’ Holdings: $317,064,000Percentage of Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates’ Portfolio: 1.6%Pinduoduo Inc. (NASDAQ:PDD) is a Shanghai, China-based social e-commerce platform with a user base of 900 million globally. The company has the distinction of introducing team purchase and consumer-to-manufacturer (C2M) concepts in the Chinese e-commerce sector.Pinduoduo Inc. (NASDAQ:PDD) has a strong affiliation with the Chinese agricultural sector, as 16 million farmers have connected with the platform as of 2022. The company is making headway in the US e-commerce market through its cross-border e-commerce application Temu. The application is one of the top e-commerce applications in the US in terms of new downloads. On October 17, Temu was the top shopping application on the iPhone Store in the US. Within a short period since its inception in 2015, Pinduoduo Inc. (NASDAQ:PDD) has emerged as one of the leading Chinese e-commerce players with international aspirations, just like Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) and JD.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:JD).Here’s what Tao Value said about Pinduoduo Inc. (NASDAQ:PDD) in its Q4 2021 investor letter:“On the detracting side, one of our largest detractors includes Pinduoduo (ticker: PDD). Pinduoduo (PDD) reported the second consecutive GAAP profit quarter yet missed on the revenue due to nation-wide consumption weakness &amp; scaled back Sales &amp; Marketing efforts. Market disliked it and the stock price plunged on the earnings. In my opinion, the accounting profits proved the original thesis of using S&amp;M to acquire users and using great shopping experience to keep them. After realizing the first growth curve, Pinduoduo now shifted its focus &amp; investment to agriculture. It is still very early, but the reduced size due to price drop warrants a position to watch and continue grow with such a team with strong culture.”7. McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 50Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates’ Holdings: $487,730,000Percentage of Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates’ Portfolio: 2.46%McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) is a Chicago, Illinois-based fast food restaurant chain known for its burgers globally.

The analyst highlighted that the Q3 2022 earnings beat reflects McDonald’s Corporation’s (NYSE:MCD) ability to take a defensive as well as an offensive stance under any economic circumstances. The analyst added that the company’s US business does not require unit growth or significant remodeling in a rising interest rate environment. McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) offers an annual forward dividend yield of 2.24% as of November 14.Of the 895 hedge funds in Insider Monkey's database, McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) was held by 50 hedge funds as of Q2 2022.6. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 67Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates’ Holdings: $522,693,000Percentage of Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates’ Portfolio: 2.64%Walmart Inc.

(NYSE:WMT) stock a target price of $161 along with a Buy rating on November 11 ahead of the Q3 FY23 results. Experts believe that the company will outperform consensus estimates for the third quarter. Research has shown that there is still momentum in the grocery shopping category that will counter the adverse impact on the discretionary shopping category and Walmart Inc.’s (NYSE:WMT) general merchandise. Furthermore, there is a widespread belief that the company will reiterate its FY22 guidance despite the tough macroeconomic circumstances. Analysts think the current stock price dip can be an attractive entry point for any potential investor. Walmart Inc.'s (NYSE:WMT) annual forward dividend yield stands at 1.57% as of November 14.Leaven Partners shared its outlook on Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“In our last quarterly letter, I briefly mentioned that the consensus estimates for corporate profits appeared to be a bit too sanguine. I referenced a Reuters article that reported, as of June 17, Wall Street expected S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022, which was up from 8.8% in April and from 8.4% in January. That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6%[2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.”Besides Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Mr. Dalio also has a stake in The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NYSE:PEP) as of Q3 2022. Click to continue reading and see Billionaire Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates 13F Portfolio: Top 5 Stock Picks. Suggested Articles:10 Cheap Monthly Dividend Stocks To BuyTop 20 Investment Companies in the World15 Biggest Hedge Funds In the WorldDisclose.

(NYSE:JWN) is a Washington-based fashion retailer that manufactures and markets apparel, footwear, beauty products, accessories, and home goods through Nordstrom branded stores and online channels. In Q3 2022, Ken Fisher purchased 1.7 million shares of Nordstrom, Inc. (NYSE:JWN) worth about $29 million. In mid-October, Nordstrom, Inc. (NYSE:JWN) reiterated its previously forecast FY22 adjusted EPS of $2.30 to $2.60 and revenue growth of 5% to 7%. Market consensus for EPS stood at $2.34 and $15.58 billion for sales.On November 14, Deutsche Bank analyst Gabriella Carbone reaffirmed a Hold rating on Nordstrom, Inc.

In 2006 I made an investment in the shares of Nordstrom, Inc. (NYSE:JWN). Over the following three-and-a-half years, the stock was up by 36%, outperforming the S&amp;P 500 by a very respectable 41.4%. A fund made up of a single holding in Nordstrom would have ranked in the top 1% of all funds in the Morningstar database.However, Nordstrom stock declined by a very painful 80% during 2008. A single-stock fund would have almost certainly liquidated during that drawdown, taking investors out of the game and ending any hope of them ever realizing the return. But because my portfolio was diversified, it held its value a bit better (it declined by 25% while the market was down by 38%), allowing me to sell some holdings and redeploy money into investments like Nordstrom that had declined severely.”8.

Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 35Fisher Asset Management’s Stake Value: $34,995,000Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH) is headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio, and the company manufactures and sells motion and control technologies and systems for various mobile, industrial, and aerospace markets worldwide. In the third quarter of 2022, Ken Fisher opened a new position in Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH) by purchasing 144,423 shares worth nearly $35 million. On October 26, Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH) declared a quarterly dividend of $1.33 per share, in line with previous. The dividend is distributable on December 2, to shareholders of record on November 14. Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH)’s dividend yield on November 15 came in at 1.71%. Citi analyst Timothy Thein on October 14 resumed coverage of Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH) with a Neutral rating and a $285 price target, suggesting 12% total return potential. The analyst expects less earnings volatility compared to past cycles, but said it will likely take some time for Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH) to prove this to investors. Further weakening in manufacturing data may result in a more attractive entry point for the stock, the analyst told investors in a research note.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 35 hedge funds were bullish on Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH) at the end of Q2 2022, compared to 39 funds in the prior quarter. Andreas Halvorsen’s Viking Global is the leading position holder in the company, with more than 3 million shares worth $755.5 million. Here is what Oakmark Fund specifically said about Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH) in its second quarter 2022 investor letter:“Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH), a U.S. company that specializes in motion and control technologies, is suffering from what we believe are investor misunderstandings and misjudgments, despite the efforts of the company’s unusually strong management team. In our opinion, since his promotion in 2015, CEO Thomas Williams has vastly improved operations and shifted the product portfolio to longer cycled, higher growth, higher margin and higher return end markets. The results are impressive. Margins, returns and earnings have increased substantially. With the expected closing of the Meggitt acquisition in the September quarter, the highly depressed aerospace segment will be its largest end market. We anticipate a rebound in aerospace revenue, which—combined with the company’s strong position in attractive businesses, including clean technologies and factory automation—should accelerate revenue growth. Parker Hannifin trades at a discount to other high-quality industrials, which we believe is unwarranted since its growth and returns should be similar or better. At a low-teens multiple of next year’s normalized cash earnings, Parker Hannifin is an attractive investment, in our view.”6. The Gap, Inc. (NYSE:GPS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 27Fisher Asset Management’s Stake Value: $40,212,000The Gap, Inc. (NYSE:GPS) is a California-based apparel retail company that sells its products under the Old Navy, Gap, Banana Republic, and Athleta brands. Ken Fisher added The Gap, Inc.

But research over the past several years has shed light on the many ways climate change is linked to adverse health outcomes around the world.Climate drivers can lead to poor health outcomes such as respiratory disorders, heat-related morbidity and mortality, undernutrition due to food insecurity, an increase in infectious diseases and mental health issues.""Think of your mental health when you're preparing for that weather emergency. When you've just withstood major flooding or survived the wildfires - the psychological impact of that disaster is real, and we sometimes don't understand the toll it takes,"" said Dr. Cheryl Holder, internist and co-chair of Florida Clinicians for Climate Action.Dr. Holder along with Sophia Kianni, climate activist and founder of Climate Cardinals, and Joel Makower, co-founder of the GreenBiz Group, recently joined Jennifer Zachary, EVP and general counsel, Merck, for episode six of our Teal Talks series to discuss the effects of climate change on human health and the actions businesses can take to fight it.Climate vulnerabilityThe health risks and impacts of climate change are not equally distributed across people, communities or nations.A recent report from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency found that racial and ethnic minorities were most likely to live in areas with the highest projected increases in morbidity and mortality due to climate-related changes in temperatures and air pollution.Additionally, people with low socioeconomic status are more likely to be exposed to environmental hazards and have a more limited ability to prepare for or recover from extreme climate events.Story continues""We have to look at race, not as a DNA issue, but as a societal issue that has identified a population that has been marginalized,"" said Dr. Holder. ""But that's an opportunity to find solutions­. If you help this vulnerable population, you'll get immediate solutions that can be replicated across the world. It's important to help the community, but it's also an opportunity to benefit all of us by those interventions.""How businesses can helpWhile everyone can help limit climate change, businesses also have a moral obligation to take climate action.""The first thing a company needs to do is understand its own impacts, and its own impacts aren't limited to the things inside of its four walls or fence line,"" said Makower. ""It's their supply chain, it's the whole value chain, it's everything that happens from the raw materials to the end of the line.""Makower said the challenge many companies face in stepping up their environmental efforts boils down to one thing - change.""Change is hard, and we're talking about massive changes, really reinventing and rebuilding our global economy over the coming decades,"" said Makower. ""We have to transform that ‘take, make and waste' linear supply chain and linear manufacturing processes to a much more circular one. And we have to transform off of fossil fuels into renewable and much healthier fuels for the world.""Younger generations at the forefront of changeMore and more young people are joining the movement for positive climate change - and they're looking for their employers to do the same.""In previous years, talking to my peers, there was a large inclination to work for some specific, big companies that they knew would pay well. But now, they're balancing that alongside an interest in social impact and making sure that they're working for companies that are morally aligned with them,"" said Kianni, who is also a member of the United Nations youth advisory group on climate change.According to a 2022 survey from global consulting firm Deloitte, nearly two in five Gen Zers and millennials say they've rejected a job or assignment because it didn't align with their values.When it comes to satisfaction in their organization's commitment to sustainability, 56% of Gen Zers and 48% of millennials said they're not at all satisfied.""Young people are looking for how they can integrate sustainability into every facet of their lives and are starting to assess how sustainable a business is,"" said Kianni. ""And with the prevalence of social media, for young people, it becomes much easier to discern which big brands and businesses are walking the walk when it comes to taking adequate climate action.""Our approach to environmental sustainabilityAs a global company, we recognize that our actions have a direct impact on our planet.To help ensure a healthy and sustainable future for people and communities everywhere, we have environmental sustainability goals that focus on climate to meet and exceed the evolving expectations of our stakeholders and employees. In addition to achieving carbon neutrality for our operations by 2025, we're working toward:Transitioning to renewables to meet our target of sourcing 100% of our purchased electricity from renewables by 2025.Achieving a 46% reduction of operational greenhouse gas emissions (i.e., Scopes 1 &amp; 2), by 2030, from a 2019 baseline.Achieving a 30% reduction in our value chain (Scope 3) GHG emissions by 2030, from a 2019 baseline.Learn more about the Merck's commitment to diversity and inclusion in its 2021/2022 Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Progress Report.View original content here.Merck &amp; Co., Inc., Wednesday, November 16, 2022, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Merck &amp; Co., Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Merck &amp; Co., Inc.Website: http://www.merck.com/about/corporate-responsibility/home.htmlEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Merck &amp; Co., Inc.View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/726290/Climate-Change-How-Its-Affecting-Your-Health-and-How-Businesses-Can-Help-Fight-This-Global-Crisis]"

The drug generated sales worth $298.8 million in the first nine months of 2022, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 11.8%. Korlym has been a consistent revenue driver since its approval.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCorcept's other pipeline candidates are also progressing with several data readouts, expected later this year and next year.CORT’s lead pipeline candidate, relacorilant, is being evaluated in phase III of the GRACE study to treat Cushing’s syndrome. Enrollment is currently ongoing in said study. A new drug application for relacorilant is expected to be submitted in the second half of 2023.Relacorilant is also being investigated in the phase III of the GRADIENT study in patients, whose Cushing’s syndrome is caused by adrenal adenoma. Enrollment in this study is ongoing.Corcept is also evaluating relacorilant in combination studies for treating solid tumors. The pivotal phase III ROSELLA study is evaluating relacorilant in combination with nab-paclitaxel for the treatment of patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.A phase Ib study is evaluating relacorilant in combination with Merck’s MRK blockbuster PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor, Keytruda (pembrolizumab), for treating patients suffering from adrenal cancer along with cortisol excess.Merck’s biggest revenue generator, Keytruda, is approved for treating several types of cancer indications. MRK continues to study Keytruda for addressing more cancer indications.Story continuesSuccessful development of relacorilant for additional indications will be an added boost to the company.Last month, CORT initiated the phase II DAZALS study evaluating its pipeline candidate, dazucorilant, for treating patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a destructive neuromuscular illness.The company is evaluating miricorilant in the phase II GRATITUDE study for treating the reversal of antipsychotic-induced weight gain (“AIWG”). The phase II GRATITUDE 2 study is investigating miricorilant to reverse long-standing AIWG. Data from both studies are expected later in 2022.CORT is conducting a phase Ib dose-finding study evaluating miricorilant in patients with presumed non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Data from the same is also expected in the first half of 2023.The successful development and potential approval of other candidates are likely to lend a boost to Corcept’s stock and should lower its dependence on Korlym.However, the company remains heavily dependent on Korlym for growth. Moreover, its pipeline is still some time away from commercialization and generating incremental sales. Hence, a decline in Korlym sales is likely to significantly hurt the company’s prospects.Corcept Therapeutics Incorporated PriceCorcept Therapeutics Incorporated PriceCorcept Therapeutics Incorporated price | Corcept Therapeutics Incorporated QuoteZacks Rank &amp; Stocks to ConsiderCorcept currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Dylan Pacholek / SkiftThe head of an influential aircraft lessor expects more airline consolidation in Europe, naming Scandinavia’s SAS, Italy’s ITA, and TAP Air Portugal as possible takeover candidates.“Those are the main targets,” said Air Lease Corporation’s Steven Udvar-Házy on Wednesday at the Skift Aviation Forum in Dallas. Udvar-Házy is often called the founder of the aircraft leasing business.Europe is already heavily consolidated, he explained, citing the three large groups that dominate European long-haul travel, namely International Airlines Group, Air France-KLM, and the Lufthansa Group. Regarding the continent’s low-cost carriers, Udvar-Házy is more skeptical about mergers.“The egos are pretty strong,” he said.He separately spoke of current strength in demand for aircraft, especially narrowbodies, following the many difficulties airlines had in trying to meet a sudden surge in demand following the Covid crisis.“Airlines grossly underestimated the resurgence in demand as the pandemic died out in the early part of this year,” Udvar-Házy said.At the same time, Airbus and Boeing have been unable to meet demand, constrained by their own supply chain and regulatory challenges. At Air Lease itself this year, “we haven’t gotten one airplane on time.” Especially bad are delays in getting Airbus A321neos. For those popular planes, delays have been as long as six to seven months, Udvar-Házy said.He separately spoke about Asia’s lagging recovery, about exceptional strength in transatlantic markets, Latin America’s rapid pace of air traffic growth, and the future of EVTOLs, or electric airplanes. He also said labor relations are a growing challenge for the world’s airlines, as unions are “flexing their muscles” in response to strong demand and tight supply for pilots and other aviation workers.Asked about the likelihood of Airbus and Boeing building a next-generation narrowbody plane to succeed the current A320 and B737 families, respectively, Udvar-Házy responded with skepticism. The technology simply doesn’t yet exist to make it economical for airlines. There hasn’t yet been “a meaningful step-change improvement.” Turning to the next-generation of widebodies, he said Boeing’s new and long-delayed B777-X faces difficult prospects. “They will lose money on every airplane.”Nor is he especially optimistic about aircraft delivery delays easing any time soon. “They will get worse before they get better,” Udvar-Házy said.Get breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.]"

The deal will serve the U.S. Navy and Federal Republic of Germany. The majority of work related to this contract will be executed in Germany’s Ottobrunn.How Will the Deal Favor Raytheon?Increasing geopolitical tensions worldwide have prompted nations to strengthen their defense systems manifold. With rapid technological upgrades, missile defense has steadily become pivotal in a nation’s defense strategy. With the United States being the world’s largest weapon supplier and Raytheon being a prominent U.S. missile maker, the increased missile defense adoption by nations offers the company solid growth opportunities.Raytheon’s RAM guided missile weapon system is the world's most modern ship self-defense weapon and is designed to provide exceptional protection for ships of all sizes. RAM is currently deployed on more than 165 ships in 11 countries, ranging from 500-ton fast attack craft to 95,000-ton aircraft carriers. With these advanced weaponry in its portfolio, Raytheon enjoys solid demand in the defense space. The latest contract is expected to boost the company’s top line in the coming quarters.Looking AheadPer a report by the Allied Market Research firm, the global rocket and missile market is projected to expand at a CAGR of 4.2% during the 2022-2031 period to reach $82 million by 2031.

177,fec008bb-1c01-35d9-bea2-63bde17e627d,CI,2022-11-17,An Intrinsic Calculation For Cigna Corporation (NYSE:CI) Suggests It's 48% Undervalued,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intrinsic-calculation-cigna-corporation-nyse-120020780.html,1668686420,STORY,['CI'],"[Today we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of Cigna Corporation (NYSE:CI) as an investment opportunity by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Cigna The ModelWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$8.18bUS$10.0bUS$8.60bUS$9.01bUS$9.14bUS$9.28bUS$9.44bUS$9.61bUS$9.79bUS$9.97bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x4Analyst x4Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 1.44%Est @ 1.6%Est @ 1.71%Est @ 1.79%Est @ 1.85%Est @ 1.89% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.6% US$7.7kUS$8.8kUS$7.1kUS$7.0kUS$6.6kUS$6.3kUS$6.0kUS$5.7kUS$5.5kUS$5.2k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$66bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.6%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$10.0b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (6.6%– 2.0%) = US$218bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$218b÷ ( 1 + 6.6%)10= US$115bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$180b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$307, the company appears quite undervalued at a 48% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Cigna as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.6%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.910. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Next Steps:Although the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?

They also discuss Cordani's dedication to his own health, including daily morning workouts no matter where he is in the world.Listen to the episode or read the full transcript below.TranscriptAlan Murray: Leadership Next is powered by the folks at Deloitte, who, like me, are super focused on how CEOs can lead in the context of disruption and evolving societal expectations. Welcome to Leadership Next, the podcast about the changing rules of business leadership.I'm Alan Murray, and—you're laughing already, Ellen—I'm here with my fantabulous co-host, Ellen McGirt. Ellen, hope you're feeling healthy. I hope you're feeling well. And I hope you're feeling vital.Ellen McGirt: I am feeling all of these things, and not just because I'm in proximity to greatness today, but also because I work in a place where I can bring my whole self to everything that I do. So I'm feeling very fulfilled. Alan, how about you?Murray: I feel exactly the same way. It could have to do with it's Monday. So I'm glad we're both at the top of our game because we have a health care expert with us today. He is Dave Cordani, who is the CEO of Cigna. We've wanted to do this, Ellen and I both wanted to do this for a long time. Thank you so much for taking the time to be here. By the way, folks, he is in studio.Dave Cordani: Good to be with you all. A lot of energy. A lot of energy to chase here. I've got to get up my game.Murray: Get ready, get ready. Here we go. So you were at the Fortune Brainstorm health conference back in May. And I remember sitting there listening to you thinking, boy, it sounds like we are on the cusp of a revolution in primary care. I remember one of the things you said was that we're changing the paradigm. So instead of you going to get health care, thanks to data, new technology, health care is going to come to you. Explain that.Story continuesCordani: So if you think about the health care delivery equation for most people, they access health care oftentimes when in need of health services because of sickness, less for preventative. And secondly, we physically go to a place to access health care, so it's less convenient, it's a bit delayed, sometimes it's fragmented. Technology presents an opportunity to expand on that. So to bring health care more real time personal, connected to an individual, oftentimes through virtual care, or reenvisioning what could happen in the home aided by technology, not to disintermediate or cut out interaction between a physical physician but to extend that from that standpoint.And we've already seen some tremendous innovation relative to that within our company through our MD live programs, through our integrated virtual care programs, through new depression and anxiety programs that again, extend the care equation to programs that are in flight already. If you look at just virtual care or virtual care services are up about 20% for the first nine months of this year versus the first nine months of last year and we all know virtual care was up significantly last year because of COVID. Our new depression and anxiety program is already in the market. A new musculoskeletal program that has digital interaction in virtual interaction is in the market today as we speak. So it's upon us now and it will continue to grow and evolve. The important part is to do it patientcentric and with the medical professionals, not technology centric or in spite of the medical professional, so patientcentric or customercentric and coordinating with the medical professionals.McGirt: This is fantastic information. I mean, clearly the pandemic was the best use case for for virtual medicine. If you were not a believer, I certainly am now. I'm curious about two things. One is how is this going to play out in communities that are already underserved by by access to health care. Can this be something that can replace medical infrastructure? Will they be able to have access?Cordani: So if we think about areas that have less access, let's look at it through a couple lenses. First, let's go rural. From a rural standpoint, we typically have less access to a variety of services. This is an opportunity to extend services and bring them into rural locations. And extend best in class medical providers whether they're primary, behavioral, certain specialists, etc. Secondly, we can reenvision what takes place in inner cities through youth centers, through community centers, etc. and create kiosks where it may not be as convenient to be literally in the home from a technological standpoint, but having the additional access. And then lastly, through the virtualization, the advent of mobility, mobile mobile devices exist almost everywhere. So yes, it is an extender.It's not a silver bullet but if you think about it, maybe we have a shortage of medical behavioral professionals in some geographies. But if we use technology to extend those individuals, you're able to manage that shortage or create some level of balance from a supply standpoint. So we see it as an equalizer or an extender of services for subsets of the population or subsets of the geographies that don't have access to the care they need today.McGirt: My follow-up then is the enormous body of work and research that you've been you've been collecting for a while. It sounds like the way we're talking about this is brand new, but I know that you've been thinking about this for a long time. I want to highlight your loneliness research, your resilience research and in the most recent research, particularly on the mental health of girls and young women coming out of the pandemic. First of all, tell us about this research and how it builds on itself and how do you use it to make investment decisions.Cordani: As an organization we're guided by a mission and it's important step back and be instructed by that. Our mission is to improve the health well-being and peace of mind of those we serve. So guided by our mission multiple years ago, we stepped back and said, we believe there's a societal issue, and we talked about it in terms of loneliness, but we didn't want to theorize that, we wanted to study and measure it. So we collaborated, which is what our company does, we partner and collaborate with academics and researchers, etc. And fielded quite interesting and somewhat disturbing research that tells us in the United States we have a loneliness epidemic. And we're able to see that about 50% of people have somewhat high levels of loneliness and our youth are the most lonely from that standpoint.We then did a body of work around resilience and we understand resilience is one's ability to, if you will bounce back from challenges, to oversimplify And historically, resilience would dip for young teens, goes down troughs and comes back up. With the pandemic it started to decrease earlier, trough was deeper and it lasted longer. And you attach it to the back end of your statement that instructed us to see that during COVID we saw a 51% increase of young ladies teens presenting in emergency rooms for attempted suicide. And a program we've already referenced previously was our depression and anxiety programming virtual virtually online depression anxiety program, because you need to bring the service immediately to somebody and having matching capabilities that we can best match an individual to a therapist through the use of data. So more real time, you don't have to wait two or three weeks for an appointment. Higher probability that the first person you're interacting with you have a match with and then then you have an opportunity for continuity. So back to guided by our mission. We continue to be instructed by where and how can we best understand life and how we could help to maintain and or improve someone's quality of life as we talk to her about health, well-being and peace of mindMurray: That 50% increase in suicide attempts by teenage girls. That's a scary number. Are you succeeding in reaching those goals?Cordani: So we think health care is personal. And all health care is local. So as a large global health service company that has 190 million customer relations around the world, we now need to boil that down to one person at a time. So yes, we are but it's a journey. That's not a way of describing away the challenge. It's a matter of leaning into the challenge. It's one person at a time highly localized, supporting our medical professionals, supporting our employers and expanding the reach of programs so we can interact with people earlier in their need state as opposed to later in their need state when it's more catastrophic.Murray: I wanted to get to the mental health piece a bit more because you deal primarily as an employer-provided health care insurance, correct? I have to tell you, I mean, this is something that we had a group of CEOs in in Florida just last week, and this was top of mind for many of them. This is something that in terms of CEO awareness has exploded during the pandemic. Maybe it was there before, but it's getting a lot more attention now. Do we have the programs in place to deal with an epidemic of mental health problems?Cordani: Before we jump in a little bit, yes, we serve individuals through employers through our benefits program, as well as through our Evernorth services. We're also a large provider of services to other health plans through our Evernorth services. We're the largest provider of services like mental health, virtual care, care coordination, especially pharmaceuticals, other health plans. Also to governmental agencies like the Department of Defense and then increasingly physician-lead organization from that standpoint. So we serve a broad swath all with the objective of touching more lives.Back to from an employer standpoint, you're absolutely right, Alan. Employers now have this front and center, they understand the impact. They see the impact. The impact is actually driven by an understanding of workplace engagement, presenteeism, productivity, turnover. They can now see the data to say that if someone is dealing with a mental health challenge himself or in the family unit, they carry that into the workplace virtual or otherwise. It reduces their productivity and engagement and it reduces the productivity and engagement of those around them. So whether an employer enters this through a philosophical lens or through a business-led lens, it brings it to the same place. We have to step up with expanded dialogue, awareness programs and services around that and we think that's a positive. It's a positive that more people are embracing this proactively as opposed to reactively.McGirt: It's so interesting. When you when you're talking about mental health, are you also talking about addiction, is that is that part of it?Cordani: One-hundred percent. So when I think about it, you think about historically as a country, and globally, when we were talking about mental health, we typically talk about mental health and substance abuse and or addiction. Now extend that continuum stress, anxiety, depression, more complex behavior health, addiction, substance abuse, etc. It's that broader continuum. In the early on, entree to it, the stress, anxiety and depression oftentimes leads to more abusive behaviors, substance abuse or otherwise.Murray: And maybe that's the answer to my next question, but what I was going to say was, you know, the first thing I hear from CEOs now around this issue is mental health and the effects of the pandemic and pandemic fatigue and all these things going on in the workplace. But the second thing is, health care just gets more and more expensive and they don't want you to reduce the cost. Can you do both? You're being asked to take over a larger part of these employees lives, but do it at a lower cost.Cordani: So there's no doubt health care is expensive. It's increasingly one of the larger expense items on an employer's income statement from that standpoint. So first, you need to be instructed by why is health care costs, what it is, why is it going up. Let's talk about why it's going up. The U.S. population is aging, the global population is aging. With that comes more...Murray: Can you stop that?[Laughter]McGirt: Asking for a friend.[More laughter]Cordani: In some ways, you could you could modify the curve, right? So it comes down to quality as opposed to the chronology dimension. So we take the aging curve, then you take lifestyle. A lot of health care costs correlate to lifestyle, sedentary lifestyle, do you exercise or not food intake, balanced or not? Alcohol consumption, balanced or not? Smoking? Yes, no. Those are the four major lifestyle events that come into play. And then we have new innovations. We lead the world from an innovative standpoint in terms of device or especially pharmaceuticals from that standpoint. So those are pushing costs up.What are the opportunities to reduce cost? How do you keep somebody healthy in the first place? How do you identify somebody who is healthy at risk and lower the risks? 25% of the population is healthy at risk. That's 80 plus million Americans who you can identify with the right information. Are they going to have a coronary event down the road or are they high risk for certain cancers or are they in a pre-diabetic state? Or is the expecting mom likely to deliver prematurely?Murray: So what do you tell CEOs who are worried about the mental health crisis and trying to figure out whether they're doing enough to address it?Cordani: In many cases over the last, let's say the last decade, there have been a lot of innovations in the health and wellbeing space, including behavioral health, that the market knows as point solutions. So if you bear with me, employers will buy another solution, another solution, another solution, all with the noble objective of helping your company helping their co workers etc. And in many cases, what's happening right now is employers and CEOs are sitting back and saying, there's a mental health and behavioral challenge that I have. I've invested in and I have 10, 15, 20 disparate programs. Maybe I need to step back and look at it wholesale. Because what I've done is I've pushed too many fragmented alternative choices to my employees, and some are benefiting from but the whole definitely are not. So employers are stepping back almost in a redesign, a bit of a strategic redesign to the benefit programs, which we think is very constructive, because in many cases, the individual was left as the kind of general contractor having to pull these solutions together. And now there's more coordination of those programs and services that companies like ours bring forward and employers are stepping back and revisiting what they're offering.The second part that I think is important is more and more CEOs are looking at these decisions like any other long term strategic investment they make, which is also very healthy, as opposed to an annual budgetary item on the expense base. Because at the end of the day, their company is fueled by their people, and their people's health and well being or engagement and productivity are interrelated. So you see them making much more strategic decisions.[Music]Murray: I'm here with Joe Ucuzoglu, CEO of Deloitte US, and had the good sense to sponsor this podcast. Joe, thanks for being with us. And thanks for your support.Joe Ucuzoglu: Pleasure to be here.Murray: So during the pandemic, we saw a real shift in how people view mental health and well being and how they incorporate it into their daily lives. People were under such stress, learning to work from home but also dealing with the challenges of caregiving and family life. Is this shift going to mean a reset in how we approach mental health and well-being overall?Ucuzoglu: Alan, this has absolutely been one of the biggest themes coming out of the last couple of years. The impact of pandemic isolation, uncertainty, fear, on people's mental health, and in some ways, it's caused the topic to be much more openly discussed for people to come forward, get the help and the resources they need. And that's a real sea change and one that we need to sustain.Murray: So what's your advice to leaders who are trying to figure out how to deal with that sea change?Ucuzoglu: This is an area where companies can do so much good providing the necessary support, access for counseling, tools to help drive overall wellbeing, and increasingly, you're going to see this become a bigger component of people deciding what type of organization they want to work at. And the tone has to be set at the top. Continuous reinforcement by leaders, acknowledging the challenges, reinforcing support for their people and supporting new work models that contribute to well-being.Murray: Thank you, Joe.[End of music]McGirt: Well, let me ask you about the human side of all of this. In an earlier iteration of my now lengthy career I was a pretty devoted health care reporter. And I spend a lot of time on that interface of new technologies and what it means for a health care provider and what it means for a patient. I think you know better than anybody else is that if you had a major surgery, and you talk to your doctor the next day and they told you to do this, this and this, you were likely to do it. You weren't likely to do it if you got an email or a text or something, like the human piece of it. How are you thinking about technology changing the way that you can reach more people but still making sure that people feel connected to a human being that cares about them? Because that seems new to me.Cordani: Yeah, I think your connected nature, that theme of connection, yeah, if you come back to the word vitality later. Let me give you an example. We launched this year, Pathwell bone and joint programs. In the United States about 50% of Americans have a bone, joint or musculoskeletal challenge. About 50%. So we're there. The United States also leads the world in low back surgical interventions. There are other alternative paths for individuals to pursue. So by presenting the more complete information and helping an individual understand through their physician there are choices and alternatives, and then keeping the line communication open. We see more people choosing not to have surgery, but their choice, in consultation with their trusted provider, acting in physical therapy and other lifestyle adjustments. And having a more complete outcome from that standpoint. That's an example of using information but it's patient or customercentric. One person at a time with a medical professional presenting choices, pros and cons and alternatives. That's more of the bright spots that are transpiring. But I agree with you, it's the human connection, and it's whoever a patient trusts, enabling them to have the best complete fact based information. And then lastly, having the reward or the payment program, reward based on quality of outcome not just volume of services consumed. When you close that circle, really positive things transpire for the patient or customer.Murray: You used the word vitality just a minute ago, and I know Cigna recently launched a vitality index. What's that all about?Cordani: So as we talked earlier on, we're guided by our mission and we stepped back and say, okay, where does this take us? Where does health and wellbeing take us and we concluded that vitality was the most comprehensive definition of an ability to thrive, an ability to excel, an ability for an individual to obviously be their best self at all given points of time.Back to just like the loneliness work, we did resilience work. We wanted to make sure we understood it and had a way of measuring and guiding it. So we collaborated, developed a vitality index with a thought leader, were able to over almost a year, validate the datasets and draw some conclusions from it. Preliminary conclusions whereby individuals that have higher levels of vitality as measured through the index. Let's go through the employer landscape tend to have higher productivity, higher engagement, higher job satisfaction, lower turnover from that standpoint. And by the way, back to the PowerPoint, they also tend to have a close working relationship with a physician. Right? They have a trusted partner, right? Those that have lower vitality measures tend to have lower levels of engagement at work, lower levels of productivity, higher probability of turning over and a lower percentage of them have a relationship with a physician—we call them primary care, OB-GYN, geriatrician, etc.—that they trust to be their navigator or portal to care from that standpoint.And then from the vitality index, we carry that forward to use it as a tool. We can measure it at a community level, we can measure it at an employer level, and then design programs and solutions that could advance the level of vitality. Because vitality means helping individual perform at their respective highest level. What sits at the foundation of it is health. With your health, you could pursue vitality, spiritual vitality, community vitality, etc. Without your health that's a fundamental foundational building block, almost Maslow's hierarchy of food, water, shelter, health sits at the foundational level of that.McGirt: I do have some leadership questions but I do have to make a Fortune quip here is that at some point, somebody in our newsroom is going to try to link the vitality index to revenue right? Like the most vital organizations are the most financially productive organization. That's coming. You know that.Cordani: I think that's a great correlation to make. high engagement, hybrid productivity, low turnover passionate coworkers, make for successful corporations.McGirt: And that leads me to my leadershipy question, which is really about the stakeholder world that we're walking into. Because I think that's really important. You've mentioned several times that your co-innovators, that your co-partners, and even in your acquisitions a long time coming, you had already partnered with people before you began to work and integrate your your paths together. What have you learned about creating partnerships that work?Cordani: So interesting. I love your phraseology, leadershipy questions. We believe deeply and I personally believe deeply that leadership starts with great listening skills. So as an organization, we believe deeply and we state one of our strategic imperatives is we seek to be the undisputed partner of choice. We chose those words very carefully, because it's a high order, seek always in pursuit of undisputed and then partner of choice. So then now to your question, whatever is worth working on, find mutuality, do the hard work to find mutual alignment. And the notion of partnering tells us if you're going to try to do a business relationship with either another corporation, a health care provider group, a community organization, and it's going to essentially be a contracted relationship in some way where someone's trying to get 51% and someone 49%? Failed proposition out of the start. Conversely, instead of arguing over who rips the loaf of bread in half, how could we bake more loaves of bread? How could we envision something together that we bake more loaves of bread? And can you collaborate and if you and I are going to partner, is your contribution to me interesting? Is my contribution to you interesting? That's table stakes. The third question is the hard one: is our contribution to society or an addressable market or community a step function. When all three of those work, then you have something to go to work on. And we've had successful collaborations or partnerships all over the world, both commercial as well as community-wise from that standpoint. It doesn't mean we're right, it means we're in the relentless pursuit of working with other like-minded organizations to accelerate and pursue our mission, which is to improve lives.Murray: I want to turn a little bit and talk about your health, your vitality. You're a triathlete, I believe, you know, swim, bike run. Are you still doing that?Cordani: So last year, I want to make sure I get the years right. 2021 was my 30th anniversary. So last summer I went back into the race I started back in 1991. So it was my 30th anniversary race. So I've raced for 30 years save one year when I had to have knee surgery. This year, I'm not racing, believe it or not, I'm dealing with a back injury.Murray: Wow, sorry to hear that.Cordani: So modified a little bit but a very active lifestyle. I work out every morning and maintain my fitness level.Murray: How do you how do you find time to do that? I mean, Cigna is a big company. You have a big job with incredible demands on your time. How do you manage to make that work?Cordani: Like all of us, all your listeners, life's busy, there's no doubt about it. And everybody's juggling. It's a matter of prioritization. So I find that I am more effective if I get a workout in every morning, no matter where I am, no matter where I am in the world. A month ago I was in Dubai with my colleagues visiting our Middle East operations, you know your timezone upside down, etc. Every morning, I was there for three mornings, I got my workout in the morning for an hour. So it's a matter of discipline. And I find that the physical health is as important as the mental health. I get aligned around my day ahead. I'm able to digest the news in some way shape or form using you know, devices and otherwise, I'm able to get a good workout, get centered and be ready to take on the day ahead. And it's a part of my life. It's a part of the way I live.Murray: You haven't mentioned sleep, which is also part of vitality. Do you get a good night's sleep in?Cordani: Most of the time. Most of the time I do and sleep is quite important. So it's back to trying to be disciplined relative to that. So breaking out you're finding your own personal recipe. I work a lot because I love what I do. I feel very fortunate to do what I do. I've been with Cigna Corporation for over 31 years and I've been in the CEO seat for 13 years. And I remind myself how fortunate I am to help pursue our mission. So we have two children, active part of the children's lives, the physical activity, try to get a reasonable amount of sleep and be disciplined relative to that, and then like everybody else, be human and understand how to adjust those dials all the time. Right. You have to be mindful of adjusting the dials up or down a little bit all the time.McGirt: Can I ask the question about how you think about the future? I'm thinking back to, you've been at Cigna a long time. You mentioned CEO since 2009. I don't know what you imagined the job was going to be what the future was going to be then. I don't think that most people thought that climate change and the effects of climate change and how that was going to impact people's health and well being was part of the remit it clearly is now. I don't think people necessarily thought about race and violence and discrimination, how that's going to be part of the health and wealth conversation, but it is now. So I'm curious how you think about the future? What are the big things that you need to be solving for now, 30 40 years down the line to make sure that you're you're continuing to go in the right direction and partnering and all the right ways.Cordani: It's a big question. I come at it a couple different ways. We've been quite fortunate. We've grown our company in excess of 10% for the last dozen years. And we've done that by managing the present and having an eye toward the future. And if I think now to the core of your question, some of the forces of change, you articulate, there'll be new ones, there will be new ones 10 years from now that we'll be talking about, but I think it'll be a constant in the middle and that is the humans' drive. The human dimensional drive for satisfaction, fulfillment and the ability to be a productive part of society and the environment around us and I don't mean that in terms of climate, climate, the environment around us being safe and allowing a diverse group of individuals to learn, thrive and excel. As a global health service company when we started talking about our journey 13 years ago, health, well being and at that time, we talked about sense of security, those were not phrases that were used in our space. Investing in wellness programs at the rate and pace we're investing in, in a services-based environment were not the way we were talking about them today. I'm not saying we were right and others were not. We had an eye toward helping to improve people's lives. We had an eye toward helping to figure out how do you reward physicians for not providing services that should not be provided.Back to the future, technology and data will provide fuel for step function, step function, massive change to what we do. But in the center, there will always be a person and there will always be a medical professional that needs to be connected in a highly personalized way. And lifestyle, quality of life and behavior will be a centerpiece in terms of someone's overall health and well being. And our job is to help individuals thrive, corporations thrive, communities thrive from that standpoint, which brings us back to vitality.Murray: You've been doing it for a long time. I mean, the average CEO tenure is about half of what you've already done.Cordani: I am very fortunate to be part of Cigna where back in the 08 09 financial meltdown when companies were going through the reformatting, I had an opportunity and we're a company that believes in that mission that we always come back to. What drives our colleagues around the globe is the opportunity to impact someone's life for the better every day. And the mission we have of improving the health, well being and peace of mind of those we serve, and the partnering notion we talked about, and relentless change. But that relentless change comes back to one person at a time and acknowledgement that all health care is local. And that's what fuels our innovation in some of the new services we talked about today that we've already brought forth in the marketplace are instructed by that.Murray: Ellen should we let this man get back to saving lives and making people healthier?McGirt: No. It practically runs itself at this point. [Laughter.] He can stay and answer questions.Cordani: Ellen, I'll tell people you suggested I take a year off.McGirt: Just a couple more minutes. That's all.Murray: Thank you so much. Fascinating conversation.Cordani: Good to be with both of you. Thank you so much.McGirt: You're a good sport.Murray: Leadership Next is edited by Nicole Vergalla, written by me, Alan Murray, along with my amazing colleagues, Ellen McGirt and Megan Arnold.

But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors? We'll need to take a closer look to find out.The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.Currently, Kyocera has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while TE Connectivity has a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell). This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that KYOCY is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.KYOCY currently has a forward P/E ratio of 14.56, while TEL has a forward P/E of 18.25. We also note that KYOCY has a PEG ratio of 1.66. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. TEL currently has a PEG ratio of 2.54.Another notable valuation metric for KYOCY is its P/B ratio of 0.74. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities.

With intense competitive rivalry in the industry, the leading companies have continued to provide product differentiation with a dynamic approach to meet the changing trends. The clothing or apparel industry in the world has been one of the most important industries for trade, investments, employment and revenue generation globally. The industry revolves around short product life cycles, changing consumer demands due to fashion dynamics, product differentiation and brand image building.The consumers in the clothing industry have high bargaining power as they have increased demand for more variety, more functionality and more new styles to meet the changing fashion needs worldwide.  In recent years, the clothing industry has faced multiple challenges due to the economic downturn globally. These challenges had different impacts on different markets. In emerging markets, growth potential increased. There was a slow-paced recovery in the US markets, and a decline in Western Europe.

During the pandemic, the companies in the apparel industry were hit badly. However, they have managed to rise again with increasing sales revenue and brand value. The revenue of the global clothing industry was recorded at approximately $1.5 trillion as of 2021. It is notably the U.S. and China which have the highest demands for clothing than any other country. Nevertheless, emerging markets have fueled the sales revenue of the leading clothing companies in the recent years. More interestingly, according to Statista, it is expected the global clothing industry’s revenue will hit $1.9 trillion target by 2025 and reach $2 trillion by year 2026. Some of the top firms in the sector include The TJX Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TJX), American Eagle Outfitters, Inc. (NYSE:AEO), and NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE). Story continuesOur MethodologyThese companies were picked after a careful assessment of the clothing industry.

UNIQLO, founded in 1949 by Tadashi Yanai, is headquartered at Midtown Tower, Akasaka, Tokyo, Japan with a total number of 56,000 employees as of 2021.In the past, the company was labeled as a discounted retail store selling low quality apparel to the sub urban areas. However, in 2004, through a Global Quality Declaration, the company made a pledge to focus on high quality and affordability, which ultimately changed the company’s brand perception and image worldwide. UNIQLO’s fleece jackets are very popular for their high-quality casual wear. Interestingly, the company is the largest apparel chain in Asia with over 800 stores in Japan alone. The company’s processes, beginning from project planning, design, and manufacturing till distribution, are all in-house, which gives a competitive edge to the company. The supply chain is cost effective as well as efficient to meet the changing demands of the global markets. According to the founder, UNIQLO is known to be a trend-driven and technology driven company to meet the uncertain, dynamic and highly challenging demands of the global industry.

The French luxury brand is known for its prestigious, exclusive watches and jewelry. However, it has a selective clothing range which has made it rank in the top 10 clothing brands worldwide. Cartier has released a new collection for the year 2022, bringing more novel and unique designs.  The company’s CEO Cyrille Vigneron emphasized in an April 2022 meeting that the company will increase its prices but stressed it will be a mild price hike only. The current economic situation globally has given a slight push to the luxury brands to redesign their marketing strategies. More focus is on digital transformation and brand imaging in order to survive and maintain the leading position in the global markets. 8. H&amp;MH&amp;M is ranked as the eighth biggest clothing brand in the world with a brand value of $12.70 billion.

Online sales have risen in recent years, jumping by 77% in year 2021, representing a third of all sales. Digital transformation has helped Zara achieve its growth targets and meet the changing demands of the global markets. The company’s CEO, Isla Pablo, has highlighted that both the physical stores and online stores will together be expanded by year 2022 to provide uninterrupted buying experience to the customers worldwide. 6. HermèsHermès is ranked as the sixth biggest clothing brand in the world with a brand value of $13.49 billion.

188,8290675b-938e-39e0-9a0f-b6605d58b122,NKE,2022-11-17,Nike (NKE) Cheers Investors With Dividend Hike Amid Cost Woes,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nike-nke-cheers-investors-dividend-145002813.html,1668610202,STORY,"['NKE', 'BYD']","[Nike, Inc. NKE announced that its board of directors approved a quarterly cash dividend hike of 11% to 34 cents per share. The quarterly dividend will be paid out on Dec 28, 2022, to shareholders of record at the close of business on Dec 5, 2022. This brings the new annualized dividend to $1.22 per share, resulting in a dividend yield of 1.1%. Also, this marked the 21st consecutive year of increasing dividend payouts.The dividend increase is likely to come as a relief for investors since the company raised concerns about increased freight and logistic costs despite sales growth. This, along with higher markdowns and currency headwinds, remain concerning.In first-quarter fiscal 2023, NIKE’s gross margin contracted 220 basis points (bps) to 44.3%. SG&amp;A expenses rose 10% year over year in the fiscal first quarter due to higher operating overhead and demand-creating expenses. Consequently, NIKE’s earnings per share of 93 cents in first-quarter fiscal 2023 decreased 19.8% from $1.16 reported in the year-ago quarter.Owing to these factors, the company provided a bleak view for the second quarter and fiscal 2023, driven by expectations of higher markdowns during the holiday season and slowed demand for NIKE's brands, including Jordan and Converse, stemming from reduced discretionary spending.For fiscal 2023, management anticipates low-double-digit revenue growth on a currency-neutral basis and revenue growth of low to mid-single digits on a reported basis. We expect currency-neutral revenue growth of 13% for fiscal 2023. For second-quarter fiscal 2023, revenues are expected to grow in the low-double digits.This Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company envisions fiscal 2023 gross margin contraction of 200-250 bps, including 150 bps of adverse impacts of significant markdowns and higher off-price mix to liquidate elevated inventory, along with more than 100 bps headwinds related to elevated freight and logistic costs, and unfavorable currency impact of 70 bps. For second-quarter fiscal 2023, the gross margin is likely to decline 350-400 bps year over year.For fiscal 2023, SG&amp;A expenses are predicted to rise in the high-single digits due to increased investment in new transformational capabilities, partly offset by reduced expenses and limited headcount growth across the business. We expect demand-creating expenses to increase 10.1% year over year in fiscal 2023.Also, the company has been witnessing currency headwinds due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. For fiscal 2023, the company expects foreign currency to hurt reported revenue growth by 800 bps. In second-quarter fiscal 2023, the company expects adverse currency rates to hurt revenues by 900 bps.However, Nike remains well-poised on the back of brand strength, robust consumer demand and an innovative product pipeline. Its Consumer Direct Acceleration strategy, along with robust performance in its digital and DTC businesses, bodes well.NIKE has been benefiting from its efficient digital ecosystem, which comprises its online site as well as commercial and activity apps. In the fiscal first quarter, NIKE Brand Digital revenues improved 16% on a reported basis and 23% on a currency-neutral basis on double-digit growth across EMEA, North America and APLA. Also, revenues grew 4% year over year and 10% on a currency-neutral basis.Coming to the latest news, the company has a five-year annualized dividend growth rate of 10.8%, reflecting dividend increases for five consecutive years. It boasts a current dividend payout ratio of 34.6%. NKE’s return on equity of 14.8% compares favorably with the industry’s 14.2%, underscoring management's efficiency in rewarding shareholders.Nike’s ability to reward shareholders with dividends and buybacks is backed by a strong cash flow and revenue generation capacity. The company’s annualized cash flow growth rate has been 6.8% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 9.4%.Dividend payouts are the biggest enticements for investors and Nike is committed to boosting shareholders’ wealth. In fiscal 2022, the company paid out $5.8 billion in dividends to shareholders. In first-quarter fiscal 2023, NKE returned $1.5 billion to shareholders, including $1 billion in share repurchases and $480 million in dividends.All said, Nike’s impressive fundamentals, strong footing in the industry and solid portfolio make it a promising stock. NKE draws further investor attention through its regular dividend payouts and commitment to enhancing shareholder returns.Story continues Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research We note that shares of the company have lost 9.4% in the past three months but came ahead of the industry’s decline of 11.2%.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked companies from the Consumer Discretionary sector are lululemon athletica LULU, Boyd Gaming BYD and Crocs CROX.lululemon presently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

(NKE) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nike-inc-nke-trending-stock-140002105.html,1668607202,STORY,['NKE'],"[Nike (NKE) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this athletic apparel maker have returned +19%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +11.4% change. During this period, the Zacks Shoes and Retail Apparel industry, which Nike falls in, has gained 19.9%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Nike is expected to post earnings of $0.66 per share, indicating a change of -20.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.4% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $2.97 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -20.8%. This estimate has changed -3.9% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.75 indicates a change of +26.1% from what Nike is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -4.4%.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for Nike.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for NKE _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Nike, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $12.58 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +10.8%. For the current and next fiscal years, $48.97 billion and $52.84 billion estimates indicate +4.8% and +7.9% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryNike reported revenues of $12.69 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +3.6%. EPS of $0.93 for the same period compares with $1.16 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.33 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.91%. The EPS surprise was +2.2%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Nike is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Nike. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

With 75% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Wells Fargo, beginning with the chart below. Check out our latest analysis for Wells Fargo ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Wells Fargo?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Wells Fargo. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Wells Fargo, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Wells Fargo. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 8.6% of shares outstanding. With 6.9% and 4.2% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.Story continuesOur studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Wells FargoThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Wells Fargo &amp; Company in their own names. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$133m of stock. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 25% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 1 warning sign  with Wells Fargo , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

The company is facing currency flactuation and pricing pressure which are key top-line headwinds. Concerns remain about its long-term growth drivers beyond its COVID-related products due to competitive pressure.However, there is no company as strongly placed in the COVID vaccines/treatment market as Pfizer right now. Its COVID-19 vaccine together with the oral antiviral pill for COVID-19, Paxlovid is expected to generate a combined $54 billion in sales in 2022. Pfizer boasts a sustainable pipeline with multiple late-stage programs that can drive growth.Nevertheless, according to the Zacks analyst estimate Pfizer’s top line suggest a CAGR decline of around 30% over the next three years.

Also, legal hassles and higher dependence on overseas revenues are woes.However, Goldman Sachs has a decent earnings surprise history. Its earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and missed in the other one. The company continues to expand organically and bolster its digital consumer banking platform.Other than business diversification, robust client engagement, a solid position in announced and completed mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;As), and a decent investment banking (IB) backlog are likely to aid in navigating weaker markets.

The company supply chain disruptions, including labor and material shortages and high logistics costs are weighing on the company’s performance. Weakness in the Power and Renewable energy segment due to lower volumes is concerning.Foreign currency headwinds are hurting the company’s top line. The company’s strong performance of the Aerospace and Healthcare segments is driving General Electric’s growth.

However, total losses seen by insiders are still US$729k but in since the time of purchase.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. See our latest analysis for Fox Fox Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single purchase by an insider was when Executive Chairman &amp; CEO Lachlan Murdoch bought US$4.6m worth of shares at a price of US$36.50 per share. That means that even when the share price was higher than US$30.75 (the recent price), an insider wanted to purchase shares. It's very possible they regret the purchase, but it's more likely they are bullish about the company. To us, it's very important to consider the price insiders pay for shares. Generally speaking, it catches our eye when an insider has purchased shares at above current prices, as it suggests they believed the shares were worth buying, even at a higher price. The only individual insider to buy over the last year was Lachlan Murdoch.The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year.

For those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Insider OwnershipMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Fox insiders own about US$188m worth of shares (which is 1.2% of the company). This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About Fox Insiders?The fact that there have been no Fox insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. On a brighter note, the transactions over the last year are encouraging. It would be great to see more insider buying, but overall it seems like Fox insiders are reasonably well aligned (owning significant chunk of the company's shares) and optimistic for the future. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 3 warning signs for Fox you should know about.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

See our latest analysis for PayPal Holdings The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At PayPal HoldingsThe Executive Vice President of Global Sales, Peggy Alford, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$2.1m worth of shares at a price of US$97.82 each. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. It's of some comfort that this sale was conducted at a price well above the current share price, which is US$87.04. So it may not tell us anything about how insiders feel about the current share price. Peggy Alford was the only individual insider to sell shares in the last twelve months.In the last twelve months insiders purchased 37.68k shares for US$4.4m.

For those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Insider Ownership Of PayPal HoldingsMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders.

PayPal Holdings insiders own about US$124m worth of shares (which is 0.1% of the company). This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The PayPal Holdings Insider Transactions Indicate?There haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much.

We have PayPal, Restaurant Brands International, and Micron on deck. And our very own Brooke DiPalma is joining us. So we'll start with my pick, which is PayPal Holdings, ticker PYPL.Now, PayPal company Happy Returns announcing a return shopping feature really aimed at creating a new free revenue stream for its Shopify merchants, and of course, just in time for the holidays. So instead of sellers getting tied up trying to manage exchanges and creating some accounting headaches, return shopping treats the sale and return as two separate transactions.Now Sanaz Hajizadeh, the director of product management at Happy Returns, wrote in the PayPal blog that, quote, ""Now, more than ever, shoppers' reengagement and revenue retention are key priorities for merchants. It's not enough to make returns easy. Merchants need to account for every dollar and bring shoppers back at every stage. We've created a way to re-engage customers at a critical point in the shopper journey in an innovative way that keeps financial reporting simple.""Now, PayPal Holdings overall did lower expectations for Q4, and they have struggled year to date. The stock is up more than 60%. We're seeing inflation bite. And then of course Target's earning miss also weighing on some of these other retail related firms, Brooke.BROOKE DIPALMA: Now, Rachelle, that reminded me a lot of Kohl's teaming up with Amazon. Ultimately, Kohl's really looking to bring in traffic here, but then actually getting a boost. Of course, they provide those discounts when you give that Amazon return. And then I know I, at least, end up making a purchase. So certainly hoping that this boosts some revenue for those merchants using Shopify, of course.]"

This program applies IBM technologies, such as hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence, and an ecosystem of experts to enhance and scale projects focused on populations vulnerable to environmental threats, including climate change. All new members will focus on accelerating clean energy projects. IBM has previously announced it plans to select five organizations for this program each year and expects to provide $30 million worth of services by the end of 2023.According to the International Energy Agency, the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, disruptions to global supply chains, and diversion of fiscal resources to keep food and fuel prices affordable, have affected the pace of progress toward the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 7) of ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy by 2030.""With the IBM Sustainability Accelerator, we are convening experts and using innovative technologies to help tackle the toughest environmental challenges our planet faces; and transitioning to clean energy is a critical step right now,"" said Justina Nixon-Saintil, Vice President of Corporate Social Responsibility and ESG at IBM. ""With this new cohort, helping marginalized communities get just and equitable access to sustainable energy resources not only helps the world achieve the goal of UN SDG7, but can help in the larger global energy transition.""Story continuesAfter evaluating more than 100 submissions from around the world, IBM selected these organizations to become the clean energy cohort of the program:United Nations Development Programme (UNDP): UNDP is working with IBM to increase access to sustainable, affordable and reliable energy in African countries, focusing on those furthest left behind. The goal is to forecast electricity access to better guide policy and investment decisions, using UNDP's technical knowledge and IBM's artificial intelligence and geospatial analytics.Sustainable Energy for All: IBM is working with Sustainable Energy for All to build an intelligent model to project energy needs based on current and future human activity. This model will be designed to help to address key development challenges (e.g., lack of energy access and poor healthcare) and support the development of robust infrastructure planning, such as electrification plans. IBM machine learning and IBM Cloud technology and expertise will be used to build and scale open-access datasets and an energy needs model using temporal and spatial data. Kenya and India are being explored as the first regions to pilot the model.Net Zero Atlantic: Net Zero Atlantic is collaborating with IBM to create an interactive digital tool that will geospatially display environmental and socioeconomic impacts of possible energy system futures for Nova Scotia. Ultimately, the goal is for Indigenous communities in Nova Scotia to leverage advanced modeling capabilities to inform their input into energy and development planning. The tool aims to be easy-to-use, locally relevant and time efficient. It will be designed to produce easy-to-understand visual results using IBM technology such as the IBM Environmental Intelligence Suite and IBM Cloud.Miyakojima City Government: The Miyakojima City Government is working with IBM to support the development of a renewable energy strategy including a microgrid on Miyakojima Island, a distant community facing severe climate issues due to typhoons in Japan, with the goal of helping their residents, who rely on a clean local environment for the tourist industry and agriculture. Miyakojima City Government and IBM will collaborate to leverage technologies such as IBM Environmental Intelligence Suite weather data and IBM Cloud to model electricity demand and advise energy infrastructure development.Environment Without Borders Foundation: Environment Without Borders Foundation's collaboration with IBM will be aimed to develop a platform to forecast, track, and communicate clean energy usage options in Egypt. The goal is to enable resilient and sustainable infrastructure and operations for clean energy in Egypt, helping residents of remote villages for whom energy is currently both expensive and unreliable. The clean energy management platform will leverage IBM Environmental Intelligence Suite and IBM Cloud.""UNDP is delighted to partner with IBM to forecast electricity access that informs better policy and investment decisions, with an initial concentration on African countries. This partnership advances UNDP's integration mandate and directly contributes to our corporate moonshot to provide 500 million people with access to safe, reliable energy by 2025, focused on reaching the furthest behind first."" - Ahunna Eziakonwa, Assistant Secretary-General, Assistant Administrator and Director of the Regional Bureau for Africa (RBA)""We are excited to be partnering with IBM.

With support from the IBM Sustainability Accelerator, we're creating a tool Indigenous communities in our region can use to assess how renewable energy development could directly benefit and affect them. We'll be working in collaboration with our Indigenous partners to develop technology that reflects their specifications and which will help define their preferred paths to net-zero emissions"" - Alisdair McLean, Executive Director, Net Zero Atlantic""Miyakojima City's critical challenge is to secure stable and low-cost electric power, because of its geographical location as a remote island and its climate issues including typhoons and other natural disasters. So, with the support of IBM's weather forecasting and data analysis resources and consulting support by staff with diverse expertise, we strive to establish efficient power supply means and make clean energy widely available in this region. We expect this initiative could contribute to sustainability of this city in the future."" - Kazuhiko Kakihana, Director, Planning and Policy Department, Miyakojima City Government""I believe that innovative technological applications can be strongly used for linking green energy users together and this is what we seek in our project.Our goal is to harness the power of technology to tackle environmental challenges and support vulnerable communities' livelihood to have a better life."" - Dr. Adel Abdallah Soliman, CEO of Environment Without Borders FoundationThe selection process considered the applicant's commitment to support communities who are especially vulnerable to environmental threats, its ability to increase access to affordable clean energy services, its strategic focus and transparency on measurement and reporting, among others.About IBM Sustainability AcceleratorLaunched in February 2022, the IBM Sustainability Accelerator is a social impact program that addresses multiple environmental threats around the world each year. The accelerator selects 5 projects to scale solutions that benefit communities that face challenges such as climate change, pollution, extreme weather and more.

A spokesperson for the Mexican Automotive Industry Association (AMIA) told Reuters the goal was between 30% and 50%.General Motors is already in the process of converting production at its Ramos Arizpe plant, in the state of Coahuila, to electric vehicles and plans to only produce electric cars at all three of its plants in Mexico by 2035, Garza said.Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard, who has also given the goal of EVs hitting 50% market share by 2030, has cited California's mandate to require all new vehicles sold by 2035 to be electric or plug-in hybrid electrics as inspiration.""The (government's) commitment has been to issue public policies for vehicle electrification by the first half of next year,"" Garza said.Once the policies are published, Garza said, ""We'll have a better idea of what the real volume that can be sold will be through 2030, and hopefully it will be more than the 15% we're projecting.""

But the all-new, fifth-generation 2023 Toyota Prius hybrid may change, at least from the looks point of view.Gone is the boxy, wedge-shaped body with snout nose and staid hatchback design; now it’s sporty, with a longer front end, sedan-like low profile roof design, and something akin to a Tesla Model Y-like hatch.Toyota (TM) says the Prius will have three powertrains, two “mild” hybrids powered by 1.8 liter and 2.0 liter engines with an electric motor, and a plug-in hybrid version using that 2.0 liter engine with a stronger motor and bigger battery. Toyota anticipates the new Prius will go on sale later this year.Toyota Motor Corporation unveils the companys all-new Prius during the World Premiere in Tokyo on November 16, 202 (Photo by Kazuhiro NOGI / AFP) (Photo by KAZUHIRO NOGI/AFP via Getty Images)For Toyota, the all-new Prius is a bet on hybrids sticking around for a long time, even as the world goes fully electric. In fact consumers are still interested, as Consumer Reports sees rising buying sentiment as reliability of at least the mild hybrids stays quite high.Toyota also has reasons to stick with its tried and true hybrid recipe, one that has seen the over 20-year-old Prius see its hybrid tech trickle down into other offerings like the RAV-4 CUV, top selling Camry sedan, and even sister brand Lexus vehicles.Toyota was late to the game trying to transform into an EV automaker, as the company didn’t see the EV wave happening as soon as it did, and the automaker has had much success with its gas-powered cars, which were generally speaking ultra reliable.Toyota late last year said it would invest nearly $38 billion to roll out 30 EVs by 2030, and make its Lexus brand all-electric by 2035, matching what its competitors like GM, Ford, and Volkswagen we’re doing, although belatedly.But just last month came word that Toyota was re-evaluating that strategy. According to Reuters, the platform underpinning its upcoming EV offerings wasn’t cost-effective enough versus competitors like Tesla, and a group within Toyota was tasked to determine if the platform was salvageable, or if an all-new EV platform was needed. Numerous EV projects were put on hold as the process was continuing, sources told Reuters.Story continuesWhile Toyota sorts out what could be a costly - both in terms of time and money - EV gameplan, it's banking on its hybrids like the Prius, and top-selling SUVs and pickups to keep the sales momentum going, despite the changing times.—Pras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Polestar sees it a big volume seller.NEW YORK, NEW YORK - DECEMBER 05: Leonardo DiCaprio arrives in an eco-friendly POLESTAR 2S car to the ""Don't Look Up"" World Premiere at Jazz at Lincoln Center on December 05, 2021 in New York City. (Photo by Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for Netflix)“Especially here for the U.S.,” Ingenlath said of the Polestar 3’s domestic prospects. “Obviously, the size of the car, the luxurious premium interior, and how much space it offers, we're very much looking forward to have this car here. '23 will be the year when this comes off course, as well.”Currently the Polestar 2 sedan/crossover is the main seller globally for the brand, but the Polestar 3 will likely overtake it. An interesting wrinkle for the Polestar 3 is that it will eventually be built in the U.S., starting in 2024. “It means such a milestone for us to go into production here in the U.S., having Charleston [South Carolina], the factory, taking the production of the Polestar 3 on. That's a big thing for us.”Story continuesAlong with the Polestar 3, the company said its product pipeline will see new launches like the Polestar 4 SUV in 2023, the Polestar 5 grand touring sedan in 2024, and the Polestar 6 roadster in 2026.Polestar’s ramp up in the U.S. and other large global markets signals its rise on the EV landscape, versus the traditional manufacturers like GM, Ford, and Volkswagen who are scaling their electric offerings, as well as the biggest player in the EV space, Tesla. With some production coming to the U.S., it will give the Swedish upstart some leverage to compete in the space, as it can then take advantage of both consumer and producer tax incentives for EVs, compliments of the Inflation Reduction Act.—Pras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this company have returned +17.5%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +11.4% change. During this period, the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry, which General Motors Company falls in, has gained 0.7%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, General Motors Company is expected to post earnings of $1.60 per share, indicating a change of +18.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.3% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.96 points to a change of -1.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +5.6%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.16 indicates a change of -11.5% from what General Motors Company is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -4.1%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for General Motors Company.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for GM _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of General Motors Company, the consensus sales estimate of $41.58 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +23.8%. The $154.77 billion and $160.09 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +21.9% and +3.4%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryGeneral Motors Company reported revenues of $41.89 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +56.4%. EPS of $2.25 for the same period compares with $1.52 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $41.83 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.13%. The EPS surprise was +19.05%.Over the last four quarters, General Motors Company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.General Motors Company is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about General Motors Company. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Dylan Pacholek / SkiftUnited Airlines is still giving every single passenger an alcohol wipe as they enter the airplane. During the pandemic, it was for a specific reason. Now, that reason has shifted a bit.“It’s a touch point. Our flight attendants greet every single customer now,” said Linda Jojo, chief customer officer for United Airlines.“We may not have a wipe forever. There may be something a little more fun coming at some point. But I don’t think we’ll ever take away that touch point at the end of the jet bridge.”That’s one of the ways United is working to make the guest experience more intimate and personalized, as Jojo described during the Skift Aviation Forum, held Wednesday at the Statler Hotel in downtown Dallas. Much of the personalization in other areas is coming through digital innovation.“We are connecting the digital and the physical experience, and there’s a huge opportunity there to make for a better experience,” Jojo told Editor-at-Large Brian Sumers.With the huge number of hires happening over the next year, it’s a good time to innovate and train for those modernized services, she said.“We’ll hire 15,000 people this year, 15,000 people next year,” she said.One of the experiences ripe for innovation is meal time.United already has a customer app that knows passengers’ birthdays and tracks their previous flights. Now, passengers can pre-order meals through that app, too. The company will be feeding that customer data through analytics engines. That allows United to more easily handle special requests, but it also gives the company a better idea of what people generally want.“We’ll have a better chance of putting that on the plane, which means less food waste,” Jojo said. “If you get your second choice, you may actually eat it or maybe eat half of it. But we want to know what your first choice was so that we can start preparing that.”It probably won’t get super specific, but the airline will know how tastes change based on the day, the time, the market, and more.Story continuesFor example: “They do eat different things coming home from Las Vegas that they do going to Las Vegas.”United is working to digitize much of the passenger experience, starting with self-service in the airport. About 25 percent of interactions now happen through the app chat function. Or, if customers prefer talking to people, they can use a QR code to connect with an agent live. United is also experimenting with biometrics in international travel and in lobbies.“It’s really about giving customers choice,” Jojo said.Throughout all of it, United is analyzing data to determine if innovations are working well or not. The use of tablets to speak with an agent in a noisy airport lobby, for example, did not work.“We’re doing a lot of innovation at our gates right now with technology, and we’re watching how people are using it.”Get breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.]"

The PNC CPI, a light-hearted take on the Bureau of Labor Statistics' (BLS) Consumer Price Index, measures the average change in prices consumers should expect to pay for True Love's gifts, outlined in the classic holiday carol, ""The Twelve Days of Christmas.""2022 PNC Christmas Price Index Infographic""True Loves will need to come up with a record $45,523.27 to buy those 12 perfect gifts this year,"" said Amanda Agati, chief investment officer for PNC Asset Management Group. ""This is a disquieting development for many, as pandemic-related supply chain disruptions and elevated energy and commodity prices continue to impact the cost of goods and services. Despite True Loves' generous intentions, the gifts that make up the PNC CPI are not well-insulated from what is being experienced across the broader economy.""Driving much of the increase is the cost of some birds in the index. While the Partridge, Calling Birds and Swans saw no flight in price, the cost of others, including Turtle Doves, French Hens and Geese, flew up 20.1%. Services are also higher, contributing significantly to the overall increase.The cost of all 12 gifts is reported on PNC's interactive website, which is meant to be as fun as it is educational. Highlights of the double-digit increase in the PNC CPI to $45,523.27 include:Far out fertilizer prices: A key driver of the spike in the pear tree is the cost of fertilizer, which saw growth of 28.4%.Soaring service costs: Services inflation, driven by increased wages and labor costs, is higher than goods inflation in the PNC CPI, much like the BLS CPI. This year, services in the PNC CPI, represented primarily by the performers, are up 14.5% while goods increased just 4.2%.Gold rings gaining: Given inflation concerns, some investors dashed for store-of-value assets like gold again this year. Gold ring prices are up a whopping 39% from 2021, reflecting the surge in the precious metal's price during the year.Story continues""While the gifts in this specialty basket of goods and services are truly unique, investors and consumers alike might consider asking their True Love for a different kind of gift this year instead,"" Agati suggested.The Federal Reserve has aggressively raised interest rates throughout the year to combat inflation against an already slowing economic growth backdrop and all indications are there is more to come.""Markets continue to focus on two critical variables for the path forward: signs of inflation peaking and rolling over, and the Fed completing its tightening of financial conditions. In the absence of confirmation on both, we think the high volatility regime is going to continue to dominate and markets are likely to stay pretty choppy,"" she added.Price Increases for Services Outstripped Goods in 2022True Loves who want to delight can do so with performers, but at a price. The price of Nine Ladies Dancing climbed to new heights, as did the Ten Lords-a-Leaping, who jumped for joy as they returned to in-person performances. Eleven Pipers Piping rose to a new tune, and the 12 Drummers Drumming found a higher beat. In aggregate, prices for performers increased 14.6% this year.Although many states and localities across the country have raised minimum wages recently, the federal minimum wage has not increased since July 2009; thus, the Eight Maids-a-Milking haven't seen a pay raise in more than a decade.Unfortunately, tech-savvy True Loves will not save by going the e-commerce route. Buying all 12 gifts virtually is ""just"" 8.9% higher this year, still an eye-popping $49,663.73. Free shipping on livestock purchases is still not an option.The annual PNC CPI tradition includes calculating the ""True Cost of Christmas,"" which is the total cost of items bestowed by a True Love who repeats all the song's verses. Purchasing all 364 gifts will cost $197,071.09, which means that spreading cheer in 2022 costs 9.8% more than it did a year ago.""Like the index, consumer behavior is the drumbeat for the U.S. economy,"" Agati said. ""With 70% of U.S. GDP tied to consumption, consumer financial health is key to future market performance. We will be keeping an eye on guiding stars like retail sales, savings rates and consumer sentiment as indicators of the success of this holiday season.""Started in 1984 by a PNC predecessor bank in Philadelphia, the PNC CPI was initially developed to include in holiday messages to clients. Now, it is intended to educate consumers while spreading some holiday joy and highlighting market changes over time.The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.

In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. With that in mind, the ROCE of Target (NYSE:TGT) looks decent, right now, so lets see what the trend of returns can tell us.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. The formula for this calculation on Target is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.15 = US$4.9b ÷ (US$56b - US$24b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to October 2022).Thus, Target has an ROCE of 15%.  In absolute terms, that's a pretty normal return, and it's somewhat close to the Multiline Retail industry average of 13%. Check out our latest analysis for Target roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Target compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Target.What Can We Tell From Target's ROCE Trend?The trend of ROCE doesn't stand out much, but returns on a whole are decent. Over the past five years, ROCE has remained relatively flat at around 15% and the business has deployed 25% more capital into its operations. Since 15% is a moderate ROCE though, it's good to see a business can continue to reinvest at these decent rates of return. Over long periods of time, returns like these might not be too exciting, but with consistency they can pay off in terms of share price returns.Story continuesAnother thing to note, Target has a high ratio of current liabilities to total assets of 43%. This can bring about some risks because the company is basically operating with a rather large reliance on its suppliers or other sorts of short-term creditors. Ideally we'd like to see this reduce as that would mean fewer obligations bearing risks.The Bottom LineIn the end, Target has proven its ability to adequately reinvest capital at good rates of return. On top of that, the stock has rewarded shareholders with a remarkable 205% return to those who've held over the last five years. So even though the stock might be more ""expensive"" than it was before, we think the strong fundamentals warrant this stock for further research.If you want to know some of the risks facing Target we've found 5 warning signs (1 doesn't sit too well with us!) that you should be aware of before investing here.If you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

(ISRG) is a Trending Stock",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-intuitive-surgical-140002547.html,1668607202.0,STORY,['ISRG'],"[Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (ISRG) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this company have returned +36.4%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +11.4% change. During this period, the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry, which Intuitive Surgical, Inc. falls in, has gained 14.9%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Intuitive Surgical, Inc. is expected to post earnings of $1.24 per share, indicating a change of -4.6% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +1% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $4.68 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -5.7%. This estimate has changed +1.1% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.31 indicates a change of +13.5% from what Intuitive Surgical, Inc. is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1.1%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Intuitive Surgical, Inc.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for ISRG _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Intuitive Surgical, Inc. the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $1.68 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +8.1%. For the current and next fiscal years, $6.25 billion and $6.98 billion estimates indicate +9.5% and +11.7% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryIntuitive Surgical, Inc. reported revenues of $1.56 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +11%. EPS of $1.19 for the same period compares with $1.19 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.52 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.17%. The EPS surprise was +8.18%.Over the last four quarters, Intuitive Surgical, Inc. surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Intuitive Surgical, Inc. is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Intuitive Surgical, Inc. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NASDAQ:ROST) By 31%?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-undervaluing-ross-stores-inc-180352602.html,1668621832,STORY,['ROST'],"[In this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of Ross Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ:ROST) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Ross Stores Step By Step Through The CalculationWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$930.0mUS$1.49bUS$1.81bUS$2.05bUS$2.48bUS$2.77bUS$3.02bUS$3.23bUS$3.40bUS$3.55bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x6Analyst x6Analyst x4Analyst x3Analyst x3Est @ 11.99%Est @ 8.99%Est @ 6.89%Est @ 5.41%Est @ 4.38% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.3% US$866US$1.3kUS$1.5kUS$1.5kUS$1.7kUS$1.8kUS$1.8kUS$1.8kUS$1.8kUS$1.7k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$16bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.3%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$3.6b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.3%– 2.0%) = US$68bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$68b÷ ( 1 + 7.3%)10= US$33bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$49b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$97.8, the company appears quite good value at a 31% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Ross Stores as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.046. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Moving On:Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?

You can skip our detailed analysis of Dalio's investment strategy and his hedge fund's performance in the past, and go directly to read Billionaire Ray Dalio's Top 5 Dividend Stocks.Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates is one of the largest hedge funds in the world. The firm uses a principled-based approach and focuses on distinctive approaches for experienced institutional investors around the globe. Dalio’s investment strategy revolves around the diversification of portfolios, as investments in different industries and asset classes reduce risks in different market situations. His ‘All Weather’ strategy is a testament to the fluctuating market conditions, like the one we are facing today. Recently, Dalio stepped down from running Bridgewater Associates and announced to remain on the fund’s board and public research team. As of November, the billionaire’s real-time net worth stands at $19.1 billion, according to Forbes.The continuous hike in interest rates this year has seasoned as well as retail investors worried about the future of the market. In one of his interviews with Business Insider this September, Dalio spoke about the trend of interest rate hikes. He said that higher interest rates will result in the slowdown of the economy in 2023, with the S&amp;P 500 falling about another 20%. He further asserted that a well-balanced portfolio is one of the most reliable ways to ride out the stock market downturn.Over the years, Bridgewater Associates has delivered solid returns to shareholders. According to a report by Bloomberg, the firm’s flagship fund Pure Alpha II delivered an annual average return of 11.4% since its inception in 1991 through June 2022. In the first half of the year, the flagship fund returned 32% due to increased economic volatility. Another report by Business Insider revealed that Bridgewater Associates gained 25% this year through September.Story continuesAs of the end of Q3 2022, Bridgewater Associates’ 13F portfolio had a value of over $19.7 billion, down from $23.5 billion in the preceding quarter.

The company has been a strong dividend payer for years and has raised its payouts for 12 years in a row. It currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.53 per share and has a dividend yield of 2.17%, as of November 16.Bridgewater Associates has been investing in Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) since the fourth quarter of 2010, purchasing shares worth $690,000. At the end of Q3 2022, the hedge fund owned roughly 3 million SBUX shares, worth over $252.5 million. The company represented 1.27% of billionaire Ray Dalio's portfolio. The company is the fund's important holding alongside Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META).Appreciating the company's strong fiscal Q4 earnings, Street analysts presented a positive outlook on Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) in November. Both Evercore ISI and Citigroup raised their price targets on the stock to $97 and $93, respectively.At the end of Q2 2022, Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) was a part of 55 hedge fund portfolios, compared with 58 in the previous quarter. The stakes owned by these hedge funds have a total value of over $1.43 billion.Polen Capital mentioned Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) in its Q2 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Starbucks, which garners a lower weighting in the Portfolio, had slightly better than average three-month performance. Samestore sales were up double-digits in the U.S. and International exChina, with solid revenue growth across those regions. The company is experiencing cost pressures from wages and input costs though, and China same-store sales were down 23% due to zero-COVID policy restrictions and lockdowns.”9. CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS)Bridgewater Associates’ Stake Value: $293,711,000 Dividend Yield as of November 16: 2.25%CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) is an American healthcare company that owns retail pharmacies and also provides health insurance services to its consumers. The company has been a part of Bridgewater Associates' portfolio since the third quarter of 2012 when the hedge fund opened its position with shares worth $2.7 million. During Q3 2022, the fund reduced its position in the company by 3% which takes its total CVS stake worth $293.7 million. The company represented 1.48% of billionaire Ray Dalio's portfolio.On September 22, CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.55 per share, in line with its previous dividend.

The collective value of these stakes is over $2.03 billion.Vltava Fund mentioned CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“CVS is a leader in the provision of healthcare services in the USA. It has three main businesses: an enormous network of pharmacies, a health insurance company, and “prescription benefit management”, which is a kind of intermediary between insurance companies and pharmacies. This is the result of large acquisitions over the past 15 years – most notably of Caremark (2007) and Aetna (2018). The markets had deemed its acquisition of health insurer Aetna too expensive (and we agree), so CVS stock then fell into disfavour for a few years.We took advantage of this in the summer of 2020 and brought the stock into our portfolio at a time when its price was pressed down still further by the coronavirus pandemic. CVS is a giant. It has revenues of USD 300 billion, making it one of the largest companies in the world. It is a relatively stable and highly profitable company with strong free cash flow. Over the past few years, CVS has focused primarily on reducing debt.This is already much lower than it had been after the Aetna acquisition, and most of the cash is now likely to go to shareholders through share buybacks or be used for smaller acquisitions to grow the company further. CVS trades at about 11 times annual earnings, which is a very appealing valuation given the expected future growth in profitability and overall modest cyclicality in its business.”8. Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT)Bridgewater Associates’ Stake Value: $298,016,000 Dividend Yield as of November 16: 1.81%Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is a Chicago-based medical device company that also offers other medical services to its patients across the globe.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Also among our bottom contributors were health care products manufacturer Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), global pharmaceutical company Pfizer, media and technology giant Alphabet, and insurance company American International Group (AIG).Abbott has been working through a recall of its infant formula brand Similac in the US, which has continued to pressure its share price. Although the recall will impact near-term revenues, we are not concerned about any long-term impacts. We remain optimistic about the company given it is one of the highest quality names in health care, in our view, with a talented management team that makes smart capital allocation decisions. Abbott also has leading health care and consumer franchises with a particularly strong competitive position in its medical device business. The company continues to launch innovative products in key strategic areas (such as diabetes, structural heart, and diagnostics), which should help drive not only revenue growth but margin expansion.”7.

(NYSE:WMT) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“In our last quarterly letter, I briefly mentioned that the consensus estimates for corporate profits appeared to be a bit too sanguine. I referenced a Reuters article that reported, as of June 17, Wall Street expected S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022, which was up from 8.8% in April and from 8.4% in January. That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6%[2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.” Click to continue reading and see Billionaire Ray Dalio's Top 5 Dividend Stocks. Suggested articles:20 Biggest Electric Vehicle Companies in the WorldTop 10 Hospitality Companies in the World15 Biggest Movie Production Companies in the WorldDisclosure.

(NYSE:V) saw a decent share price growth in the teens level on the NYSE over the last few months. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let’s examine Visa’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity. Check out our latest analysis for Visa What Is Visa Worth?The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to my valuation model. It’s trading around 3.9% below my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Visa today, you’d be paying a fair price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $218.47, then there’s not much of an upside to gain from mispricing. In addition to this, Visa has a low beta, which suggests its share price is less volatile than the wider market.What kind of growth will Visa generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Visa's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 41%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in V’s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on V, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.Story continuesDiving deeper into the forecasts for Visa mentioned earlier will help you understand how analysts view the stock going forward.

But if you choose individual stocks with prowess, you can make superior returns. For example, the News Corporation (NASDAQ:NWSA) share price is up 41% in the last three years, clearly besting the market return of around 25% (not including dividends).After a strong gain in the past week, it's worth seeing if longer term returns have been driven by improving fundamentals. View our latest analysis for News While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.News became profitable within the last three years. That would generally be considered a positive, so we'd expect the share price to be up.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthIt is of course excellent to see how News has grown profits over the years, but the future is more important for shareholders. You can see how its balance sheet has strengthened (or weakened) over time in this free interactive graphic.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of News, it has a TSR of 46% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.A Different PerspectiveThe total return of 23% received by News shareholders over the last year isn't far from the market return of -21%. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 4%, each year, over five years. If the fundamental data remains strong, and the share price is simply down on sentiment, then this could be an opportunity worth investigating. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for News   you should know about.Story continuesOf course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

244,64e54adf-affb-3f64-8935-5357d7f64501,NWSA,2022-11-17,Realtor.com® October Rental Report: Rent Growth Hits Slowest Pace in 18 Months,PR Newswire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/realtor-com-october-rental-report-110000641.html,1668682800,STORY,"['NWS', 'NWSA', 'NWSAL']","[Nearly 70% of renters surveyed are considering moving to save money as rent increases cut into monthly budgets and hinder savingsSANTA CLARA, Calif., Nov. 17, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Renters throughout the country are finally seeing a bit of relief when it comes to the seemingly relentless pace of rent growth. The Realtor.com® October Rental Report shows that nationally rent growth slowed to 4.7% year-over-year, its slowest pace in 18 months, with the median U.S. rent hitting $1,734. Additionally, The Avail, by Realtor.com®, 2022 Fall Landlord and Renter Survey found that while tenants are still struggling with affordability, the majority of landlords are planning increases in the next 12 months, albeit less than before.""With soaring inflation and recession fears a huge concern for many consumers, finding affordable housing remains a priority for families. Our data indicates that we are finally starting to see a bit of relief from the double-digit pace of rent growth that we experienced during the height of the pandemic,"" said Danielle Hale, Chief Economist at Realtor.com®. ""While it's still a bit early to say that we're officially on a downward trajectory for rent prices, the data shows a promising return toward normal seasonal slowdowns and suggests that the astronomical price gains of the past several years may be behind us.""October 2022 Rental Metrics – NationalUnit SizeMedian RentChange since Oct. 2021Change since Oct. 2019Overall$1,7344.7 %23.5 %Studio$1,4576.7 %18.3 %1-bed$1,6114.5 %23.2 %2-bed$1,9013.7 %24.7 %Rent prices slowly falling from historic highsThe median rent in the top 50 U.S. metros in October was $1,734, down $25 from last month and $47 from the peak in July. This marks the third consecutive month of single-digit growth and the ninth consecutive month of slowing. However, the pace of growth was still nearly 1.5 times faster than it was in March 2020, just before the pandemic hit. During the late-fall and early-winter, rental demand typically slows, as it's a less popular time for households to make a move. This year is showing a return to a normal seasonal slowdown that we didn't see the last two years. Despite these cooling prices, renters are still feeling the sting of the sharp increases of the past several years.Story continuesRenters seek affordability after recent rent hikesThe Avail 2022 Fall Landlord and Renter Survey found that:Nearly two-thirds (63.2%) of renters who have been in their current unit for 12-24 months have seen their rent increase, up from 52.2% in July.The median monthly rent increase reported by survey respondents was $138 for lease renewals (compared to $160 in July) and $300 for new leases (the same as in July).Despite lower increases, affordability is still a major concern, as 69.5% who had experienced an increase are considering moving to a more affordable rental, up from 66.2% in July.Those considering moving are looking for a 12.5% cost reduction, or about $200 per month for the median renter. This is up from 10.3%, or about $125, in July.Lower rent prices might not be easy to find, as most landlords plan to continue increasing rentMore than two thirds (70.4%) of landlords plan to raise the rent of at least one unit within the next 12 months (down from 72.1% in July).However, there is some good news. The number of landlords planning to increase rent more than 10% shrunk from 25.4% of landlords in April to 18.3% in October.""While it's encouraging to see smaller price increases, it's important to understand that many renters have already absorbed large increases in their monthly rental costs over the past several years, which is impacting their ability to save,"" said Ryan Coon, VP of Rentals at Realtor.com®. ""High inflation and the cost of upkeep and repairs are hitting landlords, who have had to raise rents to cover their higher cost of owning the properties and making it unlikely that they'll be open to negotiating with new tenants.""Little room for negotiation as landlords feel the pinchThe increasing cost of ownership and market conditions have impacted landlords. However, there is a bit more room to negotiate for renewing tenants:While 34.7% of renters attempted to negotiate a smaller rent increase when their rent was most recently raised, only 6% of all renters were successful in doing so.Landlords surveyed were not likely to be open to negotiating, but were more likely with renewing tenants. Just 17% of landlords report being somewhat likely (14.4%) or extremely likely (2.6%) to allow a new renter to negotiate over the price of rent. But for renewing tenants, that increased to 21.9% being somewhat likely (17.5%) or extremely likely (4.4%) to negotiate.Increasing cost of ownership has led 80% of landlords to increase rent over the past 12 months. Among these landlords, 80.1% indicate that changes in rental market prices in their area influenced their decision to raise rent.High rent prices impact the ability to save for a homeThe typical renter reported being able to save just $100 per month, so it's not surprising that:Just 32.3% of renters are considering purchasing a home in the next 12 months, down from 34.6% in July.The biggest reasons cited were not having enough savings for a down payment (44.4%) and believing they would not qualify for a mortgage (19.6%).Among renters considering purchasing a home, 83.9% said that rising interest rates and inflation have impacted their plans to buy a home, up from 80.8% in July.Avail provides informational resources for both renters and landlords via its rental resource center at: https://www.avail.co/education/resourcesOctober 2022 Rental Metrics – 50 Largest U.S. Metro AreasMetroOverallMedian RentOverallRent YYStudioMedian RentStudioRent YY1-br  Median Rent1-brRent YY2-br Median Rent2-brRent YYAtlanta-Sandy  Springs-Roswell, Ga.$1,703-0.8 %$1,6612.8 %$1,596-1.1 %$1,859-0.4 %Austin-Round Rock, Texas$1,7032.0 %$1,4956.4 %$1,551-0.5 %$1,8692.3 %Baltimore-Columbia-Towson,  Md.$1,7552.9 %$1,363-1.0 %$1,6723.1 %$1,8944.0 %Birmingham-Hoover, Ala.$1,1373.1 %$952-9.9 %$1,0551.8 %$1,1997.6 %Boston-Cambridge-Newton, Mass.-N.H.$2,89412.8 %$2,70625.0 %$2,73812.2 %$3,15211.0 %Buffalo-Cheektowaga-Niagara Falls, N.Y.$1,1640.0 %$8567.3 %$1,20210.6 %$1,1903.6 %Charlotte-Concord-Gastonia, N.C.-S.C.$1,6063.4 %$1,5118.6 %$1,5283.4 %$1,7252.4 %Chicago-Naperville-Elgin,  Ill.-Ind.-Wisc.$2,03223.7 %$1,72051.0 %$1,95122.4 %$2,18320.9 %Cincinnati, Ohio-Ky.-Ind.$1,2737.0 %$1,1828.6 %$1,2126.5 %$1,4447.6 %Cleveland-Elyria, Ohio$1,1694.6 %$8927.9 %$1,0960.3 %$1,2879.0 %Columbus, Ohio$1,2375.8 %$9627.0 %$1,1767.4 %$1,3193.5 %Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington, Texas$1,5955.8 %$1,3475.7 %$1,4454.5 %$1,8545.1 %Denver-Aurora-Lakewood, Colo.$1,9071.1 %$1,6071.3 %$1,7810.3 %$2,2111.0 %Detroit-Warren-Dearborn, Mich.$1,2478.6 %$1,17114.6 %$1,0997.7 %$1,3796.7 %Hartford-West Hartford-East Hartford, Conn.$1,7269.4 %$1,60718.4 %$1,5084.8 %$1,8942.7 %Houston-The Woodlands-Sugar Land, Texas$1,3762.9 %$1,2682.7 %$1,2672.7 %$1,5132.9 %Indianapolis-Carmel-Anderson, Ind.$1,2769.4 %$1,1148.7 %$1,1609.0 %$1,3414.3 %Jacksonville, Fla.$1,4631.3 %$1,11610.7 %$1,3411.2 %$1,555-4.6 %Kansas City, Mo.-Kan.$1,2748.7 %$1,0198.8 %$1,20910.2 %$1,4798.9 %Las Vegas-Henderson-Paradise, Nev.$1,533-2.5 %$1,0480.0 %$1,428-2.1 %$1,645-3.7 %Los Angeles-Long Beach-Anaheim, Calif.$2,9214.5 %$2,2887.1 %$2,7204.1 %$3,3814.3 %Louisville/JeffersonCounty, Ky.-Ind.$1,0893.3 %$9463.5 %$1,0184.7 %$1,1463.8 %Memphis, Tenn.-Miss.-Ark.$1,270-0.7 %$1,107-6.5 %$1,246-4.3 %$1,346-1.6 %Miami-Fort Lauderdale-West Palm Beach, Fla.$2,6868.4 %$2,3339.5 %$2,3848.4 %$2,9605.0 %Milwaukee-Waukesha-West Allis, Wisc.$1,5305.4 %$1,2638.1 %$1,4155.8 %$1,7040.3 %Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington, Minn.-Wisc.$1,5272.7 %$1,2411.3 %$1,4522.1 %$1,8082.2 %Nashville-Davidson–Murfreesboro–Franklin, Tenn.$1,6254.1 %$1,600-1.1 %$1,5323.2 %$1,6813.6 %New Orleans-Metairie, La.$1,393-3.7 %NANANANANANANew York-Newark-JerseyCity, N.Y.-N.J.-Pa.$2,77912.7 %$2,48612.6 %$2,3958.9 %$3,0459.3 %Oklahoma City, Okla.$9469.7 %$7686.9 %$8394.8 %$1,03213.3 %Orlando-Kissimmee-Sanford, Fla.$1,8055.9 %$1,63210.6 %$1,6796.2 %$2,0305.1 %Philadelphia-Camden-Wilmington, Penn.-N.J.-Del.-Md.$1,7344.1 %$1,44112.3 %$1,6424.2 %$1,844-0.8 %Phoenix-Mesa-Scottsdale, Ariz.$1,625-1.6 %$1,309-0.3 %$1,489-2.7 %$1,746-4.4 %Pittsburgh, Penn.$1,4403.7 %$1,19813.3 %$1,4705.0 %$1,4751.0 %Portland-Vancouver-Hillsboro, Ore.-Wash.$1,7745.1 %$1,4473.5 %$1,6783.4 %$1,9352.6 %Providence-Warwick,R.I.-Mass.$2,02013.6 %NANANANANANARaleigh, N.C.$1,5383.6 %$1,4123.6 %$1,4395.2 %$1,6824.0 %Richmond, Va.$1,3715.6 %$1,24314.6 %$1,2568.5 %$1,5234.5 %Riverside-San Bernardino-Ontario, Calif.$2,171-4.7 %$1,492-14.6 %$1,920-4.6 %$2,188-2.9 %Rochester, N.Y.$1,3508.0 %$1,03518.1 %$1,31412.7 %$1,4599.3 %Sacramento–Roseville–Arden-Arcade, Calif.$1,876-3.4 %$1,586-9.4 %$1,740-2.6 %$2,012-0.5 %San Antonio-New Braunfels, Texas$1,3244.7 %$1,1130.0 %$1,1993.7 %$1,4902.9 %San Diego-Carlsbad, Calif.$2,7933.1 %$2,2856.4 %$2,5312.3 %$3,0760.9 %San Francisco-Oakland-Hayward, Calif.$3,0315.8 %$2,4888.9 %$2,7673.5 %$3,4504.5 %San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara, Calif.$3,2689.6 %$2,5829.0 %$2,9438.5 %$3,6209.1 %Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue,Wash.$2,1612.7 %$1,8416.6 %$2,1131.4 %$2,5114.0 %St. Louis, Mo.-Ill.$1,2203.8 %$9474.1 %$1,1413.8 %$1,2831.4 %Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater, Fla.$1,784-2.5 %$1,476-2.8 %$1,650-2.2 %$1,968-4.6 %Virginia Beach-Norfolk-Newport News, Va.-N.C.$1,4633.9 %$1,38619.5 %$1,3863.0 %$1,480-2.4 %Washington-Arlington-Alexandria, D.C.-Va.-Md.-W.V.$2,1264.9 %$1,7715.1 %$2,0083.0 %$2,4544.6 % MethodologyRental data as of October 2022 for units advertised as for-rent on Realtor.com®.

248,93a58c94-9183-3e90-a832-14721f9b6264,TPR,2022-11-17,A Journey Toward Deforestation Free Leather,ACCESSWIRE,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/journey-toward-deforestation-free-leather-143000792.html,1668609000,STORY,['TPR'],"[NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / November 16, 2022 / Tapestry, Inc.In April 2022, the Tapestry Foundation committed $3 million to the World Wildlife Foundation to develop an innovative system to enhance traceability of the leather value chain in Brazil to drive a more sustainable future for the industry. This partnership is the most recent initiative in Tapestry's ongoing efforts to support a responsible supply chain that other industries can also adopt. Below, an update on the partnership from the WWF:Mention deforestation and the mind automatically travels to Brazil, where wide swaths of the Amazon rainforest and the Cerrado savanna have been cut down and converted into farmland. In fact, the largest cause of deforestation in Brazil is the conversion of forest areas to pasture for the production of beef.Brazil is one of the world's largest beef producers - and because of that, it also produces a lot of leather. But while nearly 80 percent of the beef processed in Brazil is used for domestic consumption, more than 80 percent of the leather produced from cowhides in Brazil is exported, for use in the automobile industry, footwear, handbags and apparel.The leather industry has long positioned itself as being unable to take significant steps to fight deforestation claiming that the cowhides used by tanneries are only a by-product of beef production. Tanneries get their supply, they say, not from farmers but from meatpackers, making it difficult if not impossible to trace whether the hides came from cattle that were raised on deforested land.These circumstances are starting to change. Beginning with support from the Moore Foundation and now with an additional grant from the Tapestry Foundation, World Wildlife Fund is working with brands and tanneries in Brazil to develop Deforestation and Conversion Free (DCF) sources of hides, catalyzing efforts to ensure that hides don't come from deforested land. Challenges persist: a single cow can be owned by many beef ranchers as it's raised from a newborn calf to fully grown and ready for processing. But several tanneries are starting pilot projects to address the challenges of tracing the origins of those hides.Story continuesThis is the start of a journey that will take time to realize outcomes. The goal is not just to eliminate illegal deforestation from the supply chain, but rather stop ALL deforestation, legal and illegal. By accelerating the development and identification of verification methods, standards, and incentives to certify DCF leather originating in Brazil, WWF and the Tapestry Foundation are aiming to enhance traceability in cattle production and the leather value chain to drive a more sustainable future for the industry.""We're in the very initial stages of this effort,"" said Fernando Bellese, senior director for beef and leather supply chains at WWF. ""It's one thing for the large tanneries to participate in pilot programs, but our goal is to develop solutions for indirect suppliers with cow or calf operations to help other players in the downstream supply chain, including smaller tanneries, to participate in the discussion. That will only happen if we can develop a credible verification system that is trusted by consumers, retailers, brands and other downstream buyers of leather to apply additional pressure for the production of DCF leather.""""The Tapestry Foundation continues to work in concert with WWF to ensure the groundwork is laid for a leather supply chain program that is sustainable, successful, and delivers solutions that will create impact,"" said Julia Furnari, Director, Tapestry Foundation. ""In partnership with WWF, we are building accountability and trust into leather supply chains and, ultimately, establishing new standards for traceability.""Leather is big business in Brazil, and the cowhides produced there find their way into automobile interiors, shoes, purses, clothing, and upholstery. That is where the urgency of this effort needs to be felt - and heard.Tapestry, Inc., Wednesday, November 16, 2022, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Tapestry, Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Tapestry, Inc.Website: https://www.tapestry.com/Email: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Tapestry, Inc.View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/726272/A-Journey-Toward-Deforestation-Free-Leather]"

""There might be some disagreement about the pace. But interest rates are not coming down anytime soon.”Stocks reduced losses late in the session but the major indexes still ended in negative territory.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 7.51 points, or 0.02%, to 33,546.32, the S&amp;P 500 lost 12.23 points, or 0.31%, to 3,946.56 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 38.70 points, or 0.35%, to 11,144.96.Data showed the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell last week, suggesting the labor market remained tight. A report on Wednesday detailed strong retail sales growth last month, indicating the economy has weathered rate hikes.Bets from traders of a 75 basis point hike at the Fed's next meeting climbed to 19% from about 15% a day earlier, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool. Most investors still expect a 50 basis point increase.Cisco Systems shares rose 5% after the company raised its full-year revenue and profit forecast with supply chain hurdles easing. The stock helped the S&amp;P 500 information technology sector log a 0.2% gain.Most S&amp;P 500 sectors ended lower, however, with utilities shedding 1.8% and consumer discretionary dropping about 1.3%.Story continuesIn company news, shares of Macy's surged 15% after the department store chain raised its annual profit forecast on resilient demand for high-end clothes and beauty products.Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 2.06-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.65-to-1 ratio favored decliners.The S&amp;P 500 posted 1 new 52-week highs and 1 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 46 new highs and 169 new lows.About 10.3 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, compared with the 12.1 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.(Reporting by Lewis Krauskopf in New York, Bansari Mayur Kamdar, Ankika Biswas and Amruta Khandekar in Bengaluru; Editing by Vinay Dwivedi, Arun Koyyur and David Gregorio)]"

PKI recently received the FDA’s marketing authorization for the EONIS SCID-SMA assay kit for in vitro diagnostic (IVD) use by certified laboratories for the simultaneous detection of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) in newborns. Other components of the platform include the EONIS DNA Extraction kit and EONIS Analysis Software.The FDA’s marketing approval for the EONIS SCID-SMA assay kit, a part of PerkinElmer’s broader EONIS Platform, marks the first FDA-authorized assay for SMA screening in newborns in the United States. The EONIS Platform is already CE-IVD marked for use by certified laboratories in countries that accept the CE mark.The latest regulatory clearance is likely to aid PerkinElmer in significantly solidifying its foothold in the global IVD space and boosting its Diagnostics business.Few Words on the PlatformThe EONIS Platform is a robust and flexible system that uses real-time polymerase chain reaction technology to screen for SMA and SCID. Additionally, when combined with PerkinElmer’s JANUS liquid handler, the company’s workflow allows maximum automation and efficiency. It can also be configured to a laboratory’s individual requirements and throughput.Significance of the ApprovalPer PerkinElmer, SMA is one of the leading genetic causes of infant death, whereas SCID (a group of rare inherited disorders) can also lead to life-threatening health complications if untreated. Early detection and intervention are critical for newborns affected by either condition.Management feels that this authorization will be a major milestone for newborn screening in the United States as labs across the country will be able to access technologies that detect SMA and SCID. It will also likely assure the labs that every test meets regulatory, manufacturing and accreditation requirements.Industry ProspectsPer a report by MarketsandMarkets, the global IVD market is anticipated to reach $113.1 billion by 2026 from $98.2 billion in 2021 at a CAGR of 2.9%. Factors like the rising elderly population and the subsequent growth in the prevalence of chronic and infectious diseases, and increasing adoption of fully automated and point-of-care instruments are likely to drive the market.Story continuesGiven the market potential, the latest regulatory approval is likely to provide a significant boost to PerkinElmer’s business globally.Recent DevelopmentsThis month, PerkinElmer announced its third-quarter 2022 results, where it reported better-than-expected pro-forma adjusted earnings per share. Per management, the company is well-poised to execute its short-term and long-term goals on the back of perseverance and team effort.PerkinElmer, in September, launched the Cellaca PLX Image Cytometry System, a first-of-its-kind benchtop platform that enables researchers to assess multiple Critical Quality Attributes of cell samples in a single automated workflow, including cell identity, quality and quantity.Also, in September, PerkinElmer received the FDA’s approval for the use of the T-Cell Select reagent kit for the automation of its T-SPOT.TB test workflow for IVD use by certified laboratories.Price PerformanceShares of the company have lost 24.1% in the past year compared with the industry’s 14.5% decline and the S&amp;P 500's 16.4% fall.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank &amp; Key PicksCurrently, PerkinElmer carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are AMN Healthcare Services, Inc.

The figure beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.7%.Segmental Sales Break-UpIn the fiscal first quarter, Animal Health’s net sales increased 10% to $154.9 million. Within the segment, sales of medicated feed additives (MFAs) and others reflected 11% year-over-year growth. The uptick was driven by increased sales of processing aids used in the ethanol fermentation industry.Within Animal Health, nutritional specialty product sales rose 8%, primarily banking on higher demand for dairy products.

This is linked to the movement of the underlying raw material costs.Net sales in the Performance Products segment dropped 6% to $18 million. In the quarter, lower demand for copper-based products was partially offset by higher volumes of ingredients for personal care products and higher average selling prices of copper-based products.MarginsPhibro’s fiscal first-quarter gross profit rose 6% year over year to $68.6 million. However, the gross margin contracted 63 basis points (bps) to 29.5% on a 9.3% rise in the cost of goods sold to $163.9 million.Selling, general and administrative expenses in the reported quarter were $55.5 million, up 9.8% from the year-ago quarter.Story continuesOperating profit declined 6.8% year over year to $13.6 million and operating margin contracted 95 bps to 5.8% in the quarter under review.Financial UpdateThe company exited the fiscal first quarter with cash and short-term investments of $86 million compared with $91 million at the end of fourth-quarter fiscal 2022.Cumulative net cash used in operating activities at the end of the first quarter was $10.7 million compared with $3.8 million of operating cash inflow a year ago.Cumulative capital expenditure amounted to $23.2 million at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2022 compared with $7.4 million in the year-ago quarter.GuidancePhibro reiterated its revenue guidance for fiscal 2023.

COO is well-poised for growth, backed by strong prospects in both CooperVision (CVI) and CooperSurgical (CSI) business segments. The company’s acquisitions to complement its portfolio buoy optimism. However, unfavorable currency movements and rising costs continue to hurt the top line and margins, respectively.Shares of the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have lost 24.6% compared with the industry's decline of 16.4% so far this year. The S&amp;P 500 Index has declined 18.2% in the same time frame.Cooper Companies — with a market capitalization of $15.52 billion — is a specialty medical device company operating on a global basis. The company’s earnings are estimated to improve 11% over the next five years. The company missed earnings estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and beat once, the average negative surprise being 0.70%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhat's Driving Its Performance?Cooper Companies maintained its market-leading position in specialty lenses, backed by highly exclusive products of Biofinity and Clariti, and growing products of MyDay and MiSight. In fact, the company's flagship silicone hydrogel lenses are expected to deliver strong sales in the coming quarters.In the fiscal third quarter of 2022, the company witnessed substantial growth across CVI’s Toric, Multifocal, single-use sphere and non-single-use sphere subunits. It also experienced an improvement in sales on a geographic basis — with the Americas, EMEA and the Asia Pacific exhibiting strength so far in 2022.The CVI segment continued to display solid performance in the fiscal third quarter, with its revenues rising 10% at constant exchange rate (CER) and 2% on a reported basis to $566.3 million. Per management, strength in silicone hydrogel lenses contributed to the segmental uptick. CVI revenues are estimated to be in the range of $2.24-$2.25 billion (organic growth of 11-12%) in fiscal 2022.Cooper Companies is well positioned to benefit from the expanding CSI product portfolio as well. Per the fiscal third-quarter 2022 earnings call, CooperSurgical witnessed a solid quarter with revenue growth across two focus areas — fertility, and office and surgical products. With respect to fertility, revenues surged 34% year over year to $114.4 million, reflecting sustained solid performance. Sales of office and surgical products surged 35% to $165.4 million.Story continuesCSI revenues are expected to be within $1.055-$1.064 billion in fiscal 2022, implying organic growth of 7-8%.Acquisitions to Drive GrowthIn December 2021, Cooper Companies completed the acquisition of privately held Generate Life Sciences — a leading provider of donor egg and sperm for fertility treatments, fertility cryopreservation services and newborn stem cell storage (cord blood &amp; cord tissue). The deal is anticipated to add approximately 30 cents to COO’s adjusted earnings in the calendar year 2022.Another acquisition is currently under review. In April, it entered into an asset purchase agreement to acquire Cook Medical’s Reproductive Health business. The acquisition will add minimally invasive medical devices focused on the fertility, obstetrics and gynecology markets. The deal is likely to be completed by the end of this year. The addition of Cook Medical’s Reproductive Health business is likely to be accretive to COO’s adjusted earnings by approximately 60 cents in the first year, following the completion of the acquisition.Both these deals helped Cooper Companies to diversify its businesses to include fertility-related medical devices.In March, the company formed a joint venture — SightGlass Vision — with another global vision care leader, EssilorLuxottica to accelerate the commercialization of novel spectacle lens technologies to expand the myopia management category.What's Weighing on the Stock?Cooper Companies generates a significant portion of its revenues in foreign currencies. Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may significantly mar its overseas revenues. Moreover, an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses is concerning.

This joint development agreement is an important step towards the development of a green ammonia import and distribution infrastructure in the Port of Hamburg. The project was announced at a ceremony in Hamburg, which was supported by German Federal Minister for Economic Affairs and Climate Action Robert Habeck and First Mayor of Hamburg Dr. Peter Tschentscher.Targeted to provide hydrogen to Germany in 2026, the planned import terminal is to be located at Mabanaft's existing tank terminal in the Port. This location offers strategic access to green ammonia from large-scale green hydrogen production facilities operated by Air Products and its partners around the world. The intention is to convert the ammonia to green hydrogen via Air Products' facilities in Hamburg, before distributing it to buyers locally and across northern Germany. This plan responds to the accelerating demand for clean energy to meet climate objectives and the need to diversify energy sources.Decarbonising the mobility sector and industrial processesAir Products and Mabanaft are committed to expediting the development of this planned, multi-million-euro, green import facility for Germany.""Together with Mabanaft, we look forward to further progressing our plans of importing needed-renewable energy into Germany, through our planned facility,"" said Air Products' Chairman, President and CEO Seifi Ghasemi. ""As the world's largest producer of hydrogen, Air Products is in an excellent position to meet demand, having committed billions of dollars to produce renewable energy at locations around the world. Air Products fully appreciates the support and visionary leadership of the German government, further demonstrated by the presence of Minister Habeck, the Port of Hamburg and other members of regional and local governments at today's ceremony,"" he added.Story continues""We are delighted to work together with Air Products, the world's leading hydrogen producer, on the development of this terminal. As a result, we will make significant investments and deploy our energy infrastructure capabilities and expertise to accelerate the energy transition in Hamburg as the key import gateway for Germany"", reaffirmed Volker Ebeling, Senior Vice President New Energy, Chemicals &amp; Gas at Mabanaft. The plant addresses the urgent task of decarbonising components of the mobility sector and industrial processes while in particular paving a climate-conscious way for Mabanaft and Air Products' respective customers. ""This project underlines Mabanaft's commitment to conducting our business in an economically, environmentally and socially responsible way,"" added Volker Ebeling.Federal Minister for Economic Affairs and Climate Action Robert Habeck said: ""Now more than ever, we need to advance the hydrogen economy. To do this, we are setting up our own hydrogen production in Germany, but of course we also need hydrogen from imports. An accelerated energy transition with more speed in expanding renewable energies and ramping up green hydrogen are the right answers to the Russian aggression and the right answers to strengthen energy security, resilience and competitiveness.""Hamburg's First Mayor Dr Peter Tschentscher: ""Hamburg offers excellent conditions for the import, distribution and use of green hydrogen. It is already clear today that the demand for hydrogen in Germany far exceeds the domestic production capacities. As a traditional trading city, we maintain good relations all over the world, and the interest of our international partners in the development of a green hydrogen economy is great. Hamburg aims to become a leading hydrogen location in Europe. We want to help ensure energy security in Germany and advance the decarbonisation of industry and the economy.""Hamburg's Senator for Economic Affairs Michael Westhagemann: ""The development of an import infrastructure for green hydrogen is of extraordinary importance. This is the only way we can meet the enormous demand for green hydrogen in the future. Hamburg, with its port and its geographical and infrastructural location and connections, is predestined for this. I am therefore very pleased that Hamburg's strategy for the import of green hydrogen is being further implemented today through the planned construction of the first German import terminal in the Port of Hamburg. Hamburg is thus developing into one of the leading hydrogen distribution centres in Europe. For this very purpose, we now have very strong partners from the business community at our side.""Jens Meier, CEO Hamburg Port Authority said: ""The Port of Hamburg is committed to protecting the climate. After completing the first important milestone by signing an MoU in February 2022 with Air Products, we are happy that we take now the next important step toward building a hydrogen value chain in co-operation with our competent partners, Air Products and Mabanaft, the central element of which will be the import of green ammonia for conversion to green hydrogen. Hamburg will be one of the first ports worldwide to offer clean hydrogen import infrastructure. This import will drive the decarbonation for several applications in the harbour, as well as applications in shipping.""Today's announcement follows a Memorandum of Understanding that Air Products and the Hamburg Port Authority signed in February 2022. Both parties committed to accelerate production, supply chain, and consumption of renewable hydrogen in the North of Germany and Free Hanseatic State of Hamburg.About Air Products Air Products (NYSE:APD) is a world-leading industrial gases company in operation for over 80 years focused on serving energy, environmental, and emerging markets.

And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 79% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Genuine Parts. Check out our latest analysis for Genuine Parts ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Genuine Parts?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.Genuine Parts already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Genuine Parts' historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Genuine Parts. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 12% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 8.8% and 5.7%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Story continuesAfter doing some more digging, we found that the top 23 have the combined ownership of 51% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Genuine PartsWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Genuine Parts Company in their own names. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$60m worth of shares. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 19% stake in Genuine Parts. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Case in point: We've spotted   1 warning sign for Genuine Parts  you should be aware of.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

263,ee228d17-d3d6-367d-a62b-f4f5d05f4112,GPC,2022-11-17,Here's Why Investors Should Hold Sonic Automotive (SAH) Now,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-investors-hold-sonic-144202824.html,1668609722,STORY,"['SAH', 'ALSN', 'GPC']","[Sonic Automotive Inc.'s SAH top line is likely to benefit from buyouts and acquisitions. Its EchoPark unit also generates considerable growth for the firm. However, supply-chain bottlenecks, stretched balance sheet and low inventory levels are likely to add to woes.Let’s delve deeper as to why SAH — currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) — warrants a cautious stance right now.Growth DriversSonic’s efforts to optimize its Franchised Dealership business through organic growth initiatives and strategic acquisitions bode well. The buyout of RFJ Auto Partners, completed in December 2021, is expected to add $3.2 billion to Sonic’s annual revenues, which are incremental to its previously stated target of $25 billion in total revenues by 2025. The RFJ deal has catapulted the firm into the top-five biggest dealership groups in the United States.Sonic’s EchoPark unit being the major growth engine, witnessed a record third-quarter gross profit of $49 million, up 88% year on year. Strong organic growth fueled by EchoPark expansion will boost Sonic’s prospects. The Echo Park brand has been successful in reaching more than 50% of U.S. population and is on track for 90% coverage by 2025.  Importantly, Sonic targets 575,000 unit sales and $14 billion in annual EchoPark revenues by 2025, with a nationwide distribution network of more than 140 stores.The company’s capital deployment strategies to boost shareholder value through its dividend and share repurchase programs are also praiseworthy. Riding on a robust cash flow generation and sound capital allocation, Sonic increased its quarterly cash dividend by 12% to 28 cents a share from 25 cents previously. SAH’s annualized dividend growth over five years is 32.9%. In the first 10 months of 2022, the company bought back 5.2 million shares. To investors’ delight, it had boosted buyback authorization by $500 million in July. The company’s ROE of 35% compares favorably with the auto sector’s 10%, underscoring management’s efficiency in rewarding investors.Sonic is also focused on enhancing digital capabilities. Strategic partnership with Cox Automotive and Darwin Automotive to develop a proprietary e-commerce platform and user interface bode well for Sonic Automotive. The company launched its proprietary e-commerce platform, echopark.com, in June in certain regional markets. The e-commerce platform has generated considerable traffic and made significant progress with the national rollout. The success of the digital platform augurs well for the long-term prospects of the unit.Story continuesHeadwindsDespite robust growth drivers, Sonic is burdened with certain impediments.Its focus on store expansion plans is likely to boost long-term growth, but it will also strain the near-term financials of the firm. The auto retailer is bearing the brunt of rising SG&amp;A over the past several quarters. In the last reported quarter, SG&amp;A rose 24% year over year. Massive expansion plans and the rollout of the new stores may limit operating margins and cash flow, going forward.The company's stretched balance sheet also plays a spoilsport. As of Sep 30, 2022, the company’s long-term debt was $1,442 million against cash and cash equivalents of a mere $139 million a year ago. Its total long-term debt-to-capital ratio stands at 0.6, higher than its industry's 0.31.  Moreover, the company’s times interest earned ratio of 5.6 is unfavorable to the industry ratio of 14.19.Supply chain disruptions have adversely impacted inventory levels. Tight inventory amid global chip concerns may induce lost revenues for the firm. Low inventory levels are particularly conspicuous in the new vehicle segment. In the third quarter, the company’s new vehicle inventory supply was below historical levels. Despite persistent demand, low inventory levels limited new vehicle sales in the last reported quarter.In addition to new vehicle inventory constraints, declining used vehicle pricing and an uncertain economic environment may pose near-term concerns for the auto retailer. Stiff competition is another headwind. Sonic competes with publicly and privately-owned dealerships, along with Internet-based vehicle brokers.Key PicksHere are some better-ranked players in the auto space –CarParts.com PRTS, sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), and Allison Transmission Holdings ALSN and Genuine Parts Company GPC, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

It may not have been easy to hold on to GPC for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?Genuine Parts' Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at Genuine Parts' main business drivers.Atlanta-based Genuine Parts distributes automotive and industrial replacement parts and materials.

The segment’s distribution centers provide replacement parts accessories and service items throughout North America, Europe and Australasia. In North America, more than 650,000 parts are sold primarily under the National Automotive Parts Association (NAPA) brand name. GPC Asia Pacific serves the Australasian markets primarily under the Repco and NAPA brand names. In Europe, Genuine Parts is rolling out the NAPA brand of quality products and serves each country under a variety of banners. Genuine Parts both the Retail (DIY) and Commercial (DIFM) automotive aftermarket segments with products and services for substantially all domestic and foreign motor vehicle models.The Automotive Parts group comprises National Automotive Parts Association (“NAPA”) automotive parts distribution centers and stores. In 2021, the company operated 52 NAPA automotive parts distribution centers in the United States and 5.898 domestic company-owned NAPA auto parts stores. The segment also operates Alliance Automotive Group (“AAG”), a European distributor of vehicle parts, tools and workshop equipment.

So, if you had invested in Genuine Parts a decade ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today.A $1000 investment made in November 2012 would be worth $3,003.31, or a gain of 200.33%, as of November 16, 2022, according to our calculations. This return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.The S&amp;P 500 rose 194.96% and the price of gold increased -0.23% over the same time frame in comparison.Analysts are forecasting more upside for GPC too.Genuine Parts’ strategic buyouts to improve product offerings and expand geographical footprint are boosting its prospects. The KDG acquisition has strengthened Genuine Parts’ market-leading position of North American industrial platform. The company's dividend aristocrat status is commendable. The upbeat 2022 view further sparks optimism. Genuine Parts projects 2022 revenues from Automotive and Industrial segments to increase 7-8%% and 31-32%, respectively. However, the company is bearing the brunt of increasing operating expenses since the past several quarters and the trend is likely to continue. Further, Genuine Parts is battling supply chain disruptions, and high freight and commodity costs. Rising capex and elevated leverage are other headwinds. Thus, the stock warrants a cautious stance for the time being.Shares have gained 12.95% over the past four weeks and there have been 7 higher earnings estimate revisions for fiscal 2022 compared to none lower.

However, total losses seen by insiders are still US$729k but in since the time of purchase.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. See our latest analysis for Fox Fox Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single purchase by an insider was when Executive Chairman &amp; CEO Lachlan Murdoch bought US$4.6m worth of shares at a price of US$36.50 per share. That means that even when the share price was higher than US$30.75 (the recent price), an insider wanted to purchase shares. It's very possible they regret the purchase, but it's more likely they are bullish about the company. To us, it's very important to consider the price insiders pay for shares. Generally speaking, it catches our eye when an insider has purchased shares at above current prices, as it suggests they believed the shares were worth buying, even at a higher price. The only individual insider to buy over the last year was Lachlan Murdoch.The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeFox is not the only stock that insiders are buying. For those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Insider OwnershipMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Fox insiders own about US$188m worth of shares (which is 1.2% of the company). This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About Fox Insiders?The fact that there have been no Fox insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. On a brighter note, the transactions over the last year are encouraging. It would be great to see more insider buying, but overall it seems like Fox insiders are reasonably well aligned (owning significant chunk of the company's shares) and optimistic for the future. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 3 warning signs for Fox you should know about.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

Last month, sales of new energy vehicles (NEVs) totaled 714,000 units, jumping 81.7% year over year. Sales of NEVs totaled 5.28 million units during January-October 2022, rocketing 105.4% from the corresponding period of 2021.On the news front, Japan-based auto giants Honda HMC and Nissan NSANY came out with their quarterly results, wherein both automakers missed earnings estimates. Auto equipment provider Westport Fuel WPRT also released third-quarter 2022 results, with earnings in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate but sales lagging the same. Meanwhile, Ryder System R — a reputed player in supply chain, fleet management and transportation solutions— announced a collaboration with Aurora Innovation—a major autonomous vehicle company— to pilot maintenance of autonomous trucks. Leading engine maker, Cummins CMI also made the headlines with the attainment of a minority stake in Exergy Energy.While R currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), HMC, NSANY, WPRT and CMI carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) each. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Last Week’s Top StoriesHonda reported earnings of 80 cents per share for second-quarter fiscal 2023, lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 91 cents. The bottom line also fell from the year-ago profit of 88 cents per share. Quarterly revenues totaled $30,824.4 million, topping the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $29,653.6 million. The top line, however, inched down from $30,925.2 million recorded in the year-ago period.Honda projects fiscal 2023 sales volumes from Motorcycle, Automobile and Power Products segments to be 18.43 million units, 4.1 million units and 5.66 million units in fiscal 2023, compared with the prior estimates of 18.56 million units, 4.2 million units and 5.66 million units, respectively. For fiscal 2023, Honda forecasts revenues of ¥17.4 trillion, up from the prior guidance of ¥16.75 trillion. The fiscal 2023 sales view implies a 19.5% rise year over year. Operating profit is envisioned at ¥870 billion, up from ¥830 billion guided earlier. Pretax profit is forecast at ¥1,080 billion, up from the previous forecast of ¥1,040 billion.Story continuesNissan reported earnings of 15 cents per share for second-quarter fiscal 2022, lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 20 cents. The bottom line also fell from the year-ago profit of 27 cents per share. Quarterly revenues totaled $18,288 million, falling short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $18,291 million. The top line, however, increased from $17,612 million recorded in the year-ago period.Nissan revised its fiscal 2022 (ending Mar 31, 2023) forecasts. The auto biggie expects net sales of ¥10.9 trillion, up from the prior estimate of ¥10 trillion. The projected revenues imply an uptick from ¥8.4 trillion generated in fiscal 2021. Operating profit is now projected at ¥360 billion, higher than ¥250 billion guided earlier. The projected operating profit also indicates a year-over-year surge of 45.5% year over year.

Net cash used in operating activities was $8.59 million during the quarter under review.Cummins announced that it has obtained a minority stake in Exergy Energy.The partnership will enable the installation of Cummins power system solutions such as generator sets, energy storage systems and switching equipment at the customer location to provide power to the entire operation at the time of grid outages or times of peak usage. A big advantage of the collaboration is that it does not entail any upfront capital investment by the customer. Exergy Energy’s avant-garde software has the potential to track the grid such that during peak usage periods, it automatically shifts the load to the backup power system. This avoids an outage or peak demand charges.Cummins is driven to help its customers meet their sustainability goals. Many organizations struggle to find solutions to grid power problems, hindered by the upfront capital expense of a generator set and power system components, coupled with the complexity of participating in grid services. Through Exergy Energy, Cummins is contributing to making the process simple by removing the cost barriers of installing and operating a backup generator owing to an economized framework.Ryder collaborated with Aurora to pilot on-site fleet maintenance. With Ryder technicians embedded at Aurora’s terminal in South Dallas, the goal is to support the current pilot operations and prepare for commercial operations at scale.As part of the pilot project, Ryder will bring experienced technicians to work in unison with Aurora’s at the latter’s South Dallas terminal. Together, they will ensure holistic conservation and maintenance work. Responsibilities will include the upkeep of Aurora’s fleet of autonomous Class 8 tractors, along with inspections and repairs. Inspection and maintenance of trailers for pilot hauls and compliance with DOT standards, and collaboration with Aurora to reduce downtime and improve maintenance operations will be the other aspects.The partnership will further bolster Ryder’s vision of expediting the commercialization of autonomous technology and the deployment of autonomous trucks across the United States. The collaboration will leverage Ryder’s nearly 90 years of fleet maintenance experience that will strengthen Aurora’s autonomous trucks and add value to its commercial product, Aurora Horizon. Aurora also anticipates significant on-site maintenance in its terminals as it increases pilot customer hauls to 100 per week, expected at the end of 2023.What's Next in the Auto Space?Industry watchers will keep a tab on October passenger vehicle registrations to be released by the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But more than that, you probably want to see it rise more than the market average. Unfortunately for shareholders, while the ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE:OKE) share price is up 30% in the last five years, that's less than the market return. However, if you include the dividends then the return is market beating. The last year hasn't been great either, with the stock up just 3.3%.The past week has proven to be lucrative for ONEOK investors, so let's see if fundamentals drove the company's five-year performance. View our latest analysis for ONEOK While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During five years of share price growth, ONEOK achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 17% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 5% average annual increase in the share price. So one could conclude that the broader market has become more cautious towards the stock.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on ONEOK's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of ONEOK, it has a TSR of 84% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that ONEOK has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 9.8% in the last twelve months. And that does include the dividend. However, the TSR over five years, coming in at 13% per year, is even more impressive. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Even so, be aware that  ONEOK is showing  3 warning signs in our investment analysis , and 1 of those is significant...There are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares.

This compares to loss of $0.62 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.A quarter ago, it was expected that this oil and gas well-drilling contractor would post earnings of $0.05 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.27, delivering a surprise of 440%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Helmerich &amp; Payne , which belongs to the Zacks Oil and Gas - Drilling industry, posted revenues of $631.33 million for the quarter ended September 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 6.76%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $343.81 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Helmerich &amp; Payne shares have added about 123.3% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -16.3%.What's Next for Helmerich &amp; Payne?While Helmerich &amp; Payne has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Helmerich &amp; Payne: favorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.63 on $625.47 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $3.72 on $2.78 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Oil and Gas - Drilling is currently in the top 10% of the 250 plus Zacks industries.

(NYSE: HP) reported net income of $46 million, or $0.42 per diluted share, from operating revenues of $631 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2022, compared to net income of $18 million, or $0.16 per diluted share, from operating revenues of $550 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2022. The net income per diluted share for the fourth and third quarters of fiscal year 2022 include $(0.03) and $(0.11) of after-tax losses, respectively, comprised of select items(2). For the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022, select items(2) were comprised of:Story continues$0.03 of after-tax gains pertaining to the sale of equipment and non-cash fair market adjustments to equity investments$(0.06) of after-tax losses pertaining to a lump sum settlement for a distribution from the pension planNet cash provided by operating activities was $117 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022 compared to $98 million for the third quarter of fiscal year 2022.For fiscal year 2022, the Company reported net income of $7 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, from operating revenues of $2.1 billion. The net income per diluted share includes $(0.05) of after-tax losses comprised of select items(2). Net cash provided by operating activities was $234 million in fiscal year 2022 compared to $136 million in fiscal year 2021.President and CEO John Lindsay commented, ""Supportive market conditions and our adherence to our business and capital allocation strategy have led to sequentially improving quarterly results in fiscal 2022. We are beginning to recognize economic returns at levels that we have not experienced since 2014. As such, we believe there is significant momentum heading into fiscal 2023, and we plan to continue a posture of fiscal discipline, move forward with our supplemental shareholder return plan, and further implement our strategic initiative to expand internationally. These actions align with the Company's history of financial stewardship by increasing the Company's financial returns through long-term investment in the business and increasing cash returns to shareholders through the augmentation of our long-standing dividend commitment.""Customer demand during the fourth fiscal quarter was satisfied by contractual churn and by reactivating one rig out of stack early in the quarter as expected. Our financial results improved substantially quarter over quarter as pricing increases and better contract economics took hold across more of our FlexRig® fleet. We anticipate a modest 16 rig uplift in our NAS rig count in fiscal 2023 of which roughly two-thirds are already committed and to attain a maximum of 192 active rigs for fiscal 2023 sometime during the second fiscal quarter of 2023. As in prior years, we expect our 2023 rig adds to be weighted toward the front half of the fiscal year, and do anticipate experiencing additional contractual churn throughout the year. We expect our financial results for the first fiscal quarter of 2023 to follow the improving trend of the past two fiscal quarters, where strong demand from customers coupled with rollovers of term contracts, should continue to drive higher average levels of pricing across the active fleet.""For our International Solutions segment, the Company plans to deploy capital in preparation for more substantive growth in the future. We are seeing opportunities to bid in areas of existing operations as well as in countries that would be new to H&amp;P. Most of these tenders are taking place where unconventional drilling is in its nascent stages, such as in the Middle East, and where we believe our proven drilling solutions can provide a lot of value to customers. We believe our international business is an important avenue of growth for the future and serves as a potential outlet for some of our currently idle super-spec rigs in the U.S. This initiative also adds more diversification to the Company's revenue streams over the long-term and this current allocation of investment capital plays an important part in executing on this strategy.""Senior Vice President and CFO Mark Smith also commented, ""Maintaining economic discipline in our capital-intensive business remains paramount, and has resulted in increased capital efficiency and a positive impact on our financial returns. The Company will continue to allocate capital with this mindset. Our North America Solutions direct margins continue to improve, led by our fiscal discipline and robust pricing despite the current inflationary and supply chain challenges, which have been more apparent as of late with a labor-related cost increase just at the end of the fiscal fourth quarter and in our recently announced fiscal 2023 capex budget reflecting higher levels of maintenance expenditures.""Looking out to fiscal 2023, we expect to see increased profitability for the Company propelling us forward to execute on other strategic capital allocation priorities, such as the recently announced 2023 supplemental shareholder return plan and diversification through further investment in our international operations. We believe both provide incremental returns; one that is more near-term and one that will develop over time. Even beyond these planned capital commitments, the Company should have flexibility to be positioned to take advantage of additional investment opportunities and/or further augment shareholder returns through additional supplemental dividends and/or share repurchases. Essentially in fiscal 2023, we plan to allocate roughly two-thirds of our cash flow generation after capex commitments to shareholders in the form of base and supplemental dividends, which would currently represent an approximate dividend yield of 4%, very competitive for our industry. The remaining one-third we believe, should give us an adequate amount of flexibility. This is further testament to the Company's strong cash flow generation and financial position.""John Lindsay concluded, ""We enter fiscal 2023 with momentum and increased confidence that our initiatives in our North America Solutions segment have gained traction and are delivering positive financial results. We are also excited by the prospects and opportunities before us, particularly in our International Solutions segment. The successes the Company has achieved and plans to achieve would not be possible without our devoted and hard-working employee base, which I am proud to say continues to set the standard for our industry.""Operating Segment Results for the Fourth Quarter of Fiscal Year 2022North America Solutions:This segment had operating income of $92.1 million compared to operating income of $57.4 million during the previous quarter. The increase in operating income was primarily due to improving contract economics as market pricing continued to increase coupled with term contracts rolling onto market rates.Direct margins(3) increased by $35.9 million to $203.5 million as both revenues and expenses increased sequentially.

In determining whether to proceed with the fiscal year 2023 base dividends and the supplemental dividends, management and the Board of Directors will continue to review the Company's financial position and performance together with relative market conditions at that time in order for the Board of Directors to determine the amount, timing and approval of any dividend payments.(2) Select items are considered non-GAAP metrics and are included as a supplemental disclosure as the Company believes identifying and excluding select items is useful in assessing and understanding current operational performance, especially in making comparisons over time involving previous and subsequent periods and/or forecasting future periods results. Select items are excluded as they are deemed to be outside the Company's core business operations. See Non-GAAP Measurements.(3) Direct margin, which is considered a non-GAAP metric, is defined as operating revenues less direct operating expenses and is included as a supplemental disclosure. We believe it is useful in assessing and understanding our current operational performance, especially in making comparisons over time. See Non-GAAP Measurements for a reconciliation of segment operating income(loss) to direct margin. Expected direct margin for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 is provided on a non-GAAP basis only because certain information necessary to calculate the cost comparable GAAP measure is unavailable due to the uncertainty and inherent difficulty of predicting the occurrence and the future financial statement impact of certain items.

HP is set to release fiscal fourth-quarter 2022 results on Nov 17. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter is a profit of 43 cents per share on revenues of $591.4 million.Let’s delve into the factors that might have influenced the oil and gas drilling rig provider’s performance in the September quarter. But it’s worth taking a look at HP’s previous-quarter performance first.Highlights of Q3 Earnings &amp; Surprise HistoryIn the last reported quarter, this Tulsa, OK-based land and offshore contractor smashed the consensus mark on strengthening energy activity. Helmerich &amp; Payne had reported adjusted earnings per share of 27 cents, well ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 5 cents. Revenues of $550.2 million also outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $513 million.HP beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the last four quarters, resulting in an earnings surprise of 118.2%, on average. This is depicted in the graph below:Trend in Estimate RevisionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal fourth-quarter bottom line has remained the same in the past seven days. The estimated figure indicates a 169.4% improvement year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues, meanwhile, suggests a 72% increase from the year-ago period.Factors to ConsiderIn the fiscal third quarter of 2022, the company’s North America Solutions segment generated revenues of $486 million, up 72.9% year over year. The positive momentum is most likely to have continued in the fiscal fourth quarter, thanks to HP’s impressive scale, technology and further growth in the region’s drilling activity. Considering the improved operating environment, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal fourth-quarter revenues of North America Solutions is pegged at $509 million, indicating a significant increase from the previous prior-year quarter’s level of $293.3 million.HP is also expected to have benefited from the powerful performance by its International Solutions unit. The company’s fiscal third-quarter segment revenues increased to $29.1 million from $15.3 million in the corresponding three-month period of 2021. With more drilling work in South America, the favorable revenue story is likely to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter. As a reflection of this, the consensus mark for fiscal fourth-quarter International Solutions revenues stands at $35.7 million, more than double that of the fiscal fourth quarter of 2021.Story continuesWhy a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model predicts a likely earnings beat for Helmerich &amp; Payne this season.

(NYSE:JNPR) will pay a dividend of $0.21 on the 22nd of December. This means that the annual payment will be 2.8% of the current stock price, which is in line with the average for the industry. Check out our latest analysis for Juniper Networks Juniper Networks' Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsWe like to see a healthy dividend yield, but that is only helpful to us if the payment can continue. Before making this announcement, Juniper Networks was earning enough to cover the dividend, but it wasn't generating any free cash flows. In general, we consider cash flow to be more important than earnings, so we would be cautious about relying on the sustainability of this dividend.The next year is set to see EPS grow by 61.8%. If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 45% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.historic-dividendJuniper Networks Is Still Building Its Track RecordThe dividend's track record has been pretty solid, but with only 8 years of history we want to see a few more years of history before making any solid conclusions. Since 2014, the annual payment back then was $0.40, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $0.84. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 9.7% per annum over that time. Juniper Networks has been growing its dividend at a decent rate, and the payments have been stable. However, the payment history is very short, so there is no evidence yet that the dividend can be sustained over a full economic cycle.Dividend Growth Is DoubtfulInvestors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. Unfortunately things aren't as good as they seem. In the last five years, Juniper Networks' earnings per share has shrunk at approximately 5.1% per annum. A modest decline in earnings isn't great, and it makes it quite unlikely that the dividend will grow in the future unless that trend can be reversed. Earnings are forecast to grow over the next 12 months and if that happens we could still be a little bit cautious until it becomes a pattern.Story continuesThe Dividend Could Prove To Be UnreliableIn summary, while it's good to see that the dividend hasn't been cut, we are a bit cautious about Juniper Networks' payments, as there could be some issues with sustaining them into the future. While Juniper Networks is earning enough to cover the payments, the cash flows are lacking. Overall, we don't think this company has the makings of a good income stock.Market movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company. Taking the debate a bit further, we've identified 2 warning signs for Juniper Networks that investors need to be conscious of moving forward.

This powerful device, which is available to X1 and Flex customers at no additional cost, combines Comcast’s award-winning voice control technology with industry-first advancements in accessible hardware design, inclusive packaging, and customer experience. The result is a hardware breakthrough that allows all viewers to easily navigate and enjoy all the entertainment, news, and information Xfinity has to offer.This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20221116005227/en/COMCAST DEBUTS XFINITY LARGE BUTTON VOICE REMOTE (Photo: Business Wire)""For more than 60 years, Comcast has pioneered advancements in entertainment and connectivity and delivered industry-shaping experiences to customers,"" says Fraser Stirling, Global Chief Product Officer at Comcast. ""Our long-standing commitment to accessibility has unlocked profound innovation across our portfolio time and time again - shaping everything we do from the way we design our products, to the content we create, to the experiences we deliver. Inclusive design, for us, is just better design.""The Most Accessible Remote to DateInnovation is powered by a deep understanding of consumer preferences and needs. That’s why Comcast’s design team worked side-by-side with the disability community to test and refine the creation of its new Large Button Voice Remote. Accessibility features and functionality were the top priorities throughout the remote’s development. The result of a rigorous research and design process is a one-of-a-kind remote unlike anything available on the market today—one that combines high functionality with elegant design to offer something for everyone to love.Story continuesNew Horizon’s, Inc., an organization that provides housing and support services for people with physical disabilities participated in the research and testing. Carol Fitzgerald, CEO of New Horizon’s says, ""Technology can help level the playing field for people with disabilities. When companies like Comcast design products and experiences with accessibility at the forefront, they not only create better products for everyone, but they also help to unlock more independence for millions of people with disabilities. We’re very proud to have been part of the creation of the Large Button Voice Remote which is truly a game-changing innovation.""Features and Functionality That Enhance AccessibilityThe collaboration behind Comcast’s new Large Button Voice Remote helped create a world-class experience, from end to end, for people with vision, mobility, and dexterity impairments.Easy NavigationAt the heart of the remote is Comcast’s award-winning voice control technology. Users can find what they want—and find it faster—using voice commands to change channels, search for shows, get recommendations, and more. The remote also includes a prominent accessibility shortcut button that offers quick, easy connection to personalized X1 and Flex accessibility settings. With this button, users can enable popular accessibility features like Comcast’s Talking Guide, closed captions, large text capabilities, audio description, and more, to suit their needs.Enhanced VisualsLocating and navigating the Large Button Voice Remote is easier than ever, thanks to its large backlit buttons and high contrast colors. Plus, the increased font size on all the remote’s buttons improves readability.Precision FeaturesIn addition to its enhanced functionality, the Large Button Voice Remote’s physical design provides remarkable ease of use. A removable wrist strap allows for more precise handling and control. An innovative battery compartment features a rubber pull tab design and ""press to slide"" battery cover making it easier to change batteries. An elevated, flat-back design allows for increased stability when the remote is used on a flat surface like a wheelchair tray or with other assistive devices.Accessible Set-UpThe inclusive packaging for the Large Button Voice Remote uses large typography and tactile features, including braille and an embossed arrow near the package’s opening, to orient users who are visually impaired. The remote comes with an audio guide that automatically begins playing step-by-step instructions upon opening—an industry-first that allows users to pair the remote to their television in less than a minute. The remote also uses haptic vibrations to create a multi-sensory experience that alerts users when pairing is complete.Leveraging Comcast’s Global Technology Platform to Improve AccessibilityThe new Large Button Voice Remote leverages voice search technology within Comcast’s global technology platform, enabling customers to easily navigate the interface and discover programming across hundreds of networks and streaming services with just the sound of their voice. Processing more than 40 million commands a day in 5 different languages, Comcast’s global technology platform powers one of the largest and best voice engines for content discovery available anywhere. Combined with the work Comcast announced earlier this year to integrate accessibility features into its next-generation platform architecture, the remote further embeds inclusive design into the ethos of the company, empowering its global teams and the broader development community to create better, more innovative experiences for everyone.Available at No Additional CostX1 and Flex customers can request a remote, at no additional charge, through Comcast’s Accessibility Support Center, which was one of the nation’s first call centers specifically created to support customers with disabilities. Comcast’s Accessibility Support Center is now home to more than 140 agents specially trained on Comcast products and services, support for third-party assistive devices, and information related to Braille or large print bills. Comcast also offers support in American Sign Language—the fourth most-used language in the United States—through a partnership with Connect Direct, a subsidiary of Communication Service for the Deaf.The Xfinity Large Button Voice Remote is another example of Comcast’s longstanding commitment to accessibility. From unveiling the nation’s first Talking Guide back in 2013, to the recent expansion of the Xfinity Web Adaptive Remote, which was named a ""Best Inventions of 2019"" by Time Magazine, these groundbreaking technological innovations continue to unlock more equitable access to entertainment, news, and information for people with disabilities.

Additionally, 41% of marketers not currently using addressable TV advertising plan to do so in 2023.

""These latest findings capture the industry’s enthusiasm and adoption of addressable, which has become an increasingly important tool for advertisers to reach their audiences effectively and with tangible ROI.""Concurrently, the Go Addressable group surveyed its participating companies and found that the industry initiative has helped to enable a monthly average of 53 billion linear advertising minutes since the inception of GoAddressable in June 2021.

The pilot program will distribute $1,000 grants to each participating student’s investment account on the Stackwell platform and will provide access to investment education and other resources to help increase their investing confidence and financial wellness to address the expanding racial wealth gap in the United States.This press release features multimedia.

""This partnership with Stackwell and Prudential shows what the power of intentionality and collaboration can do to create long-term solutions to combat the racial wealth gap. Together, we can eliminate barriers to entry and drive greater representation of the Black community in the financial markets.""The racial wealth gap is the largest of the economic disparities between Black and white Americans, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research. Federal Reserve data show white households hold on average eight times more wealth than Black households, with that figure growing to 17-times for the Millennial population and Gen Z. By providing financial acumen to the most affected generations in the Black community, the SIP seeks to have the greatest impact on those individuals, empowering them to take control of their financial futures as they prepare to enter the workforce and begin their career journeys.Story continues""At Stackwell, we are proud to partner with Student Freedom Initiative and Prudential Financial to invest in the future and advancement of current HBCU and MSI students,"" said Trevor Rozier-Byrd, Founder and CEO of Stackwell. ""Increasing Black participation and representation in the financial markets is critical to addressing the historic economic and social inequities that have disproportionately impacted HBCU students for decades. Together we will support and empower these future leaders of the Black community by providing them with access to capital, investment education and tools to build long-term sustainable wealth for themselves and their families for generations to come.""The impetus for the program is to reduce the financial stress associated with attending college, better position students and their families to protect themselves against key financial risks, redress historical and social inequities, and increase the financial preparedness of students upon graduation.""We're excited to launch this pilot investment program with Student Freedom Initiative and Stackwell,"" said Sarah Keh, Vice President of Inclusive Solutions at Prudential. ""Prudential’s vision is to expand access to investing, insurance and retirement security and the program creates wealth building pathways for HBCU and MSI students. This catalytic program will not only address generational and racial barriers to wealth building that Gen Z minority students face today but will also build a solid foundation of financial wellness and a clear future for tomorrow's leaders.""This first-of-its-kind partnership will commence in the first quarter of 2023 and will be open to students attending the 43 HBCUs and other MSIs within the SFI network. Approximately 500 participating students will be selected in a manner that ensures representation from several SFI institutions. For students at the same institution, priority will be given based on the sequential order in which they submit their registration forms. The selection will be on a first-come, first-served basis and students will be required to participate in Prudential Pathways℠ workshops. The grant funding will be invested on the Stackwell platform, and Stackwell will provide students with investment education and support through its app and community-based engagements. Grant funding will be distributed to the investment accounts of participating students over a 12-month period to encourage participants to sustain investment commitments while normalizing positive wealth-building behaviors.Student Freedom Initiative is now accepting applications from students within its network to participate in the investment program. To learn more about the SIP, please visit: https://studentfreedominitiative.org/student-investment-program/.About Student Freedom InitiativeA single purpose nonprofit organization, Student Freedom Initiative aims to reduce the wealth gap through the lens of education. This is achieved by providing a catalyst for freedom in professional and life choices for students attending Minority Serving Institutions (""MSIs"") by increasing their social and economic mobility using a student centric, evidence based, holistic, and collaborative approach. Initially focused on Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Student Freedom Initiative enables mobility through four transformational components: (1) Student Freedom Fund as a private education loan alternative to Parent PLUS loans, (2) Internships and industry-driven certifications, (3) Comprehensive Supports, and (4) Targeted MSI Capacity Building (e.g., access to affordable broadband, strengthening endowment governance and risk adjusted returns, workforce development in clean energy). Student Freedom Initiative collaborates with community-based organizations, businesses, and governmental entities through public-private partnerships to make sustainable, systemic changes to support the entire MSI ecosystem.To date, the Student Freedom Initiative has received generous contributions from Robert F. Smith, Fund 2 Foundation, Cisco, Jane Street, Prudential, First Republic, and the Walmart Foundation. The program has also been acknowledged and supported by the Business Roundtable's Racial Equity &amp; Justice Subcommittee on Education.

One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. View our latest analysis for Oracle Step By Step Through The CalculationWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$10.9bUS$13.4bUS$16.1bUS$19.6bUS$21.0bUS$22.0bUS$22.8bUS$23.6bUS$24.3bUS$25.0bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x15Analyst x16Analyst x9Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 4.8%Est @ 3.95%Est @ 3.36%Est @ 2.95%Est @ 2.66% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.2% US$10.1kUS$11.4kUS$12.7kUS$14.3kUS$14.1kUS$13.7kUS$13.2kUS$12.6kUS$12.0kUS$11.4k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$125bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.2%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$25b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (8.2%– 2.0%) = US$410bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$410b÷ ( 1 + 8.2%)10= US$186bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$312b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$79.9, the company appears quite undervalued at a 31% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Oracle as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.210. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Moving On:Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price?

This compares to earnings of $0.82 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 2.38%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this seller of routers, switches, software and services would post earnings of $0.82 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.83, delivering a surprise of 1.22%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.Cisco , which belongs to the Zacks Computer - Networking industry, posted revenues of $13.63 billion for the quarter ended October 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.32%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $12.9 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Cisco shares have lost about 29.2% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -16.3%.What's Next for Cisco?While Cisco has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Cisco: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock.

S&amp;P off nearly 1%. The NASDAQ, though, leading to the downside, off just about 1 and 1/2% today. Sector action, energy, by far, the underperformer, off just around 1.7%, but technology, consumer discretionary, communication services not too far behind in their underperformance today.All right, let's take a closer look at the action we are seeing. And for that, we want to bring in Hennion &amp; Walsh Chief Investment Officer Kevin Mahn and TheoTrade Chief Market Technician Jeff Bierman. Jeff, let me start with you just in terms of it seems like the market's taking a bit of a breather today coming off of a couple of days of pretty solid gains, a lot of that driven by the CPI and PPI reports that we've gotten over the last several trading days. I guess, what's your takeaway from some of the selling pressures that we saw today?JEFF BIERMAN: Well, you got to put things in perspective. We've rallied, about a month ago, from 3,500 to about 4,000. That's about, good 15%. That's like a yearly gain in a month, so you've got to put that under your hat and take that into consideration.You also have to take into consideration that not only did Target sort of shoot the Achilles heel of the market today in terms of retail, but you have to put into that mix the fact that, once again, Micron warned, and that sort of lit a selling pressure fire onto semiconductors. So when you lose the participation of semiconductors and technology-- that's about 15% to 20% of the market-- that is going to create some type of pullback in the market for the day.Story continuesBut apart from that, the market is just short-term overbought. So I call this any excuse to pull back the market, at least for 24 hours. I don't think it's going to last that much longer. I think the market will regain its form maybe in a week or two and start its march towards the end of the year as the window dressing starts to take over.RACHELLE AKUFFO: And, Kevin, what's your take on market sentiment right now?KEVIN MAHN: Yeah, I think we're in an environment right now where good economic news is bad news for the market because it might suggest that the Fed will continue to be as aggressive as they have been there for their last four meetings. And in that case, bad news is actually good news for the market because it might suggest that the Fed will become less aggressive starting in their December meeting, as I believe that they will be, thanks in part to last week's CPI reading, which showed inflation starting to moderate, not going away. Inflation's going to be with us here, Rachelle, for years to come, but starting to moderate.So I believe the Fed will start to scale back on the increments of their interest rate hikes, but in all likelihood, raise through the middle part of next year, probably ending with the Fed funds target rate in the range of 5% to 5 and 1/4%. But I think what was very important to see today was not only the strength from Lowe's and the earlier strength from Home Depot, as we saw Lowe's in particular beat on earnings for the 14th consecutive quarter, but how are consumers continuing to spend.Retail sales going up on a month-over-month and year-over-year basis. But now we find out that they're putting more on their credit cards, and they're dipping more into their personal savings. In fact, personal savings in our country are now as low as it's been since 2008. So how much longer can the consumer continue to spend if inflation remains as high as it is?SEANA SMITH: Jeff, you mentioned a minute ago that you expect a march higher towards the end of the year after we get over some volatility here in the very short term. I guess, here we are today, the S&amp;P still below 4,000, where do you see us by year-end?JEFF BIERMAN: Well, about three or four weeks ago when I was around 3,500, 3,600, I had another interview, and I said about 4,100 to 4,125. That's the next major resistance level in the market, about 4,200. But when you get into that fourth quarter window dressing, like, race to the top, money managers are going to start to add winners to their portfolio and subtract losers. And this particular quarter has actually worked out to script. I mean, you couldn't draw it better like it was a Shakespearean play.You bottom out in mid-October, which is exactly what you want. Then you can start a march up into the last 2 and 1/2 months into the end of the year. And the strength really coming from semiconductors, which got ridiculously cheap on that 10-year basis. And then you had strength from a lot of other collateral sectors.But the one thing that stands out to me is, is that there's still a bifurcation in the market, meaning that a lot of traders are treating value as growth and treating growth as value. And until they kind of reconnect that bifurcation or disconnect, the market itself probably won't move that much higher. But you also have to take into consideration and something else and that is the bonds were up today. They were up on a day where the equities are down. That's very unusual because usually they correlate together.So when you see that type of bearish divergence, it's a little bit of a signal saying, hey, a lot of people like tempering their enthusiasm maybe about the fourth quarter retail sales. But at the same time, they're seeing a competitive edge in buying 4% yields over trying to buy the S&amp;P, which barely offers you about 1.64%. So you're starting to see the bond buying not as a function necessarily of maybe we've topped ticked as inflation, but more or less as a competitive yield to the stock market.RACHELLE AKUFFO: And we did see, Kevin, that divergence between the two and the 10-year really widen, especially after that retail sales data signal that the Fed is still going to keep pushing ahead even if it is two 50-- 50 basis point hikes just ahead. But Goldman saying, though, potentially, we could still miss a recession next year. How do you position your portfolio when you have so many different data points that you know that the Fed is watching?KEVIN MAHN: I guess that all depends on what the definition of a recession is these days because we did have those two consecutive quarters of negative real GDP growth in Qs 1 and 2. But what we haven't seen is a material destruction in unemployment at this point. And again, we're still seeing the consumer spend, all putting more on their credit cards and dipping more into their savings.So I believe in this environment, you need to be a little bit more defensive. You need to look at some of those sectors that have historically done well during periods of economic slowdowns leading up to and through recessions. I've said on the show before, well, one sector we like in particular is health care. From a defensive standpoint, we like those larger-cap traditional pharmaceutical names, the Pfizers, the Merck, the J&amp;Js of the worlds that have strong balance sheets and pay good dividends.But we also like the smaller-cap biotechs too, as we've noticed since May of this year a noticeable pickup in M&amp;A activity of those larger-cap pharmaceutical companies using the excess cash on their balance sheet to acquire the innovative health care solutions of these smaller-cap biotech names. So perhaps having a mixture of those smaller-cap more aggressive growth names and the more value-oriented traditional large-cap pharmaceutical names might be a good way to weather the current market outlook.SEANA SMITH: Jeff, how have you been looking at earnings because so far third quarter, it's been OK, but we know the bar was set very low. In terms of revisions or outlook for the current quarter, and then looking all the way out into 2023, do you think some of those expectations have further to fall?JEFF BIERMAN: Yeah, actually, I do. As a matter of fact, when you actually look at the four jumbo 75 basis point hikes, you're not seeing it now. It takes normally between 9 to 10 months to trickle down. So what the market's starting to tell you is, hey, we think that interest rates and inflation, that the ratcheting up, the parabolic move, is coming to an end.But it's a double-edged sword because while the interest rates are starting to come down, what's already been baked into the economy is about 400 basis points or-- 3-- pardon me-- 300 basis points, four times 75, that eventually is going to wear down a lot of these large-cap international companies. So I do expect growth to moderate. I do all expect sales to moderate.I don't expect it to fall off a cliff, but it's going to start to weigh on the market because the credit markets themselves, they're not at risk now, but once things start to slow down, then you're going to start to see people start to bandy about recession because the technical definition of recession is two quarters of negative GDP growth. We may not actually hit negative GDP growth, but we could still be in a recession just because companies' margins have been compressed so much by the rise in interest rates.So I'm going to-- I think by February of 2023, you're really going to start to see the impact of interest rates impact a lot of these large-cap tech companies, and their growth is going to moderate. But I don't think it's going to fall off a cliff, by any means.RACHELLE AKUFFO: We'll certainly be keeping an eye on that.

The S&amp;P 500 information technology sector and the Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index both sank.“The biggest sector issue is Target’s earnings and what that means for retail and consumer spending in general. I think that has kind of set the tone for the market,"" said Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana.The Micron news “is certainly causing some tech investors to take some of these short term profits off the table because it still appears like the fundamentals are still not great in the tech space,” Carlson said. According to preliminary data, the S&amp;P 500 lost 32.55 points, or 0.80%, to end at 3,959.18 points, while the Nasdaq Composite lost 172.80 points, or 1.52%, to 11,185.61. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 31.14 points, or 0.09%, to 33,561.78.Gains in defensive areas such as utilities and consumer staples helped mitigate the S&amp;P 500's losses.Despite the sales warning from Target, data showed U.S. retail sales increased more than expected in October as households stepped up purchases of motor vehicles, suggesting consumer spending picked up early in the fourth quarter.Story continuesElsewhere in retail, shares of Lowe's rose after the home improvement company raised its annual profit forecast.Stocks had staged a big rally over the past month, after softer-than-expected inflation data raised hopes the Federal Reserve could get less aggressive with interest rate hikes.""The market had seen a good run-up from those lows and had continued to move higher,"" said George Catrambone, head of Americas trading at DWS Group. ""The market has a lot to think about and digest as we get into year end.""U.S. Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller, an early and outspoken ""hawk"" in the central bank's efforts to confront inflation, said he is now ""more comfortable"" with smaller rate increases going forward after recent data showed the pace of price increases slowing.Investors also had their eyes on geopolitical tensions. A missile that hit Poland was probably a stray fired by Ukraine's air defenses and not a Russian strike, Poland and NATO said, easing global concern that the war in Ukraine could spill across the border.

The firm uses a principled-based approach and focuses on distinctive approaches for experienced institutional investors around the globe. Dalio’s investment strategy revolves around the diversification of portfolios, as investments in different industries and asset classes reduce risks in different market situations.

Recently, Dalio stepped down from running Bridgewater Associates and announced to remain on the fund’s board and public research team. As of November, the billionaire’s real-time net worth stands at $19.1 billion, according to Forbes.The continuous hike in interest rates this year has seasoned as well as retail investors worried about the future of the market.

He said that higher interest rates will result in the slowdown of the economy in 2023, with the S&amp;P 500 falling about another 20%.

The company is the fund's important holding alongside Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META).Appreciating the company's strong fiscal Q4 earnings, Street analysts presented a positive outlook on Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) in November. Both Evercore ISI and Citigroup raised their price targets on the stock to $97 and $93, respectively.At the end of Q2 2022, Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) was a part of 55 hedge fund portfolios, compared with 58 in the previous quarter. The stakes owned by these hedge funds have a total value of over $1.43 billion.Polen Capital mentioned Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) in its Q2 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Starbucks, which garners a lower weighting in the Portfolio, had slightly better than average three-month performance. Samestore sales were up double-digits in the U.S. and International exChina, with solid revenue growth across those regions. The company is experiencing cost pressures from wages and input costs though, and China same-store sales were down 23% due to zero-COVID policy restrictions and lockdowns.”9. CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS)Bridgewater Associates’ Stake Value: $293,711,000 Dividend Yield as of November 16: 2.25%CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) is an American healthcare company that owns retail pharmacies and also provides health insurance services to its consumers. The company has been a part of Bridgewater Associates' portfolio since the third quarter of 2012 when the hedge fund opened its position with shares worth $2.7 million. During Q3 2022, the fund reduced its position in the company by 3% which takes its total CVS stake worth $293.7 million. The company represented 1.48% of billionaire Ray Dalio's portfolio.On September 22, CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.55 per share, in line with its previous dividend.

The collective value of these stakes is over $2.03 billion.Vltava Fund mentioned CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“CVS is a leader in the provision of healthcare services in the USA. It has three main businesses: an enormous network of pharmacies, a health insurance company, and “prescription benefit management”, which is a kind of intermediary between insurance companies and pharmacies. This is the result of large acquisitions over the past 15 years – most notably of Caremark (2007) and Aetna (2018). The markets had deemed its acquisition of health insurer Aetna too expensive (and we agree), so CVS stock then fell into disfavour for a few years.We took advantage of this in the summer of 2020 and brought the stock into our portfolio at a time when its price was pressed down still further by the coronavirus pandemic. CVS is a giant. It has revenues of USD 300 billion, making it one of the largest companies in the world. It is a relatively stable and highly profitable company with strong free cash flow. Over the past few years, CVS has focused primarily on reducing debt.This is already much lower than it had been after the Aetna acquisition, and most of the cash is now likely to go to shareholders through share buybacks or be used for smaller acquisitions to grow the company further. CVS trades at about 11 times annual earnings, which is a very appealing valuation given the expected future growth in profitability and overall modest cyclicality in its business.”8. Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT)Bridgewater Associates’ Stake Value: $298,016,000 Dividend Yield as of November 16: 1.81%Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is a Chicago-based medical device company that also offers other medical services to its patients across the globe.

Although the recall will impact near-term revenues, we are not concerned about any long-term impacts. We remain optimistic about the company given it is one of the highest quality names in health care, in our view, with a talented management team that makes smart capital allocation decisions. Abbott also has leading health care and consumer franchises with a particularly strong competitive position in its medical device business. The company continues to launch innovative products in key strategic areas (such as diabetes, structural heart, and diagnostics), which should help drive not only revenue growth but margin expansion.”7.

I referenced a Reuters article that reported, as of June 17, Wall Street expected S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022, which was up from 8.8% in April and from 8.4% in January. That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6%[2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.” Click to continue reading and see Billionaire Ray Dalio's Top 5 Dividend Stocks. Suggested articles:20 Biggest Electric Vehicle Companies in the WorldTop 10 Hospitality Companies in the World15 Biggest Movie Production Companies in the WorldDisclosure.

CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 65Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates’ Holdings: $293,711,000Percentage of Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates’ Portfolio: 1.48%CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) is a Rhode Island-based healthcare solution provider through its retail pharmacy chain, pharmacy benefits manager (PBM), and healthcare benefits (HCB) segment. The company covers various touchpoints in the healthcare segment through its divisions.Story continuesIn a research note issued on November 6, John Ransom at Raymond James gave CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) stock a target price of $115, along with an Outperform rating. The development occurred after the company reported better-than-anticipated Q3 2022 results that were driven by the stellar performance of the HCB business. Meanwhile, the performance of the pharmacy retail and pharmacy benefits management businesses was also in line with expectations. Furthermore, CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) is considered among the defensive stocks expected to hold its ground in case of a recession. CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) has an annual forward dividend yield of 2.26% as of November 14.Vltava Fund shared its bullish outlook on CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“CVS is a leader in the provision of healthcare services in the USA. It has three main businesses: an enormous network of pharmacies, a health insurance company, and “prescription benefit management”, which is a kind of intermediary between insurance companies and pharmacies. This is the result of large acquisitions over the past 15 years – most notably of Caremark (2007) and Aetna (2018). The markets had deemed its acquisition of health insurer Aetna too expensive (and we agree), so CVS stock then fell into disfavour for a few years.We took advantage of this in the summer of 2020 and brought the stock into our portfolio at a time when its price was pressed down still further by the coronavirus pandemic. CVS is a giant. It has revenues of USD 300 billion, making it one of the largest companies in the world. It is a relatively stable and highly profitable company with strong free cash flow. Over the past few years, CVS has focused primarily on reducing debt.This is already much lower than it had been after the Aetna acquisition, and most of the cash is now likely to go to shareholders through share buybacks or be used for smaller acquisitions to grow the company further. CVS trades at about 11 times annual earnings, which is a very appealing valuation given the expected future growth in profitability and overall modest cyclicality in its business.”9. Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 61Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates’ Holdings: $298,016,000Percentage of Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates’ Portfolio: 1.5%Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is a Chicago, Illinois-based healthcare and medical devices company.On October 21, Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) stock was assigned an Overweight rating and a target price of $114 by Matt Miksic at Barclays. The analyst believes that the sell-off following the Q3 2022 results has been overdone and has taken the stock price to levels seen in early October. Miksic highlighted that there were positives in the company’s results, as reflected by the encouraging performance of the cardio devices, diabetes instruments, and established pharmaceutical division (EPD). Experts believe that Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) has a strong balance sheet and can capitalize well on the fast-growing medical technology markets. The stock offers an annual forward dividend yield of 1.81% as of November 14.Despite the earnings beat and raised guidance, the stock price plummeted as investors believed that the results were primarily driven by the strong performance of the COVID testing services as opposed to the performance of the core business segments that fell short of consensus estimates.Diamond Hill Capital shared its outlook on Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“Also among our bottom contributors were health care products manufacturer Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), global pharmaceutical company Pfizer, media and technology giant Alphabet, and insurance company American International Group (AIG).Abbott has been working through a recall of its infant formula brand Similac in the US, which has continued to pressure its share price. Although the recall will impact near-term revenues, we are not concerned about any long-term impacts. We remain optimistic about the company given it is one of the highest quality names in health care, in our view, with a talented management team that makes smart capital allocation decisions. Abbott also has leading health care and consumer franchises with a particularly strong competitive position in its medical device business. The company continues to launch innovative products in key strategic areas (such as diabetes, structural heart, and diagnostics), which should help drive not only revenue growth but margin expansion.”8. Pinduoduo Inc. (NASDAQ:PDD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 41Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates’ Holdings: $317,064,000Percentage of Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates’ Portfolio: 1.6%Pinduoduo Inc. (NASDAQ:PDD) is a Shanghai, China-based social e-commerce platform with a user base of 900 million globally. The company has the distinction of introducing team purchase and consumer-to-manufacturer (C2M) concepts in the Chinese e-commerce sector.Pinduoduo Inc. (NASDAQ:PDD) has a strong affiliation with the Chinese agricultural sector, as 16 million farmers have connected with the platform as of 2022. The company is making headway in the US e-commerce market through its cross-border e-commerce application Temu. The application is one of the top e-commerce applications in the US in terms of new downloads. On October 17, Temu was the top shopping application on the iPhone Store in the US. Within a short period since its inception in 2015, Pinduoduo Inc. (NASDAQ:PDD) has emerged as one of the leading Chinese e-commerce players with international aspirations, just like Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) and JD.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:JD).Here’s what Tao Value said about Pinduoduo Inc. (NASDAQ:PDD) in its Q4 2021 investor letter:“On the detracting side, one of our largest detractors includes Pinduoduo (ticker: PDD). Pinduoduo (PDD) reported the second consecutive GAAP profit quarter yet missed on the revenue due to nation-wide consumption weakness &amp; scaled back Sales &amp; Marketing efforts. Market disliked it and the stock price plunged on the earnings. In my opinion, the accounting profits proved the original thesis of using S&amp;M to acquire users and using great shopping experience to keep them. After realizing the first growth curve, Pinduoduo now shifted its focus &amp; investment to agriculture. It is still very early, but the reduced size due to price drop warrants a position to watch and continue grow with such a team with strong culture.”7.

McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) offers an annual forward dividend yield of 2.24% as of November 14.Of the 895 hedge funds in Insider Monkey's database, McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) was held by 50 hedge funds as of Q2 2022.6.

(NYSE:WMT) stock a target price of $161 along with a Buy rating on November 11 ahead of the Q3 FY23 results. Experts believe that the company will outperform consensus estimates for the third quarter.

Analysts think the current stock price dip can be an attractive entry point for any potential investor.

Here’s what the firm said:“In our last quarterly letter, I briefly mentioned that the consensus estimates for corporate profits appeared to be a bit too sanguine. I referenced a Reuters article that reported, as of June 17, Wall Street expected S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022, which was up from 8.8% in April and from 8.4% in January. That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6%[2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.”Besides Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Mr. Dalio also has a stake in The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and PepsiCo, Inc.

PLD announced the launch of two significant electric truck charging installations in Southern California, which has two of the United States’ busiest ports.The projects are located in Sante Fe Springs and the City of Commerce, and provide more than 4 megawatts of total installed charging capacity.The logistics real estate industry is expanding on robust demand from faster e-commerce adoption, growth in industries and companies striving to improve supply-chain efficiencies.

310,875168f0-0bf7-3170-8347-6309e8f1669c,STX,2022-11-17,Bear of the Day: Seagate Technology Holdings (STX),Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bear-day-seagate-technology-holdings-110011864.html,1668682811,STORY,['STX'],"[Seagate Technology Holdings (STX), a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stock, is a global provider of data storage technology and solutions. The company provides mass capacity storage products including hard disk drives (HDDs), solid state drives (SSDs), and network-attached drives. Based in Dublin, Ireland, STX sells its products primarily to original equipment manufacturers, distributors, and retailers.STX faces stiff competition in an evolving industry. The merger between Western Digital and SanDisk has made it more challenging for Seagate to capture market share in the important SSD market. Ongoing global macroeconomic headwinds, high inflation, as well as lingering component shortages are likely to continue to exert pressure on revenues in the short-term.Furthermore, Seagate derives a significant portion of its revenues from outside the United States, subjecting the company to exchange rate volatility. Unfavorable movement in exchange rates can adversely impact results and undermine growth potential.The Zacks RundownSTX has been severely underperforming the market over the past year. This poorly-rated stock experienced a climax top in December of last year and has been in a price downtrend ever since. Shares are hitting a series of 52-week lows and represent a compelling short opportunity. When a stock can’t even muster a rally when the general market is moving higher, it’s telling us “I’m very weak”.Seagate Technology is part of the Zacks Business Services sector, which currently ranks in the bottom 44% out of all 16 Zacks Ranked Sectors. As such, we expect this sector as a whole to underperform the market over the next 3 to 6 months. The Business Services sector has underperformed the market this year at nearly every turn:Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCandidates in the bottom tiers of sectors can often represent solid potential short candidates. While individual stocks have the ability to outperform even when included in a poor-performing sector, the inclusion in a weaker group serves as a headwind for any potential rallies. The odds are stacked against STX and the stock is agreeing with this notion after making a series of lower lows.Story continuesDespite the subpar performance, the sector is still relatively overvalued:Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWeak Foundation: Falling Short on Earnings and Deteriorating ForecastsEarnings misses have been a sore spot for STX during the past year. The data storage provider has fallen short of estimates in three of the past four quarters. STX most recently reported fiscal Q1 EPS last month of $0.48/share, missing the $0.68 consensus estimate by -29.41%. Revenues of $2.03 billion also missed the mark by -1.95%. These are the types of negative trends that the bears like to see.STX has posted an average earnings miss of -11.59% over the past four quarters. Consistently missing earnings estimates by that a wide of a margin is a recipe for stock price underperformance.Analysts have been revising earnings estimates downward as of late. For the current quarter, estimates have been slashed -74.8% over the past 30 days. The fiscal Q2 Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate now stands at $0.32/share, translating to a -86.72% earnings regression relative to the same quarter last year.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTechnical OutlookSTX stock has been steadily falling since late last year and has now established a well-defined downtrend. Notice how both the 50-day (blue line) and 200-day (red line) moving averages are sloping down. Shares have declined more than 45% in the past year. The stock continues to trade below both averages – another bearish sign.StockChartsImage Source: StockChartsWhile not the most accurate indicator, STX has also experienced what is known as a ‘death cross’, wherein the stock’s 50-day moving average crosses below its 200-day moving average. STX would have to make a serious move to the upside and show increasing earnings estimate revisions to warrant taking any long positions in the stock.Final ThoughtsThe recent earnings misses in addition to deteriorating estimates are both huge red flags and need to be respected. These will likely serve as a ceiling to any potential rallies, nurturing the stock’s downtrend.STX’s characteristics have resulted in a Zacks Momentum Style Score of ‘C’, indicating further downside is likely. The fact that STX is included in a bottom-performing sector simply adds to the growing list of concerns. Investors will want to steer clear of STX until the situation shows major signs of improvement, or possibly include it as part of a hedge or short strategy.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

311,b9db76d8-50f5-391d-974c-e8719b0769fe,PCAR,2022-11-17,Here's Why Paccar (PCAR) is a Great Momentum Stock to Buy,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-paccar-pcar-great-170005161.html,1668618005,STORY,['PCAR'],"[Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock's recent trend in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will be essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" With this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving that way. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.Below, we take a look at Paccar (PCAR), a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of B. We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions, two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score.It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Paccar currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;Set to Beat the Market?In order to see if PCAR is a promising momentum pick, let's examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this truck maker holds up.A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It is also useful to compare a security to its industry, as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area.For PCAR, shares are up 3.53% over the past week while the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry is up 4.42% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 13.32% compares favorably with the industry's 3.61% performance as well.Story continuesConsidering longer term price metrics, like performance over the last three months or year, can be advantageous as well. Over the past quarter, shares of Paccar have risen 13.41%, and are up 14.91% in the last year. On the other hand, the S&amp;P 500 has only moved -6.74% and -13.41%, respectively.Investors should also take note of PCAR's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. Right now, PCAR is averaging 2,336,206 shares for the last 20 days.Earnings OutlookThe Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things, including estimate revisions and a stock's price movement. Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank, and a nice path here can be promising. We have recently been noticing this with PCAR.Over the past two months, 8 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost PCAR's consensus estimate, increasing from $7.73 to $8.15 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 8 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.Bottom LineTaking into account all of these elements, it should come as no surprise that PCAR is a #2 (Buy) stock with a Momentum Score of B. If you've been searching for a fresh pick that's set to rise in the near-term, make sure to keep Paccar on your short list.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Nevertheless, we know that our readers all have their own perspectives, so we are always looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong picks.Considering these trends, value investing is clearly one of the most preferred ways to find strong stocks in any type of market. Value investors rely on traditional forms of analysis on key valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are undervalued, leaving room for profits.On top of the Zacks Rank, investors can also look at our innovative Style Scores system to find stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will want to focus on the ""Value"" category. Stocks with high Zacks Ranks and ""A"" grades for Value will be some of the highest-quality value stocks on the market today.One stock to keep an eye on is PACCAR (PCAR). PCAR is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as a Value grade of A. The stock is trading with a P/E ratio of 12.28, which compares to its industry's average of 28.94. Over the past year, PCAR's Forward P/E has been as high as 18.10 and as low as 10.39, with a median of 11.86.Investors should also note that PCAR holds a PEG ratio of 1.23. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. PCAR's industry has an average PEG of 1.93 right now. Over the last 12 months, PCAR's PEG has been as high as 1.81 and as low as 1.04, with a median of 1.19.Another notable valuation metric for PCAR is its P/B ratio of 2.76. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This stock's P/B looks solid versus its industry's average P/B of 4.02. PCAR's P/B has been as high as 2.93 and as low as 2.20, with a median of 2.53, over the past year.Story continuesValue investors also use the P/S ratio. The P/S ratio is is calculated as price divided by sales. This is a prefered metric because revenue can't really be manipulated, so sales are often a truer performance indicator. PCAR has a P/S ratio of 1.31. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 3.28.Finally, our model also underscores that PCAR has a P/CF ratio of 10.53. This metric focuses on a firm's operating cash flow and is often used to find stocks that are undervalued based on the strength of their cash outlook. PCAR's current P/CF looks attractive when compared to its industry's average P/CF of 13.80. Over the past 52 weeks, PCAR's P/CF has been as high as 12.21 and as low as 8.61, with a median of 10.55.These figures are just a handful of the metrics value investors tend to look at, but they help show that PACCAR is likely being undervalued right now.

Rowe Price, a global investment management firm and a leader in retirement, held its annual U.S. Retirement Market Outlook press briefing yesterday, offering research-based insights on major themes expected to shape the retirement landscape in 2023. Amid economic factors such as inflation, the risk of recession, volatile markets, and rising interest rates, a select panel of the firm's experts shared their perspectives on key topics, including the impact of under‑saving and its contribution to the retirement savings gap, the need to help Americans navigate a complex set of retirement and other financial challenges, and the impact of the current investment market environment on retirement.The panel discussion featured commentary from Kim DeDominicis, target date portfolio manager; Michael Doshier, senior retirement strategist; Jessica Sclafani, senior defined contribution strategist; and Rachel Weker, senior retirement strategist. The briefing was hosted by Michael Davis, who is head of institutional defined contribution specialists and former deputy assistant secretary at the U.S. Department of Labor.Specifically, the panel discussed:Retirement plan access and adequacy: How employers, advisors, legislators, and regulators can help American workers get on track and stay on track with their retirement savings.Financial wellness: How employers and advisors can provide the holistic and personalized help that workers need to balance competing financial priorities across retirement, wealth, and health.The investment landscape: How employers and advisors can help workers weather market challenges to keep portfolios on track in both the saving and spending phases.""More than two-thirds of the assets we manage for clients is in retirement accounts, so retirement is at the heart of what we do,"" said Dee Sawyer, head of Retirement Plan Services and U.S. Intermediaries. ""Our research shows that providing access to a retirement plan and encouraging participation is only the first step. Many people need help, whether it's education, guidance, or advice, on how to balance competing financial priorities with saving for retirement.""Story continuesThe U.S. Retirement Market Outlook included research and data from a dozen proprietary studies across T. Rowe Price, along with some industry data, which helped inform the insights and input from retirement strategists and investment professionals across the firm.Sawyer continued, ""Our outlook last year identified inflationary pressures and other headwinds as potential factors that could lead to lower expected returns and could impact retirement savings. As retirement savers, employers, and advisors navigate evolving and volatile market conditions, our U.S. Retirement Market Outlook uses the firm's recognized retirement expertise, research, and perspectives on investing excellence to deliver insights on emerging trends and their impacts on the retirement landscape.""A detailed account of the insights and research shared in the 2023 U.S. Retirement Market Outlook can be found at troweprice.com/retirementoutlook.

317,ffb18e71-f0d5-3744-875a-deac8a007eac,UPS,2022-11-17,Should You Be Adding United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) To Your Watchlist Today?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/adding-united-parcel-nyse-ups-120029863.html,1668686429,STORY,['UPS'],"[It's common for many investors, especially those who are inexperienced, to buy shares in companies with a good story even if these companies are loss-making. Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS). While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it. See our latest analysis for United Parcel Service How Fast Is United Parcel Service Growing?If you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. Impressively, United Parcel Service has grown EPS by 31% per year, compound, in the last three years. If the company can sustain that sort of growth, we'd expect shareholders to come away satisfied.Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. While we note United Parcel Service achieved similar EBIT margins to last year, revenue grew by a solid 7.1% to US$101b. That's encouraging news for the company!In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart.earnings-and-revenue-historyFortunately, we've got access to analyst forecasts of United Parcel Service's future profits. You can do your own forecasts without looking, or you can take a peek at what the professionals are predicting.Story continuesAre United Parcel Service Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Since United Parcel Service has a market capitalisation of US$153b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$122m. We note that this amounts to 0.08% of the company, which may be small owing to the sheer size of United Parcel Service but it's still worth mentioning. This still shows shareholders there is a degree of alignment between management and themselves.Is United Parcel Service Worth Keeping An Eye On?If you believe that share price follows earnings per share you should definitely be delving further into United Parcel Service's strong EPS growth. Further, the high level of insider ownership is impressive and suggests that the management appreciates the EPS growth and has faith in United Parcel Service's continuing strength. On the balance of its merits, solid EPS growth and company insiders who are aligned with the shareholders would indicate a business that is worthy of further research. Don't forget that there may still be risks. For instance, we've identified   2 warning signs for United Parcel Service (1 can't be ignored)  you should be aware of.The beauty of investing is that you can invest in almost any company you want. But if you prefer to focus on stocks that have demonstrated insider buying, here is a list of companies with insider buying in the last three months.Please note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.Have feedback on this article?

PWV seeks to match the performance of the Dynamic Large Cap Value Intellidex Index before fees and expenses.The Dynamic Large Cap Value Intellidex Index is designed to provide capital appreciation while maintaining consistent stylistically accurate exposure.Cost &amp; Other ExpensesFor ETF investors, expense ratios are an important factor when considering a fund's return; in the long-term, cheaper funds actually have the ability to outperform their more expensive cousins if all other things remain the same.Operating expenses on an annual basis are 0.55% for PWV, making it one of the more expensive products in the space.Story continuesPWV's 12-month trailing dividend yield is 2.21%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsWhile ETFs offer diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk, a deep look into a fund's holdings is a valuable exercise. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation in the Healthcare sector - about 24.80% of the portfolio. Financials and Energy round out the top three.When you look at individual holdings, United Parcel Service Inc (UPS) accounts for about 3.94% of the fund's total assets, followed by Oracle Corp (ORCL) and Home Depot Inc/the (HD).The top 10 holdings account for about 35.27% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskYear-to-date, the Invesco Dynamic Large Cap Value ETF has lost about -1.98% so far, and is up about 1.19% over the last 12 months (as of 11/17/2022). PWV has traded between $41.65 and $50.64 in this past 52-week period.PWV has a beta of 0.89 and standard deviation of 24.58% for the trailing three-year period, which makes the fund a medium risk choice in the space. With about 51 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesInvesco Dynamic Large Cap Value ETF is an excellent option for investors seeking to outperform the Style Box - Large Cap Value segment of the market. There are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider as well.IShares Russell 1000 Value ETF (IWD) tracks Russell 1000 Value Index and the Vanguard Value ETF (VTV) tracks CRSP U.S. Large Cap Value Index. IShares Russell 1000 Value ETF has $54.47 billion in assets, Vanguard Value ETF has $104.38 billion. IWD has an expense ratio of 0.18% and VTV charges 0.04%.Investors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the Style Box - Large Cap Value.Bottom LineTo learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In January, U.S. consumer prices surged 6.4% from a year ago — down from 9.1% in June 2022 but still worryingly high.Spiking inflation has severe consequences for your cash savings.Don't missGoldman Sachs says bitcoin is not investable — this is where they think you should put 33% of your wealth insteadCentibillionaire Jeff Bezos says don't waste your money on a new car or household purchase — here are 3 better recession-proof buys insteadAmericans are paying nearly 40% more on home insurance compared to 12 years ago — here's how to spend less on peace of mindFortunately, investing legend Warren Buffett has plenty of advice on what to own when consumer prices spike.In a 1981 letter to shareholders, Buffett highlighted two business traits that investors should look for when trying to fight inflation: 1) the power to increase prices easily, and 2) the ability to take on more business without having to spend excessively.Here are four Berkshire holdings that largely boast those characteristics.American Express (AXP)In 2021, American Express demonstrated its pricing power as it raised the annual fee on its Platinum Card from $550 to $695.The company also stands to directly benefit in an inflationary environment.American Express makes most of its money through discount fees — merchants are charged a percentage of every Amex card transaction. As the price of goods and services increases, the company gets to take a cut of larger bills.Business is booming. In 2022, the company’s revenue jumped 25% year over year to $52.9 billion.American Express is the fourth-largest holding at Berkshire Hathaway. Owning 151.6 million shares of AXP, Berkshire’s stake is worth around $27.2 billion.Berkshire also owns shares of American Express competitors Visa and Mastercard, although the positions are much smaller.American Express shares currently offer a dividend yield of 1.2%.Coca-Cola (KO)Coca-Cola is a classic example of a recession-resistant business. Whether the economy is booming or struggling, a can of Coke is affordable to most people.Story continuesThe company’s entrenched market position, massive scale, and portfolio of iconic brands — including names like Sprite, Fresca, Dasani and Smartwater — give it plenty of pricing power.Add solid geographic diversification — its products are sold in more than 200 countries and territories around the globe — and it’s clear that Coca-Cola can thrive through thick and thin. After all, the company went public more than 100 years ago.Buffett has held Coca-Cola in his portfolio since the late ’80s. Today, Berkshire owns 400 million shares of the company, worth approximately $23.7 billion.You can lock in a dividend yield of 3.0% on Coca-Cola's shares at current prices.Read more: Rich young Americans have lost confidence in the stock market — and are betting on these 3 assets instead. Get in now for strong long-term tailwindsApple (AAPL)No one who spends $1,600 for a fully decked-out iPhone 14 Pro Max would call it a steal. But consumers love splurging on Apple products anyway.Earlier this month, management revealed that the company’s active installed base of hardware has surpassed two billion devices.While competitors offer cheaper devices, millions of users don’t want to live outside of the Apple ecosystem. The ecosystem acts as an economic moat, allowing the company to earn oversized profits.It also means that as inflation spikes, Apple can pass higher costs to its global consumer base without worrying too much about a drop in sales volume.Today, Apple is Buffett’s largest publicly traded holding, representing more than 40% of Berkshire’s portfolio by market value. Of course, the sheer increase in Apple’s stock price is one of the reasons for that concentration. Over the past five years, shares of the tech gorilla have surged more than 250%.Apple currently offers a dividend yield of 0.6%.Chevron (CVX)One of Buffett’s big moves in 2022 was loading up on Chevron. According to an SEC filing, Berkshire owned $29.3 billion of the energy giant as of Dec. 31 — a significant jump from its stake of $4.5 billion at the end of 2021.Today, Chevron represents the third-largest public holding at Berkshire.It’s not difficult to understand why. Even though the oil business is capital intensive, it tends to do very well during periods of high inflation.Oil — the most heavily traded commodity globally — shot up in the first half of 2022. While it pulled back in the second half, the supply shock caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine could keep the commodity in demand.Strong oil prices benefit oil producers. Chevron reported earnings of $35.5 billion for 2022, which represented a 127% increase from 2021.The stock is up more than 25% over the last 12 months.The company returns cash to investors, too. Paying quarterly dividends of $1.51 per share, Chevron has an annual yield of 3.6%.A better way to shockproof?Of course, picking good stocks isn't the only way to protect your portfolio.Amid hot inflation and the uncertain economy, moguls are still finding ways to effectively invest their millions outside of the stock market.Prime commercial real estate, for example, has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 over a 25-year period. With the help of new platforms, these kinds of opportunities are now available to retail investors. Not just the ultra rich.With a single investment, investors can own institutional-quality properties leased by brands like CVS, Kroger and Walmart — and collect stable grocery store-anchored income on a quarterly basis.This article provides information only and should not be construed as advice.

Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the highly elevated P/E.Mondelez International could be doing better as its earnings have been going backwards lately while most other companies have been seeing positive earnings growth. One possibility is that the P/E is high because investors think this poor earnings performance will turn the corner. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason. See our latest analysis for Mondelez International peIf you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report on Mondelez International.How Is Mondelez International's Growth Trending?The only time you'd be truly comfortable seeing a P/E as steep as Mondelez International's is when the company's growth is on track to outshine the market decidedly.Retrospectively, the last year delivered a frustrating 28% decrease to the company's bottom line. This means it has also seen a slide in earnings over the longer-term as EPS is down 17% in total over the last three years. Accordingly, shareholders would have felt downbeat about the medium-term rates of earnings growth.Turning to the outlook, the next three years should generate growth of 14% per year as estimated by the analysts watching the company. With the market only predicted to deliver 9.0% each year, the company is positioned for a stronger earnings result.In light of this, it's understandable that Mondelez International's P/E sits above the majority of other companies. Apparently shareholders aren't keen to offload something that is potentially eyeing a more prosperous future.Story continuesThe Key TakeawayWe'd say the price-to-earnings ratio's power isn't primarily as a valuation instrument but rather to gauge current investor sentiment and future expectations.As we suspected, our examination of Mondelez International's analyst forecasts revealed that its superior earnings outlook is contributing to its high P/E. Right now shareholders are comfortable with the P/E as they are quite confident future earnings aren't under threat. It's hard to see the share price falling strongly in the near future under these circumstances.You need to take note of risks, for example - Mondelez International has 3 warning signs   (and 1 which is significant) we think you should know about.If these risks are making you reconsider your opinion on Mondelez International, explore our interactive list of high quality stocks to get an idea of what else is out there.Have feedback on this article?

But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors? We'll need to take a closer look to find out.We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.Right now, PetIQ is sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Boston Scientific has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that PETQ is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.PETQ currently has a forward P/E ratio of 9.11, while BSX has a forward P/E of 24.50. We also note that PETQ has a PEG ratio of 1.14. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. BSX currently has a PEG ratio of 2.37.Another notable valuation metric for PETQ is its P/B ratio of 1.59. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, BSX has a P/B of 3.44.These are just a few of the metrics contributing to PETQ's Value grade of A and BSX's Value grade of C.PETQ is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook, which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model.

(NASDAQ:ULTA)",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/calculating-fair-value-ulta-beauty-175937786.html,1668621577,STORY,['ULTA'],"[In this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of Ulta Beauty, Inc. (NASDAQ:ULTA) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Ulta Beauty What's The Estimated Valuation?We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$967.2mUS$1.12bUS$1.08bUS$1.22bUS$1.30bUS$1.36bUS$1.42bUS$1.46bUS$1.50bUS$1.54bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x8Analyst x8Analyst x3Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 4.62%Est @ 3.83%Est @ 3.27%Est @ 2.89%Est @ 2.61% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.1% US$903US$978US$877US$924US$923US$901US$874US$842US$809US$775(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$8.8bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.1%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.5b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.1%– 2.0%) = US$31bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$31b÷ ( 1 + 7.1%)10= US$15bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$24b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$436, the company appears about fair value at a 7.4% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Ulta Beauty as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.005. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Looking Ahead:Whilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. For Ulta Beauty, we've put together three further factors you should further research:Risks: Take risks, for example - Ulta Beauty has   1 warning sign   we think you should be aware of.Future Earnings: How does ULTA's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

In addition to solid growth in CF revenues that has driven better-than-expected results, positive progress in its development pipeline has lifted shares. At the time of our Q2 2021 purchase, the stock was under pressure due to regulatory hurdles and Vertex’s decision not to pursue late-stage development of VX-864 after an unexpectedly unfavorable outcome. VX-864 is designed to treat alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD), which is an inherited disorder with a strong correlation to pediatric liver disease. Irrespective of Vertex’s AATD pipeline, the company has nearly two decades of patent protection remaining for its CF franchise. Management maintains a healthy reserve of cash and is focusing on research and development. We believe near-term growth is likely to be driven by Vertex’s expanding geographic presence and expansion of medicines to lower age groups, with long-term gains arising from the company’s diversifying pipeline.""Story continuesEasiest Md/PhD Programs to Get IntoCopyright: dolgachov / 123RF Stock PhotoVertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ:VRTX) is not on our list of 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds.

In January, U.S. consumer prices surged 6.4% from a year ago — down from 9.1% in June 2022 but still worryingly high.Spiking inflation has severe consequences for your cash savings.Don't missGoldman Sachs says bitcoin is not investable — this is where they think you should put 33% of your wealth insteadCentibillionaire Jeff Bezos says don't waste your money on a new car or household purchase — here are 3 better recession-proof buys insteadAmericans are paying nearly 40% more on home insurance compared to 12 years ago — here's how to spend less on peace of mindFortunately, investing legend Warren Buffett has plenty of advice on what to own when consumer prices spike.In a 1981 letter to shareholders, Buffett highlighted two business traits that investors should look for when trying to fight inflation: 1) the power to increase prices easily, and 2) the ability to take on more business without having to spend excessively.Here are four Berkshire holdings that largely boast those characteristics.American Express (AXP)In 2021, American Express demonstrated its pricing power as it raised the annual fee on its Platinum Card from $550 to $695.The company also stands to directly benefit in an inflationary environment.American Express makes most of its money through discount fees — merchants are charged a percentage of every Amex card transaction. As the price of goods and services increases, the company gets to take a cut of larger bills.Business is booming. In 2022, the company’s revenue jumped 25% year over year to $52.9 billion.American Express is the fourth-largest holding at Berkshire Hathaway. Owning 151.6 million shares of AXP, Berkshire’s stake is worth around $27.2 billion.Berkshire also owns shares of American Express competitors Visa and Mastercard, although the positions are much smaller.American Express shares currently offer a dividend yield of 1.2%.Coca-Cola (KO)Coca-Cola is a classic example of a recession-resistant business. Whether the economy is booming or struggling, a can of Coke is affordable to most people.Story continuesThe company’s entrenched market position, massive scale, and portfolio of iconic brands — including names like Sprite, Fresca, Dasani and Smartwater — give it plenty of pricing power.Add solid geographic diversification — its products are sold in more than 200 countries and territories around the globe — and it’s clear that Coca-Cola can thrive through thick and thin. After all, the company went public more than 100 years ago.Buffett has held Coca-Cola in his portfolio since the late ’80s. Today, Berkshire owns 400 million shares of the company, worth approximately $23.7 billion.You can lock in a dividend yield of 3.0% on Coca-Cola's shares at current prices.Read more: Rich young Americans have lost confidence in the stock market — and are betting on these 3 assets instead. Get in now for strong long-term tailwindsApple (AAPL)No one who spends $1,600 for a fully decked-out iPhone 14 Pro Max would call it a steal. But consumers love splurging on Apple products anyway.Earlier this month, management revealed that the company’s active installed base of hardware has surpassed two billion devices.While competitors offer cheaper devices, millions of users don’t want to live outside of the Apple ecosystem. The ecosystem acts as an economic moat, allowing the company to earn oversized profits.It also means that as inflation spikes, Apple can pass higher costs to its global consumer base without worrying too much about a drop in sales volume.Today, Apple is Buffett’s largest publicly traded holding, representing more than 40% of Berkshire’s portfolio by market value. Of course, the sheer increase in Apple’s stock price is one of the reasons for that concentration. Over the past five years, shares of the tech gorilla have surged more than 250%.Apple currently offers a dividend yield of 0.6%.Chevron (CVX)One of Buffett’s big moves in 2022 was loading up on Chevron. According to an SEC filing, Berkshire owned $29.3 billion of the energy giant as of Dec. 31 — a significant jump from its stake of $4.5 billion at the end of 2021.Today, Chevron represents the third-largest public holding at Berkshire.It’s not difficult to understand why. Even though the oil business is capital intensive, it tends to do very well during periods of high inflation.Oil — the most heavily traded commodity globally — shot up in the first half of 2022. While it pulled back in the second half, the supply shock caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine could keep the commodity in demand.Strong oil prices benefit oil producers. Chevron reported earnings of $35.5 billion for 2022, which represented a 127% increase from 2021.The stock is up more than 25% over the last 12 months.The company returns cash to investors, too. Paying quarterly dividends of $1.51 per share, Chevron has an annual yield of 3.6%.A better way to shockproof?Of course, picking good stocks isn't the only way to protect your portfolio.Amid hot inflation and the uncertain economy, moguls are still finding ways to effectively invest their millions outside of the stock market.Prime commercial real estate, for example, has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 over a 25-year period. With the help of new platforms, these kinds of opportunities are now available to retail investors. Not just the ultra rich.With a single investment, investors can own institutional-quality properties leased by brands like CVS, Kroger and Walmart — and collect stable grocery store-anchored income on a quarterly basis.This article provides information only and should not be construed as advice.

(NYSE:WM)",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/estimating-intrinsic-value-waste-management-130033402.html,1668690033,STORY,['WM'],"[Today we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of Waste Management, Inc. (NYSE:WM) as an investment opportunity by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. Check out our latest analysis for Waste Management Crunching The NumbersWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$1.95bUS$2.69bUS$2.90bUS$3.13bUS$3.31bUS$3.45bUS$3.58bUS$3.70bUS$3.80bUS$3.90bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x12Analyst x10Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 5.58%Est @ 4.5%Est @ 3.74%Est @ 3.21%Est @ 2.84%Est @ 2.58% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.0% US$1.8kUS$2.4kUS$2.4kUS$2.4kUS$2.4kUS$2.3kUS$2.2kUS$2.2kUS$2.1kUS$2.0k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$22bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.0%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$3.9b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.0%– 2.0%) = US$79bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$79b÷ ( 1 + 7.0%)10= US$40bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$62b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$158, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Waste Management as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.0%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.977. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Moving On:Whilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. For Waste Management, we've compiled three important aspects you should consider:Risks: Take risks, for example - Waste Management has   1 warning sign   we think you should be aware of.Future Earnings: How does WM's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

To skip our comprehensive analysis of the waste management sector in the United States, go directly and see 5 Biggest Garbage Companies in the US.According to a report by McKinsey and Company, growth in the global economy has led to a drastic increase in consumption which, in turn, has led to an increase the use of resources. This has resulted in a rapid surge of waste production. Global demand for plastics is also on the rise, promulgated by the material's barrier properties, light weight, malleability and profitable production economics. Plastic consumption is expected to play a significant role in global supply chains, despite efforts to move away from single-use plastics. This rising demand of plastic has also spurred a drastic rise in plastic waste production. According to the report, since 2007, the considerable rise in solid waste production has strained waste-management systems in many countries, which has led to negative impact on the global economy, health, and ecosystems.Waste Collection Services Industry in the U.S: An AnalysisThe average American produces approximately 4.5 pounds of trash a day, leading the U.S. to produce 268 million tonnes of waste annually. Though the country is home to merely 4% of the global population, it is responsible for more than 12% of the planet's waste. According to a study conducted by Greenpeace USA, industry claims of creating an efficient, circular economy is nothing more than ""fiction"", as of the 51 million tons of plastic waste generated by households in the United States in 2021, only 2.4 million tonnes, less than 5%, were recycled. After peaking in 2014 at 10%, the trend of recycling in the United States has been on the decline, especially since China stopped accepting the West's plastic waste in 2018. Since the waste management industry revenue is highly dependent on waste production in any given economy, the market trends for the industry in the U.S. have picked up considerably since the pandemic in 2020, and a favorable future outlook for the industry is anticipated.Story continues15 biggest waste management companies in the worldThe waste collection services industry has recorded massive growth over the past five years. The market is highly segmented into industrial waste, hazardous waste, and municipal waste. Given that residential waste has remained relatively dormant during the period, accounting for 31.8% of the total market share, overall industry demand is stabilized. The market size, measured by revenue, has totaled up to $68 billion in 2022, and is expected to reach $229.3 billion by 2028, projected to grow at a CAGR of 6.7% from 2022 to 2030. Stringent government regulations towards open burning and illegal dumping, introduction of governmental regulations to curb greenhouse gas emissions like the Inflation Reduction Act, and legislative amendments by the Environmental Protection Agency to contain illegal dumping and burning of waste, are all driving augmented market growth. However, inadequate waste disposal methods, and labor intensive and high cost of transportation are anticipated to restraint the North American waste management market. Some of the most prominent players in the waste collection industry are Waste Management Inc. (NYSE:WM), Waste Connections Inc. (NYSE:WCN), and Republic Services Inc.

Last year, China's Foreign Ministry labeled the charges against Xu ""pure fabrication.""U.S. officials say the Chinese government poses the biggest long-term threat to U.S. economic and national security, and is carrying out unprecedented efforts to steal critical technology from U.S. businesses and researchers.FBI Director Christopher Wray has said his agency opens a new counterintelligence case related to China about twice a day.

The company is facing currency flactuation and pricing pressure which are key top-line headwinds. Concerns remain about its long-term growth drivers beyond its COVID-related products due to competitive pressure.However, there is no company as strongly placed in the COVID vaccines/treatment market as Pfizer right now. Its COVID-19 vaccine together with the oral antiviral pill for COVID-19, Paxlovid is expected to generate a combined $54 billion in sales in 2022. Pfizer boasts a sustainable pipeline with multiple late-stage programs that can drive growth.Nevertheless, according to the Zacks analyst estimate Pfizer’s top line suggest a CAGR decline of around 30% over the next three years.

The company’s a decline in equities revenues is likely to hurt the Global Market segment. A rise in the expense base will hinder the bottom line. Also, legal hassles and higher dependence on overseas revenues are woes.However, Goldman Sachs has a decent earnings surprise history. Its earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and missed in the other one. The company continues to expand organically and bolster its digital consumer banking platform.Other than business diversification, robust client engagement, a solid position in announced and completed mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;As), and a decent investment banking (IB) backlog are likely to aid in navigating weaker markets.

The company supply chain disruptions, including labor and material shortages and high logistics costs are weighing on the company’s performance. Weakness in the Power and Renewable energy segment due to lower volumes is concerning.Foreign currency headwinds are hurting the company’s top line. The company’s strong performance of the Aerospace and Healthcare segments is driving General Electric’s growth. Its investments in productivity and innovation should fuel growth going forward.Cost-control measures and pricing actions are aiding its bottom line.

The average selling price of US$500 is still lower than the current share price, or in other words, insiders would have been better off holding on to their shares.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. View our latest analysis for UnitedHealth Group The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At UnitedHealth GroupIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the President &amp; COO, Dirk McMahon, sold US$8.0m worth of shares at a price of US$543 per share. So we know that an insider sold shares at around the present share price of US$512. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. In this case, the big sale took place at around the current price, so it's not too bad (but it's still not a positive).Happily, we note that in the last year insiders paid US$1.0m for 2.24k shares. But insiders sold 74.33k shares worth US$37m. All up, insiders sold more shares in UnitedHealth Group than they bought, over the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeI will like UnitedHealth Group better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Insiders At UnitedHealth Group Have Sold Stock RecentlyThe last three months saw significant insider selling at UnitedHealth Group. In total, insiders dumped US$8.2m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Story continuesInsider Ownership Of UnitedHealth GroupI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. UnitedHealth Group insiders own about US$1.6b worth of shares (which is 0.3% of the company). I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About UnitedHealth Group Insiders?Insiders sold UnitedHealth Group shares recently, but they didn't buy any. Zooming out, the longer term picture doesn't give us much comfort. But it is good to see that UnitedHealth Group is growing earnings. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. In terms of investment risks, we've identified 1 warning sign with UnitedHealth Group and understanding it should be part of your investment process.Of course UnitedHealth Group may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free collection of high quality companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

352,ee0ab852-d2e4-3065-bfaf-3d2972d3ec6f,UNH,2022-11-17,UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (UNH) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/unitedhealth-group-incorporated-unh-trending-140002026.html,1668607202,STORY,['UNH'],"[UnitedHealth Group (UNH) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this largest U.S. health insurer have returned -3.7% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +11.4% change. The Zacks Medical - HMOs industry, to which UnitedHealth belongs, has lost 1.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.UnitedHealth is expected to post earnings of $5.18 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15.6%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -2.9%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $21.99 points to a change of +15.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.3%.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $24.89 indicates a change of +13.2% from what UnitedHealth is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.5%.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for UnitedHealth.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for UNH _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of UnitedHealth, the consensus sales estimate of $81.53 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +10.6%. The $322.88 billion and $351.51 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +12.3% and +8.9%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryUnitedHealth reported revenues of $80.89 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +11.8%. EPS of $5.79 for the same period compares with $4.52 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $80.72 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.21%. The EPS surprise was +6.24%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.UnitedHealth is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about UnitedHealth. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

353,f15f6aa9-deef-3cf6-b199-648c4cd0937c,EL,2022-11-17,The Estee Lauder Companies (EL) Strikes a Deal With TOM FORD,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/estee-lauder-companies-el-strikes-180406992.html,1668621846,STORY,"['EL', 'IPAR', 'THS']","[The Estee Lauder Companies Inc. EL is spurring its momentum in the rising luxury beauty category and is on track to become a leader in global prestige beauty. The company entered into an agreement to buy the TOM FORD brand — a global leader in luxury. Once the deal concludes, The Estee Lauder Companies will become the sole owner of the TOM FORD brand and its intellectual property. Management envisions closing the buyout during the first half of 2023.Per the deal, the total enterprise is valued at $2.8 billion. The Estee Lauder Companies will pay roughly $2.3 billion, net of a $250 million payment to ELC at closing from Marcolin S.p.A. (“Marcolin”). The transaction is likely to be funded via a combination of cash and debt, among others.The acquisition will accelerate the evolution of the TOM FORD brand as one of the leading global luxury brands. The deal will help ELC secure the long-term cash flow from the ownership of the high-growth TOM FORD BEAUTY brand, new licensing revenue streams and eliminating royalty payments. The acquisition will also generate synergies like creative oversight, enhanced speed and agility and scope for deeper online penetration.The Estee Lauder Companies anticipates the buyout to be dilutive to fiscal 2023 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) by negative 5-15 cents, mainly due to one-time costs associated with the buyout. The transaction will likely be almost neutral to adjusted EPS during fiscal 2024.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWe note that TOM FORD BEAUTY reported almost 25% year-over-year net sales growth in ELC’s fiscal 2022. Management expects the brand to achieve annual net sales of one billion dollars in the next few years. In addition, Ermenegildo Zegna Group and Marcolin S.p.A. signed long-term license agreements for TOM FORD fashion and TOM FORD eyewear, respectively, as part of the deal.What Else Should You Know?COVID-19 continued affecting The Estee Lauder Companies’ operating environment in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, including curbs in China that dented travel retail and retail traffic. Results were affected by increased inflation and concerns surrounding the recession, which led certain retailers to tighten their inventory. The company reported first-quarter fiscal 2023 results, with the top and bottom lines declining year over year. Margins also remained soft in the quarter.The Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) company expects the rest of fiscal 2023 to remain pressurized by temporary hurdles stemming from pandemic-led curbs in China, foreign currency headwinds, heightened inflation, supply-chain bottlenecks and the risk of sluggishness in certain markets globally. Incidentally, management expects net sales to decline in the band of 17-19% year over year in the second quarter of fiscal 2023.Organic net sales are anticipated to decline in the range of 9-11% in the fiscal second quarter. The quarterly adjusted EPS is anticipated to be $1.19-$1.29, indicating a 57-60% decline from the year-ago period’s levels. The adjusted EPS is likely to decline 50-54% at constant currency.EL’s shares have lost 17.9% in the past three months compared with the industry’s 23.7% decline.Story continuesStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks are e.l.f. Beauty ELF, Inter Parfums, Inc. IPAR and TreeHouse Foods THS.e.l.f. Beauty, a cosmetic company, currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). ELF has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 92.8%, on average. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for e.l.f.

The uncertainty, exhaustion, health concerns, and additional care required can take a toll on families, even during the transition from hospital to home.Some of that additional care includes protecting a premature baby's skin. Preterm babies' skin can be up to two times thinner than full-term babies, making it extra sensitive to touch and irritants1.That's why selecting the right diaper is so important for premature babies with heightened sensitivity to skin irritation. A few years ago, as the #1 Canadian Pediatrician Recommended Brand, Pampers partnered with NICU nurses to develop a special diaper designed for babies weighing as little as one pound, the first major diaper brand to do so.Now, in recognition of World Prematurity Day and November's Prematurity Awareness Month, Pampers® Canada is partnering with the Canadian Premature Babies Foundation (CPBF) and Préma-Québec to support families with premature babies.""We know that having a premature baby can be overwhelming and stressful for many Canadian families. That's why Pampers is partnering with Walmart Canada to bring attention to the impact of prematurity on babies and their families and provide financial assistance to two wonderful charitable organizations that are working to educate, support and advocate for premature babies and their families,"" said Irena Kahn, Brand Director, P&amp;G.To help babies and their families when they need it the most, Pampers® Canada is participating in these initiatives:In partnership with Walmart Canada*, Pampers® Canada will donate 8 cents to the CPBF and Préma-Québec for every Pampers® Swaddlers diaper pack sold at Walmart from Nov. 1 to Dec. 31, 2022.This funding will go towards support programs for families of premature babies, including mental health and wellness resources.For more information about CPBF's support programs, visit: www.canadianpreemies.orgFor more information about Préma-Québec's support programs, visit: www.premaquebec.caStory continues""The experience of premature birth can be traumatizing, scary and filled with unknowns, but Canadian families don't have to go through it alone. The CPBF is dedicated to helping them through peer support programs, resources, and research leading to improved outcomes and experiences for babies and families. Through these generous donations from Pampers® Canada, we will be able to continue this support for Canadian families,"" said Fabiana Bacchini, Executive Director, Canadian Premature Babies Foundation.Those who would like to donate to the CPBF and Préma-Québec through this initiative, can purchase Pampers® Swaddlers diaper packs in store at any Walmart location in Canada.For more information, please visit pampers.ca.About Pampers®For more than 50 years, parents have trusted Pampers® to care for their babies.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out Billionaire Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates 13F Portfolio: Top 5 Stock Picks.Ray Dalio founded Bridgewater Associates from his apartment in Manhattan back in 1975 and turned it into one of the biggest hedge funds in the world, with an asset under management (AUM) of over $150 billion as of 2022. Mr. Dalio achieved this milestone by developing a deep understanding of market forces and macroeconomic factors. As Mr. Dalio progressed, he established an ethos that made Bridgewater Associates one of the five most important private companies in the US, according to the renowned Fortune magazine. Given Mr. Dalio’s comprehension of macroeconomics and his unique investing perspective, some analysts have labeled him as the Steve Jobs of investing.Mr. Dalio’s investing expertise can also be gauged by the fact that the flagship Pure Alpha fund of Bridgewater Associates is up 22% YTD, while the broader markets have been heavily in the red due to global macroeconomic concerns. Some of the popular stocks held by Mr. Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates include The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NYSE:PEP), as of Q3 2022.BRIDGEWATER ASSOCIATESRay Dalio of Bridgewater AssociatesOur MethodologyIn this article, we discuss the top 10 stock picks of billionaire Ray Dalio’s 13F portfolio. These stocks have been picked from the Q3 portfolio of Mr. Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates. We have ranked these stocks in terms of the fund’s stake in them. The majority of these stocks appear to be defensive in nature and reflect that Mr. Dalio’s hedge fund is bracing for a possible recession.Billionaire Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates 13F Portfolio: Top 10 Stock Picks10. CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 65Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates’ Holdings: $293,711,000Percentage of Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates’ Portfolio: 1.48%CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) is a Rhode Island-based healthcare solution provider through its retail pharmacy chain, pharmacy benefits manager (PBM), and healthcare benefits (HCB) segment. The company covers various touchpoints in the healthcare segment through its divisions.Story continuesIn a research note issued on November 6, John Ransom at Raymond James gave CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) stock a target price of $115, along with an Outperform rating. The development occurred after the company reported better-than-anticipated Q3 2022 results that were driven by the stellar performance of the HCB business. Meanwhile, the performance of the pharmacy retail and pharmacy benefits management businesses was also in line with expectations. Furthermore, CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) is considered among the defensive stocks expected to hold its ground in case of a recession. CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) has an annual forward dividend yield of 2.26% as of November 14.Vltava Fund shared its bullish outlook on CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“CVS is a leader in the provision of healthcare services in the USA. It has three main businesses: an enormous network of pharmacies, a health insurance company, and “prescription benefit management”, which is a kind of intermediary between insurance companies and pharmacies. This is the result of large acquisitions over the past 15 years – most notably of Caremark (2007) and Aetna (2018). The markets had deemed its acquisition of health insurer Aetna too expensive (and we agree), so CVS stock then fell into disfavour for a few years.We took advantage of this in the summer of 2020 and brought the stock into our portfolio at a time when its price was pressed down still further by the coronavirus pandemic. CVS is a giant. It has revenues of USD 300 billion, making it one of the largest companies in the world. It is a relatively stable and highly profitable company with strong free cash flow. Over the past few years, CVS has focused primarily on reducing debt.This is already much lower than it had been after the Aetna acquisition, and most of the cash is now likely to go to shareholders through share buybacks or be used for smaller acquisitions to grow the company further. CVS trades at about 11 times annual earnings, which is a very appealing valuation given the expected future growth in profitability and overall modest cyclicality in its business.”9. Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 61Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates’ Holdings: $298,016,000Percentage of Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates’ Portfolio: 1.5%Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is a Chicago, Illinois-based healthcare and medical devices company.On October 21, Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) stock was assigned an Overweight rating and a target price of $114 by Matt Miksic at Barclays. The analyst believes that the sell-off following the Q3 2022 results has been overdone and has taken the stock price to levels seen in early October. Miksic highlighted that there were positives in the company’s results, as reflected by the encouraging performance of the cardio devices, diabetes instruments, and established pharmaceutical division (EPD). Experts believe that Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) has a strong balance sheet and can capitalize well on the fast-growing medical technology markets. The stock offers an annual forward dividend yield of 1.81% as of November 14.Despite the earnings beat and raised guidance, the stock price plummeted as investors believed that the results were primarily driven by the strong performance of the COVID testing services as opposed to the performance of the core business segments that fell short of consensus estimates.Diamond Hill Capital shared its outlook on Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“Also among our bottom contributors were health care products manufacturer Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), global pharmaceutical company Pfizer, media and technology giant Alphabet, and insurance company American International Group (AIG).Abbott has been working through a recall of its infant formula brand Similac in the US, which has continued to pressure its share price. Although the recall will impact near-term revenues, we are not concerned about any long-term impacts. We remain optimistic about the company given it is one of the highest quality names in health care, in our view, with a talented management team that makes smart capital allocation decisions. Abbott also has leading health care and consumer franchises with a particularly strong competitive position in its medical device business. The company continues to launch innovative products in key strategic areas (such as diabetes, structural heart, and diagnostics), which should help drive not only revenue growth but margin expansion.”8. Pinduoduo Inc. (NASDAQ:PDD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 41Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates’ Holdings: $317,064,000Percentage of Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates’ Portfolio: 1.6%Pinduoduo Inc. (NASDAQ:PDD) is a Shanghai, China-based social e-commerce platform with a user base of 900 million globally. The company has the distinction of introducing team purchase and consumer-to-manufacturer (C2M) concepts in the Chinese e-commerce sector.Pinduoduo Inc. (NASDAQ:PDD) has a strong affiliation with the Chinese agricultural sector, as 16 million farmers have connected with the platform as of 2022. The company is making headway in the US e-commerce market through its cross-border e-commerce application Temu. The application is one of the top e-commerce applications in the US in terms of new downloads. On October 17, Temu was the top shopping application on the iPhone Store in the US. Within a short period since its inception in 2015, Pinduoduo Inc. (NASDAQ:PDD) has emerged as one of the leading Chinese e-commerce players with international aspirations, just like Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) and JD.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:JD).Here’s what Tao Value said about Pinduoduo Inc. (NASDAQ:PDD) in its Q4 2021 investor letter:“On the detracting side, one of our largest detractors includes Pinduoduo (ticker: PDD). Pinduoduo (PDD) reported the second consecutive GAAP profit quarter yet missed on the revenue due to nation-wide consumption weakness &amp; scaled back Sales &amp; Marketing efforts. Market disliked it and the stock price plunged on the earnings. In my opinion, the accounting profits proved the original thesis of using S&amp;M to acquire users and using great shopping experience to keep them. After realizing the first growth curve, Pinduoduo now shifted its focus &amp; investment to agriculture. It is still very early, but the reduced size due to price drop warrants a position to watch and continue grow with such a team with strong culture.”7. McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 50Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates’ Holdings: $487,730,000Percentage of Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates’ Portfolio: 2.46%McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) is a Chicago, Illinois-based fast food restaurant chain known for its burgers globally. Furthermore, the company is also regarded as a real estate company as it owns thousands of locations around the world.

The analyst highlighted that the Q3 2022 earnings beat reflects McDonald’s Corporation’s (NYSE:MCD) ability to take a defensive as well as an offensive stance under any economic circumstances. The analyst added that the company’s US business does not require unit growth or significant remodeling in a rising interest rate environment. McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) offers an annual forward dividend yield of 2.24% as of November 14.Of the 895 hedge funds in Insider Monkey's database, McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) was held by 50 hedge funds as of Q2 2022.6. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 67Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates’ Holdings: $522,693,000Percentage of Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates’ Portfolio: 2.64%Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is an Arkansas-based retail company with a chain of discount department stores, grocery stores, and hypermarkets.Krisztina Katai at Deutsche Bank gave Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) stock a target price of $161 along with a Buy rating on November 11 ahead of the Q3 FY23 results. Experts believe that the company will outperform consensus estimates for the third quarter. Research has shown that there is still momentum in the grocery shopping category that will counter the adverse impact on the discretionary shopping category and Walmart Inc.’s (NYSE:WMT) general merchandise. Furthermore, there is a widespread belief that the company will reiterate its FY22 guidance despite the tough macroeconomic circumstances. Analysts think the current stock price dip can be an attractive entry point for any potential investor. Walmart Inc.'s (NYSE:WMT) annual forward dividend yield stands at 1.57% as of November 14.Leaven Partners shared its outlook on Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“In our last quarterly letter, I briefly mentioned that the consensus estimates for corporate profits appeared to be a bit too sanguine. I referenced a Reuters article that reported, as of June 17, Wall Street expected S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022, which was up from 8.8% in April and from 8.4% in January. That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6%[2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.”Besides Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Mr. Dalio also has a stake in The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NYSE:PEP) as of Q3 2022. Click to continue reading and see Billionaire Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates 13F Portfolio: Top 5 Stock Picks. Suggested Articles:10 Cheap Monthly Dividend Stocks To BuyTop 20 Investment Companies in the World15 Biggest Hedge Funds In the WorldDisclose.

(NASDAQ: GWRS), (TSX: GWR), a pure-play water resource management company, applauds The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) for receiving approval of an economic development agreement to build a new manufacturing facility in Coolidge, Arizona.As recently announced by Arizona Commerce Authority (ACA), the facility will support P&amp;G’s fabric care portfolio, which includes products such as Tide PODS®, Downy Unstopables® and Bounce® Dryer Sheets.According to the ACA, P&amp;G plans to complete a land acquisition this month, begin construction in 2023, and for the facility to be operational by 2025. It will represent a $500 million investment by P&amp;G and is expected to create about 500 new jobs.The facility will be located on 427 acres at Inland Port Arizona, a 2,700-acre mega-site currently under development by Saint Holdings. Inland Port Arizona falls within a 3.4 square mile region in the central Arizona corridor between Tucson and Phoenix, an area where Global Water received a certificate of convenience and necessity permit from the Arizona Corporation Commission to exclusively provide water, wastewater and recycled water services.“With a leading manufacturer such as P&amp;G locating to Inland Port Arizona, we expect the facility’s development and operation to stimulate further interest in our industrial mega-site, which will also attract commercial and residential growth to the region,” said Saint Holdings president, Jackob Andersen. “All of this economic activity generates job and population growth, with people relocating to Coolidge and the surrounding Pinal County region to support these facilities.”Global Water will now work directly with P&amp;G to provide water, wastewater and recycled water services to the planned manufacturing facility. Based upon P&amp;G’s stated schedule, Global Water expects to begin detailed design and permitting in 2023. Construction will commence thereafter, with a servicing goal of 2025. Global Water may begin providing construction water as soon as late 2023.Story continuesGlobal Water Resources president and CEO, Ron Fleming, commented: “We look forward to working with such a renowned company as P&amp;G. The new facility represents another major anchor to the Inland Port Arizona industrial mega-site, joining the new Nikola manufacturing plant that began production earlier this year. As more large facilities locate to this area, it enables the efficient deployment of infrastructure and integrated utility operations designed to provide safe, reliable and sustainable utility solutions for the entire region.”P&amp;G’s decision to build its facility at Inland Port came after several other manufacturers located to Pinal County, including electric vehicle manufacturers, Lucid and Nikola; semiconductor leader Chang Chun Arizona; aircraft services leader eCube; iconic brand Kohler; and battery innovator Cirba Solutions. The increased manufacturing activity has brought thousands of new jobs to Pinal County through direct production and supply chain operations.About Global Water ResourcesGlobal Water Resources, Inc. is a leading water resource management company that owns and operates 16 utilities which provide water, wastewater, and recycled water services.

SkiftThe world’s biggest airline is ready for Thanksgiving, having already battled through several hurricanes in recent months.American Airlines CEO Robert Isom played down any potential pressure points that could emerge during the upcoming vacation. In the longer term, the challenge may be identifying new flying habits as corporate travel blurs even further with leisure.Speaking at Skift Aviation Forum, held at the Statler Hotel in downtown Dallas, Isom was quizzed on stage on whether American was ready — with just a week to go.“Look, we’ve had three hurricanes in the last few months,” he told Airline Weekly editor Edward Russell. “We’ve had all sorts of issues. But October was one of the best months in terms of performance … I look at the holidays as a busy time, but it’s something I know we’ve had more pilots on hand, more attendants and team members. We’re ready.”Another reason behind the CEO’s confidence is that it is likely peak travel won’t be so peak-ish, as travelers spread out their vacations as they work remotely.“We’re seeing demand is more spread out,” he said during the “Re-Imagining Global Connectivity — Expansion for The Decade Ahead” session.Russell suggested: Is it a week-long Thanksgiving?“It’s interesting. Travel, as it’s come back, we’re doing things differently. People are spreading out, going past nine-to-five. I see it all over the place, and that bodes well. For our airports, and airlines, we’re not all beholden to the structure of the past.”Isom said smaller businesses were now outpacing travel from the larger corporates, and there was now a lot of of travel that was falling outside “the old corporate travel policy.”The trick is to now identify what is different, and the CEO believes it’s an upside that’s here to stay.“As we look at travel going forward, especially corporate travel, people will see it as a benefit, rather than an expense,” he said. “As people get back to the office, and the pandemic wanes further, it’s an upside.”Story continuesIsom acknowledged that it used to be fairly easy to identify the typical corporate traveler, who’d fly out and back for a day. Now it’s about leveraging data, and there were “obvious ways” to track business passengers, including analyzing their spending behavior.Airline CEOs are typically bullish, and Isom doesn’t believe the macroeconomic uncertainty rippling across the tech sector means much.“People have become more confident,” he argued. “The airline business is still 10 percent smaller than 2019. It’s not pent-up demand, it ‘s demand coming back at a level of 2019. Recession or no recession, demand is strong, and it’s at at a level where airlines are trying to get capacity back … over time, as we are able to meet demand, we’ll see where things go. No matter how the economy gyrates, we’ve got enough demand to support the capacity.”Get breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.]"

368,571acdf4-bd09-341e-9497-15faaef2766f,AFL,2022-11-17,Employee Burnout Is on Par With Levels at the Height of the COVID-19 Pandemic; Job Performance Impacted,ACCESSWIRE,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/employee-burnout-par-levels-height-151000739.html,1668611400,STORY,['AFL'],"[COLUMBUS, GA / ACCESSWIRE / November 16, 2022 / Due to continued COVID-19 concerns, a sluggish economy and the fear of a potential recession, there is a critical need for mental health care and resources to support employees, according to the nationally representative 12th annual Aflac WorkForces Report. The study - released by Aflac Incorporated, a leading provider of supplemental health insurance and products in the U.S. - captures trends and attitudes about the state of workplace benefits.According to the newly released report, more than half (59%) of American workers are experiencing at least moderate levels of burnout, a notable increase over 2021 (52%) and on par with the levels reported in 2020 at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to the 2022-2023 Aflac WorkForces Report.Mental health and well-being rise to the topThe study uncovers the enduring effect of stress and uncertainty on Americans, making mental health care a big priority for employers. Stress is not only impacting American workers' home lives, but also their work lives and, consequently, productivity. The survey found that employees are asking for mental health care in higher numbers than ever before, and employers are searching for new ways to provide it. Key statistics:Mental health negatively affected job performances of nearly half (46%) of the U.S. workforce in the past year - a significant increase over 2021 (34%).More than half (51%) of employers recognize that employee mental health issues have affected their businesses over the past year.Nearly 80% of employees state that mental health coverage is critical, yet only 61% have access to mental health care as part of their benefits package.Burnout has a detrimental impact on U.S. workforceSurvey responses show that burnout is associated with job satisfaction and loyalty. Employees who suffer from high levels of burnout report lower job satisfaction (55%), lower confidence that their employers care about them (47%), negative perceptions of work-life balance (55%) and a higher likelihood of seeking another job in the next year (56%). According to the report:Story continuesThe most financially concerned populations - Gen Z (71%), those working multiple jobs (66%), Hispanics (65%), those working multiple jobs (66%), millennials (65%) and women (62%) - are seriously affected by burnout.Yet 45% of employers are no more likely this year than last (43%) to view burnout as a problem for their organization.Over half (56%) of employees believe that their organizations care about their well-being at least a moderate amount. This sentiment is strongest among those with a hybrid working arrangement (70%).""A major concern of employee burnout is the impact on their well-being and how it affects engagement and retention,"" said Matthew Owenby, chief human resources officer, Aflac Incorporated. ""Employers are looking for new ways to offer benefits that help improve their employees' mental health balance. At Aflac, we help support our customers with access to mental health benefits, which is available through our individual short-term disability and group critical illness products.""2Employees and employers have differing views on financial stabilityAccording to the survey, many American workers are struggling financially, and even more are vulnerable to unexpected medical costs not covered by health insurance. While employers have always lagged in understanding the financial instability facing the workforce, this year, the gap is wider than ever.More than half (58%) of Americans say they could not pay $1,000 in out-of-pocket costs. This is most concerning for Gen Z (78%), African Americans (72%) and Hispanics (65%).About 3 out of 5 (57%) workers report suffering high levels of anxiety about health care costs exceeding what their insurance covers. This is most prevalent among Hispanics (69%), including both Gen Z and millennials (65%).Three-quarters (76%) of employers think their employees understand their health care costs well, while just 52% of employees agree.About 57% of employees are confident they will be very well covered in the event of a serious illness, and only 1 in 5 believe they will be covered extremely well.Hispanic (46%) - including both Gen Z and millennial (44%) - workers are the most impacted by inflation with nearly half indicating that rising costs have affected their ability to afford a medical treatment or prescription.""Soaring health care costs, lack of understanding of benefits on health insurance policies and the economic downturn have contributed to employees' anxiety about their insurance coverage,"" said Owenby. ""Hispanics and younger workers have been hard-hit by inflation with nearly half indicating that rising costs have driven them to choose between paying medical or other bills.""Supplemental insurance can help provide an additional layer of financial protectionAbout half (48%) of American employees view supplemental benefits as a core component of a comprehensive benefits program.Nine out of 10 employees believe the need for supplemental insurance like dental, life and vision is increasing.Nearly 77% of employers who offer supplemental insurance believe these benefits help with recruitment, and 80% say they help with retention.The COVID-19 pandemic brought about sweeping changes to the workplace, the workforce, and benefits enrollment and management, while also spurring a period of innovation in the benefits space. However, even with advancements in key areas such a telemedicine and other online resources, employees made it clear in 2022 that they value the human side of their benefits packages just as much. Offering robust mental health resources, flexible work schedules, and one-on-one support rise to the top this year as ways for employers to attract and retain top talent in today's competitive work environment.To learn more, read the 2022-2023 Aflac WorkForces Report at AflacWorkForcesReport.com.About the 2022-2023 Aflac WorkForces ReportThe 2022-2023 Aflac WorkForces Report, conducted by Kantar on behalf of Aflac, is the 12th annual study examining benefits trends, attitudes and use of employee benefits in the U.S. workforce in various industries and business sizes.

369,8270aa21-7468-3fa3-b30d-7e76d652f39e,SHW,2022-11-17,Calculating The Fair Value Of The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/calculating-fair-value-sherwin-williams-130029112.html,1668690029,STORY,['SHW'],"[In this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Sherwin-Williams What's The Estimated Valuation?We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.46bUS$2.87bUS$2.97bUS$3.19bUS$3.36bUS$3.50bUS$3.62bUS$3.73bUS$3.84bUS$3.93bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x11Analyst x10Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 5.22%Est @ 4.25%Est @ 3.57%Est @ 3.09%Est @ 2.76%Est @ 2.52% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.2% US$2.3kUS$2.5kUS$2.4kUS$2.4kUS$2.4kUS$2.3kUS$2.2kUS$2.1kUS$2.1kUS$2.0k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$23bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.2%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$3.9b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.2%– 2.0%) = US$77bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$77b÷ ( 1 + 7.2%)10= US$39bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$61b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$241, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Sherwin-Williams as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.014. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Moving On:Whilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. For Sherwin-Williams, there are three fundamental aspects you should explore:Risks: For example, we've discovered 1 warning sign for Sherwin-Williams that you should be aware of before investing here.Future Earnings: How does SHW's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out Billionaire Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates 13F Portfolio: Top 5 Stock Picks.Ray Dalio founded Bridgewater Associates from his apartment in Manhattan back in 1975 and turned it into one of the biggest hedge funds in the world, with an asset under management (AUM) of over $150 billion as of 2022. Mr. Dalio achieved this milestone by developing a deep understanding of market forces and macroeconomic factors. As Mr. Dalio progressed, he established an ethos that made Bridgewater Associates one of the five most important private companies in the US, according to the renowned Fortune magazine. Given Mr. Dalio’s comprehension of macroeconomics and his unique investing perspective, some analysts have labeled him as the Steve Jobs of investing.Mr. Dalio’s investing expertise can also be gauged by the fact that the flagship Pure Alpha fund of Bridgewater Associates is up 22% YTD, while the broader markets have been heavily in the red due to global macroeconomic concerns. Some of the popular stocks held by Mr. Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates include The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NYSE:PEP), as of Q3 2022.BRIDGEWATER ASSOCIATESRay Dalio of Bridgewater AssociatesOur MethodologyIn this article, we discuss the top 10 stock picks of billionaire Ray Dalio’s 13F portfolio. These stocks have been picked from the Q3 portfolio of Mr. Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates. We have ranked these stocks in terms of the fund’s stake in them. The majority of these stocks appear to be defensive in nature and reflect that Mr. Dalio’s hedge fund is bracing for a possible recession.Billionaire Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates 13F Portfolio: Top 10 Stock Picks10. CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 65Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates’ Holdings: $293,711,000Percentage of Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates’ Portfolio: 1.48%CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) is a Rhode Island-based healthcare solution provider through its retail pharmacy chain, pharmacy benefits manager (PBM), and healthcare benefits (HCB) segment. The company covers various touchpoints in the healthcare segment through its divisions.Story continuesIn a research note issued on November 6, John Ransom at Raymond James gave CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) stock a target price of $115, along with an Outperform rating. The development occurred after the company reported better-than-anticipated Q3 2022 results that were driven by the stellar performance of the HCB business. Meanwhile, the performance of the pharmacy retail and pharmacy benefits management businesses was also in line with expectations. Furthermore, CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) is considered among the defensive stocks expected to hold its ground in case of a recession. CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) has an annual forward dividend yield of 2.26% as of November 14.Vltava Fund shared its bullish outlook on CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“CVS is a leader in the provision of healthcare services in the USA. It has three main businesses: an enormous network of pharmacies, a health insurance company, and “prescription benefit management”, which is a kind of intermediary between insurance companies and pharmacies. This is the result of large acquisitions over the past 15 years – most notably of Caremark (2007) and Aetna (2018). The markets had deemed its acquisition of health insurer Aetna too expensive (and we agree), so CVS stock then fell into disfavour for a few years.We took advantage of this in the summer of 2020 and brought the stock into our portfolio at a time when its price was pressed down still further by the coronavirus pandemic. CVS is a giant. It has revenues of USD 300 billion, making it one of the largest companies in the world. It is a relatively stable and highly profitable company with strong free cash flow. Over the past few years, CVS has focused primarily on reducing debt.This is already much lower than it had been after the Aetna acquisition, and most of the cash is now likely to go to shareholders through share buybacks or be used for smaller acquisitions to grow the company further. CVS trades at about 11 times annual earnings, which is a very appealing valuation given the expected future growth in profitability and overall modest cyclicality in its business.”9. Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 61Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates’ Holdings: $298,016,000Percentage of Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates’ Portfolio: 1.5%Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is a Chicago, Illinois-based healthcare and medical devices company.On October 21, Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) stock was assigned an Overweight rating and a target price of $114 by Matt Miksic at Barclays. The analyst believes that the sell-off following the Q3 2022 results has been overdone and has taken the stock price to levels seen in early October. Miksic highlighted that there were positives in the company’s results, as reflected by the encouraging performance of the cardio devices, diabetes instruments, and established pharmaceutical division (EPD). Experts believe that Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) has a strong balance sheet and can capitalize well on the fast-growing medical technology markets. The stock offers an annual forward dividend yield of 1.81% as of November 14.Despite the earnings beat and raised guidance, the stock price plummeted as investors believed that the results were primarily driven by the strong performance of the COVID testing services as opposed to the performance of the core business segments that fell short of consensus estimates.Diamond Hill Capital shared its outlook on Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“Also among our bottom contributors were health care products manufacturer Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), global pharmaceutical company Pfizer, media and technology giant Alphabet, and insurance company American International Group (AIG).Abbott has been working through a recall of its infant formula brand Similac in the US, which has continued to pressure its share price. Although the recall will impact near-term revenues, we are not concerned about any long-term impacts. We remain optimistic about the company given it is one of the highest quality names in health care, in our view, with a talented management team that makes smart capital allocation decisions. Abbott also has leading health care and consumer franchises with a particularly strong competitive position in its medical device business. The company continues to launch innovative products in key strategic areas (such as diabetes, structural heart, and diagnostics), which should help drive not only revenue growth but margin expansion.”8.

Within a short period since its inception in 2015, Pinduoduo Inc. (NASDAQ:PDD) has emerged as one of the leading Chinese e-commerce players with international aspirations, just like Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) and JD.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:JD).Here’s what Tao Value said about Pinduoduo Inc. (NASDAQ:PDD) in its Q4 2021 investor letter:“On the detracting side, one of our largest detractors includes Pinduoduo (ticker: PDD). Pinduoduo (PDD) reported the second consecutive GAAP profit quarter yet missed on the revenue due to nation-wide consumption weakness &amp; scaled back Sales &amp; Marketing efforts. Market disliked it and the stock price plunged on the earnings. In my opinion, the accounting profits proved the original thesis of using S&amp;M to acquire users and using great shopping experience to keep them. After realizing the first growth curve, Pinduoduo now shifted its focus &amp; investment to agriculture. It is still very early, but the reduced size due to price drop warrants a position to watch and continue grow with such a team with strong culture.”7.

That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6%[2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.”Besides Walmart Inc.

(PEP) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pepsico-inc-pep-trending-stock-140002977.html,1668607202,STORY,['PEP'],"[PepsiCo (PEP) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this food and beverage company have returned +1.2%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +11.4% change. During this period, the Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry, which PepsiCo falls in, has gained 9.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, PepsiCo is expected to post earnings of $1.64 per share, indicating a change of +7.2% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.4% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $6.76 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +8%. This estimate has changed -0.1% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.25 indicates a change of +7.2% from what PepsiCo is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.1%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for PepsiCo.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for PEP _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For PepsiCo, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $26.74 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +5.9%. For the current and next fiscal years, $85.13 billion and $87.79 billion estimates indicate +7.1% and +3.1% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPepsiCo reported revenues of $21.97 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +8.8%. EPS of $1.97 for the same period compares with $1.79 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $20.88 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +5.24%. The EPS surprise was +6.49%.Over the last four quarters, PepsiCo surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.PepsiCo is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about PepsiCo. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE:JWN) is a Washington-based fashion retailer that manufactures and markets apparel, footwear, beauty products, accessories, and home goods through Nordstrom branded stores and online channels. In Q3 2022, Ken Fisher purchased 1.7 million shares of Nordstrom, Inc. (NYSE:JWN) worth about $29 million. In mid-October, Nordstrom, Inc. (NYSE:JWN) reiterated its previously forecast FY22 adjusted EPS of $2.30 to $2.60 and revenue growth of 5% to 7%. Market consensus for EPS stood at $2.34 and $15.58 billion for sales.On November 14, Deutsche Bank analyst Gabriella Carbone reaffirmed a Hold rating on Nordstrom, Inc.

(NYSE:JWN) in its second quarter 2022 investor letter:“The second thought experiment comes from my own personal experience in the period around the financial crisis. In 2006 I made an investment in the shares of Nordstrom, Inc. (NYSE:JWN). Over the following three-and-a-half years, the stock was up by 36%, outperforming the S&amp;P 500 by a very respectable 41.4%. A fund made up of a single holding in Nordstrom would have ranked in the top 1% of all funds in the Morningstar database.However, Nordstrom stock declined by a very painful 80% during 2008. A single-stock fund would have almost certainly liquidated during that drawdown, taking investors out of the game and ending any hope of them ever realizing the return. But because my portfolio was diversified, it held its value a bit better (it declined by 25% while the market was down by 38%), allowing me to sell some holdings and redeploy money into investments like Nordstrom that had declined severely.”8.

In the third quarter of 2022, Ken Fisher opened a new position in Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH) by purchasing 144,423 shares worth nearly $35 million. On October 26, Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH) declared a quarterly dividend of $1.33 per share, in line with previous. The dividend is distributable on December 2, to shareholders of record on November 14. Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH)’s dividend yield on November 15 came in at 1.71%. Citi analyst Timothy Thein on October 14 resumed coverage of Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH) with a Neutral rating and a $285 price target, suggesting 12% total return potential. The analyst expects less earnings volatility compared to past cycles, but said it will likely take some time for Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH) to prove this to investors. Further weakening in manufacturing data may result in a more attractive entry point for the stock, the analyst told investors in a research note.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 35 hedge funds were bullish on Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH) at the end of Q2 2022, compared to 39 funds in the prior quarter. Andreas Halvorsen’s Viking Global is the leading position holder in the company, with more than 3 million shares worth $755.5 million. Here is what Oakmark Fund specifically said about Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH) in its second quarter 2022 investor letter:“Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH), a U.S. company that specializes in motion and control technologies, is suffering from what we believe are investor misunderstandings and misjudgments, despite the efforts of the company’s unusually strong management team. In our opinion, since his promotion in 2015, CEO Thomas Williams has vastly improved operations and shifted the product portfolio to longer cycled, higher growth, higher margin and higher return end markets. The results are impressive. Margins, returns and earnings have increased substantially. With the expected closing of the Meggitt acquisition in the September quarter, the highly depressed aerospace segment will be its largest end market. We anticipate a rebound in aerospace revenue, which—combined with the company’s strong position in attractive businesses, including clean technologies and factory automation—should accelerate revenue growth. Parker Hannifin trades at a discount to other high-quality industrials, which we believe is unwarranted since its growth and returns should be similar or better. At a low-teens multiple of next year’s normalized cash earnings, Parker Hannifin is an attractive investment, in our view.”6. The Gap, Inc.
