While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates."", 'The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 21. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.', ""While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise."", 'Zacks Consensus Estimate', 'This insurance data provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.42 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -0.7%.', 'Revenues are expected to be $670.17 million, up 6.3% from the year-ago quarter.', 'Estimate Revisions Trend', 'The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.08% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.', 'Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.', 'Earnings Whisper', ""Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out.

However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only."", 'A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.', 'Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).', 'How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Verisk?', ""For Verisk, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects.

So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number."", 'For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Verisk would post earnings of $1.46 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.52, delivering a surprise of +4.11%.', 'Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.', 'Bottom Line', 'An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors.

One element that I discovered was the intense emotions that are part and parcel of involvement in the derivatives market. Glued to the trading desk, I was zeroed in on every blip and every dip. I also agonized in the closing hours of the session whether I should stay or leave.', 'With long-term stocks to buy, you don’t think about that stuff at all.

However, the company will also benefit from longstanding demographic trends.', 'Following the end of World War II, the U.S. experienced a massive population growth – the baby boom. However, humans get older and when they do, they increasingly require care. Further, the focus on future political administrations in dealing with various healthcare reforms should be a net benefit to UnitedHealth. Again, aging is an inevitability and that affords UNH a level of permanent relevance.', 'Unsurprisingly, hedge funds understand this concept very well. Since the fourth quarter of 2022, these major players’ exposure to UNH increased by over 27%.

Further, as artificial intelligence protocols expand in scale and scope, computers will almost certainly require more storage and memory needs. To that end, Western Digital recently announced that it will invest billions into the development of cutting-edge memory chips for advanced innovations such as generative AI.', 'Not shockingly, hedge funds’ sentiment toward WDC is “very positive.” Per TipRanks, their collective exposure to WDC increased by 73.5% between Q1 and Q3 of last year.

On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.', ""While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise."", 'Zacks Consensus Estimate', 'This independent oil and gas company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.45 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -65.4%.', 'Revenues are expected to be $674.33 million, down 32.4% from the year-ago quarter.', 'Estimate Revisions Trend', 'The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 7.46% lower over the last 30 days to the current level.

The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.', ""Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only."", 'A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.', 'Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss.

Additionally, key producing regions continue to face challenging production economics due to the cost and availability of natural gas.', 'North America: Management believes nitrogen channel inventories remain below average following a strong fall 2023 ammonia season, nitrogen imports to the region that are below the 3-year average, and reported production downtime in the region during the fourth quarter of 2023. The Company projects that 91 million acres of corn will be planted in the United States in 2024 and that North American farm profitability will improve in 2024 compared to 2023 as lower crop prices are offset by lower input costs. As a result, management expects nitrogen demand in North America for the spring 2024 application season to remain strong.', 'Brazil: Imports of urea into Brazil totaled 7.3 million metric tons in 2023, an increase of approximately 3% year-over-year. Management expects Brazil to remain the largest importer of urea globally despite reported farmer caution regarding fertilizer purchases during this growing season as they evaluate the potential impact of poor weather conditions on the upcoming safrinha plantings.', 'India: Management expects India to remain a significant importer of urea in 2024 even as domestic production increases with higher operating rates at its new nitrogen facilities. Imports of urea in 2024 are projected to be in a range of 6.0-7.0 million metric tons.', 'Europe: Approximately 40% of ammonia and 25% of urea capacity were reported in shutdown/curtailment in Europe as of early January 2024 as high natural gas prices and lower global nitrogen values continue to challenge production economics in the region. Management believes that ammonia operating rates and overall domestic nitrogen product output in Europe will remain below historical averages over the long-term given the region’s status as the global marginal producer. As a result, the Company expects nitrogen imports of ammonia and upgraded products to the region to be higher than historical averages.', 'China: Management expects urea export controls and inspections imposed by the Chinese government on domestic producers to remain in place in 2024 in order to prioritize fertilizer production for domestic consumption. The Company also anticipates that the Chinese government will allow windows during the year that will enable Chinese producers to export. Urea exports from China are projected to be approximately 4 million metric tons for 2024.', 'Trinidad: Ammonia production in Trinidad in recent years has been approximately 1 million metric tons lower annually compared to the 2018-2020 average. Management expects ammonia production to remain below average due to anticipated higher natural gas prices and lower natural gas availability in the country for nitrogen producers.', 'Russia: Exports of ammonia from Russia continue to remain lower compared to prior years due to geopolitical disruptions arising from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the resulting closure of the ammonia pipeline from Russia to the port of Odessa in Ukraine. Exports of other nitrogen products from Russia are at pre-war levels, with product moving to countries willing to purchase Russian fertilizer, including Brazil and the United States.', 'Over the near- and medium-terms, significant energy cost differentials between North American producers and high-cost producers in Europe and Asia are expected to persist. As a result, the Company believes the global nitrogen cost curve will remain supportive of strong margin opportunities for low-cost North American producers.', 'Longer-term, management expects the global nitrogen supply-demand balance to tighten as global nitrogen capacity growth over the next four years is not projected to keep pace with expected global nitrogen demand growth of approximately 1.5% per year. Global production is expected to be further constrained by continued challenges related to cost and availability of natural gas.', 'Strategic Initiatives Update', 'Donaldsonville Complex green ammonia project', 'CF Industries’ green ammonia project at its Donaldsonville Complex in Louisiana, which involves installing an electrolysis system to generate hydrogen from water that will then be supplied to existing ammonia plants to produce ammonia, continues to progress. The electrolysis system is mechanically complete and commissioning activities are underway. At full capacity, the project will enable the Company to produce approximately 20,000 tons of green ammonia per year. Green ammonia refers to ammonia produced with hydrogen sourced through an electrolysis process that produces no carbon emissions. This represents North America’s first commercial-scale green ammonia capacity.', 'Donaldsonville Complex carbon capture and sequestration project', 'Engineering activities for the construction of a dehydration and compression unit at CF Industries’ Donaldsonville Complex continue to advance, all major equipment for the facility has been procured, and fabrication of the CO2 compressors is proceeding. Once in service, the dehydration and compression unit will enable up to 2 million tons of captured process CO2 to be transported and permanently stored by ExxonMobil. Start-up for the project is scheduled for 2025, at which point CF Industries will be able to produce significant volumes of low-carbon ammonia.', 'Certified natural gas purchase', 'CF Industries has entered into an agreement for 2024 with bp for the purchase of 4.4 billion cubic feet of certified natural gas, which is double its purchase in 2023. The certificates purchased by CF Industries are issued by not-for-profit MiQ and certify that certain natural gas produced by bp has a 90% lower methane emissions intensity - the ratio of methane emissions to natural gas produced - than the industry average. Methane emissions throughout the natural gas supply chain are a significant contributor to the lifecycle carbon intensity of ammonia production and the second largest source of Scope 3 emissions for CF Industries.', '___________________________________________________', '(1)', 'Certain items recognized during the full year and fourth quarter of 2023 impacted our financial results and their comparability to the prior year period.

Results were roughly in line with estimates, with revenues of US$6.0b and statutory earnings per share of US$2.30. This is an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance in its report, look at what experts are forecasting for next year, and see if there has been any change to expectations for the business. We thought readers would find it interesting to see the analysts latest (statutory) post-earnings forecasts for next year."", ' View our latest analysis for Edwards Lifesciences ', ""Taking into account the latest results, the most recent consensus for Edwards Lifesciences from 29 analysts is for revenues of US$6.52b in 2024. If met, it would imply a decent 8.5% increase on its revenue over the past 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are predicted to climb 16% to US$2.70. In the lead-up to this report, the analysts had been modelling revenues of US$6.47b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$2.73 in 2024. So it's pretty clear that, although the analysts have updated their estimates, there's been no major change in expectations for the business following the latest results."", ""With the analysts reconfirming their revenue and earnings forecasts, it's surprising to see that the price target rose 13% to US$90.47. It looks as though they previously had some doubts over whether the business would live up to their expectations. That's not the only conclusion we can draw from this data however, as some investors also like to consider the spread in estimates when evaluating analyst price targets. There are some variant perceptions on Edwards Lifesciences, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$105 and the most bearish at US$67.00 per share. There are definitely some different views on the stock, but the range of estimates is not wide enough as to imply that the situation is unforecastable, in our view."", ""Another way we can view these estimates is in the context of the bigger picture, such as how the forecasts stack up against past performance, and whether forecasts are more or less bullish relative to other companies in the industry. We can infer from the latest estimates that forecasts expect a continuation of Edwards Lifesciences'historical trends, as the 8.5% annualised revenue growth to the end of 2024 is roughly in line with the 9.0% annual growth over the past five years. Juxtapose this against our data, which suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in the industry are forecast to see their revenues grow 7.9% per year. So although Edwards Lifesciences is expected to maintain its revenue growth rate, it's only growing at about the rate of the wider industry."", ""The most obvious conclusion is that there's been no major change in the business' prospects in recent times, with the analysts holding their earnings forecasts steady, in line with previous estimates. They also reconfirmed their revenue estimates, with the company predicted to grow at about the same rate as the wider industry. There was also a nice increase in the price target, with the analysts clearly feeling that the intrinsic value of the business is improving."", ""Following on from that line of thought, we think that the long-term prospects of the business are much more relevant than next year's earnings. We have estimates - from multiple Edwards Lifesciences analysts - going out to 2026, and you can see them free on our platform here."", ""You can also see our  analysis of Edwards Lifesciences' Board and CEO remuneration and experience, and whether company insiders have been buying stock."", 'Have feedback on this article?

Our third quarter results reflect meaningful top and bottom line improvement. We saw our gross margin returned to more historical levels. And we continue to see a nice contribution from Manhattan toys, which contributed $6 million in net sales during the quarter as we continue to monitor the macro environment we are encouraged to see that recent economic reports indicate a more favorable outlook as the year progresses. However, the overall impact from the higher inflationary environment that has transpired over the past couple of years continues to be a prolonged strain on our consumers as reflected yesterday in yesterday's CPR report. This is particularly evident at the lower end of the income scale with those consumers have experienced a longer term effect to their discretionary income due to higher interest rates for mortgages and credit cards as well as the resumption of student loan repayment another encouraging update is the reopening of 11 buybuy BABY stores, which started during the quarter. Although we did ship product to these locations, we expect this to be a more gradual benefit as they slowly roll rollout of the opening of more stores. About Bailey's goal to open a hundred additional stores over the next few years would equal the number of stores that were closed as part of last year's bankruptcy. These openings would be a great benefit, giving us additional physical locations for consumers to get a firsthand look and feel for our products, particularly our higher-end infant bedding offering. We also continue to work with other specialty retailers to add our products to their shelves. We have made good controls on our inventory throughout the year as major retailers continue to carry lower levels of goods within their system. At the end of the quarter, total inventory was $34.9 million compared to $34.2 million at the end of fiscal '23 compared to the same period last year. Nojo and Sassy inventory levels have declined from $25.8 million last year to $22.7 million this year.With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Craig to cover the financials in more detail."", ""Thank you, Olivia, and good morning. Everyone. net sales for the third quarter of fiscal '24 increased approximately 25% to $23.8 million compared to $19 million in the prior year. Quarter. The increase is attributable to the addition of Manhattan toys, which added $6 million in net sales to the current year quarter. Net sales of bedding, blankets and accessories were essentially flat as consumers face the economic pressures that Olivia mentioned.Gross profit for the quarter was 27% compared to 23.7% in the third quarter of fiscal '23 as margins have returned to historical levels and consistent with year to date margins.Marketing and administrative expenses were $4.1 million in the current year quarter versus $2.7 million in the prior year quarter. This increase is primarily related to expenses associated with Manhattan toys. Net income for the quarter was $1.7 million or $0.17 per diluted share compared to net income of $1.3 million or $0.13 per diluted share in the prior year quarter.Turning now to our balance sheet cash and cash equivalents at the end of the third quarter were $683,000 compared to $1.7 million at the end of fiscal '23 borrowings on our revolver at the end of the quarter were $10 million compared to $12.7 million at the end of fiscal '23. And finally, we paid our regular quarterly dividend of $0.08 per share and declared our next dividend, which will be paid in April on an annualized basis. Our shares currently offer just over 6% yield based on yesterday's closing price.And now I will turn the call back over to Olivia for additional comments."", ""And Craig, as we approach the end of fiscal 2024 we continue to implement our long-term strategic plan, which was approved by our board in fiscal 2023. As a reminder, this plan includes continuing growth in our toy category through market share expansion within both Sassy and Manhattan toys. Toys are projected to represent nearly half of our overall sales for fiscal 2024 compared to just 17% at the end of fiscal 2023. We also have plans to enter into new and adjacent product categories through a combination of organic growth and strategic acquisitions. We are working on product development to bring select items from the Manhattan toy lineup into Walmart if the price points makes sense. And we continue to look at additional acquisition opportunities that expand or complement our existing portfolio selling direct to consumers has remained challenging given the significant upfront spending to build out the website followed by advertising of the brand. Manhattan toys had a website in place at the time of the acquisition, which we are using to sell some of the Sassy brand and our NoJo brand is ready to launch its own website. The remainder of the plan is centered on implementing operating cost efficiencies and investing in technology and our organizational structure. Our Company has a long track record of holding expenses in line and we will continue to run the business with this at the forefront.Overall, we continue to manage our business through the ongoing macroeconomic challenges while positioning our brands to capitalize when the overall economy improves. We believe the long-term prospects of the company remain favorable as evidenced by our long-standing track record and dividends and look forward to delivering long-term value to our shareholders.With that, I'd like to open up the line for questions Daniel"", 'Operator', '(Operator instructions) Douglas Ruth, Lennox financial services.', 'Douglas Ruth', 'Greg Craig, congratulations. A very good report are coming back in for you. Can you talk about are you having any success lowering the main hit employee our manufacturing cost?', ""Yes, actually, we are. So I mean, we we kind of went into this with a look at everything from the First Call to freight on pretty much everything across the whole manufacturing channel, we've managed to get some decrease this quarter."", 'Douglas Ruth', 'Is there or is there more to come? Do you think.', ""We are always dry? And so I mean we're pushing on on certain things. I mean, as you know, the inventory that was already in the warehouse was at some higher cost. And so as we run through that I'm hopeful that we can see more modest decreases."", 'Douglas Ruth', ""Okay. And my understanding is that you are considering the possibility of combining our warehouses could do maybe explain to us what's happening with that."", ""And we're on the early stages of that. And so yes, we're starting to look at other locations for warehouses, possibly even outside of California. And so to do that, you know, it's a it's a pretty big commitment and it takes some time because when we do make a move, it will be for up at least hopefully 10 years or more. So we want to make sure we get it right? So we're looking at that on the front end right now, and hopefully we'll have a solution within the next 18 months or so."", 'Douglas Ruth', 'Okay. Very good. And my final question, can you are give us a little bit more color on what the relationship with Walmart and is it possible that maybe Manhattan client might be able to our get into Walmart maybe in fiscal 2025, anything you could share is appreciated.', ""So yes, we've got a very good relationship with Walmart, Sassy and NoJo have both been selling to them for many, many years longer than I've been at the Company. And so we are talking to Walmart. We do have some opportunities in. So a very minimal amount of stores in fiscal 2025. But hopefully the sales and go well with that, then we'll have an opportunity to expand more."", 'Douglas Ruth', 'Okay. Thank you for answering my questions and congratulations on a really a tremendous thought earnings report.', 'Thank you, Doug.', 'Operator', 'As a reminder, if you have a question, please press star one. If there are no further questions. I would like to turn the call back over to Olivia Elliott for closing remarks.', 'Thank you for your continued interest in our company, and we look forward to speaking with you again when we report our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2024 results in June. Thank you.', 'Operator', ""The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending. Today's presentation. You may now correct.""]"

The stock was trading lower by as much as 11% before closing with a nearly 9% decline. There was no Roku-specific news to account for the streaming video pioneer's slide. It doesn't report fresh financials until Thursday afternoon."", ""Shares of Roku tumbled after The Wall Street Journal reported that Walmart (NYSE: WMT) is in talks to acquire TV manufacturer Vizio (NYSE: VZIO) in a $2 billion deal. The potential pairing would be more about Vizio's growing smart-TV operating system platform than its meandering hardware business, placing market share leader Roku in the crosshairs."", ""Scary stuff? Not really. Let's go over some of the reasons why this shouldn't matter."", 'Most TV makers have partnered with Roku or other third-party platform operators for built-in solutions to transform their televisions into smart TVs out of the box, but Vizio has taken a more ambitious path. Its product rolls into your living room with its own proprietary operating system. There are now 17.9 million active Vizio SmartCast accounts, a figure that is growing while its TV sales have fallen over the past year.', ""Vizio has seen its SmartCast audience grow by 8% from where it was a year ago. It's moving in the right direction, but the gap is widening for the market leader. Roku has grown its audience by 16% in that time to 75.8 million users. It's not the only metric where Vizio is fading in Roku's rearview mirror."", ""The average SmartCast viewer is spending 3.2 hours a day streaming through the platform. Roku is at 3.8 hours a day. Vizio's average revenue per user (ARPU) over the trailing 12 months is $31.55, also well short of Roku at $41.03."", ""It's easy to see why a penny-pinching Walmart would be eyeing Vizio and its $1.6 billion enterprise value, rather than Roku with its $11.5 billion price tag. It's also easy to see why it can be gobbled up without much of a premium. Vizio stock was trading lower over the past year before leaping on the Walmart story. Roku stock has more than doubled since the start of last year."", 'If a streaming leader taking a hit because Walmart is buying a small rival sounds familiar you have a pretty good memory. Find me in a time capsule as a Netflix\xa0shareholder in 2010 when Walmart acquired premium streaming service Vudu.', 'Walmart had some initial success with Vudu, but it was no match for a leader with momentum. Netflix would go on to deliver wealth-altering gains for us shareholders. Walmart would dump Vudu on Fandango a decade later.', ""This particular deal could be even more problematic because of the devices angle. Walmart already sells its own private-label TV under its Onn brand, but that doesn't stop other manufacturers from selling their hardware through the country's largest retailer. Will that change if Walmart owns a competitor outright? How badly would Onn sales suffer if Walmart decides to replace Roku as the built-in operating system? This would be bad news for Roku, sure, but who would buy a TV from Walmart if they all came in one unpopular platform flavor?"", ""If you think Walmart going from friend to foe is a problem for Roku have you checked out its current competition? Roku is facing off against Apple, Alphabet, and Amazon. It's been competing against Apple TV, Google Chromecast, and Fire TV for years. It's doing pretty well."", ""Roku commands double the U.S. market share of its closest rival. It's the top dog in Canada and Mexico, too. I don't think Roku shareholders need to lose any sleep if Walmart is dreaming of a way to sell more ads. It's already fighting and winning against the titans of consumer-facing tech."", ""Roku remains the leading streaming service stock in a growing space. If Walmart is eyeing a small rival generating less than a fifth of the platform revenue of Roku, bring it. History has been kind to the market leaders, and Tuesday's sell-off could be an opportunity to pick up Roku at a discount ahead of a potentially promising financial update later this week."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Roku right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Roku, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Roku wasn’t one of them.

This renewed optimism is underscored by the addition of 353,000 jobs to the U.S. economy in January 2024, surpassing December 2023's revised figure of 333,000.Traditionally, the fourth-quarter reporting cycle includes the U.S. holiday season, which accounts for a sizable chunk of yearly revenues for retailers. Data released by the National Retail Federation (“NRF”) reveals a noteworthy 3.8% surge in sales, reaching a record-breaking $964.4 billion. This impressive performance aligns seamlessly with the NRF’s forecast, indicating a rise between 3% and 4%.No doubt, inflation and a higher interest rate environment have been subjects of concern across various sectors, including retail. Rising cost pressure, wage increases and higher promotional activities have put margins in the spotlight. This has spurred retailers into action, who are re-engaging with their customer base, recalibrating pricing strategies, refreshing product assortments and identifying opportunities to curtail costs.Also, companies have been undertaking a more consumer-centric approach — emphasizing membership programs, store technology upgrades, shopping via the mobile app and last-mile delivery solutions. Expedited delivery services like doorstep delivery, curbside pickup or buy online and pick up at store, as well as contactless payment solutions, have been aiding in maximizing the share of customers’ wallets.Per the latest Zacks Earnings Preview, the sector is anticipated to have witnessed top-line growth of 6.3% year over year in the fourth quarter of 2023. This follows a 5.9% increase in the preceding season. Meanwhile, the bottom line is expected to have increased 27.8% this earnings season.

According to the report, motor vehicle premiums surged by a staggering 20.3% in December 2023 from a year earlier in December 2022. This has been the largest increase in motor vehicle insurance premiums since the mid-70s. Auto insurance premiums are primarily rising due to the inflating cost of labor and car parts supported by the general expansion of car prices over the past few years.

I will now turn it over to Bill Hornbuckle.', 'William Hornbuckle: Thank you, Andrew, and good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us today. Our MGM Resorts achieved outstanding results in 2023, delivering all-time high adjusted property EBITDAR in Las Vegas and at MGM China. Notably, seven of our domestic properties set individual records for adjusted property EBITDAR for the full year. These outstanding accomplishments underscore the resilience and the agility of our team in navigating a complex operating year. In fact, our employees earned record NPS scores from our customers throughout 2023. I want to thank all of our dedicated employees who consistently strive to deliver on world-class service to our guests. The strength and resiliency of Las Vegas market has been particularly impressive.', ""Strategically you've heard me talk a lot last year about the evolution of Las Vegas as a new sports and entertainment capital of the world. You saw that fact proven out again Sunday, as the city proudly hosted Super Bowl 58, right in our own backyard. The game was another strong hotel and casino event for us with ADRs near a thousand, and posting three of the top five room revenue days ever recorded and near-record event gaming volumes. The game weekend is typically a strong event for MGM Resorts, but having the game in town amplified those results dramatically. The game on Sunday followed our inaugural Formula 1 race in November which was also an incredible success as the largest city event in our history. Additionally, we glean valuable insights from the event, and specifically on how to better price and program all of our resorts and streamline the preparation work for future years."", 'We both F1 and Super Bowl, our brand was on full display. Our proximity to the Legion Stadium, the F1 track, and of course, T-Mobile Arena offered us the opportunity to expand our reach during the city wide events. We also have officially launched our partnership with Marriott, with impressive early results. Marriott Bonvoy customers can now seamlessly book rooms at select MGM properties in Las Vegas with 16 brands set to be introduced by the end of Q1. In Macau, we ended 2023 with an all-time record adjusted EBITDAR for the quarter and the full year. Our robust market share was comfortably in the mid-teens and continued its upward trend in January. The strategic addition of 200 table games, coupled with the agile operations of our team, and the reinvestment into many amenities have collectively driven these exceptional results.', ""In digital, BetMGM made it full-year 2023 targets in both net revenue and second-half profitability. They also made significant strides in the technology roadmap -- with the launching of a new app design and was single account, single wallet capabilities being available now in most states. Looking ahead, our outlook remains strong. We're encouraged by the metrics we've seen in our business, including room and rates on the books and in the year, group attendance and future bookings, as well as a robust event calendar for the city. Our Las Vegas operations represent within 70% of our US brick-and-mortar. Adjusted property EBITDAR in 2023 will benefit from a number of key initiatives in '24. For example, our transient segment will grow as a result of the Marriott relationship, which will bring a new customer base that will be acquired at lower acquisition costs, higher rates and more spend on property."", ""On the Group side, the Mandalay Bay Convention Center refreshes nearly complete and we are poised to benefit from an increased 100,000 plus group room nights on the strip. With MGM's casino segment, we will drive growth from the return of Far East baccarat play, which is still below 2019 levels. We will leverage our branch office network to drive customers to our resorts in Las Vegas, and expect to see further recovery of international inbound flights, which is still only 75% recovered from Asia. Later this week, we will host our Annual Chinese New Year celebration at Bellagio and Aria which is already seeing strong gaming demand -- stronger gaming demand, excuse me, than last year. Our 2024 regional outlook anticipates demand to remain stable."", 'That being said, we are committed to consistently improving our operational model, sustained margins and foster steady generation of free cash flow. Our regional portfolio has historically proven to be highly defensive thanks to the exceptional high-quality assets we operate, the diverse set of non-gaming amenities we offer, our strong market-share positioning and overall customer loyalty. Looking ahead in Macau, our exceptional results for 2023 have carried into the first 45 days of 2024, driven by successful events, including a Bruno Mars concert at the MGM Cotai, driving strong visitation to our properties. Demand in our properties for Chinese New Year, which is also going on now is also very strong. As we look further into the year, the Macau government has set a target of track 33 million visitors in 2024, reflecting a 17% increase year-over-year.', ""It's the testament to our team's continuous innovation in craft and compelling experiences for our predominantly premium mass clientele. Our focus is on the New Year in Macau remained on three priorities, implementing strategic adjustments to our casino floor and existing room offerings to optimize yield, prioritizing the needs of our mass and premium mass customers, and actively driving international tourism. Turning to BetMGM. In 2024, we will soon be live in 29 markets with the launch of North Carolina next month. We had a noteworthy technology achievement in January with the approval and subsequent migration of the Entain platform in Nevada. This sets the stage for integration of a single account and single wallet in Nevada later this spring, which is critical to our omnichannel thesis with fully unlocked -- and will fully unlock one of the key differentiators for BetMGM by fully leveraging our Las Vegas properties."", ""Within our international digital space, in the UK, LeoVegas BetMGM's KPIs have exceeded our initial projections, demonstrating again the strength of MGM's brand. In fact, by leveraging the MGM Resorts balance sheet, we now offer the highest jackpot payouts amongst all competitors in the US, making our offers even that much more compelling. Turning to our development pipeline. In Osaka, we successfully began liquefaction countermeasures in the fourth quarter, maintaining our trajectory to commence preparatory construction efforts in 2025 on time for 2030 opening. Additionally, in New York. The request for proposal process is currently underway. We anticipate submitting our full application to the government by the middle of this year with a decision expected shortly thereafter."", ""Putting it all together, our Company is in a great position to generate free cash flow through 2028. We will deploy this free cash strategically to the development projects such as Japan and New York, we'll reinvest in our existing portfolio through maintenance and growth CapEx, which we are specifically focused on enhancing and expanding our luxury-oriented offerings and the repurchase of shares at attractive levels and investment, which we believe will still continue to generate strong returns. Jonathan, over to you."", ""Jonathan Halkyard: Thanks, Bill. And before I dig into the financial results, I'd like to join Bill in thanking our employees at MGM Resorts for an outstanding quarter and a truly great year. Well, I certainly focus on our exceptional financial results, we accomplish that and so much more together. Our consolidated businesses in the fourth quarter generated net revenues of $4.4 billion, up 22% from last year, net income of $202 million and adjusted EBITDAR of $1.2 billion. During the quarter, net cash from operating activities was $716 million and free cash flow was $387 million. It's important to note that $283 million in cash flow from operating activities and $18 million in capital expenditures related to MGM China, and they were included in the quarter."", ""For the full year of 2023, free cash flow was $1.8 billion. In Las Vegas, same-store net revenues, which excludes Mirage from the prior year period was $2.4 billion, up 10% over last year. On previous calls, we've talked about the fact that our operations in Las Vegas skewed towards the high-end with approximately 80% of our Strip adjusted property EBITDAR coming from our luxury properties. Interestingly, this year's revenues from our luxury properties increased mid-teens for the quarter and the year, representing approximately 90% of our absolute top line growth. And this further highlights the prominence of the higher-end segments in our business here in Las Vegas. Same-store adjusted property EBITDAR increased 3% or $29 million year-over-year."", ""Margins were about 36% in the quarter, well within our expected range in the mid-30s. In the regions, same-store revenue, which excludes Gold Strike was down 7% year-over-year, with same-store adjusted property EBITDAR decreasing $64 million, or 22%. It's important to note that approximately $60 million of the decrease year-over-year came from Detroit and National Harbor, where those properties were impacted by disruptions related to a strike and some high-end play not returning, respectively. There was also some lingering cyber incident challenges that specifically impacted the regional portfolio given the promotional offers were not available to our customers for the first half of October. Beyond these specific property circumstances in the fourth quarter, the regional property trends remained stable."", 'As we look to drive future growth within our domestic portfolio, our centers of excellence and property leaders have identified opportunities to increase our share of customer spend and drive organic growth. We see plenty of both near-term and medium-term opportunities to enhance revenue per occupied room night even beyond the benefits of the Marriott partnership. For example, adaptive pricing will maximize throughput within our high-demand outlets and will further enhance our ability to drive upsells and new product offerings. This includes bundled packages with room, show and food and beverage offerings. We expect these initiatives to drive RevPAR growth in 2024. Improved segmentation will allow us to increase personalization and enhance the guest experience while driving increased NPS and overall customer lifetime value.', 'An omnichannel purchase behavior by our MGM Rewards members will be enhanced by a single account, single wallet in Nevada later this year. Once in action, our customers will be able to open an account here in Las Vegas and bring that wallet home to continue their experience with MGM Resorts, allowing us to drive targeted marketing and outreach to further cross-sell our digital and physical assets. Moving over to MGM China. Our record adjusted property EBITDAR of $262 million was a 42% increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. This was driven by casino revenue which increased 31% versus the fourth quarter of 2019, and more specifically, our main floor segment table games win, which increased 74% from 2019. Margins were in line with the first three quarters of the year at 27%.', 'Market share was an all-time record in the fourth quarter over 16%, and for the full year, our market share exceeded 15%, which is 600 basis points above our 2019 performance and 300 basis points above our table fair share. On the digital side, BetMGM successfully met its 2023 targets by reporting positive EBITDA in the second half of the year, and reaching the upper limit of its net revenue from operations guidance of $1.8 billion to $2 billion. And let me close with as usual with a brief walk-through of our capital allocation strategy and our valuation. First off, we successfully closed on an amendment and extension of our senior secured credit facility this week. This expands our capacity by approximately $600 million to $2.3 billion, and extends the maturity of that facility to 2029.', 'The commitment from our relationship banks allows us to sustain our financial policy of a minimum $3 billion in liquidity, while deploying incremental cash for further high-return investments, including share repurchases. As Bill mentioned, we expect to fully fund the equity contribution in Japan and the commercial gaming expansion in New York with our free cash flow. Domestically, we intend to invest maintenance capital of approximately $600 million this year, or 4% of revenue, which is consistent with our historical trend. Major maintenance capital projects this year focus on luxury-oriented offerings, examples being the remodeling of the Bellagio Tower Suite, the Cosmopolitan Chelsea Tower Penthouses, and the MGM Main -- Grand main tower rooms.', 'As of the end of 2023, we had liquidity of $4.5 billion when excluding MGM China. Excluding the cash that we keep on hand to operate our business and keeping with our policy, we have $1 billion in excess cash, which will be allocated to international digital acquisitions, high ROI capital projects, and share repurchases. We continue to see great value in our shares, and during the year, with a $2.3 billion repurchase of our shares, we reduced our share count by 14%. To close, I would briefly like to discuss our enterprise valuation and why we still believe share repurchases are a remunerative use of our capital. Consider the following. As of yesterday, our share price was $47, and we had 320 million shares outstanding. This equates to a market capitalization of $15.1 billion, and if we add our quarter-end domestic net debt and subtract the market value of our 56% stake in MGM China, and analyst consensus estimates for the value of our 50% of BetMGM, then we have the enterprise value of our operations, less China and BetMGM of $10.6 billion.', 'Divide this by our 2023 EBITDA adjusted for corporate expense and we calculate and implied current trailing trading multiple just 4.9 times. We think this multiple represents a discount to the value that we see in our future cash flows, which provides us further conviction and returning capital to shareholders by repurchasing our shares at these levels. Bill, back to you.', ""William Hornbuckle: Thanks, Jonathan. Before I open it up for questions, maybe just some general comments on the year. And you've heard me say this and use this word resilient and luxury a couple of times. If you think about particularly this last quarter, we were on our heels with the cyber-attack. You all understood what that did to us, and so as we entered October to think we'd end up having the quarter we had, I just -- I couldn't be proud of the organization. And it particularly shown through in luxury. Bellagio after 25 years had its best quarter in its history and its best year in its history. And so it does prove that continuing to invest in these properties in the right place at the right time does make a difference."", ""And so we're very excited by thinking about that as we continue to go forward. I think about what happened with BetMGM and ultimately our database. MGM Rewards database now has over 44 million participants driven by BetMGM and ultimately, the omnichannel effect of that long-term we think to pay dividends. Macau is doing amazingly well. I know some of our competitors are wondering what we're doing. Kenny and the team broke through 20% in the month of January for market share. I'm not suggesting that's sustainable, but I will tell you, I think we have repositioned those two properties and we're prepared to compete on an equal basis with anybody in the marketplace. When I think about BetMGM, the original goal five years ago was to get into the top three because we thought it mattered and we have."", ""We realized there's focus on product. There's some things we need to do to maintain and keep market share. And we think moves by that team with Angstrom and other things have done that for us. We realize particularly this quarter there is pressure on regional margins. We know what they did. But remember what Jonathan said, $60 million of the $64 million was tied to two events, the Detroit Strike and ultimately a player in our National Harbor company didn't come back at year-over-year. We find ourselves we're one of the best balance sheets in the industry, which well positions us to invest in places like Japan and New York. We are looking aggressively at the UAE. And Gary Fritz and the digital team has constant things in front of us in terms of growing the balance of our worldwide digital business."", ""And so we're excited by all of that. And then obviously, if again you follow Jonathan's math, like every CEO, we think we're under-traded at 4.9 times, but obviously, you all will be the judge of that. So with that, operator, I will open it up for questions."", 'See also 20 Cheapest Places to Retire with Good Healthcare and 15 Worst States to Retire in 2024.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

According to the report, motor vehicle premiums surged by a staggering 20.3% in December 2023 from a year earlier in December 2022. This has been the largest increase in motor vehicle insurance premiums since the mid-70s. Auto insurance premiums are primarily rising due to the inflating cost of labor and car parts supported by the general expansion of car prices over the past few years. According to the report, auto insurance policies may not see an unexpected surge over the next 12 months. The report highlights that auto insurance prices have rarely contributed to the rise in inflation in the past. On the contrary, auto insurance prices were responsible for 15% of headline price increases in the fourth quarter of 2023. However, the impact auto insurance prices may have on the monetary policy over the next 12 months is rather ambiguous.

These companies are, literally, built to pass income on to shareholders. For conservative investors, Realty Income (NYSE: O) and its 5.8% yield is a good choice. For more aggressive sorts, EPR Properties (NYSE: EPR) could be attractive, given its even higher 7.7% yield. But be careful not to overreach and buy Annaly Capital (NYSE: NLY) and its 13.7% yield."", ""Here's what you need to know."", ""Realty Income has increased its dividend annually for 29 consecutive years. Although dividend growth has been modest over time, at roughly 4.3% a year, it has clearly been a highly reliable dividend stock. As for the financial foundation, the company's balance sheet is investment grade-rated."", ""Adding to the allure here is the REIT's business model. It invests in single tenant net lease properties, which means that its tenants are responsible for most property level costs. Although any individual property is high risk, Realty Income owns over 15,000 properties -- mostly retail, with some industrial and other assets in the mix. So the risk is fairly muted while the company's operating costs are protected from the impact of inflation. Regular rent bumps and acquisitions have driven and should continue to drive slow and steady growth over time. In all, Realty Income is the kind of high-yield stock you can sleep well owning, which will make the lofty 5.8% dividend yield attractive to even the most conservative of investors."", ""That said, if you're willing to take on more risk for a higher yield, then EPR Properties might be the choice for you. The company also uses the net lease approach, but its portfolio is much more focused. That's true in two ways. First, EPR owns only around 350 properties. Second, almost all of the REIT's assets are experiential properties, including things like movie theaters, amusement parks, and ski resorts."", ""This focus was a major problem during the early days of the coronavirus pandemic, when social distancing was used to slow the spread of the illness. EPR ended up suspending its dividend for a few quarters. It has since started to pay a dividend again. And while most of its tenants are in better shape today than they were back then, there's still some lingering pain in the movie theater business (about 40% of rents) that has to be dealt with. This is why conservative investors might want to err on the side of caution and not buy EPR. But the company's adjusted funds from operations (FFO) payout ratio in the third quarter of 2023 was a very modest 55% or so. That means there's a huge amount of leeway for EPR to deal with the ongoing headwinds facing the movie business."", 'If you can stomach a little adversity, EPR looks to be navigating its turnaround extremely well. The lofty 7.7% dividend yield could be well worth the extra effort that will be needed to keep track of the progress from here.', ""That said, the risk/reward profile of Annaly Capital probably isn't worth it. Yes, it has a huge 13%-plus dividend yield, but the mortgage REIT has also cut its dividend multiple times over the past 10 years or so. And each time the stock price has followed the dividend lower. That has left investors who reached for this stock's heady yield with less income and less capital."", ""To be fair, Annaly isn't really designed for small investors looking to live off the income their portfolios generate. It's meant for large institutional investors who use an asset allocation approach and look at total return -- which assumes dividends get reinvested. Mortgage REITs are fairly complex entities that can be affected by interest-rate fluctuations and housing market dynamics, among other things. Annaly isn't inherently a bad company, but that doesn't mean it's a good choice for investors looking to maximize the income their portfolios generate. In fact, history suggests that it's a less than desirable option if that's your goal."", ""The S&P 500 Index is offering a miserly 1.4% or so yield today, and the average REIT, using Vanguard Real Estate ETF\xa0as a proxy, is yielding around 4.1%. So both Realty Income and EPR are offering compelling yields, the difference being the risk profile of the two stocks. However, the risk profile of Annaly, despite its massive yield, probably won't be a good choice for most investors."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Annaly Capital Management right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Annaly Capital Management, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Annaly Capital Management wasn’t one of them.

Regardless of how much money you have to invest or your risk tolerance, there are stocks and/or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that can grow your wealth."", 'But among these seemingly countless strategies, buying and holding high-quality dividend stocks over long periods is tough to beat.', 'Last year, the Hartford Funds published an extensive report (""The Power of Dividends: Past, Present, and Future"") extolling the greatness that is dividend stocks. In particular, researchers at Hartford Funds, in collaboration with Ned Davis Research, examined the annualized performance of income stocks, compared to non-payers, over a half-century (1973-2022). While the non-payers generated a relatively modest average annual return of 3.95% spanning five decades, the dividend payers more than doubled the annualized return of the non-payers -- 9.18% over 50 years.', ""What's arguably most challenging for income seekers is weighing the risks associated with high-yield dividend stocks. Generally, the higher the yield, the more inherent risk there is for investors. However, this isn't always the case."", 'If you want $300 in exceptionally safe annual dividend income, you can get it by investing $4,975 (split equally, three ways) into the following three high-yield stocks, which sport an average yield of 6.05%!', 'The first high-octane dividend stock that can help you bring home super safe annual income is retail real estate investment trust (REIT) Realty Income (NYSE: O). Realty Income has raised its payout 123 times since going public, and it doles out its dividend on a monthly basis.', ""The clearest headwind for all REITs over the past two years has been the Federal Reserve's hawkish monetary policy. The fastest rate-hiking cycle in four decades has made it costlier to borrow. More importantly, it's sent Treasury bond yields soaring. When bond yields outpace the prevailing inflation rate, it can make bonds more desirable than stocks."", ""The counter to this headwind is that Realty Income isn't just a run-of-the-mill REIT. It's the retail REIT that pretty much every other retail REIT tries to mirror."", ""What's helped set Realty Income apart from its peers, aside from the size of its commercial real estate (CRE) portfolio, is that it primarily leases to retailers that are resilient to economic downturns. According to the company, approximately 91% of its total rent is resilient to economic contractions or pressure from online retailers. This is because the company's renters are primarily found in industries that draw customer traffic in any economic climate. I'm talking about grocery stores, convenience stores, dollar stores, drug stores, and home improvement stores, which collectively account for almost 41% of the company's annualized contractual rent."", 'Another reason Realty Income has set the standard among retail REITs is its ability to diversify its more than 13,000-property CRE portfolio. Last month, it closed its all-share acquisition of Spirit Realty Capital, which enhanced its existing CRE portfolio, as well as expanded Realty Income into new industries. Over the past two years, Realty Income has also made two deals in the gaming space, which further diversifies its lease exposure beyond the traditional retail industry.', ""The cherry on top for income investors is that Realty Income is cheaper now than it's been in at least a decade. Shares can be purchased for 11.6x forward-year cash flow, which represents a 38% discount to the company's average multiple to cash flow over the trailing five years."", 'A second high-yield stock that can deliver $300 in exceptionally safe annual dividend income from an initial investment of $4,975 (split across three stocks) is tobacco company Philip Morris International (NYSE: PM).', 'The biggest problem for Philip Morris is that consumers have, over time, wised up about the potential dangers of long-term tobacco use. As a result, cigarette shipments have been declining in developed markets. While a shrinking pool of consumers would normally be a major red flag, a tobacco giant like Philip Morris has easily identifiable competitive advantages in its corner.', ""To start with, tobacco products contain nicotine, which is an addictive chemical. Tobacco companies haven't had any trouble raising their prices to more than offset declines in cigarette shipments, as well as inflation. In other words, exceptional pricing power is helping Philip Morris and its peers grow their bottom lines."", ""Another reason Philip Morris has proved unstoppable is its geographic reach. It's currently operating in more than 180 countries. If it's contending with shipment declines in select developed markets, there's a good chance it's offsetting these drops with increased demand for tobacco products in emerging markets where tobacco remains something of a luxury."", ""But the most exciting development for Philip Morris and its prospective and existing shareholders is the growth it's seen in its smokeless tobacco products. Specifically, the company's Iqos system has gobbled up more than 9% of the global heated tobacco market. in 2023, heated tobacco unit shipment volume surged by almost 15% to 125.3 billion."", ""The final catalyst that makes Philip Morris a smoking-hot investment -- other than its 5.8% yield -- is its valuation. Philip Morris' forward-year earnings multiple of 12.7 is a marked 17% discount to its forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple over the trailing five years."", ""The third high-yield stock that can produce $300 in exceptionally safe annual dividend income from a starting investment of $4,975, split equally among three stocks, is none other than telecom company AT&T (NYSE: T). AT&T's 6.5% yield is the high-water mark on this list."", 'Telecom stocks took a beating in 2023 following a July report from The Wall Street Journal that alleged legacy providers using lead-clad cables could face sizable environmental- and health-related liabilities. This concern, coupled with rapidly rising interest rates (legacy telecom companies are lugging around quite a bit of debt), weighed heavily on the industry.', ""But when examined with a broader lens, the WSJ report looks like a short-term nothingburger. AT&T notes that lead-sheathed cables make up only a small percentage of its network, and has previously pointed out that testing of these cables didn't turn up any health-related concerns. Even if telecom companies were to eventually face some form of financial liability, it would likely be determined in the U.S. court system, which often takes years."", ""What investors should be paying attention to is AT&T's steadily improved operating performance. Upgrading its network to support 5G download speeds is encouraging wireless users to consume more data. Full-year mobility service revenue rose 4.4%, with the company's wireless segment registering its highest-ever operating income."", ""Perhaps even more impressive is the growth AT&T has delivered from its broadband operations. The 1.1 million net additions in 2023 marked the company's sixth consecutive year where it's added at least 1 million net subscribers. Broadband marks an easy way for AT&T to encourage high-margin service bundling that keeps consumers loyal to its ecosystem of products and services."", ""AT&T's balance sheet has demonstrably improved, too. Since the end of March 2022, AT&T's net debt has declined by roughly $40 billion to $128.9 billion. Organic paydown and the divestment of its content arm, WarnerMedia, have meaningfully improved the company's financial flexibility."", ""Valuation marks the last reason income investors can confidently buy AT&T. A forward P/E ratio of 7.4 provides a very favorable risk versus reward for the company's current and prospective shareholders."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Realty Income right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Realty Income, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Realty Income wasn’t one of them.

An intelligent assistant, the bot is designed to make it easier to catch up on the ever-expanding list of work threads and channels that haunt your dreams.', 'Salesforce-owned (CRM) Slack has been testing Slack AI with a handful of early adopters, but now it’s opening the service up to all of its customers, albeit as a paid add-on. Slack, however, didn’t disclose the price of the offering.', 'Slack AI is broken down into three main features: summarization for threads, summarization for channels, and a search option. To access threads and channel summarization, you go into the appropriate thread or channel and click or tap the star symbol in the top right corner of your Slack Window.', 'Slack AI will then run through the content of your thread or channel and summarize it into a bite-sized list complete with key topics and action items. The idea is to eliminate the hassle of having to scroll through long conversations that you might have missed while you were in a meeting, focused on other work, or out of the office.', 'Slack vice president of product Jackie Rocca said the feature is also helpful in time-sensitive situations. One example she cited was workers attempting to respond to a customer issue. The expert who would normally resolve the problem, however, is offline and by the time they get online there’s been a lengthy conversation with the customer and other workers about the issue.', 'Rather than scrolling through the back-and-forth between the customer and co-workers, the expert could use Slack AI to summarize the chat and get the gist of what’s going on right away.', 'The same general concept applies to channel summaries. You can choose to summarize recent conversations, from the last seven days or within a specific time period.', 'If you use Slack and have any colleagues who are prone to sending a particularly prodigious number of messages, Slack AI could be a godsend. Better still, if you go on vacation and want to catch up on everything you missed, the feature should help cut down on the amount of time you need to get up to speed.', 'In addition to summarizing threads and channels, Slack says you can use its AI bot to search for specific content. Rocca offered an example of a new hire trying to figure out what a frequently used acronym means. Rather than having to ask around, the person could instead search for it via the Slack search bar, which should pull up a thread that explains the acronym.', 'Slack AI is just getting out into the broader world beyond initial tests, so it could run into trouble as other AI platforms have in the past. It’s also important to note that Slack says it doesn’t train any large language models on customer data. And Slack won’t disclose which large language models it uses; it says it is hosting the models in its virtual private cloud and that no data leaves Slack’s infrastructure.', 'Slack is just the latest enterprise business to get into the generative AI game. Parent company Salesforce already offers its generative AI-powered Einstein GPT, while rival Microsoft (MSFT) has added its Copilot generative AI software to its Teams chat platform. Google (GOOG, GOOGL), meanwhile, incorporates its newly renamed Gemini AI into its Workspace suit of enterprise apps.', ""Daniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.', ""While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise."", 'Zacks Consensus Estimate', 'This maker of adhesives and industrial coatings is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.03 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +4.1%.', 'Revenues are expected to be $630.2 million, up 3.2% from the year-ago quarter.', 'Estimate Revisions Trend', 'The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.39% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.', 'Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.', 'Earnings Whisper', ""Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction)."", 'The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.', ""Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only."", 'A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.', 'Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).', 'How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Nordson?', ""For Nordson, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +3.25%."", 'On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.', 'So, this combination indicates that Nordson will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.', 'Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?', ""While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number."", 'For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Nordson would post earnings of $2.40 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.46, delivering a surprise of +2.50%.', 'Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.', 'Bottom Line', 'An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.', ""That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported."", 'Nordson appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.', 'Expected Results of an Industry Player', 'Another stock from the Zacks Manufacturing - General Industrial industry, Flowserve (FLS), is soon expected to post earnings of $0.61 per share for the quarter ended January 2024.

The company's commitment to integrating advanced technologies such as AI and ML into its offerings underscores its dedication to maintaining a competitive edge in risk assessment.

Its MIS segment is pivotal, generating substantial revenue and profits through its trusted credit ratings and comprehensive view of global debt markets.

The company's strategic partnerships and internal developments in Gen AI technology are expected to enhance customer decision-making capabilities by providing deeper, more integrated risk perspectives. This technological foresight is a testament to Moody's commitment to staying ahead in a rapidly evolving industry."", ""Legal and Regulatory Risks: Moody's faces increased legal and regulatory scrutiny, particularly related to its credit ratings and financial instruments pricing services. The company has a history of litigation and regulatory inquiries, such as those stemming from the financial crisis of 2007-2008. These challenges impose additional costs, distract senior management, and could lead to adverse judgments or penalties, potentially harming Moody's financial condition and reputation."", ""Operational Risks and Infrastructure Reliance: Moody's operational efficiency is heavily reliant on its technological infrastructure, which is susceptible to disruptions from various sources, including cyber threats and natural disasters. While the company has invested in disaster recovery and risk management, the potential for significant operational disruptions remains a weakness that could materially impact its service delivery and customer trust."", ""Growth in Global Fixed-Income Market Activity: Moody's anticipates continued growth opportunities driven by increasing financial complexity and the widespread use of credit ratings and integrated risk solutions. The company's comprehensive solutions and data analytics capabilities are well-positioned to capitalize on the transformation underway across various industries, particularly as organizations seek to understand interconnected and emerging risks."", ""Expansion through Acquisitions and Innovation: Moody's has strategically acquired businesses, such as RMS, to expand its climate data and analytics capabilities. The integration of these capabilities into existing offerings is expected to enhance the company's product suite, providing customers with valuable climate insights. Additionally, Moody's ongoing investments in Gen AI and ML technologies present opportunities for new product development and market differentiation."", ""Competitive and Pricing Pressures: Moody's operates in a highly competitive environment with price competition from other credit rating agencies and financial research firms. The emergence of non-traditional parties offering credit opinions and the use of alternative sources of financing pose threats to Moody's traditional revenue streams. Additionally, the adoption of technologies like LLMs and Gen AI by competitors could intensify these pressures."", ""Economic and Market Volatility: Moody's business is sensitive to fluctuations in the volume of debt securities issued in domestic and global capital markets. Economic downturns, market volatility, and changes in government policies can adversely affect the demand for Moody's services. The company's reliance on transaction-based revenue from credit ratings makes it particularly vulnerable to such market dynamics."", ""In conclusion, Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO) demonstrates a strong market presence and innovative edge through its advanced technological capabilities and comprehensive risk assessment solutions. However, it must navigate the complexities of legal and regulatory landscapes, as well as maintain resilience against operational risks.

74,02f2c892-6894-356c-9df2-10bec5a9bb33,MRO,2024-02-15,There's A Lot To Like About Marathon Oil's (NYSE:MRO) Upcoming US$0.11 Dividend,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/theres-lot-marathon-oils-nyse-102155680.html,1707992515,STORY,['MRO'],"[""It looks like Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE:MRO) is about to go ex-dividend in the next four days. Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important as the process of settlement involves two full business days. So if you miss that date, you would not show up on the company's books on the record date. Meaning, you will need to purchase Marathon Oil's shares before the 20th of February to receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 11th of March."", ""The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.11 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$0.44 per share. Last year's total dividend payments show that Marathon Oil has a trailing yield of 2.0% on the current share price of US$22.39. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether Marathon Oil's dividend is reliable and sustainable. That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing."", ' View our latest analysis for Marathon Oil ', 'Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. Marathon Oil paid out just 15% of its profit last year, which we think is conservatively low and leaves plenty of margin for unexpected circumstances. Yet cash flows are even more important than profits for assessing a dividend, so we need to see if the company generated enough cash to pay its distribution. The good news is it paid out just 11% of its free cash flow in the last year.', ""It's positive to see that Marathon Oil's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut."", ""Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends."", ""Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. That's why it's comforting to see Marathon Oil's earnings have been skyrocketing, up 40% per annum for the past five years. Marathon Oil looks like a real growth company, with earnings per share growing at a cracking pace and the company reinvesting most of its profits in the business."", ""The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. Marathon Oil's dividend payments per share have declined at 4.3% per year on average over the past 10 years, which is uninspiring. It's unusual to see earnings per share increasing at the same time as dividends per share have been in decline. We'd hope it's because the company is reinvesting heavily in its business, but it could also suggest business is lumpy."", ""Should investors buy Marathon Oil for the upcoming dividend? Marathon Oil has grown its earnings per share while simultaneously reinvesting in the business. Unfortunately it's cut the dividend at least once in the past 10 years, but the conservative payout ratio makes the current dividend look sustainable. It's a promising combination that should mark this company worthy of closer attention."", ""On that note, you'll want to research what risks Marathon Oil is facing. To that end, you should learn about the 4 warning signs we've spotted with Marathon Oil (including 1 which is potentially serious)."", 'A common investing mistake is buying the first interesting stock you see.

While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates."", 'The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 21. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.', ""While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise."", 'Zacks Consensus Estimate', 'This energy company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.62 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -29.6%.', 'Revenues are expected to be $1.66 billion, down 4.3% from the year-ago quarter.', 'Estimate Revisions Trend', 'The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 12.85% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.', 'Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.', 'Earnings Whisper', ""Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core."", 'The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.', ""Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only."", 'A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.', 'Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).', 'How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Marathon Oil?', ""For Marathon Oil, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.78%."", 'On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #5.', 'So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Marathon Oil will beat the consensus EPS estimate.', 'Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?', ""Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number."", 'For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Marathon Oil would post earnings of $0.69 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.77, delivering a surprise of +11.59%.', 'Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.', 'Bottom Line', 'An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.', ""That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported."", ""Marathon Oil doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release."", 'Expected Results of an Industry Player', ""Among the stocks in the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - United States industry, Equitrans Midstream (ETRN) is soon expected to post earnings of $0.18 per share for the quarter ended December 2023.

(Operator Instructions). This event is being recorded today.I would now like to turn the conference over to Brian Hawthorne, Director of Corporate Finance. Please go ahead.', 'Brian Michael Hawthorne', ""Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for Agree Realty's Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. Before turning the call over to Joey and Peter to discuss our results for the quarter, let me first run through the cautionary language.Please note that during this call, we will make certain statements that may be considered forward-looking under federal securities law. Our actual results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements for a number of reasons. Please see yesterday's earnings release and our SEC filings including our latest annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of various risks and uncertainties underlying our forward-looking statements. In addition, we discuss non-GAAP financial measures, including core funds from operations or core FFO, and adjusted funds from operations or AFFO, and net debt to recurring EBITDA. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release, website and SEC filings. I'll now turn the call over to Joey."", 'Joel N. Agree', ""Thank you, Brian. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that 2023 was another strong year for our company. Looking back on the past year, we executed several strategic initiatives that positioned our company for continued success. In anticipation of capital markets volatility, we pre-equitized our balance sheet in the fourth quarter of 2022 with $560 million of forward equity raised at a net price of just over $67.50. While at the time, many thought our mindset was conservative, we were confident that while interest rates rose rapidly, cap rates would be slow to exhibit expansion in our large illiquid and fragmented space.We were determined to avoid deviating from our core strategy for providing debt financing, expanding into new verticals or going up the risk curve either via credit or tenant concentrations. Instead, we continue to execute our disciplined and time-tested strategy of investing in the country's biggest and best retailers. Those that have the balance sheet to invest in price, labor and fulfillment while creating a unique value proposition for customers.While the performance of our stock has certainly been frustrating, we have not wavered. Management and our tremendous Board of Directors put their money where their mouths are with almost $12 million of insider purchases during 2023.Net lease is a long-term business. We believe in consistency, reliability and quality of cash flows will ultimately lead to outperformance. While we can't control macroeconomic volatility, we can execute with a mindset of value creation, not simply short-term earnings accretion.The days of free money and ubiquitous capital were behind us, which made a strong and strategic change in capital allocation philosophy. We have seen the result of investing at de-minimis spreads. It drives little to no AFFO per share growth. In this new economic paradigm, our focus is on achieving outsized investment spreads and the best risk-adjusted opportunities, not simply aggregating volume. We will not grow the denominator without driving meaningful AFFO per share growth, nor will we move up the risk curve to create short-term opportunities and growth. We are laser focused on allocating capital in a disciplined manner to drive growth that is sustainable.On last quarter's call, we outlined the do-nothing scenario in which we would drive over 3% AFFO per share growth in 2024 with conservative assumptions and the absence of external growth. With over $235 million of forward equity raise at the end of the year and anticipated free cash flow of approximately $100 million, we have visibility beyond the do-nothing scenario. We can invest approximately $500 million this year on a leverage-neutral basis, excluding any disposition proceeds and without the need for any additional equity capital.Most importantly, we remain nimble and opportunistic, ensuring we are well positioned to capitalize on the opportunities as we uncover them. With over $1 billion of total liquidity, including the outstanding forward equity raise in the fourth quarter, we have ample runway and complete optionality. In addition, we have no material debt maturities until 2028 and pro forma net debt to EBITDA stood at just 4.3x at year-end.Our fortress balance sheet is paired with a best-in-class portfolio and our record investment-grade exposure of over 69% provides for highly durable cash flows in today's dynamic environment. The strength of our balance sheet and the quality of our portfolio are evidenced by the positive outlook that S&P placed on their BBB credit rating last week. We believe that our credit metrics are emblematic of a higher rated company and the positive outlook is another step in gaining recognition for the manner in which we operate our company and manage our balance sheet.Moving on to our standard update. This past quarter, we worked through significant market turbulence and ultimately invested nearly $200 million in 70 high-quality retail net lease properties across our 3 external growth platforms. This included the acquisition of 50 properties for over $187 million. The properties acquired during the fourth quarter leased to leading operators in sectors, including home improvement, farm and roll supply, off-price, tire and auto service as well as convenience stores.As our fourth quarter activity demonstrated, we can continue to push cap rates higher, piercing 7% for the first time since 2019. The acquired properties had a weighted average cap rate of 7.2%, a 30 basis point expansion relative to the third quarter and 80 basis points higher than the prior year. The weighted average lease term was 10.1 years and approximately 71% of annualized base rents were derived from investment-grade retailers.We acquired 7 ground leases during the quarter, representing approximately $30 million or 14.8% of total acquisition volume for the quarter. In 2023, we invested more than $1.3 billion and 319 retail net lease properties spanning 41 states. We continue to leverage all 3 external growth platforms to find compelling risk-adjusted opportunities.For the full year, nearly 74% of the annualized base rents acquired were from investment-grade retailers, while ground leases represented almost 9% of rents acquired. Notably, we increased sale-leaseback activity in 2023, partnering with leading operators in the farm and rural supply and convenience store sectors. Sale leasebacks represented 1/3 of our acquisition activity in 2023, compared to just over 10% in the year prior, further demonstrating our ability to be a full-service comprehensive real estate solution for our retail partners.Switching to our Development and DFP platforms. We had a record year with 37 projects either completed or under construction, representing approximately $150 million of committed capital. We're continuing to see increased activity across both platforms as we work with our retail partners to help them execute their store growth plans and provide struggling merchant developers with the ability to lock in funding for their pipeline.We commenced 4 new development and DFP projects during the fourth quarter with total anticipated cost of approximately $13 million. The new projects include a Burlington and HomeGoods in Yuma, Arizona and 2 Starbucks in Illinois. Construction continued during the quarter on 12 projects with anticipated costs totaling approximately $51 million.Lastly, we completed construction on 4 projects during the quarter with total costs of approximately $16 million. We disposed 5 properties during 2023 for total gross proceeds of approximately $10 million, including 3 properties that were sold during the fourth quarter. The weighted average cap rate for dispositions in 2023 was 6.1%. I anticipate additional opportunistic dispositions in 2024 as we will seek to sell assets at attractive cap rates and redeploy that capital on an accretive basis.On the leasing front, we executed new leases, extensions or options on 425,000 square feet of gross leasable area during the fourth quarter. Including a T.J.Maxx in New Lenox, Illinois, and a Walmart Supercenter in Hazard, Kentucky. For the full year 2023, we executed new leases, extensions or options on approximately 1.9 million square feet of GLA. We are in a great position for 2024 with only 28 leases or 110 basis points of annualized base rents maturing.At year-end, our best-in-class portfolio spanned 2,135 properties across 49 states, including 224 ground leases representing 11.7% of total annualized base rents. Occupancy ticked up slightly to 99.8%. And again, our investment-grade exposure reached a record of over 69%.Lastly, I'd like to welcome Linglong He to our Board of Directors. Linglong was Rocket's first software engineer over 25 years ago and today serves as a Chief Leadership Adviser for Rocket Central where she is responsible for executive leadership development for the Rocket companies. Prior to that role, she served as Chief Information Officer of Rocket Mortgage, one of the nation's largest mortgage lenders for 10 years. Linglong has over 25 years of experience, technology and leadership, and we're truly excited to add her expertise to our esteemed Board of Directors. I'll now hand the call over to Peter, and then we can open it up for questions."", 'Peter Coughenour', ""Thank you, Joey. Starting with earnings. Core FFO per share was $0.99 for the fourth quarter and $3.93 per share for full year 2023, representing 3.4% and 1.6% year-over-year increases, respectively. AFFO per share was $1 for the fourth quarter and $3.95 for the full year, representing 5.2% and 3.1% year-over-year increases, respectively. As a reminder, treasury stock is included in our diluted share count prior to settlement if ADC stock trades above the deal price of our outstanding forward equity offerings. The aggregate dilutive impact related to these offerings was approximately [$0.05] for the full year.Our consistent and reliable earnings growth continues to support a growing and well-covered dividend. During the fourth quarter, we declared monthly cash dividends of $0.247 per share for October, November and December. On an annualized basis, the monthly dividends represent a 2.9% year-over-year increase.For the full year, the company declared dividends of approximately $2.92 per share, a 4.1% increase year-over-year and almost a 12% increase on a 2-year stack basis. Our payout ratios for the fourth quarter and full year remained at or below the low end of our targeted range of 75% to 85% of AFFO per share. Subsequent to year-end, we declared a monthly cash dividend of $0.247 per share for January and February 2024. The monthly dividends reflect an annualized dividend amount of over $2.96 per share or a 2.9% increase over the annualized dividend amount of $2.88 per share from the first quarter of 2023.General and administrative expenses decreased quarter-over-quarter to 5.7% of revenue, adjusted for the noncash amortization of above and below market lease intangibles. For the year, G&A expense totaled $34.8 million or 6.1% of adjusted revenue. With our continued investments in systems, including ongoing enhancements to our proprietary ARC database, we anticipate that G&A expense will continue to scale as a percentage of adjusted revenue in 2024.We recorded $709,000 of income tax expense during the fourth quarter. This brings the total for the year to $2.9 million, near the midpoint of our guidance.Turning to our capital markets activities. We raised over $370 million of gross equity proceeds during the year via the forward component of our ATM program. With more than $235 million of forward equity raised late in the fourth quarter, we anticipate putting in place a new ATM program in the coming weeks in normal course. We also demonstrated our ability to access attractive bank debt with a market-leading $350 million 5.5-year term loan at a fixed rate of 4.52% inclusive of prior hedging activity. The term loan received strong support from our key banking relationships and the 5.5-year term allowed us to extend the maturity into 2029. As Joey mentioned, our debt maturity schedule remains in an excellent position with no material maturities until 2028.Our capital markets activity further fortified our balance sheet and positioned us for continued growth in 2024. We ended the year with over $1 billion of total liquidity, including more than $235 million of outstanding forward equity, $773 million of availability on the revolver and approximately $15 million of cash on hand. In addition, our revolving credit facility and term loan have accordion options, allowing us to request additional lender commitments of $750 million and $150 million, respectively.In addition to our strong liquidity position, free cash flow after the dividend is now approaching $100 million on an annualized basis. As of December 31, pro forma for the settlement of our outstanding forward equity, net debt to recurring EBITDA was approximately 4.3x. Excluding the impact of unsettled forward equity, our net debt to recurring EBITDA was 4.7x. Our total debt to enterprise value was approximately 27%, while our fixed charge coverage ratio, which includes principal amortization in the preferred dividend is in a very healthy position at 5x. With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Joey."", 'Joel N. Agree', ""Thank you, Peter. To summarize, we are very well positioned to execute in 2024 to drive sustainable earnings and a growing and well-covered dividend. At this time, operator, let's open it up for questions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) And our first question will come from Spenser Allaway of Green Street Advisors.', 'Spenser Bowes Allaway', 'Given that you guys have capital locked in and as you mentioned, you have a very strong liquidity position. Why not provide some formal acquisition guidance at this time?', 'Joel N. Agree', ""Spenser, so I think, first of all, we're in an extremely volatile macroeconomic environment, including interest rate volatility here that's going on. And so I think our #1 focus is not going to be aggregating volume today at de minimis spreads, as we talked about in the prepared remarks. We're 100% focused and the team is disciplined here, focusing on deploying capital at 100-plus basis point spreads into our sandbox of the country's leading retailers. And frankly, with 70 days of visibility in the net lease space, that's our average duration from letter of intent to close, I can't tell you what's going to happen in 71 days, let alone later the summer or fall."", 'Spenser Bowes Allaway', ""Okay. And then as you think about the 3 different kind of investment verticals that you play in, can you just talk about where you're seeing the best spreads today?"", 'Joel N. Agree', ""Well, the best spreads, of course, would be in development, right? Duration -- development duration, we don't take speculative risk in terms of acquiring land or specking buildings without a tenant in hand without that being fully bid and all permits secured. So the best risks -- excuse me, the best returns would, of course, be on the development spectrum. And so duration equals risk. So we're looking for a significant spread if we're going to develop to where we can acquire a light-kind asset.And the other end of the spectrum would be acquisitions. Again, where our focus here is deploying capital 100 basis points wide of where we see our cost of capital. And as we've noted significantly before, our cost of capital, we perceive it as a forward AFFO yield at a 75/25 split with 10-year unsecured pricing. We're not using unburdened free cash flow here. It's a conservative approach to that cost of capital. But our goal, again, is to deploy that capital 100 basis points wide of that."", 'Operator', 'Next question comes from Smedes Rose of Citigroup.', 'Smedes Rose', ""So I get -- you don't want to provide a full year kind of outlook and thinking about acquisition activity. But could you maybe just talk about what you've seen kind of year-to-date and kind of where cap rates have moved -- have been moved up sequentially from the fourth quarter where you were able to lock in at 7.2%. Maybe just a little color on kind of what you're seeing near term?"", 'Joel N. Agree', ""Sure. Smedes, I would tell you, cap rates right now are all over the board given the volatility in the underlying markets that we see and the interest rate. Fourth quarter was a roller coaster. Obviously, we saw the base rate for the world go up 25% from 4% to 5% in 70 days, then dropped 28% over the subsequent 21 days this morning. I'm not sure what it's going to do or what goals be and all the Fed speakers are going to say. I think it's more likely that we get a rate hike this year than a cut in March at this point.And so cap rates are all over the board, as you would imagine that sellers' expectations of the overall economy and interest rate environment all over the board. What I will tell you is building upon my last answer, that 100 basis point spread to where -- we see our cost of capital will result in a material jump in our cap rates in Q1, 30 to 40 basis points most likely, still focusing a 30 to 40 basis points jump over Q4. Again, without sacrificing credit quality. And that will be an aggregation on the acquisition side of unique opportunities, short-term blend and extend opportunities, high-performing stores directed by our retail partners and asymmetric opportunities.But the market in terms of transactional volume is effectively fractional of where it was historically. And sellers' expectations are all over the board. And so we really don't have -- unfortunately, when the 10-year was at 4% early in the fourth quarter, we were approaching it. It seems like a new normal of 4% 10-year. Since then, obviously, the volatility has got some consternation -- some hope amongst borrowers that kind of vacillates back and forth."", 'Smedes Rose', ""Okay. And then I just wanted to ask, you mentioned G&A expense will continue to move up as a percent of revenue. Do you just have a -- do you have a sense of kind of what percentage that we should expect that to move to over the course of '24?"", 'Joel N. Agree', ""So embedded in our guidance -- I'll let Peter add any color, embedded in our base case of over 3% AFFO growth, which clearly is off the table right now given the forward equity that we've raised and the color I've given on the pipeline, the percentage of G&A of revenue will go down. The absolute number we anticipate going up because auditors, professional services and everything else continues to go up in this world. Peter, anything I'm missing?"", 'Peter Coughenour', ""No, that's correct. I think in recent years, we've seen scale in G&A as a percent of adjusted revenue of approximately 40 or 50 basis points on an annual basis on average. It's difficult at this point to predict how much scale we'll see in 2024, but we do anticipate that G&A as a percentage of revenue will continue to come down."", 'Operator', 'Next question comes from Ki Bin Kim of Truist.', 'Ki Bin Kim', 'So first question, I noticed you guys have about 10 Big Lots. So a question is about your guidance. And I think you embedded about 50 basis points credit loss reserves. So curious how much of that accounts for the known or highly likely move out versus the unknown and Big Lots, what is that as a percent of ABR please?', 'Joel N. Agree', ""Yes. So our total watch list today is approximately inclusive of any Big Lots exposure or any At Home exposure where we have won, these are real estate plays for us at the end of the day. You can take a look at our At Home in Provo, Utah. That's a real estate play across a mall that's undergoing renovation with a new large format target. .Big Lots, we continue to monitor. It's an immaterial piece of our overall, obviously, portfolio, and it's embedded in that 1% approximately watch list with -- amongst At Home. And so I'll give you an example. We had 1 Big Lots that didn't renew. We just -- we're at lease right now with a national retailer in the auto parts space, a great partner of ours for approximately a 5% lift on the NOI on a 15-year new base term. So we're very comfortable with our exposures and frankly, the underlying real estate here. So again, that total watch list that we're focused on is basically 1% and a lot of it, frankly, we want back."", 'Ki Bin Kim', 'Okay. And the Big Lots ABR percentage?', 'Peter Coughenour', ""Yes. Ki Bin, it's sub-50 basis points today in terms of our overall exposure to Big Lots. And I'd also note, on average, to Joey's point, in terms of being comfortable with the basis, they're paying just over $6 per square foot on average."", 'Ki Bin Kim', ""Okay. And I appreciate your comments about being more disciplined on capital deployment if the pricing doesn't make a whole lot of sense. Since your last equity raise, obviously, your stock price has drifted slightly lower. So if you had to raise a new round of equity today, and if you still want to hold on to the 100 basis point spread target, it would imply that you would probably have to buy something closer to an 8% GAAP cap rate. I'm not sure if there's enough desirable product at those prices, so if you can provide some commentary? And if that is the case, like would you just be comfortable slowing down the acquisition pace again?"", 'Joel N. Agree', ""Well, we started the year by putting out a base. We started the year -- last year by putting out a base case with no investment volume with over 3% AFFO growth with those conservative inputs that we just went through and Peter gave more descriptive analysis too. So we will not put out capital south of that 100 basis point spread unless it is a unique compelling opportunity a mark-to-market or something that justifies -- has the merits to justify that business case.And so where our stock price is, where stock price goes, where cap rates go, I'll be honest, I don't anticipate material expansion throughout the course of the year, absent more economic macro volatility -- incrementally more volatility than we see now. This is a large liquid fragmented space. Our focus is, again, is being 100% focused and disciplined on deploying that capital, a material accretive spread. This business is very simple. And a forward AFFO yield, if you deploy capital inside of that forward AFFO yield, it does not work. Forget that. I don't care for using overnight paper. We price our cost of capital using 25% 10-year unsecured bonds. That's how we look at our cost of capital. But if you're deploying capital inside of your forward AFFO yield, it's not going to work and it's going to drive no shareholder accretion on an AFFO per share basis. And so we're not going to be out there collecting nuts, growing our denominator, not driving per share value and per share growth for our shareholders. The relationship between cap rates and volume at the end of the day is exponential and not linear.And so again, people have heard me say, inside of 75 basis points is the red light. We've seen the anecdotal evidence as well as the empirical evidence of some large volume numbers not producing annualized growth in the subsequent year. 75 to 100 basis points is a yellow light in this business. You could invest selectively. Over 100 basis points when you look at your true cost of capital, not including unburdened free cash flow or short-term debt the light become start to be turned green. If you get to 150 basis points, you can slam on the gas like we did for several years. We're not at that 150 basis point space in this market today, unless you want to go significantly up the risk curve, which is adverse to everything we believe in at this company. And so that 100 basis point bogey, -- not sure how much we're going to be able to aggregate for the year. I don't have that crystal ball, but we're certainly not going to deploy capital inside of it, just to grow our denominator in our asset base."", 'Operator', 'Next question comes from Joshua Dennerlein of Bank of America.', 'Unidentified Analyst', 'This is (inaudible) on behalf of Josh. I know you already made some a few comments about your development pipeline. I was curious, I know over 2022, 2023, it was about say, like a 23% increase. Is it fair to assume maybe a comparable amount going into 2024 for a total amount of development?', 'Joel N. Agree', ""We are consistently and constantly answering the phones and responding to inquiries from merchant developers from retailers, from all different types of constituents given the lack of liquidity out there in the construction lending market and the lack of ability for merchant builders to develop net new stores. Where that number ends up this year is going to be frankly subject to where we can get returns. We're just not going to grow that number to put shovels in the ground, take duration risk and not provide for the appropriate levels of ultimate accretion on our deployed capital.So it's difficult to say where that will go. It can change by the day. We announced a number of new projects as well as completed in this quarter. Our pipeline continues to grow the pace at which it grows, it's really up in the air. Retailers want to grow today. That's the ultimate bottom line. As the retailers in our portfolio, inclusive of Walmart, who just announced a slew of new stores really since the first time -- since the GFC want to grow today. The question is construction costs, availability of capital, return on cost and what rent per square foot they can pay. And so calibrating those things ultimately our goal is to calibrate those things and figure out what projects make sense for us with those retail partners. What that number is, again, I wish I had that visibility."", 'Unidentified Analyst', 'Great. And I believe this is along the lines of what you were just mentioning that last quarter, -- you made some comments about partnering up with retailers to kind of assist with bringing stores to close. Is there any other further update on that?', 'Joel N. Agree', ""Continued discussion. The team is at 2 national retailers that you're familiar with today and tomorrow, frankly, we're constantly in dialogue trying to help break this logjam that's occurring right now in the development of new stores. That said, we're not going to do it, obviously, to the detriment of our shareholders. We're going to get the appropriate spreads.So the dialogue is ongoing. It is very fluid, as you can imagine, with the world going inside out in the fourth quarter. But we're going to continue to have those conversations, and I think our full-service value proposition is -- I know it is. I know it is unique to retailers and they appreciate all of our capabilities, inclusive of our asset management capabilities."", 'Operator', 'Next question comes from Rob Stevenson of Janney.', 'Robert Chapman Stevenson', ""Can you talk about what the cash spread on leasing done in the fourth quarter and for '23 as a whole was? And have the size of the bumps or other lease terms change given the persistently higher inflation these days?"", 'Joel N. Agree', ""On the first one, Peter, do you have a number handy, I mean it's fairly de minimis."", 'Peter Coughenour', ""Yes, Rob, I would just say first that we don't have a ton of actually re-leasing activity in our portfolio. The vast majority of leases that are up for expiration so the tenant exercise an option, which typically has an embedded bump within that option. That said, the recapture rate for Q4 and for the full year was north of 100%."", 'Robert Chapman Stevenson', ""Okay. And then what about the lease terms? Are you guys trying to push higher bumps, more frequent bumps, et cetera, given the higher inflation or trying to mitigate people to CPI. How are you guys thinking about that as you're starting new leases on any of these development deals or any of the other stuff?"", 'Joel N. Agree', ""Yes. So no national retailers will generally echo as to CPI-based bumps. They want to know what the rent is going to be on a go-forward basis so they can plan -- but yes, I mean, that's thematic since we've seen inflation at 8%, 9%, let alone over 3%, that everybody is I think understanding that we're in an inflationary environment. And so the frequency as well as the size of those bumps, I think most tenants are amenable to relooking at their lease terms there."", 'Robert Chapman Stevenson', 'Okay. And then can you talk about the difference between cap rates on ground leases in the fourth quarter for the year overall versus the fee simple acquisitions. Is that spread sort of stayed relatively consistent? Are you seeing better opportunities or less opportunities in ground leases today and going forward? How should we be thinking about that?', 'Joel N. Agree', ""Very, very consistent, if any -- a de minimis spread between the ground leases and net leases, we're generally working with our retail partners there. I think you'll see more of the same in the first quarter. Some of them are shorter term, some of them are targeted by retailers in partnership with us. So very de minimis spread, I think."", 'Operator', 'Next question comes from Haendel St. Juste of Mizuho.', 'Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste', ""Joey, I think you mentioned earlier in the call that you're anticipating -- let's see -- opportunities dispositions this year. Curious what categories you want client to call potentially how much you like to call in potential range of cap rates or any pricing color expectations?"", 'Joel N. Agree', ""Yes. I would tell you, from a category perspective, we're not overly interested in decreasing our Walmart exposure or anything like that. The opportunistic dispositions will generally be into the pretty tenuous 1031 market dominated in markets where you have significant capital, it seems to be significant capital, still chasing things at fairly low yields. We'll look to deploy -- redeploy that capital at approximately 150 basis point spreads. You can see it in the auto service space. You can see it amongst other categories, the farm and rural supply space, the car wash space, potentially -- generally spaces where we're very comfortable with our exposure, but there is still opportunistic, maybe tax-motivated purchasers out there in geographies, which seem to still have heat to them."", 'Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste', ""Got it. That's helpful. And then just going back to the messaging here. Clearly, you're guiding to a capital light deployment, earnings growth, minimum 3, probably looks like 4% now expecting interest rates to be higher for longer. So I guess I'm curious, kind of from your perspective, what's the investment case for investors buying the stock here today, 3% to 4% earnings growth isn't too shabby in this environment, I get it, but still likely to lag a number of your peers, I think, are we basically in a wait-and-see mode to a degree here?"", 'Joel N. Agree', ""So let's take a step back. We have a 5% plus and growing dividend that's covered at the low end of our target payout ratio of 75%. We have a 5-year CAGR of 6% AFFO growth while qualitatively improving the portfolio to now approaching 70% investment grade and 12% ground leases. It is the strongest retail portfolio, I think, without exception in the country and most investors and analysts would agree.We have a balance sheet that is fortified with $1 billion of liquidity has no material debt maturities until 2028, no floating rate exposure except anything outstanding on the line of credit. So if you take your 3% to 4%, you can go ahead and take the high end, then take the 5% and growing dividend, you're at 9% total returns there alone, assuming no dividend growth, which it will grow this year with an underlying fortress balance sheet and an underlying fortress portfolio. I think that is a very compelling case in today's environment to invest in ADC. And I think, as I said in our prepared remarks, insiders here, inclusive of myself, agree. What we have done and what we have built without diminishing the qualitative aspect of our portfolio, is, I think, is without peer. We haven't loaded up on pharmacies. We've ran from Walgreens exposure. We don't have double-digit pharmacy exposure and double-digit dollar store exposure. We're not just out there checking the IG box. We've been talking about Walgreens now for years, reducing our Walgreens exposure to an inconsequential number, watching CVS overtake Walgreens in the pharmacy space.I think we have a proven track record now of not only being correct in our retail predictions and predilections about the concerns in an omnichannel world, but we also have the balance sheet management, the earnings growth profile to, frankly -- to bank on. And so I think there's something to be said, especially in today's environment for stability and predictability."", 'Operator', 'Next question comes from Mitch Germain of JP (sic) [JMP] Securities.', 'Mitchell Bradley Germain', ""I know it's early in the year, but I'm just curious if you're seeing any changes to the buyer pool?"", 'Joel N. Agree', ""Mitch, honestly no. I mean this market is so fragmented and large to begin with, that you stress it in a higher interest rate environment and in a liquid credit environment, the buyer pool kind of becomes a toss-up in the air. So it's very difficult. I mean sometimes I'll be honest, I'll ask an investment or disposition committee, who is this? Who is buying this? Who is selling this? And the answer turns into something like a riddle. .And so I'll be honest, it's -- there is -- there are no parallels to be drawn. There is not a fluid market right now. It is hit or miss. It's about being disciplined and it's about throwing darts and being decisive in what you want to accomplish."", 'Operator', 'Next question comes from R.J. Milligan of Raymond James.', 'Richard Jon Milligan', ""So I just want to follow up. I think Smedes asked this. I'm not sure if you provided an answer in terms of what the year-to-date activity has been so far?"", 'Joel N. Agree', ""No. We haven't provided any answer or any update on the year-to-date activity. Although I did mention that we anticipate cap rates jumping in Q1 by approximately 30 to 40 basis points on the acquisition side."", 'Richard Jon Milligan', ""Got it. And so I know there's a difference between capital previously raised, right, via the ATM last quarter versus trying to go out and raise new capital -- equity capital today. So I'm just curious if you are seeing that or 7.5% average cap rate or that cap rate expansion, would the goal then be to deploy the Q4 ATM proceeds quickly I guess, what is the outlook for cap rates? Is it going to deploy at a 7.5% today, given that, that's a pretty high absolute cap rate? Or is it still more of a wait and see even with the previously raised proceeds?"", 'Joel N. Agree', ""Yes. Just to clarify, that's not market. These are manufactured transactions where we work out there creating value. That is nowhere near market cap rates today on a like-kind product. We're not out there buying glossy brochures here that are highly marketed and sent through the auction process. And so if we can achieve those types of cap rates, we'll look at that spread relative to our cost of capital, deploy that equity. But I think as we highlighted, we have $500 million in leverage-neutral buying power today, not inclusive of any disposition proceeds. And so as the year materializes, again, as the pipeline and the pipeline grows, we'll look at all capital options for us, but we don't need to do anything today. I think that's pretty clear with $1 billion of liquidity and that $500 million in leverage neutral power."", 'Richard Jon Milligan', ""And just 1 follow-up. So Joey, you've talked a lot or very often about the lack of visibility 70 days, however, you have been able to provide, despite that lack of visibility as sort of a guidepost at least for acquisition volume. I understand that we are in a volatile capital markets environment. I'm just curious, what do you need to see in the capital markets or the transaction market to get the confidence to resume an external growth guideposts?"", 'Joel N. Agree', ""I think we have to get to a level of normalcy again. I think we have to get to a level of stability in the underlying macroeconomic environment. I mean, I haven't -- I'd be honest, I haven't seen an economist who's gotten this right since we pumped $6.5 trillion into the economy and lowered rates to 0. And so for us to sit here and me specifically to sit here as a [dumb] real estate guy and try to anticipate what's going to materialize over the course of the next 11 months during this year, I would frankly be getting ahead of myself.And so we were able to provide those historic guidepost because we had a level of visibility into anything absent in aberration or geopolitical event or some type of crash today with the underlying volatility that we're seeing in these markets and frankly, the lack of clarity we're seeing in these markets, I mean, it's a foggy world out there today. And so when we get and if we get that level of clarity based upon that stability, we will 100% provide it. But I think anything -- if we did anything else, we would just be getting ahead of ourselves."", 'Richard Jon Milligan', ""One additional is clearly, you guys have been pretty proactive in selling down your Walgreens exposure over time. I'm curious if there's any other categories that you're looking to sort of get ahead of the curve over the next year or 2?"", 'Joel N. Agree', ""Not really from a category perspective. We saw something very specific with Walgreens in context of the pharmacy space, the degradation of the front end, the constant need and desire to do M&A to increase store count, which didn't make sense to us the failure of Walgreens to repurpose the front end of the store with their attempts at beauty and fragrance. Their attempted to (inaudible) we saw that very specifically. And frankly, we had an overabundance of Walgreens exposure. I mean it was 45% Walgreens exposure in 2012, I think, approximately. In 2013, we were 45% Walgreens exposure and -- we had a lot of intimate experience developing approximately 40 to 50 of them in 6 states. And so that was abundantly clear to us watching those stores erode.I'll tell you, today, the retailers in our portfolio are generally doing really well and are really healthy. Now we stayed away from the casual dining space. We've stayed away from the experiential stuff and we'll continue to. But if you look at our portfolio today, the retailers are really doing well. The bigger getting bigger, they're getting stronger. They're investing in price, labor and distribution and then figuring out how to drive EBITDA in this omnichannel world."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Linda Tsai of Jefferies.', 'Linda Tsai', 'Regarding what you referred to as manufactured cap rates in 1Q being up 40, 50 bps through the auction process. Any more color on how you drive that level of expansion and how easy or difficult it is to achieve this?', 'Joel N. Agree', ""Yes. Just to clarify, those cap rates are effectively us creating value out there, seeking off-market opportunities, blend and extend opportunities. These aren't highly marketed glossy brochure through national brokers. We're working with our retail partners to find opportunities where they want to be there long term, and we want to be their landlord long term you. What was the -- would you repeat the second part of that question?"", 'Linda Tsai', 'Just how easy it is to -- or difficult to achieve this and -- its sustainability?', 'Joel N. Agree', ""Not easy. Look, this is -- I don't think anything is easy in this world today. It takes grit. That's one of our core values here. Greatness requires grit. It takes grit. We leverage our relationships. The team here has tremendous relationships and credibility with retailers. We aren't in the wholesale buying process anymore out there that's going -- given where cost of capital are. But I'm 100% confident that the team will continue to be able to uncover opportunities across all 3 external growth platforms that provides outsized returns relative both to the market and hopefully, our own internal expectations."", 'Linda Tsai', ""And then if sale leaseback was 1/3 of the acquisition volume, what can it grow to in '24? And similarly, where can DFP grow to as a percentage of the volume?"", 'Joel N. Agree', ""From a sale leaseback perspective, any tenant that doesn't need capital, and those are the only tenants that we typically do business with, we don't want to become a large unsecured creditor to any retailer that's private equity sponsors. So if you looked at the retailers, we did sale leaseback, they're on pause, right? Their CFOs, their real estate departments are watching the volatility. They know where they can issue paper, in the unsecured market today, they're waiting for things to settle down here as well. And so I wouldn't anticipate given today's status quo, that number approaching 1/3. It's fully possible if we get stabilization later in the year.In terms of DFP, every day, it changes. We have built that team out. We've built that system out in context of ARC. We have improved and made our processes more efficient. Again, it's just a question of pricing. And the pricing is both with the developers as well as the retailers, the returns they're willing to accept and ultimately, the rents they're able to pay on those specific sites. And if it works in context of our -- obviously return profile."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Ronald Kamdem of Morgan Stanley.', 'Zhen Li', ""Joey and Peter, you have Jenny on for Ron.I just have 2 quick questions. The first is, can you talk a little bit on the competition environment today for the IG focused market? And you mentioned like transaction volume is kind of low, like this year. But if you compare on a year-over-year basis, is that like getting worse or it's actually better than last year?"", 'Joel N. Agree', ""Competition in our specific sandbox is really hit or miss, right? There are the random and infrequent 1031 or high net worth individuals. They tell you the competition is very similar to what it was historically, except the amount of competition. The composition is similar, but the amount of competition, given just the transactional slowdown, the 1031 slowdown is very de minimis. And so I often say our largest competitors are sellers' expectations themselves.Would you repeat the second part of that question?"", 'Zhen Li', ""The second is the transaction volumes. You mentioned like the transaction volume this year is kind of low, but if you compare on a year-over-year basis, it's actually better than last year or actually worse than last year?"", 'Joel N. Agree', 'Well, the transaction volume in terms of closed acquisitions?', 'Zhen Li', 'Of the pipelines and just overall?', 'Joel N. Agree', ""We're still early. Look, we have visibility into the Q1 pipeline. We're just starting to build Q2, transaction volume for Q1 will be down year-over-year relative to Q1 undoubtedly. But as I mentioned, our focus is on improving those cap rates very significantly on a relative year-over-year basis.So I think looking forward, again, we'll see what type of normalcy we get or stabilization we get in the underlying macro. It's difficult -- it's very difficult to predict, impossible for us."", 'Zhen Li', ""Yes, it makes sense. If you talk about dispositions, I think you mentioned you're expecting to dispose more this year. And based on your target cap rates, do you think -- just maybe talk a little bit more about like the disposition cap rate is trending in the overall environment?"", 'Joel N. Agree', ""Yes. We're looking for those opportunistic areas where we can sell an asset generally in -- plus or minus in the 6 cap range and then redeploy it north of 100 basis points, minimally above that in assets that we don't think long term necessarily have the growth potential profile that -- within the portfolio."", 'Operator', 'Next question comes from [Alex Hagan] of Baird.', 'Unidentified Analyst', 'First off, where are the current yields on the new development funding deals?', 'Joel N. Agree', ""When you say new development funding deals, I mean, generally, we're targeting new -- net new in terms of approvals and starting now, we're targeting the DFP transaction that is let's call it, 6 months until rent commencement, approximately 50 to 75 basis points over lifetime cap rates in the acquisition. If it's an overall project that takes entitlements, we're significantly wide of that just because of the duration risk."", 'Unidentified Analyst', ""Okay. And I guess, second, you kind of put on your macro hat earlier said you think the chance of a rate hike is -- might be higher now than a rate cut kind of curious what's the most attractive source of debt today? And does the company have any plans on issuing long-term debt to reduce the revolver anytime soon?"", 'Joel N. Agree', ""Yes. Just, I'll let Peter answer the second question. I said just to repeat, the change of rate hike is probably better than this year is probably better than the chance of a rate cut in March. We'll see more data, obviously, tomorrow. But I think that rate cut expectation that the market had for March is clearly off the table, and we'll see if we get any more hot prints that come out. Peter, in terms of the debt market, I'll let you take that."", 'Peter Coughenour', ""Yes. I think -- we came into this year with $1 billion of total liquidity available to us. And so there's no near-term need to access the debt markets. We have no material debt maturities until 2028. And so we can continue to be opportunistic in terms of how and when we access the debt capital markets.We have access to both the unsecured markets as well as the bank debt markets where we continue to have strong support from our bank group. I think our preference is typically for longer-term fixed rate unsecured financings that match the underlying lease duration of our portfolio. And to that end, as disclosed in the 10-K, we entered into $150 million of forward starting swaps during the fourth quarter. Those swaps contemplated a future 10-year unsecured debt issuance, and they're swapped at an effective rate just under 4%. So we have optionality in terms of when we use those swaps. They have a mandatory termination date in June of '25, but contemplates us coming back to that market at some point in the future."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Eric Borden of BMO Capital Markets.', 'Eric Martin Borden', ""Just a quick 1 on the watch list. What's the mark-to-market on the assets in there today? I think you mentioned Big Lots expiring or taking back space in the mid-single digits. Just curious about the rest of the portfolio?"", 'Joel N. Agree', 'The Big Lots expiration that I mentioned, which was now at least within auto parts, that mark-to-market is approximately 5% on a new 15-year lease. In reference to where we think the remainder of the overall portfolio is?', 'Eric Martin Borden', 'Just the remainder of the -- the portion of the portfolio that is on the watch list or base that you anticipate taking back?', 'Joel N. Agree', ""I'd tell you, we're extremely comfortable given the rental rates that we've acquired across those, we're extremely comfortable. Again, these are mid-single-digit rental rates today to even build a box like that is [$160, $150] vertical a foot. These are mid-single-digit rental rates that we feel extremely comfortable that if we were to get any of these boxes back that we'll have no challenge here marking them to market where market is, it varies across the board, but to find any box today that has any merit to it in mid-single-digit range is almost impossible."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Connor Siversky of Wells Fargo.', 'Jesus Garcia', 'Jesus on for Connor this morning. Just in your conversations with tenants, can you offer a temperature check on the willingness for some of these retail operations to continue to expand in this current macro backdrop?', 'Joel N. Agree', ""Yes, as I touched on earlier, the retailers that we talk to want to continue to expand and -- continue to expand aggressively. I don't remember a time when Home Depot, Walmart and Lowe's before except it prior to the GFC, we're expanding the large-format C-stores, the auto parts operators, the off-price retailers, it's all the TJX concepts, Ross, Burlington, Five Below. These operators are have the desire to continue to expand across all of their different flags. And again, the challenge today is construction costs and ultimately, what they can pay on a per square foot rental rate. But there is voracious demand in the discount space, again, we're focused in the necessity-based arena here. It is a voracious demand to continue to expand and open stores. We're seeing that really across the board, whether it's all the way from O'Reilly and AutoZone to tracker supply to Walmart to ALDI, which is obviously making a large acquisition and opening net new stores. I think you see that across the area in terms of discount-oriented operators."", 'Operator', 'This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Joey Agree for any closing remarks.', 'Joel N. Agree', ""Well, thank you, operator, and thank you all for joining us this morning, and we look forward to seeing you at the upcoming conferences. We appreciate everybody's time."", 'Operator', ""The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation, and you may now disconnect.""]"

However, this could be a costly mistake by stock investors. According to historical data, dividends have accounted for about 75% of the total returns of U.S. stocks over the last 123 years."", 'Not every dividend stock is a good investment, though. The best dividend stocks are backed by companies with a durable competitive advantage, robust free cash flow, and a global presence. Here are two ultra-high-quality dividend stocks you can buy and hold forever.', 'American Express (NYSE: AXP), or Amex for short, is a global leader in credit card and payment services, offering a range of products and solutions for consumers and businesses. Its dividend yield of 1.14% may seem low, compared to its peers in the financial services industry, but the company compensates with a high dividend growth rate.', ""In the last five years, the credit card and payment services giant has increased its quarterly cash distribution by 8.9% per year, on average. Moreover, Amex's dividend is well supported by earnings, as shown by its exceptionally low payout ratio of 21.4%."", ""Amex also rewards shareholders through regular share buybacks. In fact, the company has reduced its outstanding share count by a healthy 13.7% in the past five years. Regular share buybacks help to boost earnings and signal to investors that management is optimistic about the company's near-term prospects."", ""Finally, Amex is not just a solid dividend stock; it's also a fast-growing company with a strong competitive advantage. Analysts expect the company's revenue to grow by 9.2% in 2024 and 8.4% in 2025. Few credit card companies can match Amex's growth potential, especially with its focus on premium and ultra-premium cards -- i.e., lower-risk customers."", ""Apart from its strong fundamentals and stellar near-term outlook, Amex stock is also a top holding of Warren Buffett's conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway, which has been a loyal shareholder since the 1990s. Buffett has often used Amex stock in his public commentary as a real-world example of the power of compounding returns."", ""All in all, Amex offers a dependable quarterly payout, a remarkable dividend growth rate, and an incredible level of revenue growth for a major credit card company. It's also a top Warren Buffett stock, which speaks to the high-quality nature of its business and wide competitive moat."", 'Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX) is a dividend-growth stock that offers a reliable income stream to investors. The company operates a global network of specialty coffee shops and has increased its dividend by an annualized rate of 9.62% over the last five years. It currently yields 2.43%, which is higher than the average of its large-cap peers.', 'Besides paying dividends, Starbucks also rewards shareholders by buying back its shares. The company has reduced its share count by 8.8% in the past five years, which has helped to boost its earnings and valuation. Its payout ratio of 57.5% is about average for a large-cap dividend payer, indicating that it should to be able to sustain its aggressive dividend-growth policy in the future.', 'Starbucks is also growing its revenue at a robust pace, thanks to its global expansion strategy and loyal customer base. Analysts expect the company to deliver an 18.6% increase in sales for fiscal 2024 and 2025, which is extremely impressive for a mature business.', ""Moreover, Starbucks is a favorite among institutional investors because they tend to have a long-term horizon and a deep understanding of a company's value proposition.

The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.', ""Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only."", 'A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.', 'Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).', 'How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Synopsys?', ""For Synopsys, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.21%."", 'On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.', 'So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Synopsys will beat the consensus EPS estimate.', 'Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?', ""Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number."", 'For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Synopsys would post earnings of $3.04 per share when it actually produced earnings of $3.17, delivering a surprise of +4.28%.', 'Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.', 'Bottom Line', 'An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.', ""That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported."", ""Synopsys doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate.

Regardless of how much money you have to invest or your risk tolerance, there are stocks and/or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that can grow your wealth."", 'But among these seemingly countless strategies, buying and holding high-quality dividend stocks over long periods is tough to beat.', 'Last year, the Hartford Funds published an extensive report (""The Power of Dividends: Past, Present, and Future"") extolling the greatness that is dividend stocks. In particular, researchers at Hartford Funds, in collaboration with Ned Davis Research, examined the annualized performance of income stocks, compared to non-payers, over a half-century (1973-2022). While the non-payers generated a relatively modest average annual return of 3.95% spanning five decades, the dividend payers more than doubled the annualized return of the non-payers -- 9.18% over 50 years.', ""What's arguably most challenging for income seekers is weighing the risks associated with high-yield dividend stocks. Generally, the higher the yield, the more inherent risk there is for investors. However, this isn't always the case."", 'If you want $300 in exceptionally safe annual dividend income, you can get it by investing $4,975 (split equally, three ways) into the following three high-yield stocks, which sport an average yield of 6.05%!', 'The first high-octane dividend stock that can help you bring home super safe annual income is retail real estate investment trust (REIT) Realty Income (NYSE: O). Realty Income has raised its payout 123 times since going public, and it doles out its dividend on a monthly basis.', ""The clearest headwind for all REITs over the past two years has been the Federal Reserve's hawkish monetary policy. The fastest rate-hiking cycle in four decades has made it costlier to borrow. More importantly, it's sent Treasury bond yields soaring. When bond yields outpace the prevailing inflation rate, it can make bonds more desirable than stocks."", ""The counter to this headwind is that Realty Income isn't just a run-of-the-mill REIT. It's the retail REIT that pretty much every other retail REIT tries to mirror."", ""What's helped set Realty Income apart from its peers, aside from the size of its commercial real estate (CRE) portfolio, is that it primarily leases to retailers that are resilient to economic downturns. According to the company, approximately 91% of its total rent is resilient to economic contractions or pressure from online retailers. This is because the company's renters are primarily found in industries that draw customer traffic in any economic climate. I'm talking about grocery stores, convenience stores, dollar stores, drug stores, and home improvement stores, which collectively account for almost 41% of the company's annualized contractual rent."", 'Another reason Realty Income has set the standard among retail REITs is its ability to diversify its more than 13,000-property CRE portfolio. Last month, it closed its all-share acquisition of Spirit Realty Capital, which enhanced its existing CRE portfolio, as well as expanded Realty Income into new industries. Over the past two years, Realty Income has also made two deals in the gaming space, which further diversifies its lease exposure beyond the traditional retail industry.', ""The cherry on top for income investors is that Realty Income is cheaper now than it's been in at least a decade. Shares can be purchased for 11.6x forward-year cash flow, which represents a 38% discount to the company's average multiple to cash flow over the trailing five years."", 'A second high-yield stock that can deliver $300 in exceptionally safe annual dividend income from an initial investment of $4,975 (split across three stocks) is tobacco company Philip Morris International (NYSE: PM).', 'The biggest problem for Philip Morris is that consumers have, over time, wised up about the potential dangers of long-term tobacco use. As a result, cigarette shipments have been declining in developed markets. While a shrinking pool of consumers would normally be a major red flag, a tobacco giant like Philip Morris has easily identifiable competitive advantages in its corner.', ""To start with, tobacco products contain nicotine, which is an addictive chemical. Tobacco companies haven't had any trouble raising their prices to more than offset declines in cigarette shipments, as well as inflation. In other words, exceptional pricing power is helping Philip Morris and its peers grow their bottom lines."", ""Another reason Philip Morris has proved unstoppable is its geographic reach. It's currently operating in more than 180 countries. If it's contending with shipment declines in select developed markets, there's a good chance it's offsetting these drops with increased demand for tobacco products in emerging markets where tobacco remains something of a luxury."", ""But the most exciting development for Philip Morris and its prospective and existing shareholders is the growth it's seen in its smokeless tobacco products. Specifically, the company's Iqos system has gobbled up more than 9% of the global heated tobacco market. in 2023, heated tobacco unit shipment volume surged by almost 15% to 125.3 billion."", ""The final catalyst that makes Philip Morris a smoking-hot investment -- other than its 5.8% yield -- is its valuation. Philip Morris' forward-year earnings multiple of 12.7 is a marked 17% discount to its forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple over the trailing five years."", ""The third high-yield stock that can produce $300 in exceptionally safe annual dividend income from a starting investment of $4,975, split equally among three stocks, is none other than telecom company AT&T (NYSE: T). AT&T's 6.5% yield is the high-water mark on this list."", 'Telecom stocks took a beating in 2023 following a July report from The Wall Street Journal that alleged legacy providers using lead-clad cables could face sizable environmental- and health-related liabilities. This concern, coupled with rapidly rising interest rates (legacy telecom companies are lugging around quite a bit of debt), weighed heavily on the industry.', ""But when examined with a broader lens, the WSJ report looks like a short-term nothingburger. AT&T notes that lead-sheathed cables make up only a small percentage of its network, and has previously pointed out that testing of these cables didn't turn up any health-related concerns. Even if telecom companies were to eventually face some form of financial liability, it would likely be determined in the U.S. court system, which often takes years."", ""What investors should be paying attention to is AT&T's steadily improved operating performance. Upgrading its network to support 5G download speeds is encouraging wireless users to consume more data. Full-year mobility service revenue rose 4.4%, with the company's wireless segment registering its highest-ever operating income."", ""Perhaps even more impressive is the growth AT&T has delivered from its broadband operations. The 1.1 million net additions in 2023 marked the company's sixth consecutive year where it's added at least 1 million net subscribers. Broadband marks an easy way for AT&T to encourage high-margin service bundling that keeps consumers loyal to its ecosystem of products and services."", ""AT&T's balance sheet has demonstrably improved, too. Since the end of March 2022, AT&T's net debt has declined by roughly $40 billion to $128.9 billion. Organic paydown and the divestment of its content arm, WarnerMedia, have meaningfully improved the company's financial flexibility."", ""Valuation marks the last reason income investors can confidently buy AT&T. A forward P/E ratio of 7.4 provides a very favorable risk versus reward for the company's current and prospective shareholders."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Realty Income right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Realty Income, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Realty Income wasn’t one of them.

Bready', ""Thanks, Winnie, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased with our fourth quarter and full year 2023 results, which exceeded our initial expectations outlined last February. I am extremely proud of our teams around the world for an outstanding execution. Together, we accomplished a great deal in 2023. Starting with our financial performance. For the full year, we achieved high single-digit adjusted net revenue growth and increased adjusted earnings per share 12%. This includes a more than 400 basis point headwind from the divestiture of our Netspend Consumer business, which we completed early in the second quarter. We also expanded adjusted operating margins 90 basis points, including the impact of EVO Payments, which had a lower margin profile than Global Payments at the time of the acquisition. Importantly, we delivered this performance consistently throughout the year despite ongoing headwinds, including macroeconomic uncertainty, persistent inflation, FX volatility and geopolitical unrest, highlighting the durability of our model. Strategically, we also made significant progress during the year executing on a number of key initiatives. First, we successfully closed the acquisition of EVO Payments in March, which complements our strategy by providing further penetration into integrated payments, enhancing our B2B capabilities and expanding our exposure to stronger secular growth markets globally. Our integration has progressed quite well, and we remain on track to deliver on our revised target of $135 million in annual run rate expense synergies within 2 years. And while revenue synergies generally take longer to materialize, we are more excited today than when we announced the transaction about opportunities we have to cross-sell our products and capabilities into EVO's existing customer base. We are continuing to invest in these opportunities in 2024 and expect them to scale more fully in 2025. Further, we completed the divestitures of our Netspend Consumer assets and our Gaming Solutions business in April. These 3 transactions represent important milestones as we seek to advance our strategy and operate a simpler business model centered on our core corporate and financial institution customer base. In our Merchant business, that strategy is spearheaded by a software-centric approach, leveraging our strengths across our vertical markets, integrated and point-of-sale businesses. And we seek to drive distinction in our offerings by providing omnichannel capabilities and value-added commerce enablement solutions across our markets, including those that benefit from stronger payment digitization and secular growth trends. We continue to see good momentum in our Merchant Solutions as we execute against these strategies. Starting with our vertical markets businesses, we had a number of notable achievements in 2023 across the portfolio. These include Xenial's new partnerships to be the official commerce technology provider for both the Atlanta Braves and Atlanta Hawks as we look to further expand our market presence in the stadium and event venue vertical. In the United Kingdom, we renewed our relationship with Principality Stadium, home of Welsh rugby and football, and expanded our services with Wembley Stadium in London. We were also selected by leading food service management company, Sodexo, to be its preferred point-of-sale and kiosk partner and are now the partner of choice for the 3 largest players in the food service management space. Our education solutions business delivered many new marquee customer additions across our K-12 and our university businesses and continued to expand to international markets with School Solutions launching MySchoolBucks in Australia, and TouchNet achieving new wins in Canada, Australia and the United Kingdom. And our ACTIVE Network business had a record bookings year, signing 839 new logos, including its largest ever win in the community vertical with the City of Toronto. Moving to partner and software solutions. We achieved record bookings in 2023 with new partners increasing 23% from the prior year. This was in part driven by the strong momentum we have seen with our new progressive payment facilitation or ProFac model that we launched midyear. This hybrid option provides many of the benefits of being a payment facilitator while minimizing the heavy burden that comes with it. ProFac is unique to Global Payments, and we are delighted to have signed 16 ProFac partners to date who already have thousands of merchant customers using our payment solutions. Some notable new partners in our integrated business include 402 Ventures, a leading provider of auction software in the heavy equipment and machinery vertical; AutoSoft, which provides a software management platform for auto dealerships; Black Knight, a leading provider of mortgages and loan origination software; and Inovalon, a leading data analytics ISV in the health care vertical. These trends, including the momentum we are seeing with ProFac, underscore our confidence in our ability to maintain consistent growth going forward as our differentiated capabilities continue to resonate with the ISV market. As for the third leg of our software strategy, our point-of-sale software business delivered strong growth for the full year as we continue to see solid demand for our solutions and benefit from the releases of new product enhancements. Notably, our average revenue per unit continues to expand up 9% year-over-year as more merchants are using payments and other add-on capabilities in our evolving POS platform. And of course, this is prior to the full launch of our complete next-generation restaurant and retail point-of-sale software platforms, which we continue to expect this quarter. Lastly, our exposure to some of the most attractive secular markets globally remains a core element of our strategy, both in terms of contributing to our overall rates of growth and providing us the global footprint we need to support complex multinational corporations. We continue to see good trends across our businesses in Spain and Central Europe, each of which delivered high teens growth. And key new European markets entered with EVO, including Poland and Greece, also achieved double-digit growth. Further, we have seen favorable secular trends in Lat Am, where we meaningfully increased our footprint with EVO. This includes new implementations in Mexico with large customers like dLocal, DHL and Petro 7 as we leverage our partnership with Citibanamex. Turning to Issuer Solutions, where we have long-standing relationships with some of the most complex and sophisticated institutions globally. We are proud to have completed 11 customer conversions in 2023. In total, we added over 50 million accounts to our business and ended the year with record traditional accounts on file of more than 800 million. We continue to have a strong pipeline of new business that extends into 2025 as well as 8 letters of intent with institutions worldwide. In 2023, we achieved 13 multiyear renewals and new customer agreements. This includes a new contract with a leading U.S. bank that is a long-standing Global Payments merchant partner, a relationship that provided the foundation for the growth of our partnership to include issuer technology solutions. We also continued to expand into new and faster growth markets, including in Lat Am through our partnership with CAT, a credit card joint venture between Scotiabank and Chile's largest retailer, Cencosud.The confidence that many of the largest and most sophisticated, complex financial institutions have with us is enhanced by our issuer platform modernization efforts, which positions us to provide our clients market-leading, cloud native, real-time solutions at scale in more markets than we ever had previously. We've made substantial progress with our modernization with 2 clients now in production, leveraging products by our cloud solution. Further, we expect to complete the development of our client-facing applications this year and are planning to execute dozens of unique cloud issuer platform pilots spanning multiple services, products and geographies as we prepare for the commercial launch of additional cloud native capabilities. Moving to B2B. We continue to see solid demand for our leading capabilities across our 3 focus areas: software-driven workflow automation, money-in and money-out funds flow and employer solutions. We have successfully integrated EVO's PayFabric software into our Merchant business allowing us to go to market in B2B acceptance with a software-led approach. Further, our MineralTree business nearly doubled subscription bookings in its core mid-market, positioning the business well heading into 2024. As one of the largest virtual card issuers in the world, we are benefiting from accelerated adoption of virtual cards globally, which contributed to strong growth in commercial transactions this year. Additionally, our B2B bookings in Merchant Solutions increased over 20% in 2023 as more of the spend shifts towards digital channels. Our employer solutions are also seeing favorable trends, including our payroll business delivering mid-teens growth for the full year and our Paycard and EWA solutions achieving nearly 2,000 new partnerships last year. After an eventful and successful 2023, I'm pleased to report that we are carrying this momentum into the early part of 2024. In January, our Merchant business announced a new joint venture with Commerzbank in Germany. This new entity, Commerz Globalpay, is expected to launch in the first half of 2024 and will deliver a comprehensive suite of innovative omnichannel payments and software offerings including our GP point-of-sale software solutions and our GP touch-on-mobile technology at scale, providing merchants the capabilities needed to run and grow their businesses more efficiently in the largest economy in Europe. We are delighted to be partnering with Commerzbank, a premier financial institution with unmatched relationships with small- and medium-sized merchants, to significantly enhance distribution in Germany where there are substantial opportunities to further digitize the payment experience. This partnership was achieved with Global Payment's leadership in payments technology and commerce solutions and extensive JV experience across European markets while our acquisition of EVO helped provide a foundation with this existing physical presence in merchant portfolio in Germany. In North America, we remain on track to launch our next-generation Heartland Restaurant and Heartland Retail offerings this quarter, which will provide best-in-class omnichannel experiences and further catalyze our success in point-of-sale software. Early feedback on our next-generation restaurant point-of-sale solution has been overwhelmingly positive, including our new updated and enhanced features like online ordering, loyalty, mobile point-of-sale and a simplified user interface on commercial grade hardware. And our new retail POS solution will allow us to extend into additional retail verticals, which is the cornerstone of our broader strategy of sub-vertical expansion, allowing us to increase wallet share while also meeting the demands of a modern retail environment that bring supply chain, e-commerce, customer engagement and complex ERP functionality into a simplified and single ecosystem. This expansion not only aligns with our growth objectives, but also ensures we stay at the forefront of retail technology, providing our clients with the tools they need to thrive in a rapidly evolving market. Our POS momentum also continues in the enterprise QSR space. We were delighted to be selected to power CosMc's, a new concept from the McDonald's universe. Xenial's cloud point-of-sale, drive-through digital menu boards and Vision's speed-of-service solutions are enabling an innovative new drive-through traffic management system that supports CosMc's multiple drive-through lanes and pickup windows optimizing restaurant operations in a dynamic and flexible way. CosMc's is also using Xenial's back-office suite to provide real-time reporting and management of inventory, sales, labor, projections and scheduling. We are excited to have already launched with CosMc's at the initial Bolingbrook, Illinois restaurant concept in December and look forward to helping future-proof all new pilot locations with our cloud-based technology ecosystem as they open in additional markets in 2024. Our Issuer business has also started the year well, having executed multiyear renewal agreements with 2 of our flagship clients, Capital One and Navy Federal Credit Union, both long-standing relationships spanning decades. Our renewal with Capital One includes both its consumer and commercial credit portfolios in North America. And for Navy Federal, a not-for-profit credit union serving the military veterans and their families, our relationship supports its consumer portfolio as well as an array of value-added services, including loyalty, fraud and digital engagement solutions. The extension of these partnerships further validates our strategy of aligning our business with clear market winners. Looking ahead, we remain encouraged by the resiliency we have seen in consumer spending and expect fairly similar trends in 2024. However, we recognize there remain a number of risks to the global economy and consumer and are appropriately reflecting this in our expectations. Our outlook does incorporate a slightly more tempered expectation for the macro environment relative to what we experienced in 2023, but is roughly aligned with what we saw exiting the year. January trends were fairly consistent with what you heard from the networks and broadly in line with our expectations. We are confident we have built a better and more durable business model, which positions us well to manage through any environment if the current backdrop changes. With that, I'll turn the call over to Josh."", 'Joshua J. Whipple', ""Thanks, Cameron. We are pleased with our financial performance in the fourth quarter and for the full year, which reflects continued outstanding execution and the resiliency of our business model. I'm particularly proud that we delivered these results while simultaneously completing multiple transactions, which serve to accelerate our strategy. Starting with the full year 2023, we delivered adjusted net revenue of $8.67 billion, an increase of 7% from the prior year. Excluding the impact of dispositions, adjusted net revenue increased 15% compared to 2022. Adjusted operating margin for the full year improved 90 basis points to 44.6%. The net result was adjusted earnings per share of $10.42, an increase of 12% compared to the full year 2022, which equates to over 16% growth, excluding the impact of dispositions. For the fourth quarter, we delivered adjusted net revenue of $2.19 billion, an increase of 8% from the same period in the prior year. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 30 basis points to 44.8%. This equates to 100 basis points of margin expansion, excluding EVO Payments and dispositions. The net result was adjusted earnings per share of $2.65, an increase of 10% compared to the same period in 2023. Taking a closer look at performance by segment. Merchant Solutions achieved adjusted net revenue of $1.67 billion for the fourth quarter, reflecting growth of 19% or approximately 8%, excluding the impact of EVO and dispositions. Our performance was led by our software-centered businesses, which again delivered double-digit growth in the quarter. Specifically, we saw strength in Zego, School Solutions and AdvancedMD, which delivered strong double-digit growth for the fourth quarter. And our point-of-sale businesses again grew roughly 20%. Focusing on faster-growth geographies, we achieved double-digit growth in Spain and Central Europe as well as in Poland and Greece. Our Lat Am business was another bright spot for the quarter as we benefit from the strong secular payments trends in Mexico and Chile. This performance was partially offset by ongoing weakness in the macro environment in the U.K. and Canada. We delivered an adjusted operating margin of 47.7% in the Merchant segment, a decline of 60 basis points due to the acquisition of EVO. Excluding EVO and dispositions, operating margins grew 40 basis points year-on-year. For the full year, we realized approximately 25% of our targeted expense synergies from EVO. And as Cameron mentioned, we expect to deliver on our raised expectation of $135 million in annual run rate expense synergies within 2 years. Our Issuer Solutions business produced adjusted net revenue of $531 million, reflecting growth of 6% or 5% constant currency growth. The core Issuer business also grew mid-single digits this quarter, driven by ongoing strength in volume-based revenue. This was partially offset by slower growth in managed and output services as we continue to focus our Issuer business on more technology enablement. We added approximately 13 million traditional accounts on file sequentially. This equates to an increase of more than 50 million accounts year-over-year as we continue to benefit from the ongoing execution of our conversion pipeline in addition to healthy consumer and commercial account growth with our large existing FI customers. Issuer transactions grew high single digits compared to the fourth quarter of 2022, led by commercial card transactions, which increased low double digits, highlighting ongoing strength in cross-border corporate travel. Focusing in on our Issuer B2B portfolio, MineralTree delivered high teens growth and achieved record bookings this quarter in its targeted mid-market segment while Paycard saw improving trends as the business lapped a more difficult employment comparisons from the last year. Finally, Issuer Solutions delivered an adjusted operating margin of 47.3%. As expected, this was relatively consistent with our third quarter performance, but represented a decline compared to the prior year due to a difficult comparison resulting from vendor benefits reflected in that period. For the full year, our Issuer margins expanded 100 basis points, which exceeded our initial guidance for 60 basis points of margin improvement compared to 2022. From a cash flow standpoint, we produced strong adjusted free cash flow for the quarter of $784 million and $2.5 billion for the year. This represents an approximately 100% conversion rate of adjusted net income to adjusted free cash flow for the full year, consistent with our expectations, excluding the impact of the requirement to capitalize research and development costs for income tax reporting purposes. Capital investment was approximately $157 million in the fourth quarter and roughly $660 million for the full year. Since closing EVO in March, we have reduced outstanding debt by more than $1.4 billion, and our leverage position was 3.4x at the end of the fourth quarter. Our balance sheet remains healthy and we have approximately $3.5 billion of available liquidity. Further, our total indebtedness is approximately 91% fixed with a weighted average cost of debt of 3.78%. While debt repayment was our top priority for capital allocation in 2023, we are pleased to have also repurchased 4 million shares for roughly $410 million prior to closing EVO. Turning to the outlook. We are pleased with how our business is positioned as we enter 2024. We currently expect reported adjusted net revenue to range from $9.17 billion to $9.30 billion, reflecting growth of 6% to 7% over 2023 or approximately 7-plus percent, excluding EVO and dispositions. We are forecasting annual adjusted operating margin to expand up to 50 basis points for 2024, driven by benefits to our business mix from our ongoing shift towards technology enablement, partially offset by the lower margin profile of EVO prior to full synergy realization. To provide color at the segment level, we expect our Merchant business to report adjusted net revenue growth of 9-plus percent for the full year. This includes growth in the 7% to 8% range, excluding the impact of the acquisition of EVO and the disposition of Gaming Solutions. We fully annualize these transactions by the end of the first quarter of 2024. We expect up to 30 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion for the Merchant business in 2024 with a slower expansion in the first half relative to the second half as EVO synergy realization ramps as the year progresses. Moving to Issuer Solutions. We are anticipating adjusted net revenue growth in the 5% to 6% range for the full year compared to 2023 as we benefit from our strong conversion pipeline and continued account growth with our large existing FI partners. We expect core Issuer to grow in the mid-single-digit range and for MineralTree and Netspend's B2B businesses to grow low double digits. We anticipate adjusted operating margin for the Issuer business to expand by up to 50 basis points as we continue to drive efficiencies in the business, which will be offset somewhat by faster growth in our lower-margin B2B businesses.  In terms of quarterly phasing, as I mentioned, we will anniversary the acquisition of EVO and the disposition of Gaming by the end of the first quarter. We will also anniversary the impact of the divestiture of Netspend's consumer assets at the end of April. As a result, we will continue to have some impacts from these transactions in the first half of the year. Moving to a couple of nonoperating items. We currently expect net interest expense to be slightly above $500 million this year and for our adjusted effective tax rate to be approximately 19%. We also are planning for our capital expenditures to be around $670 million in 2024, which remains roughly 7% of revenue. We anticipate adjusted free cash flow to again be in a comparable range of 100%, excluding the roughly 5-point impact from the timing change to recognizing research and development tax credits. Regarding capital allocation, we plan to return to a more balanced capital allocation approach in 2024, and I'm delighted that our Board of Directors has approved an increase in our share repurchase authorization to $2 billion as share buyback remains one of our priorities. We also plan to further reduce our indebtedness until we return to roughly 3x levered on a net debt basis during the year. Putting it all together, we expect adjusted earnings per share for the full year to be in the range of $11.54 to $11.70, reflecting growth of 11% to 12% over 2023. Excluding dispositions, adjusted earnings per share growth is expected to be 14-plus percent for 2024. Our outlook for the year reflects the ongoing positive momentum in our business while accommodating for a more tempered economic environment given the continued uncertainty. We remain confident in the resiliency of our model and our ability to adapt to potential shifts in the economic environment. Cameron?"", 'Cameron M. Bready', ""Thanks, Josh. As I said when I was named CEO in May, it's an exciting time for Global Payments and I could not be more proud of what we accomplished last year. As we begin 2024, I remain enthusiastic about the opportunities in front of us. We have a compelling technology-enabled strategy, a world-class team, great partners and clients and a global presence with diverse distribution capabilities.This year, I remain highly focused on the priorities for our business and customers I outlined at the time I stepped into this role. First, we will continue to execute against our strategies, which positions us well for growth and success across our markets. We will, however, sharpen our focus on the most attractive opportunities we see in these areas while seeking to further simplify our business and amplify the impact of our investments. Specifically, we are focusing on the most impactful of these initiatives and where we can drive further differentiation in our business, including with our software-centric channels across our own, partnered and POS solutions. Additionally, we will continue to harmonize areas of the business that are less differentiated with an eye towards further improving scale and enhancing margin characteristics. Further, in markets and businesses we are subscale with limited potential to build scale, we may choose to exit certain lines of business and activities in order to better focus our investments, resources and management intention on opportunity with better long-term growth prospects that can more meaningfully impact our business. Second, I'm focused on making it as easy as possible to do business with Global Payments, while providing more solutions that deepen our relationships with our customers. We will continue to prioritize meeting our clients and customers how and where they want to be met with innovative and distinctive capabilities that integrate seamlessly. This includes our issuer modernization program and cloud investments, which will provide our clients with greater enablement capabilities and allow them to consume the services they need with greater speed to market and flexibility while providing best-in-class experiences for their cardholders. Third, we will maintain our relentless focus on execution, which has been one of the hallmarks of Global Payments and a key component of our ability to produce consistent results through market cycles. We are, however, undertaking an initiative to further simplify our technology and operating environments across the globe to become more efficient and effective, placing greater focus on aligning with business outcomes. We are committed to redefining success with a continuous improvement mindset and increasing the speed of delivery and nimbleness of our business. Fourth, we remain committed to harnessing the power of generative AI to both innovate new products and solutions that deliver value and improve experiences to our customers and increase the productivity and efficiency of our operating environments and workforce around the globe. We have already made meaningful progress in our journey to embed generative AI into our business to leverage its power in the richness of data in our ecosystem. We have established a center of excellence to coordinate our adoption of generative AI technologies and provide a governance framework, implemented foundational tools and models that are being utilized throughout our organization, evaluated numerous use cases and deploy generative AI technology in a number of areas of our business. For example, in our Issuer Solutions business, our Foresight solution, in partnership with Featurespace, provides a market-leading fraud solution that uses generative AI to detect fraud strategies in real time, utilizing our proprietary data. Clients using this solution have realized a nearly 50% reduction in fraud losses. And we are evaluating a number of development opportunities that use generative AI across our issuing and acquiring businesses as a key component of our next-generation applications to further combat fraud and identity risks across our portfolios. Finally, I'm focused on ensuring Global Payments' culture is second to none. Our culture dictates how we accomplish our goals and achieve results as an organization. Having a world-class culture will further differentiate us in the marketplace while driving value creation and benefits for all of our constituents. Winnie?"", 'Winnie Smith', 'Thanks, Cameron. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. Operator, we will now go to questions.', 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America.', 'Jason Alan Kupferberg', ""I wanted to start with the guidance for 2024 on the top line. Looking at the Merchant piece specifically, I know we're talking about at least 7% organic. It did sound in your prepared remarks like you're maybe being a little bit more conservative versus this time last year. So if you can elaborate on that and just give us a sense. I mean, if the consumer doesn't slow at all, are we looking at more like 8%? Just trying to calibrate what some of the underlying assumptions might be in that part of the guide."", 'Cameron M. Bready', 'Jason, it\'s Cameron. Thanks for the question, it\'s a good question. So the way I think about it is we exited the year at basically 8%. And as we said in our prepared remarks, our expectation for Merchant for 2024 is 7% to 8% kind of ""organic,"" obviously excluding the pickup that we get from EVO in the first quarter before we anniversary the deal. So to me, that really reflects, as we said, a slightly more tempered view of the macroeconomic environment, given that we do see some risk to the consumer as we head into 2024. That being said, to your point, if the consumer hangs in better than we would expect, I would anticipate us being towards the higher end of that range. Obviously, if the consumer is a little weaker, as our guide sort of contemplates or at least allows for, I think, at the low end, we might be towards the lower end of that range. So I think the way you\'re thinking about it is right, and it\'s consistent with how we\'re thinking about it. We\'re being a little bit cautious around the consumer heading into the year. Obviously, a continued resilient consumer who doesn\'t weaken at all will put us towards the higher end. And if we do see a little bit of softness, we think we\'d be towards the lower end of that range. But again, we wanted to be prudent with our expectations around the consumer heading into the year.', 'Jason Alan Kupferberg', 'Understood. And I wanted to just pick up on your comments around simplifying the business, some possible portfolio pruning sounds like it could be on the table. Wondering if that might be a 2024 event. And then if you can just comment on the M&A front about whether or not large-scale acquisitions could be in the cards. There are obviously some media reports out a little bit before Christmas on that, which I know you guys denied, but just to get a sense of where A versus buybacks is sitting in your priority list right now.', 'Cameron M. Bready', ""Yes, happy to. Maybe I'll address the latter part of that question first and then I'll circle back to the front in a second. I think on the M&A front, as Josh mentioned in his prepared comments, we're kind of back to a business-as-usual mindset heading into the year as it relates to capital allocation. As I said, pretty consistently, whatever we do or consider from an M&A perspective, obviously, it has to fit strategically, it has to fit culturally and financially it needs to be attractive as the returns matter relative to the alternative uses of our capital. And given that leverage is right around our targeted level right now and we expect it to be for 2024, the alternative use of capital is buying back our stock. So I remain of the view that anything we do from an M&A perspective needs to be competitive from a return standpoint relative to our ability to buy back stock and the returns that we think we can generate from that. And that's true regardless of whether we're thinking about smaller deals that present nice tuck-in or enhanced capability opportunities or we think of larger deals that obviously provide more opportunity for increased scale and advance the strategy as well. So as always, from an M&A perspective, we're open-minded. I think we're very deliberate, I think, in terms of how we think about M&A that's going to fit our strategy and the things that we want to pursue and we'll continue with that mindset as we move forward in time. But I'll be clear, the return expectations from M&A need to be competitive and that's how we view everything through that lens. I think as it relates to your first question around potential portfolio pruning, there is some chance that, that will be in the cards for 2024. Yes, it's not contemplated in our outlook currently today but it is something that we're continuing to evaluate. And it's really in the context of making sure that as we think about investing in the business, that we're investing in those areas where we have scale, we have differentiation, we have prospects to be able to continue to grow the business at attractive rates going forward and trying to minimize investment, minimize resources and management attention that's focused on markets that may be subscale or line of business where we don't have a particular differentiation and we don't see greater prospects to meaningfully impact the business moving forward. So that's the way we're thinking about it. Obviously, if we make decisions around that, we'll provide updates as we work through the year, but it is certainly something that we're contemplating as I noted in my remarks."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley.', 'James Eugene Faucette', ""Wanted to ask in terms of your current competitive environment, I think, Cameron, you highlighted a lot of different things that you're working on in areas of strength. But how would you generally assess the competitive intensity in the market right now? And where do you see opportunities versus challenges generally?"", 'Cameron M. Bready', ""I think it's a good question. I would say we feel fairly good about how we're positioned strategically across most of the markets that we're in today. Certainly, here, in the U.S., we feel quite good about, obviously, our integrated business, the capabilities we have there, the differentiation, the distinction we think we can bring to ISV partners and how that has allowed us to position that business for continued growth and success.And certainly, we're very excited about the rollout of our next-generation of point-of-sale software solutions I talked about, which are coming, obviously, this quarter which we think will give us a more competitive positioning, obviously, in the POS space here in the U.S. market with feature-rich capabilities and obviously service that we think is distinctive relative to, again, the competitors in the marketplace. And obviously, we still see a long runway for growth around POS, whether it's enterprise QSR with what we're doing with CosMc's or small- to medium-sized merchants across restaurants and retail that we're targeting through our Heartland Restaurant and Heartwood Retail platforms. So I think we feel very good about that. And then, of course, across the vertical market software businesses and those verticals where we do own the entirety of the software stack, again, we think we're well positioned in those verticals to continue to grow nicely and continue to gain share with those businesses and the specific verticals that they're targeting. So that's really the software-centric strategies that we're pursuing here in the U.S. market. I do think those are the areas of growth that we're continuing to focus on and continuing to invest in, in our business and that's the best strategy for us competitively, I think, here in the U.S. market. But I think we're feeling pretty sanguine about the overall competitive landscape in the U.S. I think pricing has become more rationalized obviously with rates rising and competitors focusing on sort of profitability and free cash flow, which I think creates a more constructive backdrop overall just from a competitive standpoint. I'd say outside the U.S., we're pretty bullish how we're positioned competitively largely because of the capability that we can bring to bear on markets that are probably not quite as sophisticated from a product and solutioning standpoint as the U.S. market. So our ability to bring our point-of-sale solutions, our touch-on-mobile solutions, our commerce enablement capabilities, our Google Run and Grow My Business platform to markets outside the U.S., particularly in Europe, Lat Am, and to some degree, Asia Pacific, I think competitively positions us really well in markets where I'd say the competitive dynamic, in many cases, is probably less intense than it is here in the U.S. market. So from that perspective, I'm relatively bullish what we can do putting aside macro just in terms of competitive positioning in markets outside the U.S., bringing these distinctive and differentiated capabilities."", 'James Eugene Faucette', ""Appreciate that. And then as a follow-up and related to this year's outlook, how should we be thinking about the targets, especially from a profitability standpoint vis-à-vis kind of your cycle guide that was established a few years ago and wondering kind of the trajectory of that and how we should be thinking about medium-term EPS targeted growth rates, et cetera."", 'Cameron M. Bready', 'Yes, James, look, it\'s a fair question, and I\'m not going to get ahead of my skis today and sort of give a new ""cycle guide"". Obviously, as I\'ve communicated previously, we intend to host an Investor Day this year. That will be one of the topics that we cover at that time and then we\'ll provide a little more color about how we\'re thinking about the business end. But I would say if you just step back and look at how we\'re thinking about the business heading into the year, as we said, excluding kind of the anniversary-ing of deals, if you think about the business on a normalized basis, we\'re targeting 7-plus percent revenue growth on the top line and kind of 14-plus percent from an earnings per share perspective. So think about it kind of in the high single-digit top line growth and kind of mid-teens earnings per share growth, again, reflecting a little bit more of a tempered view of the macro environment heading into the year. I think that\'s generally fairly reflective of how we think about the business. And I think that kind of business is one that we can continue to execute against those targets and expectations are something that we think we can sustainably achieve over a period of time. So I wouldn\'t characterize kind of the outlook broadly as reflective of how we think about the business, obviously, with the overlay of a little bit of a tempered macroeconomic expectation for 2024.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research.', 'Darrin David Peller', ""I was actually going to touch on the medium-term guide, but that was helpful. But just as a kind of a quick follow-up on the guidance, when we think about the inputs, again, you said more conservative in terms of the consumer, which is helpful, are you incorporating any type of M&A or tuck-ins in that outlook that we should consider being at all material to the revenue growth rates? And then just going back to guide on margins, I think you're saying up to 50 basis points. Can we just walk through that a bit? It's a little lower than it used to be in terms of margin expansion. How much of that is synergies from EVO? How much of that is just operating leverage versus mix? Any conservatism in that outlook as well and just maybe the inputs.And then also, if your margins are coming to a level that's higher, does that inform your view on capital allocation more and more buybacks perhaps?"", 'Cameron M. Bready', ""Yes. A lot buried in there, Darrin. Maybe I'll start and then ask Josh to chime in as well on a couple of the comments. I would just say on the first question, the answer is no from an M&A perspective. We did a small portfolio buy in Q4, but it's de minimis in terms of contribution to 2024. I mean, less than 10 basis points. So that's not a particular large impact. We don't have any other M&A included in our guide. Obviously, if we do M&A, we'll update at the time as we have historically and provide an expectation of contribution for whatever M&A we do as we head into 2024.On the second question, I think, as it relates to the margin guide, I'll just give a couple of opening comments and then I'll let Josh maybe provide a little more color. I'd say 2 things really, one is I think we're taking a fairly prudent view of the outlook kind of heading into the year. We have a lot of things that we're trying to accomplish as a business, particularly as it relates to EVO integration as well as continuing to invest in the business in areas that we think are going to help drive growth and sustain growth over longer periods of time. So I think like everything in life, it's a bit of a balanced view around how much of the benefit is flowing through margins to the bottom line versus how much we're reinvesting in the business to support the rollout of our new POS platform, obviously, to ensure that we execute integration of EVO seamlessly, effectively, while we continue to invest in their underlying platforms to ensure stability and reliability. We continue to invest in bringing new product and capability to their markets, which we think will drive revenue, obviously, longer term, et cetera. So I think the view around margins is pretty balanced around, again, wanting to invest in the business to drive growth as well as allowing some of that to flow through to the bottom line to impact earnings. The last point I would make, and I'll ask Josh to add any color he would like is if you exclude sort of the impact of EVO, which obviously is still coming in at a lower margin profile, I think overall margins for the year would be up closer to 75 basis points and Merchant would be closer to 60%. So I'll just remind you that's going to move off of a base for Merchant of kind of 48%. So margins are fairly healthy in the business overall. We're focused on continuing to find opportunities for market expansion, again, while also continuing to find opportunities to invest to grow the business. Josh, I don't know if you'd want to add anything to that?"", 'Joshua J. Whipple', ""No. Look, I think the only thing I would add is that if we think about margins by segment, we continue to expect Merchant margins to improve as synergies ramp. And Darrin, you may recall, if you go back to last year, Q2 margins were down 170 basis points; Q3, they were down 90; and Q4 60. So we're seeing a continued, consistent positive trend coming into the year. I'd also just reecho what Cameron said, we need to focus on balancing margin expansion with reinvestment in the business. And as it relates to our Issuer margins, we'll continue to see the benefit of strong volume-based revenue trends and ongoing expense management. In Q1 specifically, we expect margins to be slightly higher than the 50 basis points given the low Q1 '23 absolute margin figures. But otherwise, margin expansion for the overall company will be pretty consistent across each of the quarters."", 'Darrin David Peller', ""That's really helpful. And just quickly on the buyback question. I mean, is this -- it looks like you raised your authorization, if I'm not mistaken. And so is this an indication of more capital return expectations going forward?"", 'Joshua J. Whipple', 'So look, Darrin, I would say that we plan to return to a more balanced capital allocation approach in 2024. Buybacks remains one of our priorities, but we plan to further reduce debt until we can return to that roughly 3x levered target on a net debt basis during the year.', 'Cameron M. Bready', ""Darrin, the only thing I'd add, I mean, it was important to us -- it was important to us going in the year to have the capacity to be able to do share repurchases if that's what capital allocation plans call for. So obviously, we're pleased the Board supports that and I think it sends a signal, obviously, that we're very open-minded to share repurchases if that's the best alternative for capital allocation this year."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays.', 'Ramsey Clark El-Assal', 'Could you help us think through the timing and magnitude of the contribution from the Commerzbank JV this year? Will it ramp quickly? Does it -- how much is baked into guidance basically from that deal?', 'Cameron M. Bready', ""Yes, it's a good question. And let me just be clear, Ramsey, the joint venture itself. We're not buying into an existing portfolio that Commerzbank has. Commerzbank doesn't have an acquiring business today. What we're doing effectively through the joint venture is entering into a distribution partnership, whereby Commerzbank will obviously be a distribution channel for us. They'll own 49% of the business, but they're largely bringing distribution to the party as it relates to the joint venture that we're establishing with them. So essentially think of it as a greenfield opportunity to really grow and scale a business in Germany, starting with a very small base that we acquired through the EVO acquisition last year, but it's an opportunity to grow and scale a more meaningful business in Germany over a long period of time. Commerzbank is one of the largest domestic banks in Germany. They have one of the strongest market positions, particularly across small- and medium-sized merchants, which is obviously more of our target market in the markets that we serve around the globe. So end of the day, we think it's a fantastic new partner that's going to allow us to build over time a more meaningful business in our -- in Germany but obviously it's going to take a while to scale there."", 'Ramsey Clark El-Assal', ""Got it. Great. Sounds like a great new channel. A follow-up from me. Could you update us on the U.K. business? And just let us know if you're seeing stabilization there on the macro or consumer spending front? And I guess kind of being in the context of the sort of takepayments chatter, do you have the product capabilities that you need over there to compete effectively at this point?"", 'Cameron M. Bready', ""Yes, it's a good question, Ramsey. I'm not going to comment on the latter part of that. Naturally, not surprisingly, we don't comment on market rumors of that nature. But I think as it relates to the U.K. market, I would say a couple of things. One is we are starting to see some signs of stabilization there, which I think is positive. Obviously, they reported their sort of inflation numbers this morning. They were generally in line with expectations unlike where the U.S. was yesterday. So I think that's a constructive step forward as well. So I don't know that we've seen absolute bottom in the U.K. just as it relates to the macro pressure, obviously, that we've highlighted over the course of much of the last year and beyond. But I do think we are getting to a point where we're seeing -- obviously, seeing things stabilize in that market, which gives us a little bit more optimism about where we can go over the longer term in the U.K. I would say as it relates to product and capability, the short answer is yes. I mean, we've worked hard to bring new product and new solutions to that market. We talked about bringing our GP POS solution to the U.K. market, which we think will give us a very competitive point-of-sale to market. And again, that's not highly differentiated like it is here in the U.S. market. We brought other solutions from a commerce enablement perspective to the U.K. market as well. So I think, certainly, from a product capability standpoint, we have everything that we need to be successful in that market. I think the challenge with the U.K. has really been macro-driven over a longer period of time. And that's obviously something that I've said before, I think we're starting to see signs of stabilization there."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Dave Koning with Baird.', 'David John Koning', ""I thought one of the really encouraging parts of the quarter and just the guidance is free cash flow conversion. Not many companies are guiding to around 100% conversion. Can you kind of discuss that a little bit why -- what about your company converts so well?And then kind of as a pairing with that question, you've had semi-high merger add-backs, although they've come down in the last few quarters. Are those going to go down pretty significantly in 2024?"", 'Joshua J. Whipple', ""Yes, I'll go ahead and take that. So look, we were, I would say, generally very pleased with our free cash flow conversion, especially for the quarter, we were over 100%. For the full year, we were 100%, and this was in line with our expectations as we've been guiding over the last several quarters and last year. And I would say that this conversion follows the trajectory that we saw in 2022, a little bit weaker in the first half of the year and stronger in the second half of the year. So we -- what I would say in '24, we continue to go ahead and target that same general trajectory and pattern and we expect to go ahead and convert roughly 100% in 2024, excluding the impact of the timing -- change of the recognizing the R&D tax credit. So as it relates to the add-backs, I would say we continue to go ahead and expect add-backs to come down. I think you'll note in our Schedule 10 of the press release, that we expect GAAP earnings to be approximately 50% of adjusted earnings. That's a significant improvement relative to last year and we expect that to go ahead and continue as time goes on."", 'David John Koning', 'And maybe just a quick follow-up. On the pace through the year of earnings, I mean, it sounds like once you anniversary Netspend and anniversary EVO, both revenue and EPS can accelerate a little bit given just the profiles?', 'Joshua J. Whipple', ""Yes. So look, what I would say is we're expecting 11%, 12% EPS growth. Q1, as you rightly point out, we're anniversary-ing Netspend and Gaming. So that will be slightly below the range. But I would say, Q2 will be in the 11% to 12% range and then Q3, Q4 will be in the 12% to 13% range and that kind of gets you to the 11% to 12% for the full year."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin with TD Cowen.', 'Bryan C. Bergin', 'Wanted to dig in on the Merchant growth guidance first. Are you expecting volumes to be generally in line with the forecast you have? Just any comments on additional potential lift from pricing in that view. And are you forecasting that Merchant growth level in the balance of the year after EVO and the Gaming sales to be generally level?', 'Cameron M. Bready', ""Yes. Good questions. I would say, maybe just to address the last one quickly, the short answer is yes. Once we anniversary EVO in the first quarter and Gaming, I would expect Q2 through Q4 to be relatively consistent based on our current outlook for the full year.Just going back to the first part of your question, I would say, yes, we would expect volumes to generally track relatively in line with the revenue growth that we're seeing in the business. That's been a consistent trend. If you look at the schedule we provide in our earnings presentation, you can go back quite a long period of time and see that trend being pretty consistent, which is something that we're pleased about. So the outlook for 2024, I would say, yes, by and large, we expect volumes to generally track our revenue expectations as we work ourselves through the balance of the year. And then I would say on pricing, we really haven't changed our philosophy on that front. We've been pretty consistent in our commentary as to how we think about pricing -- not only our commentary, but our actual execution of it as well, clearly geared towards making sure that we think we're getting paid fairly and appropriately for the level of value and service that we're giving to our customers. We're not the low-cost provider in the market and we don't strive to be. And we think the value proposition we bring to customers and clients is differentiated and we want the price for our services to reflect that. So there's nothing unusual, I would say, in 2024 from a pricing perspective. It's a little bit of more of a continuation of executing against that philosophy that we've had over a long period of time."", 'Bryan C. Bergin', ""Okay. Appreciate that. And then a follow-up on the vertical solutions business. As you think about potential investments, where may you have further interest to lean in where you aren't currently exposed?"", 'Cameron M. Bready', ""Yes, it's a good question. And we take a lot of care to be very deliberate in terms of where we think we want to own software assets versus where do we want to partner. We obviously have a fantastic integrated business. We have a great partnership model. That is a business that gives us, I think, a lot of opportunity to continue to benefit from embedded payments, integrated payments, put whatever term you want to around it. So obviously, that is a focus of our growth as well as in certain vertical markets wanting to own software assets because we think we can drive better payment monetization, we think we can drive better growth and better differentiation in our solutions by owning software. So we tend to target verticals, as we've said, for a long period of time that are large addressable spend markets. There needs to be a strong nexus with payments. Obviously, we're not in the business of owning software just to own software. We want to own software in vertical markets where there's strong consumer spend and a good opportunity to monetize payment flows coming out of that. The third thing I would say is we want to invest in software businesses where we can leverage our investment across the broader Global Payments. A big focus for us is finding ways to amplify the impact of the investments we're making. Whether it's in our more traditional payments businesses or in our vertical market software businesses, we want to be able to take investments that we're making in those businesses and find ways to amplify them across the broader Global Payments portfolio. And then lastly, as I talked about before, we're very focused on those vertical markets that have some international applicability. One of the things we've been successful in doing, and I highlighted some of this in my script today, is taking our software solutions to markets outside of the U.S., U.K., Canada, Australia, et cetera, and using those, obviously, as a means by which to drive growth and differentiation in markets outside the U.S. that we serve today. So that's another important element as we think about vertical expansion. So without getting into specific verticals, that's how we think about the world. But it's a pretty consistent mindset, I would say, that we've had over a long period of time as we thought about investing in software."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey with Truist Securities.', 'Andrew William Jeffrey', 'Cameron, I love the build up to the growth rates in Merchant and the focus on software and technology broadly. Can you talk a little bit about, again, the macro aside, maybe a couple of levers that might accelerate Merchant organic revenue growth? Or longer term, and again, I want to stay away from the cycle guide, but just theoretically, conceptually, is there the capacity to accelerate top line and how do you do it? And how much of a sense of urgency is it versus just compounding what is a very nice rate today? Just trying to think about that longer term.', 'Cameron M. Bready', ""Yes, Andrew, it's good questions. I would say, certainly, I think there are opportunities over time to be able to drive that higher -- slightly higher. I mean I would just sort of balance that against the fact that our Merchant revenue today is north -- well north of $7 billion. So you're moving a big number when we're talking about growth rates in the range that we're talking about. But the areas where I'm sort of bullish and I think there are probably prospects to drive better rates over time is really around point-of-sale software. We're making meaningful investments in that area. We spent a lot of time on our Q3 call talking about our overall point-of-sale strategy, how we think about the different assets that we own today, where we're trying to leverage those across our wholesale business, across our direct business, across our international markets, across enterprise QSR and stadium and event venues, et cetera. So as we're rolling out our next generation of capabilities in 2024 and we think about bringing POS solutions to markets outside of the U.S. over time, as I touched on, I'm pretty -- I do have high expectations for what we're able to do with that point-of-sale business and growing and scaling it over the next several years. So I certainly think that is a lever that we want to lean on and try to drive, obviously continued strong rates of growth in that channel that can obviously augment the overall rate of growth for the business. And I'd say the second thing is really the international markets, as I highlighted. I do think those markets just as a competitive dynamic perspective are less intense than the U.S. market. I think we have great market positions, we have great partners. And we're bringing more and more product and capability to those markets that I think can drive more differentiation, and therefore, lead to better rates of growth for the business over time. So certainly, that's another area in the business where I continue to see good opportunities for us to grow and scale. And then third, obviously, the more embedded payment trends that sort of become tailwinds for the business, the more omnichannel continues to drive meaningful growth, I would say, in the business overall, I think we're poised to take advantage of those trends over a longer period of time. And obviously, I think those support clearly the rates of growth that we have in the business and hopefully would provide some tailwind to that over time."", 'Andrew William Jeffrey', ""Okay. I appreciate that. That's helpful. And just a quick one as a follow-up. It looks like yields within the Issuer business have been pretty stable. Can you just comment on renewal terms? You called out a couple of big customer renewals. I just wonder if pricing is stable or what the trends are there?"", 'Cameron M. Bready', ""Yes, it's a good question. And obviously, not surprisingly, we don't get into specific conversations around pricing for any particular customer. I would say a couple of things. One is we're obviously delighted to renew 2 flagship customers, as I called out in my prepared remarks. Those are customers that have been with us for a very long period of time, we have very strong relationships with. And obviously, getting those renewals done, I think, was important. It's also reflected in the guide for the business. So as you can see, obviously, we're able to manage those in the context of still growing the Issuer businesses kind of at our targeted rate of growth heading into 2024. I would say more broadly, as we continue to invest in modernization, we continue to invest in more enablement capability for our clients and building out more cloud native solutions and more microservices that allow our clients to be able to consume capabilities more easily, I think that's going to open up new channels and new avenues for growth for that business, which we think long term obviously helps to drive better growth prospects for the Issuer Solutions business. So we've made a substantial amount of progress on our modernization efforts. We talked about what's in plan for 2024 as we're running a number of pilots across the business, different geographies, products and services and bundles that we sell into the market that obviously positions us to begin to start commercializing those solutions in the near term. So we're pleased with how that progress -- how that project is progressing. And we're pleased with how we've positioned that business, I think, to obviously sustain kind of current rates of growth. But obviously, the goal and the objective is to be able to accelerate those rates of growth over time by opening new markets and opening up new revenue channels for the Issuer business. And with that, I'd like to thank everyone for joining our call this morning. We appreciate your interest in Global Payments and all of your support. And I wish everyone a Happy Valentine's Day. Have a great day."", 'Operator', ""Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.""]"

estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. However, since real estate values historically have risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors deem presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. For that reason, the Company considers Nareit FFO and Normalized FFO to be appropriate supplemental measures of operating performance of an equity REIT. The Company believes that the presentation of FFO, combined with the presentation of required GAAP financial measures, has improved the understanding of operating results of REITs among the investing public and has helped make comparisons of REIT operating results more meaningful. Management generally considers Nareit FFO to be a useful measure for understanding and comparing our operating results because, by excluding gains and losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets, impairment losses on depreciable real estate and real estate asset depreciation and amortization (which can differ across owners of similar assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), Nareit FFO can help investors compare the operating performance of a company’s real estate across reporting periods and to the operating performance of other companies. The Company believes that Normalized FFO is useful because it allows investors, analysts and Company management to compare the Company’s operating performance to the operating performance of other real estate companies across periods on a consistent basis without having to account for differences caused by non-recurring items and other non-operational events such as transactions and litigation. In some cases, the Company provides information about identified non-cash components of Nareit FFO and Normalized FFO because it allows investors, analysts and Company management to assess the impact of those items on the Company’s financial results.', 'Nareit Funds from Operations Attributable to Common Stockholders (""Nareit FFO"")', 'The Company uses the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (""Nareit"") definition of FFO. Nareit defines FFO as net income attributable to common stockholders (computed in accordance with GAAP) excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real estate property, including gain (or loss) on re-measurement of equity method investments and impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated entities and noncontrolling interests. Adjustments for unconsolidated entities and noncontrolling interests will be calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis.', 'Normalized FFO', 'The Company defines Normalized FFO as Nareit FFO excluding the following income and expense items, without duplication: (a) transaction, transition and restructuring costs, including transaction, integration and restructuring-related costs and expenses, and amortization of intangibles, in each case net of noncontrolling interests’ share of these items and including Ventas’ share of these items from unconsolidated entities; (b) the impact of expenses related to asset impairment and valuation allowances, the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees or additional costs, expenses, discounts, make-whole payments, penalties or premiums incurred as a result of early retirement or payment of the Company’s debt; (c) the non-cash effect of income tax benefits or expenses, the non-cash impact of changes to the Company’s executive equity compensation plan, derivative transactions that have non-cash mark-to-market impacts on the Company’s income statement and non-cash charges related to leases; (d) the financial impact of contingent consideration; (e) gains and losses for non-operational foreign currency hedge agreements and changes in the fair value of financial instruments; (f) gains and losses on non-real estate dispositions and other items related to unconsolidated entities and noncontrolling interests; (g) net expenses or recoveries related to materially disruptive events; and (h) other items set forth in the Normalized FFO reconciliation included herein.', 'Nareit FFO and Normalized FFO presented herein may not be comparable to those presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definitions.

With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Peter Zaffino."", 'Peter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO', ""Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to review our fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial results. Following my remarks, Sabra will provide more detail on the quarter and some perspective on the year, and then we'll take questions. Kevin Hogan and David McElroy will join us for the Q&A portion of the call. We had a very strong fourth quarter, which highlighted a significant year of achievements at AIG. Throughout 2023, we continue to build on our underwriting excellence; repositioned the portfolio through several divestitures; made meaningful progress towards the deconsolidation of Corebridge, including 3 secondary sell-downs; delivered disciplined premium growth in businesses where we have scale and outstanding combined ratios; and continue to execute on our balanced capital management strategy. I'm very proud of the work our colleagues delivered for all of our stakeholders throughout the entire year. In the fourth quarter, adjusted after-tax income per diluted common share was $1.79, an increase of 29% year-over-year driven by continued strong underwriting results, 17% growth in net investment income and excellent execution of our balanced capital management strategy that resulted in a 6% reduction in diluted common shares outstanding. For the full year 2023, adjusted after-tax income per diluted common share was $6.79, an increase of 33% over 2022. AIG overall produced an adjusted return on common equity of 9% for the year, up from 7% in 2022. As I will share with you today, 2023 was an extraordinary year for AIG. During my remarks this morning, I'll discuss the following topics. First, I will provide an overview of our fourth quarter financial results. Second, I will review AIG's significant accomplishments in 2023, including our strategic repositioning and our financial highlights. Sabra will comment on the Life Retirement business in her prepared remarks. Third, I will cover insights on the January 1 reinsurance market and specifically AIG's reinsurance renewals. And finally, I'll share some thoughts on how we're building on our momentum and positioning the company as we enter 2024, including some specifics on AIG Next, our initiative focused on creating the AIG of the future. I will also discuss our capital management strategy and growth expectations. AIG's strong fourth quarter results demonstrated our continued execution across all aspects of our strategy. Within General Insurance, underwriting income was $642 million. Gross premiums written for the fourth quarter were $7.6 billion, an increase of 4% from the prior year quarter. Net premiums written for the quarter increased by 7% from the prior year quarter to $5.7 billion. Global Commercial grew 5%, and Global Personal grew 9% from the prior year quarter. If you exclude Financial Lines, Global Commercial would have grown 11%. In North America Commercial, fourth quarter net premiums written grew 5% over the prior year quarter led by Retail Property, which grew 32%; Lexington, which grew 20%. These were offset by North America Financial Lines, which was lower by 13%. In International Commercial, fourth quarter net premiums written grew 6% over the prior year quarter as International Property grew 28% and Talbot grew 12%. These were offset by International Financial Lines, which was lower by 7%. In the fourth quarter, Global Commercial had very strong renewal retention of 86% in its in-force portfolio as well as very strong new business performance. North America Commercial produced new business of $503 million in the quarter, an increase of 21% year-over-year. The growth was led by Retail Casualty, Lexington and Retail Property. International Commercial produced new business of $467 million for the quarter, representing an increase of 14% year-over-year. This growth was led by Global Specialty and Talbot. Moving to rate. In North America Commercial, overall rate increased 4% in the fourth quarter with exposure adding 3 points, and the overall pricing was up 7%. In North America Commercial, if you include Financial Lines and workers' compensation, overall rate would have increased 11% in the quarter. And with exposure adding 4 points, overall pricing would have been 15%, meaningfully above the loss cost trend. North America Commercial rate increases were driven by Lexington wholesale, which was up 17%; Retail Property, which was up 19%; and Excess Casualty, which was up 13%. In International Commercial, overall rate increased 3% in the fourth quarter with exposure adding 2 points, and the overall pricing was up 5%, which is slightly below loss cost trend. The rate increase was driven by Property, which was up 12% and marine, which was up 8%. Turning to Personal Insurance. Fourth quarter net premiums written increased 9% from the prior year quarter, primarily driven by North America. In North America Personal, net premiums written increased 37% in the quarter. As we've seen in prior quarters in 2023, the significant premium growth for North America Personal was driven by our high net worth business. And as we discussed in prior quarters, the growth in North America earned premium continued to generate a lower expense ratio, and we expect the expense ratio will continue to improve in 2024. Now let me turn to the full year financial results. 2023 was another year of meaningful strategic repositioning and was, in many ways, our best year yet. The repositioning included the disposition of Validus Re and Crop Risk Services, which generated a combined $3.5 billion of proceeds, including a pre-close dividend. Additionally, we settled a $1 billion intercompany loan from Validus Re to AIG and received approximately $250 million of RenaissanceRe common stock. The changes to our portfolio further reduced volatility and allowed us to focus on businesses where we believe we have better opportunities for stronger risk-adjusted returns. We reshaped the reinsurance structure of our high net worth business and launched a newly formed MGA called Private Client Select. We made significant progress towards Corebridge's separation, another major strategic milestone on our journey to becoming a less complex company. We completed 3 secondary offerings in 2023 that generated approximately $2.9 billion in cash, we worked with Corebridge on the divestiture of Laya Healthcare and announced the sale of the U.K. Life business. In 2023, AIG received $1.4 billion of capital from Corebridge through $385 million of regular dividends, $688 million of special dividends and $315 million of share repurchases. At the end of 2023, our ownership stake in Corebridge was approximately 52%. In 2023, we continue to execute on a thoughtful and balanced capital management strategy. During the year, AIG returned $4 billion of capital to shareholders through $3 billion of share repurchases and $1 billion of dividends. We reduced our common shares outstanding by 6% and increased quarterly dividends by 12.5%. On August 1, the AIG Board of Directors increased our share buyback authorization of $7.5 billion. At the year-end 2023, we had $6.2 billion remaining on that authorization. We reduced AIG net debt by $1.4 billion in 2023 after successfully conducting a senior notes tender offer in November. We finished 2023 with very strong parent liquidity of $7.6 billion, which gives us ample capacity to continue executing on our capital management priorities. Turning to the full year results for General Insurance. Throughout 2023, we delivered terrific financial performance. General Insurance full year underwriting income was $2.3 billion, a 15% increase year-over-year. For the full year, the General Insurance accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, was 87.7%, an improvement of 100 basis points year-over-year. Global Commercial achieved an accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, of 83.3% for the full year, an improvement of 120 basis points year-over-year driven by loss ratio improvement. The calendar year combined ratio was 87.1%, a 250 basis point improvement year-over-year. Excluding Validus Re and Crop Risk Services for the full year results, the Global Commercial accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, would have increased by 50 basis points to 83.8%, and the calendar year combined ratio would have increased by slightly over 20 basis points to 87.3%. In Global Personal, the full year accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, was 99.3%, in line with the prior year. For the full year, General Insurance grew net premiums written by 7% year-over-year, driven by 5% growth in Global Commercial and 10% in Personal Insurance. North America Commercial grew 5% and International Commercial grew 6% year-over-year. A couple of highlights. Lexington and Global Specialty had outstanding years. We remain very focused on these businesses and made investments to accelerate growth and continue to deliver strong underwriting profitability. Lexington grew its net premiums written by 17% year-over-year. Growth was driven by historically high retention, which was 80%, $1 billion of new business and rate increases of approximately 18%. Global Specialty, which includes businesses in marine, energy, trade credit and aviation, grew its net premiums written 10% year-over-year driven by 88% retention, almost $750 million of new business and rate increases of 7% for the year. Also, there are 2 parts of our business that impacted growth in Global Commercial, which I would like to offer some perspective. First, if you exclude Financial Lines, our net premiums written growth would have been 10%. Second, as we've outlined on prior calls, we decided to not renew 2 programs that had significant property catastrophe exposure that no longer met our underwriting guidelines. We do not believe that the premium increases on a risk-adjusted basis for these 2 programs delivered an acceptable return. The decision to nonrenew impacted the gross and net premiums written for Lexington specifically as well as the Global Commercial business throughout 2023. If you exclude Financial Lines and these 2 programs that I just mentioned, our year-over-year net premiums written growth would have been 13%, which gives you a sense as to why we have significant confidence in our core portfolio where we saw meaningful overall growth for the year. It's worth providing a little bit more detail on Financial Lines. In Financial Lines, particularly in our public directors and officers book of business, we continue to exercise underwriting discipline by maintaining our primary position in our portfolio to being very prudent on large account excess layers, where there is significant exposure to vertical loss, and these layers are highly commoditized where typically the best price wins. We've spoken about the cumulative rate change in Financial Lines before, but I want to provide a little bit more detail. The compound annual growth rate for Financial Lines achieved from 2019 through 2023 was 49%. If you exclude 2023, the compound annual growth rate was 63%. It's a business we're very focused on and our underwriters are continuing to carefully monitor market conditions and underwrite conservatively. Now I'd like to provide you with some insight into the current reinsurance market generally and an overview of our January 1 reinsurance renewals. As I mentioned on previous calls, AIG's reinsurance purchasing is deliberately weighted to January 1, which enables us to strategically optimize the outcome across our reinsurance placements and provides us with clarity on our cost of reinsurance at the beginning of the year. Before I go into detail on this year's outcomes, I want to speak about how we evaluate our reinsurance purchased. We've seen significant changes in the global property market over the last 2 years, and analyzing and quantifying changes and the portfolio's risk profile has become increasingly complex. Currently, one of the most overused phrases that has been used with more frequency in the last year is risk-adjusted pricing or risk-adjusted rate changes, which have multiple interpretations, particularly when it comes to property treaty reinsurance. Calculating the risk-adjusted rate change can be complicated and is often inconsistent. I want to outline how AIG determines risk-adjusted pricing changes, which we believe is an industry-best practice. To begin, you must determine the baseline structure and all the variables required to assess and quantify the risk-adjusted pricing change. To do that, the base analysis should be set at the identical structure and coverage with the exact terms and conditions of the prior year structure. The analysis needs to compare the cost of capital year-over-year and any model changes from vendor model output such as RMS to determine if the loss costs have increased or decreased at the attachment point and the vertical limits deployed. Also, an analysis is needed for any changes to the coverage provided in the treaty placement. For instance, over the last few years, many programs have gone from an all-risk coverage basis to a named or peak peril basis.To correctly calculate the risk-adjusted rate change, perils no longer covered need to be analyzed and priced separately and the impact of any reduced coverage should be factored into the assessment of the price change. This can be particularly difficult when assessing perils that would not be economically viable to place on a standalone basis with significant limits, which could include wildfire, flood or terrorism. There needs to be consideration given to the volatility associated with the expected loss in calculating the risk-adjusted rate change. Given the complexity of these calculations, the methodologies applied should be done with consistency and discipline. When applying the methodology I just described, AIG had a tremendous outcome with our reinsurance partners at the January 1 renewal season, building upon the very strong result achieved in a very challenging market in 2023. Now let me turn to AIG's reinsurance renewals at January 1 of this year. To level set, the natural catastrophe insured loss activity remained at the forefront of the market with a record-setting 37 events in 2023 that exceed $1 billion of insured loss. These events contributed to a total annual insured loss currently estimated at over $100 billion, marking the sixth time in the past 7 years that insured loss from natural catastrophes has exceeded $100 billion. Over the last 7 years, there's been nearly $1 trillion of aggregate losses with over 60% driven by secondary perils. The headline is that we were able to significantly improve our property cat structure and reinsurance coverage provided. When you review what we purchased last year, including for Validus Re, the overall spend has reduced by approximately $200 million and our core property treaties, excluding Validus Re, have slightly lower ceded premium year-over-year. Let's start with our property catastrophe placements. Our core commercial North America retention of $500 million remained unchanged for the second straight year. The attachment on our dedicated Lexington occurrence tower was unchanged at $300 million. In both cases, the model [detachment] point is lower, and the exhaust limit is higher. Our International Property cat per current structures renewed with a reduced retention in Japan to $150 million, a $50 million improvement from the prior year. The rest of the world attachment remains unchanged at $125 million. We were very pleased to have achieved broader coverage across all of our core occurrence towers. With nominal attachment points unchanged, or in the case of Japan decreasing, the model probability of attaching our cat reinsurance improved with respect to key perils and across every major territory following the growth achieved in the property portfolio in 2023. Our property cat aggregate cover was also successfully renewed with improved coverage, further reducing our volatility from frequency of loss. The aggregate now includes a standalone supplement dedicated to losses in North America arising from secondary perils. Importantly, it also now covers contributing losses from our high net worth portfolio. Our annual aggregate deductible for North America is $825 million. The North America other perils deductible is $350 million, which is a new deductible. And Japan and the rest of the world deductibles are $200 million and $175 million, respectively. These are subject to each and every loss deductibles of $20 million other than for North America wind and earthquake, which are at $50 million. Our return period attachment point is lower year-over-year. For all of our major proportional treaties across a range of classes, we improved or maintained our ceding commission levels, reflecting our market-leading underwriting expertise and position in the market. Turning to casualty. The challenges we've spoken about previously regarding the impact of inflation, both social and economic and litigation funding in the U.S. were a focal point for reinsurers at 1/1. For casualty at AIG, we remain very focused on our underwriting standards and the positioning of the portfolio. Our team has done a terrific job of reunderwriting the entire business, particularly considering the amount of work that was needed to reposition it to where it is today. Additionally, our pricing assumptions today have loss trends ranging from the high single digits to over 10%. These were increased over the past 2 years, given inflationary dynamics. I do want to make a few comments about the last 10 years of casualty results for the industry. The industry as a whole has reported meaningful reserve releases in 4 of the past 10 calendar years, including in calendar year 2017. At the same time, there have been 6 years of significant reported industry strengthening in the last 10 calendar years, including in all of the most recent 5 calendar years. Focusing on AIG, for accident years 2016 through 2019, our initial loss picks in our Casualty lines, excluding workers' compensation, averaged 78%. Looking specifically at accident years 2016 and '17, the initial loss picks were approximately 81% in both years. These loss picks exclude unallocated loss adjustment expense. We significantly strengthened the reserves by over $1 billion for accident years 2016 through 2019, which revised our year-end ultimate loss picks to 91% in 2016 and 96% in 2017 at an average of 87% over accident years 2016 through 2019. To further analyze our casualty results compared to industry results for other liability and commercial auto using the most recent Schedule P data, they are well above the average industry loss picks on both measures. Our initial and year-end ultimates for both lines are roughly 10 to 20 points higher than the overall industry average. In addition, we have reinsurance in place for 2016 and 2017 to mitigate our gross results. As we outlined last quarter, we put a comprehensive reinsurance treaty in place starting 2018 that provides us with substantial amount of vertical protection. Our renewal of the casualty reinsurance protections allowed us to maintain the same net retained lines with no impact on ceding commissions, which is an outstanding outcome. At January 1, our reinsurance partners maintained their significant support of AIG with consistent capacity and improved reinsurance terms that demonstrate a clear recognition of the quality of our portfolio and our underwriting teams. I'll now turn to discuss our efforts to create a future state business structure for AIG post deconsolidation of Corebridge. As part of this effort, we've launched a new program, AIG Next, to create a company that's leaner, less complex and more effective with the appropriate infrastructure and capabilities for the size of business we will be post deconsolidation. AIG Next will focus on the following key principles: driving global consistency and local relevancy across our end-to-end processes to improve operational efficiency and effectiveness, reducing organizational complexity to create a better and differentiated experience for our clients and colleagues, creating an agile and scalable organization to support business growth, optimizing our ecosystem to modernize our data analytics, digital and technology capabilities, clarifying roles' responsibilities while eliminating duplication and increasing our speed of execution. As we've stated in the past, we expect the simplification and efficiencies created through this program to generate $500 million of sustained annual run rate savings and to incur approximately $500 million of onetime spend to achieve these savings. As part of AIG Next, we are creating a leaner parent company with a target cost structure of 1% to 1.5% of net premiums earned. Some of the current costs and other operations will be eliminated contributing to the $500 million savings, and others will be moved into the business where the service is utilized. In 2023, we began this work, as we've moved approximately $140 million of expenses from other operations into General Insurance for services that are more closely aligned to our business operations. Even with this shift, the full year combined ratio of 90.6% improved 130 basis points year-over-year, and the full year GOE ratio only increased 40 basis points due to offsetting savings within General Insurance. Throughout the year, we've built efficiencies into our business, which have allowed general insurers to absorb these costs. We've already begun to make meaningful progress against our $500 million savings target and have established a team to drive and govern the AIG Next program with focus and discipline. Sabra and I will provide more detail on next quarter's call regarding the specific cost to achieve by category and the expected timeline for the realized benefits in 2024 and 2025. As we are approaching the final steps of the Corebridge deconsolidation, we remain agile and continue to explore all options based on market conditions with respect to our remaining ownership of Corebridge, always focusing on what's aligned with the best interest of our stakeholders. Sabra will take you through a pro forma capital structure based on assumptions about the deconsolidation. Throughout 2024, we expect to continue to execute the capital management strategy we've outlined before. Our insurance company subsidiaries continue to have excess capital to support the type of organic growth we have seen through 2023 and would expect to see in the future. We made enormous progress on our debt structure and maturities. Since year-end 2021, we've reduced over 50% of AIG's debt outstanding, which is over $11 billion of debt reduction. The primary focus in 2024 will be on returning capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Since the start of 2024, we have repurchased an additional $760 million of common shares. We expect to continue at this pace for the first half of 2024, subject to market conditions, which should bring us near the high end of our target share count range. Post Corebridge deconsolidation, we should achieve the low end of our range, which is approximately 600 million of common shares. The AIG Board increased the dividend in 2023, reflecting our confidence in the future earnings power of AIG, and we will continue to evaluate our dividend policy in 2024. And lastly, as I enter my seventh year at AIG, I've never been more optimistic about our opportunities for growth and the momentum that AIG has entering 2024. We now have a terrific business. Global Commercial, which we've been working on for years to reposition, is now one of the most respected portfolios in the industry. While there's always pruning to do in any business, the remediation is now behind us. We're well positioned to grow based on AIG's strong retention, strong opportunities for new business, excellent combined ratios and a company that has been able to distinguish itself amongst our clients and distribution partners. In Personal Insurance, we will continue to make investments, particularly in our Japan business, our global A&H business and our high net worth business where we anticipate continued growth and more importantly, profitability improvement. With that, I will turn the call over to Sabra."", 'Sabra Rose Purtill', ""Thank you, Peter. This morning, I will provide more detail on AIG's fourth quarter results. But first, as we are getting closer to Corebridge deconsolidation, I would like to start with an illustrative pro forma. With AIG's current ownership of Corebridge at 52%, the next transaction may likely result in deconsolidation. Today, Corebridge is consolidated in both AIG's balance sheet and income statement with offsets of noncontrolling interest for the portion that AIG does not own. You can see those adjustments in the financial supplement on Pages 8 and 11. When we deconsolidate, we will report Corebridge as an investment with dividends reported in net investment income and Corebridge shares included in parent investments. Corebridge's balance sheet and income statement will no longer be in our financials. If we were able to deconsolidate Corebridge now, accounting rules require us to fair value their assets and liabilities and recognize the net difference between that valuation and the current GAAP carrying value in AIG's equity. That process also includes some changes primarily driven by differences in basis and deconsolidation of variable investment entities. The example I will provide is a hypothetical pro forma view. Please remember that there are many factors, and each one impacts the output. This view builds on the remarks I provided last quarter about pro forma adjusted shareholders' equity. For simplicity, in this example, we used Corebridge's current stock price as a proxy for fair value. But the process is more complicated than that and is more dependent on interest rates than stock price as the investment portfolio has to be valued on the day of deconsolidation, which will change based on interest rates. As a very high-level illustration, as of year-end, the fair value of Corebridge's net assets and liabilities was about $2 billion higher than the book value on AIG's balance sheet. As a result, deconsolidation would have increased AIG's book value per share by almost $3 a share. However, for AIG's adjusted shareholders' equity, the fair value adjustment would have resulted in a reduction of about $4 billion or around $6 per AIG share, given Corebridge's stock price relative to its adjusted book value. Now let me link these items to the AIG year-end pro forma estimates that I provided last quarter of adjusted shareholders' equity of approximately $33 billion, adjusted for the sale of Validus Re, to be used in evaluating the ROCE target. At December 31, 2023, AIG's adjusted shareholders' equity was approximately $53 billion. With the pro forma fair value decrease of $4 billion at deconsolidation, adjusted shareholders' equity would be roughly $49 billion, including about $8 billion of value for our Corebridge shares. To get to the E, we subtract the value of Corebridge shares. And for the purposes of this exercise today, we also subtract year-end parent liquidity of almost $8 billion, most of which is to be used for 2024 capital management, interest and other parent expenses as Peter described. That results in pro forma adjusted shareholders' equity of about $33 billion invested in our business plus whatever liquidity is at the parent as the focus of our 10%-plus target. This example is illustrative based on year-end financials and subject to change based on markets and the actual path to deconsolidation, but I hope it is helpful. Now I will turn to fourth quarter results. Fourth quarter consolidated net investment income on an APTI basis was $3.5 billion, up 17% over the fourth quarter of 2022. General Insurance net investment income was 38%, while Life and Retirement was up 15%. Higher new money reinvestment rates in both businesses drove the improvement. Fourth quarter new money rates on fixed maturities and loans averaged 6.5%, about 180 basis points higher than the yield on sales and maturities in the quarter. Fourth quarter new money rates were 160 basis points higher in GI and 190 basis points higher in L&R. With higher reinvestment rates, the yield on General Insurance fixed maturities and loans, excluding calls and prepayments, rose to an annualized yield of 3.8% in the quarter, up from 3.0% in 4Q '22 and up 9 basis points sequentially. L&R's fourth quarter portfolio yield was 5.0% compared to 4.4% in 4Q '22 and up 10 basis points sequentially. In the first half of 2024, we currently expect continued yield pickup on fixed maturities over the prior year but less improvement sequentially, given the cessation of Fed interest rate hikes and the current shape of the yield curve. In contrast, alternative investment returns were weak this year, coming in slightly negative in the fourth quarter and at only 2.4% for the full year. GI alternative income was $41 million in the fourth quarter, down 11% from the prior year quarter for an annualized return of 3.9%. L&R's alternative portfolio generated a loss of $24 million in the quarter for an annualized yield of negative 1.8% compared to income of $16 million last year. Turning to General Insurance. As Peter said, our underwriting results remain very strong. The 4Q '23 calendar year combined ratio was 89.1%, 80 basis points better than the fourth quarter of 2022. And the accident year combined ratio ex cats was 87.9%, 50 basis points better. Global Commercial Lines delivered outstanding fourth quarter results with a calendar year combined ratio of 85.4%, a 90 basis point improvement over the prior year. The accident year combined ratio ex cats was 82.4%, a 170 basis point improvement reflecting exceptional underwriting profitability in both North America and International. The fourth quarter included only 1 month of Validus Re due to the timing of the divestiture. Excluding Validus Re from fourth quarter results, the pro forma Global Commercial Lines calendar year combined ratio would have been 85.1%, 30 basis points lower than reported. The accident year combined ratio ex cats would have been 82.5%, only 10 basis points higher. The fourth quarter calendar year combined ratio for Global Personal Insurance was 98.8%, 90 basis points better than 4Q '22. The accident year combined ratio ex cats was 101.8%, 140 basis points higher driven by the repositioning of the high net worth business, which made significant progress in 2023. Fourth quarter underwriting income for GI was $642 million, up slightly from $635 million in 4Q '22 as improved accident year results, including catastrophe losses, were offset by lower favorable prior year development, net of reinsurance and prior year premiums. Catastrophe losses totaled $126 million in the quarter, down from $235 million last year. The largest event was Hurricane Otis in Mexico. For the fourth quarter and the year, catastrophe losses, excluding Validus Re, would have been $111 million and $937 million, respectively. Favorable prior year development totaled $69 million in the fourth quarter compared to $151 million in 4Q '22. Including the impact of prior year premiums, the total impact of prior year loss reserve development was favorable by $37 million compared to favorable development of $150 million in 4Q '22. Fourth quarter net favorable development this quarter includes $41 million of ADC gain amortization and $28 million of net favorable development from annual DVRs and other reserve reviews, particularly prior year catastrophes. The $28 million included $75 million in additional reserves for Russia-Ukraine related claims, offset by net favorable development on shorter tail lines and older catastrophes. Turning to L&R. Fourth quarter results were solid, especially considering the continued headwinds from alternative investment returns. Fourth quarter APTI was $957 million, up 12% over the prior year driven by base spread expansion, strong sales and growth in assets under management and administration. Base net investment spreads in Individual and Group Retirement together widened 23 basis points in the quarter. Fourth quarter premiums and deposits were $10.6 billion, up 20% from 4Q '22. For the fourth quarter, Corebridge's earnings included in AIG adjusted after-tax income decreased by about 25% due to the reduction in AIG ownership from 78% last year to 52% as of year-end. For the full year, Corebridge earnings in our adjusted after-tax income declined 20%. Turning to other operations. Fourth quarter 2023 adjusted pretax loss improved by $52 million from 4Q '22 due to a $72 million reduction in AIG general operating expenses. Total other operations GOE was $242 million for the quarter, including $61 million for Corebridge. On a consolidated basis, AIG's fourth quarter adjusted after-tax income rose 21% to $1.3 billion driven by 19% growth in General Insurance APTI. The annualized adjusted return on common equity was 9.4% for the quarter, almost 2 points higher than the fourth quarter of 2022. Moving to the balance sheet. Book value per common share ended the year at $65.14, up 18% from year-end 2022 and up 16% from September 30, primarily due to the impact of lower interest rates. Adjusted book value per share was $76.65 at year-end, up 1% from year-end 2022 and down 2% for September 30, reflecting the net impact of income, dividends, share repurchases and Corebridge secondary sales. At December 31, AIG's consolidated debt and preferred stock to total capital, excluding AOCI, was 24.3%, down 1.3 points from year-end 2022. With first quarter 2024 debt reduction, leverage is likely to be at the low end of our 20% to 25% range upon deconsolidation. As Peter noted, we made substantial progress towards our 10%-plus ROCE goal this year. 2023 full year adjusted ROCE for AIG was 9.0% compared to 7.1% in 2022 and was 12.5% in General Insurance and 11.5% in L&R. The actions to reach 10% or greater will be driven by the 4 levers we have discussed before, including AIG Next. We are confident in our ability to achieve this goal, subject to market conditions and look forward to updating you on our progress. With that, I will turn the call back over to Peter."", 'Peter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO', ""Thank you, Sabra. Michelle, we're ready for questions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Michael Zaremski with BMO Capital Markets.', 'Michael David Zaremski', ""Maybe first on the expense ratio. I appreciate the color, Peter, you gave us on the continued improvement. Anything -- looks like this quarter, specifically, though, it took -- it was a bit higher than expected. Anything we should be thinking about? Or I don't know, if it's profit share, given the excellent loss ratio or just anything, any noise in there or seasonality?"", 'Peter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO', ""Thanks, Mike. We outlined in my script that the business has been taking a lot of additional costs. Think about cyber and usage on the cloud. And so that might have been held centrally in the past. That has now been put into the business. And so you see that they're absorbing most of it, but there is some timing on that. Also in Personal Insurance, there is a lot of noise in the quarter. There's some onetime true-up adjustments. There's also some profit sharing, as you mentioned, in some of our Personal Insurance businesses. And so -- and there was also some catch-up on some of the reinsurance on earned premium. So I'm not concerned at all about the uptick in expenses. It was very nominal. When I look at what the business has actually absorbed in terms of increased costs year-over-year, they've really built capacity to be able to invest in the future. And the fourth quarter reflected that, but there was a little bit of noise as well, particularly on the Personal Insurance side."", 'Michael David Zaremski', ""Okay. Great. And then my final follow-up is on the -- specifically on the accident year loss ratio. You've -- the Validus is property-centric, and it's going to be kind of fully out of the numbers next quarter. You talked about nonrenewing some property throughout the year. And I understand Financial Lines has got a lot of pricing, but Financial Lines pricing isn't great trailing 12-month basis. So just on the underlying loss ratio, given just all the dynamics, should we be thinking about any material changes to the underlying loss ratio as the year progresses, given the moving parts?"", 'Peter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO', ""I don't think so. I think the accident year loss ratio that we finished the year is what I would expect in 2024. Like you said, there's always a mix of business changes. There's always a little bit of noise. There could be some shift in composition. As you mentioned, property, we think we have tremendous opportunities there based on having 5 or 6 entry points across the world in terms of getting the best risk-adjusted returns. When I look at what we've done in property over the last 5 years, we've gone from combined ratios in North America that are well north of 130 combined into the 70s and 80s now. So I think we have a really good platform. We're able to scale up businesses when we see opportunities. But I would think absent big mix of business changes, I would not expect any changes in the loss ratio. And I signaled on the call that the remediation is largely behind us. I mean, again, you're always going to be reunderwriting, but large programs or portions of the business in commercial, we really like what we have, and I think that there's real good opportunities for growth."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Meyer Shields with KBW.', 'Meyer Shields', 'Great. One quick question just to make sure I understand it. So you talked about pricing assumptions for casualty, assuming loss trends of either high single digits or low teens. Did that match the loss trends embedded in the reserves?', 'Peter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO', 'Sabra, do you want to talk about the reserves commensurate to the increase in premium and then -- sorry, an increase in rate change, particularly on excess?', 'Sabra Rose Purtill', ""Yes. So when we've -- and we've talked about it in the past, we've taken a proactive approach to try and to react quickly to bad news that we see in trends. And as you know, even back in 2017, we moved to increase the reserves on casualty lines. Our underlying assumptions for casualty loss trend is in the 10% range. It does vary between primary and excess. Our book historically has been a little bit more balanced towards excess, and that's why you can see some of the changes in the loss ratios accident year by accident year. I would note that we do our deeper dive on the casualty lines largely in the third quarter. There are some that are in the second quarter, and we did complete those reserves this year without any meaningful changes in the reserves."", 'Peter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO', ""So another observation, Meyer, on that is that the rates as we got to the back half of the year in Casualty, particularly in Excess Casualty, started to accelerate into double digits. And also not that this is a bellwether because there's different mix of business, but our casualty submissions in Lexington in the fourth quarter were up 100%, which just means it's getting harder to get casualty placements done in the admitted market. Pricing is going up driven by rate, terms of conditions are being tightened and there's more activity in E&S."", 'Meyer Shields', ""Okay. Fantastic. That's very helpful. Second question, I guess, maybe jumping off from that. I guess I'm a little surprised that there's still, if I understand correctly, the same level of proportional sessions on North American casualty despite the fact that overall profitability has gotten so much better and higher interest rates. And I was hoping you could take us through your thinking on that."", 'Peter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO', ""Sure. Look, our casualty placements have evolved over time to reflect the portfolio, the gross limit deployment. And if I could take you back to even 2016 and '17 where we had quota shares before we arrived where we had a 50% quota share on Primary Casualty and then we had a 37.5% placement on Excess Casualty. That's just continued to evolve as we got into 2018, where we bought a large excess of loss placements for our worldwide Casualty portfolio for 75 ex of 25. And then at the end of 2018, we bought a 50% quota share for our casualty portfolio within the United States. And the reason why I just give you that as a baseline is we've changed, evolved. We've had reinsurance in place since 2016. But when you look at what we place on the quota share today, it's basically 20%. So we've taken that down while we've improved ceding commissions over 800 basis points from the original placement to 20% from north of 50. So I think we have been recognizing that we don't need to do as much proportional. But there's a balance in those placements between the excess and the quota share partnerships with reinsurers. They like a balance between the excess of loss and quota share in terms of our underwriting and feel very comfortable that, that's a good amount to cede off for looking at our overall casualty portfolio."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.', 'Elyse Beth Greenspan', ""My first question was on the equity that you laid out, Sabra. So $33 billion pro forma adjusted equity. And then I believe you said parent liquidity would come on top of that. So can you just give us a sense of once you're through deconsolidation, what type of liquidity you would like to have in parent? Because I'm assuming it would be $33 billion plus the parent liquidity would be the equity that we should consider in reference to the double-digit plus ROCE target."", 'Peter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO', ""Thanks, Elyse. I'll turn it over to Sabra in 2 seconds. But I just want to caution us that we tried to outline what we expect shareholders' equity with a variety of different variables, but it was all pro forma. So I think Sabra can answer the question sort of technically as to how we should be looking about our capital relative to how we get to the 10% ROCE. But I just don't want to go into too many more variables because that was a pro forma that had a lot of assumptions. Sabra?"", 'Sabra Rose Purtill', ""Yes, certainly. Look, we have a framework around our liquidity position. And clearly, given the timing of the Corebridge secondaries and the Validus sale in the fourth quarter, parent liquidity was at very attractive and high levels at year-end. The way we think of it in a normal framework is we look at what our forward holding company needs are. So think about common dividend payments of roughly $1 billion a year. AIG-only interest expense, roughly $500 million a year. And then parent expenses, which as we've talked about, we're focused on getting those down to 1% to 1.5% of NPE range. So that's what we think about in terms of a normal liquidity position, which is lower, obviously, than where we ended the year."", 'Elyse Beth Greenspan', ""And then my second question, appreciate all the color on the call on premium growth, right, I think it was around 9% in the quarter kind of ex Validus and Crop. And so as we think about the moving pieces and just your view of price, loss trend, et cetera, would you expect top line growth kind of on an adjusted basis to be within that range in '24? Are there other things that we should consider?"", 'Peter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO', ""Well, when you take out -- again, there's a lot of moving pieces, but like you take out Validus, Crop Risk Services, and so we have a baseline. And then when we look at our commercial portfolio -- I look at the fundamentals, Elyse, in terms of how are we growing the business. And we gave you highlights in the fourth quarter about our new business, which was simply terrific, and that momentum continues. Our retentions have been fantastic. And so again, it's a portfolio that we have done such a great job to get to a place where we really like and find opportunities for stability and more growth. Agree on the rate. I mean, again, the fourth quarter was just a moment, but we would expect Financial Lines in 2024 not to keep up at the same pace on excess. We'll see as we get into the market, but really like the opportunities in our core businesses to drive growth. Lexington, I know there's been a lot of discussion in this quarter around is excess and surplus lines slowing down, things going back to the admitted. There's no evidence to suggest that's true. Again, submission count is significantly up. And it's not just property. Property, if I looked at the fourth quarter, was the lowest submission count growth, and that was up over 30%. As I said, property's around 30%, casualty was up over 100%, and health care was around 50%. So there's a lot more opportunity to continue to grow in excess and surplus lines. And you know what, the property market, you get to the second quarter and there is your opportunity. So like we have built a reinsurance structure. We've built a gross portfolio that we can flex depending on market conditions. I mentioned Global Specialty. We think there's growth opportunities there. We think there's growth opportunities in our Personal Insurance business. So we're cautious but optimistic that the growth rate that you outlined in the high single digits is going to be achieved. But again, we have to be in the year, and we'll give you updates every quarter, but we're optimistic."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Mike Ward with Citi.', 'Michael Augustus Ward', 'Maybe kind of a similar question, but specifically on International. I think rate is a little below loss cost. So I was just wondering if you have any commentary on how you see the top line growth there playing out.', 'Peter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO', ""Mike, thanks for the question. If I look at International on the rate side, just a reminder that we do rate on gross premium written, not net. And so like as you take that from the portfolio, there's a heavy weighting our Specialty business in the fourth quarter. And the Specialty business does have a lot of quota shares and has a terrific reinsurance partnership. But it's almost 50% of the business, roughly between 40 to 50 in the quarter. And so Specialty while had good rate increase in marine, political risk had a weighting on rate in the quarter as well as Financial Lines. Financial Line is about 20% of the gross premium written in the quarter and having a negative that just weights the overall rate environment. But we had very strong rate in property. We had very good rate, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, of 8% in marine. And so yes, the overall index was at or perhaps slightly below loss cost trend, but it's not something we're concerned about. The other thing too, in Specialty, you should realize is that December 1 is when all aviation renews. And so that was low single digits, again, weighting on it. But it's mix of business, it's gross, and why I say gross is that when you take the gross to net for our Specialty business, it's basically 50% net premium written to gross. And so like we put that in the math in terms of our ceding commissions and profitability of the portfolio. But overall, we were pleased and think that there's opportunities to improve that in 2024."", 'Michael Augustus Ward', ""And then maybe just on the adverse PYD in Russia, Ukraine. Just is that related to aviation? And is that just accident year '22? Because I think there was some adverse in other -- '20 and '19."", 'Peter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO', 'Sabra, do you want to provide a little bit of update in terms of how we got to the adverse?', 'Sabra Rose Purtill', ""Sure. And I'll just start by overall. As I mentioned, we did have some favorable prior year development from older catastrophe years. So those were basically in years 2018 through 2020. If you look at the more recent accident years, as we indicated, we did put up $75 million of additional reserves related to Russia- and Ukraine-related claims. We've been evaluating our exposure for some time. And based on the analysis where we are at the end of the year, we felt it was appropriate to increase our reserves for the quarter. But I would also note that in the 2022 accident year, we did have some adverse development on winter storm Elliott, which was at the very tail end of the fourth quarter of 2022. And then in the older accident years, as I said in General, we netted to a favorable reserve development. But we did have some adverse development in the 2018 and 2019 accident years on some mergers and acquisitions-related exposures."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Brian Meredith with UBS.', 'Brian Robert Meredith', ""First question, I'm just curious, as we look at this, you're getting close to the 600 million kind of share count. As we think about that and the use of proceeds from Corebridge, are you willing to go kind of meaningfully below that? And if not, what is the other kind of potential uses of capital here that you're thinking about to mitigate dilution from selling down your remaining interest in Corebridge?"", 'Peter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO', ""Thank you, Brian. It's a good question. It's a little leading, but we had outlined the capital management strategy for the first 6 months, and that gets us below the [650 million] share count at a base assumption of a stock price around where we are now. And so there's a few variables that could accelerate that or slow it down depending on market conditions and share price. But we know we have the liquidity, and we just wanted to outline what we thought we would do within the first 6 months. The next is dependent upon when we do a secondary sell-down, which I would expect before the end of the second quarter another sell-down, which gives us more liquidity. And the primary focus is going to be on share repurchase and dividend payment and believe that we can then get by the end of the year down to the lower end of the range or the 600 million. Once we're closer to that, we feel like we've made enormous progress on all the elements of our capital management strategy. It has been very balanced and believe we would have to give guidance after that in terms of what we intend to do. But I kind of want to get to the range first, in the 600 million to 650 million, and then get to the lower end of the range with proceeds, and then we would provide additional guidance."", 'Brian Robert Meredith', ""Great. That's helpful. And then, Peter, I just want to chat briefly on the Financial Lines business. And it seems like everybody is cutting Financial Lines. I'm just kind of wondering like who is actually running the business? And do we think we're getting closer to a bottom here? And do you think that's still a significant headwind to 2024 premium growth?"", 'Peter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO', ""Thank you, Brian, for the question. And I've been trying to find a way to bring in McElroy to close it out. So Dave, why don't you give Brian some insight, and then we'll send it back to me, and we'll finish up."", 'David Hughes McElroy', ""Thank you, Brian, and thank you, Peter. The -- yes, honestly, Brian, you see the weighting of the Financial Lines in our portfolio. It's a bit of an outside influence. But we've also gone through the year, and I think we trade the market we're in, not the market we hope for. So the -- I think we've been prudent around letting excess underpriced business go. I think we've been good about holding on to our primary business. So I think that actually really has held up well. I'd also think that it's always worth understanding there's a lot of other products in the portfolio. And they've held up well, whether that's private company business or professional indemnity or the fidelity businesses. Those are strong, and we actually anticipate those will continue to hold up in '24, okay?The seminal event is 2023 showed up with different securities class action experience than the '20 to '22 cohort here. It actually looks more like '16 to '19. The question will be whether the industry reacts to that, okay? Much more severity flowing through that year. It obviously exposes the verticality of loss. I do think it's put a little bit of a floor on the market going into 2024. We're seeing that. We're seeing that now. There's definitely going to be more control in primary, but I'm not going to be -- we won't sit on the front cover of CNBC -- or sitting in the middle of CNBC, but we like the business. We like the pricing of the business. And we also think that it's tethered to the economy. As that shows up, that will also help with new business opportunities that we see both in M&A, both in IPOs and both in structured. So it is the first time in 3 years that I might give it a little bit of optimism. Peter?"", 'Peter Zaffino;Chairman and CEO', ""Thanks, Dave. Thank you very much, and thanks, Brian. Thank you, everyone, for coming to the earnings call today and greatly appreciate the engagement. And I want to thank all of our colleagues around the world for all they've done to progress the strategic progress that we've made and just have delivered tremendous results. So everybody, have a great day, and thank you."", 'Operator', ""Thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program, and you may now disconnect.

Auto insurance premiums are primarily rising due to the inflating cost of labor and car parts supported by the general expansion of car prices over the past few years. According to the report, auto insurance policies may not see an unexpected surge over the next 12 months. The report highlights that auto insurance prices have rarely contributed to the rise in inflation in the past. On the contrary, auto insurance prices were responsible for 15% of headline price increases in the fourth quarter of 2023.

That's reflective of a streaming market that's increasingly crowded with both streaming-only players such as Netflix, Amazon, and Apple, as well as legacy-owned services like Hulu, Disney+, ESPN+, Peacock, Paramount+, Max, and Discovery+."", ""It's understandable why audiences feel frustrated with the large number of platforms. It makes it hard to find something to watch, and it means you need to pay for several services if you want to be able to watch popular content, such as the latest hit show, or something like Thursday Night Football, which is exclusively on Prime Video."", ""The survey also found that viewers are less interested in adding new streaming services, though they're still adding more than they're getting rid of right now. Forty-six percent of respondents said they were subscribed to more streaming services than they were a year earlier, while 37% said they were subscribed to fewer. That was a substantial increase from just 13% who said they had fewer streaming services from the year before in 2022."", ""The biggest complaint respondents had was that they wanted their shows on one platform. That was followed by its being too hard to keep track of which streaming service had the content they wanted, and that it's getting too expensive to pay for the content they want."", 'After its fourth-quarter earnings report, Netflix looks as strong as it ever has. The company added 13.1 million subscribers in the fourth quarter, a record for that quarter. Results topped estimates, and it raised its operating margin forecast for 2024.', ""However, the survey, which includes only the U.S., indicates that streaming customers are growing less willing to add new services, meaning that there may be a ceiling on Netflix's subscriber growth, or that the streaming sector may be entering a zero-sum game, where one service's gains come at the expense of another."", ""While Netflix looks as if it could easily outperform the market from here, there's another streaming stock with more upside potential: Roku (NASDAQ: ROKU). Roku is the leading streaming distribution platform in the U.S., with more than 75 million active accounts, and it helps solve the biggest complaints of the respondents, since Roku is designed to make it easy to stream the shows you want to watch."", ""For example, Roku offers a global search so that users can search for content across multiple services, solving the biggest complaints from the survey. Roku's platform makes it feel as if all of the content is on one platform, and it makes it easier to keep track of which shows are on which service."", ""Similarly, if audiences are showing fatigue from adding more streaming services, investors are likely to find more opportunities in Roku, which makes streaming easier and has a business model that should benefit from increased viewing time but doesn't require additional subscriptions. Roku also looks poised to capitalize on the boom in ad-based streaming, as it typically takes 30% of advertising inventory from its streaming partners."", 'Finally, Roku appears to have significantly more upside potential than Netflix or the other streaming services as the company seems in the middle of inflection into profitability after several rounds of layoffs and a recovery in advertising demand.

Coyote (a pair of cartoon characters)."", 'So how did the next couple of years work out for Roku in this challenging market?', 'Well, the stock price is down more than 40% from the eve of that fourth-quarter update. But trailing revenues are up by 22%, Roku sported 76 million active accounts in the latest earnings report, and the streaming hours just keep rising. As it turns out, Roku can generate healthy viewership growth even while many of its content suppliers are struggling individually.', 'The inflation-flavored lean years may be behind the media market at this point. Netflix posted double-digit percentage growth in subscriber counts for the last two quarterly reports. Disney expects to restart its stalled subscriber growth in the spring and report streaming profits in fiscal year 2024. Both stocks soared on their recent earnings reports, setting the stage for a strong Roku update, too.', 'Beyond that potential jump, Roku should be off to new growth adventures, driven by healthier financials. Armed with robust cash flows and rekindled growth prospects, the company is ready to push harder on its international expansion ambition. On top of that bullish trend, the digital advertising market is coming back to life.', ""Assuming the world economy doesn't run into another crippling crisis along the way (famous last words, I know), I expect Roku's user count to cross 100 million names over the next three years. I don't expect a towering pile of profits, since the company should remain in a high-octane growth mode for the foreseeable future. Instead, Roku will probably make heavy investments in original Roku TV content, marketing its international products and services, and the short-term research and development budgets will create long-term business drivers."", ""Roku's growth story is far from over; it's merely entering an exciting new chapter. Investors considering Roku stock right now should weigh the company's growth prospects against the backdrop of a brutally competitive streaming market -- where this company can be a winner no matter which streaming service walks away with the most subscribers, viewing hours, or profits. The platform people use to interact with their favorite streaming services remains the same, and no one can hold a candle to Roku's dominant market share in this space."", ""As Roku navigates the complexities of the digital landscape, its stock trades at a modest 4 times trailing sales. Streaming is the indisputable future of entertainment, and Roku plays a leading role in this digital revolution. If you pick up a few Roku shares this week, you'll probably want to thank me for the tip in 2027."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Roku right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Roku, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Roku wasn’t one of them.

With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE)."", 'ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.', ' View our latest analysis for NextEra Energy ', 'Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for NextEra Energy is:', '11% = US$6.3b ÷ US$59b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).', ""The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.11 in profit."", 'One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, NextEra Energy has a better ROE than the average (8.8%) in the Electric Utilities industry.', ""That is a good sign. With that said, a high ROE doesn't always indicate high profitability. Especially when a firm uses high levels of debt to finance its debt which may boost its ROE but the high leverage puts the company at risk. To know the 3 risks we have identified for NextEra Energy visit our risks dashboard for free."", ""Virtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same."", ""NextEra Energy clearly uses a high amount of debt to boost returns, as it has a debt to equity ratio of 1.24. With a fairly low ROE, and significant use of debt, it's hard to get excited about this business at the moment. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time."", ""Return on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE."", ""Having said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward. So you might want to take a peek at this data-rich interactive graph of forecasts for the company."", 'Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

And yet it's not your typical dividend-paying utility given that dividend growth has averaged a heady 10% per year over the past decade."", 'If you are a growth and income investor, NextEra Energy should be on your radar screen now. Here are two key reasons why.', ""The big reason to be attracted to NextEra Energy right now is its dividend yield, which is 3.2%. For income-focused investors, that will probably sound a bit low, because the average utility -- using Vanguard Utility ETF (NYSEMKT: VPU) as a proxy -- is offering up 3.6%. But most utilities don't grow their dividend by 10% per year; about half that figure is usually considered a solid number in the sector."", ""The more important fact to note here is that NextEra's 3.2% dividend yield is near its highest levels over the past decade. In other words, the stock looks historically cheap right now. To be fair, the utility sector is out of favor thanks to rising interest rates. The industry is capital-intensive and debt plays an important role in financing capital spending needs. Higher rates are a cost headwind. Most utilities will probably be cheaper than they have been in a long time. But given the rapid dividend growth NextEra Energy has offered, and the fact that management expects that growth to continue in 2024, a historically high yield is very attractive."", 'There is a nuance here that sets NextEra Energy apart from its peers. While it is one of the biggest utilities in the United States, operating largely in Florida via Florida Power & Light, it is also the largest producer of solar and wind power in the world.

If you are not interested in learning about the US meat industry, head straight to the 5 Most Meat Eating States Per Capita.', 'In the United States, dietary habits vary significantly from state to state, and one intriguing aspect is meat consumption. Some states like Texas, Nebraska, Oklahoma, and Missouri, among others, stand out for their per capita meat consumption, reflecting cultural preferences, agricultural traditions, and economic factors. Understanding meat consumption patterns across different states provides valuable insights into regional food cultures and their impact on health, the environment, and the economy.', 'The worldwide meat industry is experiencing significant growth, with market value expected to surge from $897.5 billion in 2021 to over\xa0$1.3 trillion by 2027. In the United States alone, projections indicate a 4.39% growth from 2024 to 2028, resulting in a market volume of $157.10 billion in 2028. Notably, multinational giants like Tyson Foods, Inc. (NYSE:TSN), Cargill, Inc., and Smithfield Foods, Inc. are actively pursuing new product developments, mergers, and acquisitions to solidify their positions in the market.\xa0', ""Despite this growth, there's a subtle shift in consumption patterns within the U.S. Meat consumption, a significant dietary component, has fluctuated. While the average U.S. resident consumes 224.6\xa0pounds of meat annually, indicating a historical rise compared to 1970, recent years have witnessed a slight decline in meat sales. Overall meat sales by volume in U.S. groceries have dipped by\xa04%\xa0year-over-year and 6% over the past two years, signaling changing consumer behaviors.\xa0"", ""When examining per capita meat consumption in the U.S., it's evident that beef holds a prominent position, with the average person consuming 82 pounds annually, well above the global average of 19.8 pounds per year. However, this decline in meat consumption has spurred a wave of disruptions in the industry, prompting the emergence of alternative products.\xa0"", ""The meat market in the USA is experiencing significant shifts in consumer preferences, influencing market trends and consumption patterns. According to the Power of Meat study, consumers' focus on value, product quality, and animal welfare drives purchasing patterns. The study also highlights that higher prices and increased meals at home have led to a sales record for meat, with dollar sales reaching\xa0$81.8 billion\xa0in 2022, despite a 5.6% decline in volume compared to 2020. "", 'Additionally, the willingness to pay a premium for high-grade, grass-fed, and locally-grown meat products reflects the growing demand for differentiated and specialty meat products. Furthermore, there is a rising focus on organic and natural meat products and grass-fed and free-range options, indicating a shift towards more sustainable and environmentally friendly choices.\xa0', 'In the US beef market, consumer preferences drive remarkable growth, with an increasing demand for specific attributes such as grass-fed and organic beef, which has led to a significant shift in production practices, marketing strategies, and product offerings in the beef industry. The market is expected to achieve a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of\xa03.12%\xa0between 2022 and 2027, translating into a substantial increase in market size.\xa0', ""The Economic Research Service of the\xa0USDA\xa0emphasizes that changes in consumer preferences, relative prices, and available leisure time drive the allocation of meat budgets between beef, chicken, and pork. US consumers' substituting poultry meat for beef is the most significant change in meat consumption patterns over the past 30 years.\xa0"", 'Meanwhile, on a global scale, meat consumption has been steadily increasing, with certain countries showing rapid growth rates. Factors such as population growth, urbanization, and rising incomes in developing countries have contributed to this trend. While developed countries like Germany, the United States, and Japan rank among the top meat consumers, developing nations often have lower per capita consumption rates. As of\xa02023, 72% of the global meat industry revenue comes from fresh meat, 26.2% from processed meat, and 1.8% from meat substitutes. Companies like Hormel Foods Corporation, Beyond Meat, Inc., and The Kroger Co. are among the key players capitalizing on the expanding meat industry.\xa0', ""Tyson Foods, Inc.

With an annual income of $165 billion in 2022 and a workforce of 165,000 employees, Cargill Meat Solutions plays a significant role in the meat sector.\xa0', ""Quick service restaurants (QSRs) like McDonald's Corporation (NYSE: MCD) also wield substantial influence in the meat industry. McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) alone purchases 0.861 million tons of beef annually, serving billions of burgers worldwide through its 38,000 locations in Chicago, Illinois.\xa0"", 'Constantine Pankin/Shutterstock.com', 'In our methodology, we ranked the most meat-eating states by using total beef production as a proxy for meat consumption. This decision was based on the understanding that there is no readily available data specifically on meat consumption by state. Through a study, we found that midwestern states tend to consume the most meat in the US. Therefore, we utilized beef production by state as a reliable indicator of meat consumption levels. Our analysis revealed that midwestern states were among the top beef producers, further validating our chosen proxy measure. We then assigned scores to these states, defining the states with the highest consumption.\xa0', 'By the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds.

So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number."", 'For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Mosaic would post earnings of $0.80 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.68, delivering a surprise of -15%.', 'The company has not been able to beat consensus EPS estimates in any of the last four quarters.', 'Bottom Line', 'An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.', ""That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success.

Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported."", ""Mosaic doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate.

Boeing has a multiyear backlog in place and, despite its issues in recent years, remains a critical part of the commercial aerospace industry. Still, there's more to the sector than the first-line names, and I think a lesser-known company like Carpenter Technology\xa0(NYSE: CRS) is a better buy. Here's why."", 'Before discussing Carpenter, a few words on Boeing. The recent results were somewhat disappointing, with management postponing its 2024 guidance as it digests the aftermath of the latest manufacturing quality issue on Boeing airplanes. The latest issue, a structural failure on Alaska Airlines flight 1282,\xa0led CEO David Calhoun to tell investors on the earnings call: ""We have more work to do. I know that these moments that impact delivery schedules can frustrate our customers and our investors.""', 'As such, he declined to give an outlook for 2024, and CFO Brian West went on to dampen expectations for Boeing\'s 2025/2026 outlook by saying, ""We\'re still confident in the goals we laid out for \'25, \'26 although it may take longer in that window than originally anticipated.""', ""Boeing just about met its 2023 free-cash-flow guidance of $3 billion to $5 billion in reporting $3.1 billion and missed its delivery targets on the 737 in 2023 (396 planes delivered compared to an initial outlook for 400-450), and it continues to report losses in its defense business.\xa0 So it's fair to say the company continues to face challenges."", ""Given these challenges, it's natural to be concerned about aerospace suppliers. Still, it's worth noting that Boeing's problems largely involve manufacturing quality issues rather than an inability to meet its delivery targets due to product unavailability. In addition, the problem in defense is a margin issue rather than a revenue growth one."", 'Significant delays in airplane deliveries will impact aerospace suppliers like Carpenter over the near term. Still, Boeing, Airbus, and other manufacturers will endeavor to catch up, and have multiyear backlogs in place.', 'Carpenter is a producer and distributor of premium specialty alloys for the industries as outlined in the chart below. Of the non-aerospace businesses, its industrial and consumer business has exposure to semiconductors -- a market set to recover in 2024. Its material solutions to the medical end market (for use in dental implants, stents, orthopedics, and other applications) have attractive long-term growth prospects due to an aging population and increases in medical procedures.', ""Turning to the focus of this article and Carpenter's revenue, its aerospace products span three sub-markets, namely engines (40% of commercial aerospace revenue), structural and avionics (30%), and fasteners (20%)."", ""As previously noted, airplane manufacturers are doing all they can to ramp up production, and that's flowing into increased revenue and margin performance at Carpenter. Carpenter is a business with relatively high fixed costs, meaning that its margins get crushed when there's an industry slowdown, but it expands rapidly in a recovery."", 'The chart below shows that its gross margins are firmly in recovery mode.', 'Carpenter applies a raw material surcharge to its pricing and discloses sales with and without the surcharge. As such, its adjusted operating profit margin, excluding surcharges, was 14.4% in the recently reported second quarter of 2024 (its financial year finishes at the end of June), a figure up from 5.4% in the same quarter a year ago. Moreover, CEO Tony Thene prepared investors for more expansion to come on the earnings call, saying, ""We anticipate our margins will continue to improve with productivity improvements and a richer product mix.""', ""In addition to the margin leverage that Carpenter generates through increased sales, there's also the matter of rapid free-cash-flow expansion as increased margins and better capacity utilization improve cash flow."", 'While Carpenter reported a cash outflow of $25.4 million in the first half of 2024, CFO Timothy Lain forecasts, ""We anticipate that for fiscal year 2024, we will generate meaningful positive free cash flow.""', 'Indeed, Wall Street analysts have Carpenter generating $148 million in free cash flow in its financial 2024, leading to $179 million in its financial 2025. As such, based on the current price, Carpenter will trade at 21 times free cash flow at the end of June and then 17.4 times its free cash flow at the end of June 2025, and a price-to-earnings ratio of 13.1.', 'Those are attractive valuations for a company set to expand margins as the aerospace industry continues to recover, led by production ramps at Boeing and Airbus.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Carpenter Technology right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Carpenter Technology, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Carpenter Technology wasn’t one of them.

But it’s going to add a lot of capacity and growth. There will be about 70% more capacity in our network overall for the state,” Drouhard told FreightWaves at the AirCargo 2024 conference here this week. He spoke on the exhibit floor, where Alaska Airlines (NYSE: ALK) had a booth to showcase its transport service to freight shipping intermediaries.', 'In November, Boeing delivered one 737-800 passenger aircraft for all-cargo operations and is putting the finishing touches, including upgrading galley fixtures and a new paint job, on the second aircraft. Touch work on the planes, which came from Alaska’s passenger fleet, was done by Boeing’s airframe repair partners in Costa Rica and Canada.', 'The first plane is currently grounded for scheduled maintenance. Both cargo jets will be ready for service by mid-March, the cargo chief said.', '', 'The conversions were originally scheduled to be completed last year, but the aerospace industry is still plagued by shortages of skilled workers and supply chain challenges that have delayed production across the aftermarket freighter industry.', 'With five freighters in the fleet, Alaska Air Cargo will be better able to deliver medicine, household goods and fresh food to communities in Alaska, many of which have limited road access, while also moving seafood and other export commodities to cities across North America with passenger services that connect in Seattle and Los Angeles.', 'Each 737-800 freighter can carry 10,000 pounds more than a 737-700. With a configuration that also holds more containers, the -800s\xa0 will have 40% additional space than their predecessors.', 'Widespread dependance on air service means the Alaska Airlines freighters make about seven departures per day, which is more taxing on the airframe and engines than flying at a constant speed and altitude. The 737-700s on some routes make three to five stops between Anchorage and Seattle. The planes also run about 10 hours per day. By reducing daily operating time to eight hours and the number of cycles, Alaska Air Cargo can extend their longevity, Drouhard explained.', '“The uniqueness of that market up there is high cycle for us. So as we add two more aircraft to our fleet, it helps us right-size capacity so we’re not trying to solve so many stops off of one plane,” he said. “It also allows us to unbundle markets, so that way markets get much more dedicated capacity that’s not shared. We’re able to spread that schedule across more aircraft.”', 'The new Los Angeles destination will initially be connected to Alaska through Seattle, but management expects to launch direct flights between Los Angeles International Airport and cities in Alaska in 2025. Alaska Airlines currently averages three daily departures from Seattle to Alaska.', '“As the new expansion gets going, we want to keep close to Seattle rotation-wise. It makes it simple for us. As we get this set in place, we’ll be looking at opportunities to go direct to Anchorage, or other places like King Salmon, Bethel, Nome or the Alaska North Slope,” said Drouhard.', 'The new freighters are also in the process of becoming certified for flying long distances over open water. The aircraft’s expanded range will allow the cargo team to explore new routes, such as a possible nonstop from King Salmon to Seattle.', 'Cargo revenue at Alaska Airlines was about $130 million in 2023, nearly flat with the prior year. The revenue performance was much better than that of most airlines, which experienced revenue declines of 25% to 50% last year because of tepid freight demand and overcapacity. The difference is that most airlines operate in the international freight market, where the downturn was most severe, whereas Alaska operates domestically.', 'Drouhard said he expected to generate 10% to 15% more cargo revenue in 2024 because of the larger cargo fleet.', 'Alaska Airlines to fly Amazon packages after completing Hawaiian buy', 'The post Alaska Airlines to expand freighter service to Los Angeles appeared first on FreightWaves.']"

Below is a chart showing annual Dividends Per Share for tracking historical trends.', 'As of today, Southern Co currently has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 4.12% and a 12-month forward dividend yield of 4.15%.

A lower ratio suggests that the company retains a significant part of its earnings, thereby ensuring the availability of funds for future growth and unexpected downturns. As of 2023-09-30, Southern Co's dividend payout ratio is 1.04, which may suggest that the company's dividend may not be sustainable."", ""Southern Co's profitability rank, offers an understanding of the company's earnings prowess relative to its peers.

Southern Co's growth rank of 7 out of 10 suggests that the company's growth trajectory is good relative to its competitors."", ""Revenue is the lifeblood of any company, and Southern Co's revenue per share, combined with the 3-year revenue growth rate, indicates a strong revenue model. Southern Co's revenue has increased by approximately 10.00% per year on average, a rate that outperforms approximately 58.59% of global competitors."", ""The company's 3-year EPS growth rate showcases its capability to grow its earnings, a critical component for sustaining dividends in the long run.

While the high payout ratio might raise some concerns, the company's strong profitability and growth potential suggest that Southern Co could maintain its commitment to rewarding shareholders.

Given that stock prices are usually aligned with a company's financial performance in the long-term, we decided to study its financial indicators more closely to see if they had a hand to play in the recent price move. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Skyworks Solutions'  ROE today."", ""Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments."", ' View our latest analysis for Skyworks Solutions ', 'The formula for ROE is:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Skyworks Solutions is:', '15% = US$905m ÷ US$6.2b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).', ""The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.15."", 'Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don\'t necessarily bear these characteristics.', ""To start with, Skyworks Solutions' ROE looks acceptable. Even when compared to the industry average of 15% the company's ROE looks quite decent. Skyworks Solutions' decent returns aren't reflected in Skyworks Solutions'mediocre five year net income growth average of 4.2%. A few likely reasons that could be keeping earnings growth low are - the company has a high payout ratio or the business has allocated capital poorly, for instance."", ""Next, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Skyworks Solutions' reported growth was lower than the industry growth of 27% over the last few years, which is not something we like to see."", 'Earnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. What is SWKS worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether SWKS is currently mispriced by the market.', 'While Skyworks Solutions has a decent three-year median payout ratio of 29% (or a retention ratio of 71%), it has seen very little growth in earnings. Therefore, there might be some other reasons to explain the lack in that respect. For example, the business could be in decline.', ""Moreover, Skyworks Solutions has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more suggesting that management must have perceived that the shareholders prefer dividends over earnings growth. Based on the latest analysts' estimates, we found that the company's future payout ratio over the next three years is expected to hold steady at 30%. Still, forecasts suggest that Skyworks Solutions' future ROE will rise to 21% even though the the company's payout ratio is not expected to change by much."", ""In total, it does look like Skyworks Solutions has some positive aspects to its business. However, given the high ROE and high profit retention, we would expect the company to be delivering strong earnings growth, but that isn't the case here. This suggests that there might be some external threat to the business, that's hampering its growth. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings are expected to accelerate.

And on Tuesday, VF appointed Caroline Brown to the company’s board.', 'More from Sourcing Journal', 'VF Activist Engaged Capital Gets Surprise Support', 'Shuffle Board: Zac Posen Named Creative Director of Gap, VF Corp CFO Exits', ""VF's Debt Load Suggests Asset Sales Ahead"", 'VF said the appointment “follows constructive engagement with VF’s shareholders, including Engaged Capital.” Moreover, VF said not only will it appoint another independent director in the near term, it will also give priority to candidates identified by Engaged. VF said Brown and the additional director will be nominated at VF’s 2024 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. The two new board members will bring the Board total to 13 directors, up from 12. That means that one current director will not be standing for re-election to the board.', '“We are excited to welcome Caroline to the VF Board,” VF chairman Richard Carucci said. “Caroline is highly respected in the apparel industry, with a proven track record of turning around, scaling and transforming global brands, and her insights will be valuable as the company continues to execute its Reinvent strategy.”', 'Brown from 2019 to 2023 was a managing director and headed up the fashion practice at Closed Loop Partners, a N.Y.-based investment firm and innovation center focused on the development of the circular economy. Brown is also a former CEO at Donna Karan International (DKI) and DKNY from 2015 to 2017, where led the transformation of the company and its sale from LVMH to G-III Apparel Group. Before DKI, she was president of luxury fashion house Carolina Herrera. Brown has also served as the U.S. CEO of Swiss-based luxury fashion brand Akris. She began her fashion career at Giorgio Armani, where she spent more than a decade in marketing and communications leadership roles.', 'Brown has also served on a number of boards, including Eileen Fisher, Browzwer and Dimpora, among others, and is a member of the MIT Sloan Sustainability Initiative Advisory Board. She is also an advisor to the Martin Trust Center for Entrepreneurship at the MIT Sloan School of Management.', '“Having worked on the leadership and investment sides of the apparel and fashion industry, I recognize the tremendous potential of VF’s portfolio of beloved brands,” Brown said. “I believe VF has what it needs to return to strong and sustainable profitable growth, and I look forward to capitalizing on my experience to help the company deliver enhanced value for shareholders over time.”', 'Carucci also gave credit to Engaged Capital for the constructive input provided over the past several months, and said board will continue the dialogue with the activist and other shareholders.', '“We look forward to continuing to work collaboratively with Caroline and the rest of the Board on the appointment of the Additional Director. We believe these appointments will help support Bracken Darrell and the management team as they lead the turnaround of this iconic portfolio of brands,” Glenn W. Welling, Engaged’s founder and chief investment officer, said.', 'Engaged took a stake\xa0in the apparel giant last October. It said The North Face, Vans, and Timberland owner should sell some of its real estate and look at options for assets beyond its biggest powerhouse brands, in addition to shaking up the board. It also wasn’t keen on VF’s “risky M&A strategy” when it bought the streetwear brand \xa0Supreme\xa0in 2020 for $2.1 billion.', 'The ability for VF and Engaged to work together is in contrast with other activist battles in fashion, whether that’s the very public back-and-forth between Gildan Activewear and Browning West or the battles Kohl’s Corp. has had with its activist investors. In addition to Engaged, activist heavy-hitter Legion Partners Asset Management reportedly also is looking to shake things up at VF.', 'And while Engaged was able to secure the support of a family member—who wants certain directors out—connected to the founder of VF, it will be interesting to see which board member is stepping down. With the collaborative approach VF seems to be taking, it would appear that having Engaged involved could do much to help the apparel giant with its turnaround plans.', 'Those plans now are expected to include sales of non-core assets. VF has debts totaling $1.7 billion coming due and CEO Bracken Darrel has said the current plan is for the company to complete the repayments without the need for any refinancing. The firm has $1 billion in debt due Dec. 30, 2024 and $700 million due on April 23, 2025.']"

If you wish to skip our detailed analysis, you can move directly to the 5 States with the Best Healthcare in the US.', 'The United States faces a huge burden of preventable diseases which have reduced the nation’s average life expectancy. As reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the risk of cardiovascular disease can be prevented through adequate access to health care for instance health insurance can help detect the disease early thereby minimizing the probable loss. However, nearly 1 quarter of low-income Americans who have a heart disease continue to be uninsured. States with the most expensive health insurance have also been previously covered. Diabetes, dementia, hypertension, and cancer are some of the other chronic illnesses which are prevalent. The overall health situation remains aggravated due to reduced healthcare availability, with almost 84 million Americans residing in areas that experience a shortage of primary healthcare professionals.', 'In the healthcare sector, the issue of racial inequality is even worse and evident from the fact that premature mortality is the highest among black residents, American Indians, and Alaska Natives. Apart from the deaths related to the global pandemic, these groups also encountered relatively higher mortality from cardiovascular diseases and stroke. Simultaneously, many mental problems emerged as a result of the pandemic. The country saw a substantial number of deaths from drug overdoses, alcohol, and suicide during the pandemic’s outbreak.', 'Women tend to be another disadvantaged group in terms of health access and outcomes. As reported by the Commonwealth Fund, West Virginia and Mexico had the highest mortalities among women of reproductive age. Better access to quality health could have avoided these deaths. Even in this case, women of color are subject to bitter outcomes through which racial inequalities get reinforced. Lack of prenatal care creates an even more adverse situation. In states such as Texas and Florida, approximately 29% of females couldn’t receive early prenatal care during the first trimester in 2021.', ""Companies including Pfizer Inc.

The company manufactures vaccines and medicines to cure illnesses common across the United States including cancer.

On February 5, the company reported that it has joined hands with The American Cancer Society to undertake a three-year-long initiative that will be reducing disparities in cancer care. Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) will be contributing $15 million to target medically underrepresented US communities, raise cancer awareness among them, and improve their access to cancer screenings and treatments.', ""Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is an American multinational healthcare company that has recently tried to address obesity which is so widely spread that more than 7 in 10 American adults are overweight or have obesity and hence resort to weight loss methods. On January 31, the company reported the launch of its new PROTALITY™ brand which will be serving those who are obese, overweight, or use medications for weight loss. It will offer nutritional products to help maintain muscle mass during the weight loss journey. Those undergoing weight loss procedures have higher nutritional requirements which can adequately support their muscle activity. The first product from the Abbott Laboratories' (NYSE:ABT) new brand is a high-protein nutrition shake."", 'AstraZeneca plc (NASDAQ:AZN) is a renowned biopharmaceutical company that operates in more than 100 countries across the world. On January 29, the company reported that the supplemental Biologics License Application for Enhertu has been given Priority Review. This is a major development regarding the treatment of metastatic HER2-positive solid tumors among adults in the United States. AstraZeneca plc (NASDAQ:AZN) has collaborated with Daiichi Sankyo on Enhertu, a specifically engineered HER2-directed antibody drug conjugate.

Initially, we shortlisted the top states with higher healthcare rankings. Moving forward, we selected three metrics. We selected the number of avoidable deaths before the age of 75 as our primary metric. These are the deaths from infections, injuries, or illnesses that can be prevented or treated through adequate healthcare. The rationale behind our primary metric was that prevention is better than recovery in the field of health since many health issues won’t even emerge if precaution is taken timely.', 'Simultaneously, the mortality rate for women of reproductive age, those aged between 15 and 44, was chosen as the secondary metric. This is because apart from basic prevention, reproductive health is a significant factor since it is linked with the health conditions of the future generation. Lastly, the percentage of uninsured adults in every state was taken as a tertiary metric as it represents access to health.', 'By the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds.

Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. Thus, you can purchase Marathon Petroleum's shares before the 20th of February in order to receive the dividend, which the company will pay on the 11th of March."", ""The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.825 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$3.30 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Marathon Petroleum stock has a trailing yield of around 1.9% on the current share price of US$169.88. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing."", ' View our latest analysis for Marathon Petroleum ', 'If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Marathon Petroleum is paying out just 13% of its profit after tax, which is comfortably low and leaves plenty of breathing room in the case of adverse events.', ""Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends."", ""Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. It's encouraging to see Marathon Petroleum has grown its earnings rapidly, up 45% a year for the past five years. Marathon Petroleum looks like a real growth company, with earnings per share growing at a cracking pace and the company reinvesting most of its profits in the business."", ""Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. Since the start of our data, 10 years ago, Marathon Petroleum has lifted its dividend by approximately 17% a year on average. Both per-share earnings and dividends have both been growing rapidly in recent times, which is great to see."", 'From a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid Marathon Petroleum? Typically, companies that are growing rapidly and paying out a low fraction of earnings are keeping the profits for reinvestment in the business. Perhaps even more importantly - this can sometimes signal management is focused on the long term future of the business. Marathon Petroleum ticks a lot of boxes for us from a dividend perspective, and we think these characteristics should mark the company as deserving of further attention.', ""While it's tempting to invest in Marathon Petroleum for the dividends alone, you should always be mindful of the risks involved. For example, we've found 2 warning signs for Marathon Petroleum (1 shouldn't be ignored!) that deserve your attention before investing in the shares."", ""If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks."", 'Have feedback on this article?

Rubbing salt in the wounds, it partially attributed its strong earnings to its new customers. “Molson Coors was well positioned to benefit from the significant shifts in consumer purchasing habits, largely in the U.S. premium segment in 2023,” the earnings report said, though it didn’t name any of the company’s competitors.', 'But Anheuser-Busch can’t just blame the culture wars for a tepid year. Customers appear unwilling to pick up the tab on increasing beer costs, which rose nearly 6% from April 2022 to 2023 as beer companies struggled to keep up with the increased cost of packaging and transportation caused by inflation.\xa0Other brewers experienced a similar sales slump to Anheuser-Busch.', 'Heineken’s stock dropped over 6% on Wednesday after the brewer forecasted a modest single-digit profit growth. Heineken raised prices by over 10% in the first half of 2023, and continued price hikes into the second half of the year as volumes declined.', '“Pricing has impacted volumes, that’s obvious. What’s good to see is that we are seeing inflation starting to taper and consequently we are also starting to moderate the pricing that we need to offset input cost inflation,” Heineken CEO Dolf van den Brink told Bloomberg.', 'Constellation Brands, which, like Molson Coors, inherited some of Bud Light’s customers, is also struggling. Net sales of its beers, including Corona Premier and Modelo Especial, rose 4% in the last quarter of 2023, but the company still reported lower-than-expected sales due to inflation-induced price hikes on wine and spirits.', 'Molson Coors is one of the few beer companies to buck the trend. Despite raising prices like other beer brands, it has kept prices comparatively more affordable. It’s also worked to capitalize on Anheuser-Busch’s Bud Light stumble, spending 19% more on marketing and administration this year.', 'But beer’s growing unpopularity—much of it to do with a brewing prohibition vibe among Gen Z, the next generation of supposed beer drinkers—could threaten the entire industry.', 'While beer remains the alcoholic beverage of choice among Americans, it has waned in popularity over the past 20 years, according to a 2022 Gallup poll. U.S. beer shipments in 2023 are expected to be the lowest in a quarter century, and liquor’s strong hold on the market share means it has eclipsed beer and wine sales two years in a row.', 'Gen Z is partially responsible for these trends. Fewer young adults are interested in drinking, a 2023 Gallup poll shows, with 62% saying they ever drink at all, compared to 72% two decades ago. Not only are Zoomers not interested in spending money to go out, but they also see drinking as unhealthy compared to cannabis. Two in three 18- to 24-year-olds are somewhat or very concerned about the impact of drinking on their health, according to a July 2023 CivicScience survey of 5,545 respondents.', 'For Zoomers who do want to drink, they prefer higher-quality spirits and ready-to-drink cocktails, though mocktails and nonalcoholic beverages, also favored by Gen Z, are growing at double-digit rates.', 'Beer companies are trying to keep up with the changing trends, pivoting energy to low- and no-alcohol beverages. Anheuser-Busch plans to have alcohol-free or low-alcohol drinks such as Busch NA and Budweiser Zero account for 20% of its sales by 2025.', ""But even with meaningful product changes, environmental and geopolitical factors could prevent the beer industry from bouncing back. Danish brewer Carlsberg had to hike prices last year not only due to inflation, but to offset unexpected business loss. In July, the company’s Russian operations were seized by the country's government."", 'Climate change has also impacted beer-production forecasts. Rising temperature and less rain in Europe mean a decrease in the yield of hops between 4% and 18% by 2050, according to an October 2023 study in Nature. Some American producers are turning to U.S. production of winter barley as an alternative to hops, but it’s not yet the dominant crop, signaling there’s not an infrastructure in place to account for climate change’s impact on beer-related grain farming.', '“It will be increasingly difficult for us as plant breeders to provide new varieties of barley and new varieties of hops that can meet, just, all of the terrors of the climate change process,” Patrick Hayes, a professor at Oregon State University, told Fortune in November. “And I say terrors because…it’s that volatility, which is so, so frightening.”', 'This story was originally featured on Fortune.com']"

Their high costs also represent an iffy financial decision when you start running the numbers on EVs versus comparably sized hybrids and plug-in hybrids: yes, you’ll save money by running on electricity, but probably not enough to counter the much higher cost of entry.', 'Because of both the infrastructure and financial challenges, hybrids and plug-in hybrids are an obvious bridge technology to the full EV future. This was obvious years ago and it’s obvious today. And yet, car companies mostly eschewed hybrids and plug-in hybrids in favor of a full EV push. Why? Electric cars are REALLY expensive to develop. Investing in a bridge technology at the same time as the ultimate goal … well, speaking of iffy financial decisions.', 'As such, the only companies really making hybrids these days are those who were making them before the recent EV push: Toyota/Lexus, Honda, Ford, Hyundai/Kia, BMW and Porsche. The company formerly known as Chrysler is the rare exception to this as it has more recently invested in and introduced new plug-in hybrids.', 'One company not listed there, of course, is General Motors. It dove head-on into electric and swore off hybrids apart from the recently introduced Corvette E-Ray. GM, however, not only had hybrid technology, it had exceptional hybrid technology. The Chevrolet Volt came out in 2010, and while the car itself was flawed, the powertrain and its general concept were exceptional. The non-plug-in version of the Voltec hybrid powertrain was also very good, but it wound up in virtually nothing. I’m one of only a handful of journalists who ever tested a 2016 Chevy Malibu Hybrid, and you know what? It was really good!', 'That was the most perplexing thing about GM’s decision several years ago to move beyond hybrids. How could it not see that EVs were not going to be for everyone? How could it not see the short-sightedness of the decision? Those were questions myself and many others covering the automotive industry were asking back then. And it’s why I have nothing to say but “well, duh” when GM recently announced it was throttling back on EV development and dusting off their hybrid tech from the vault.', 'This is just the latest example of General Motors completely bungling its electrification strategy. The engineers have done their jobs over the years, but the combination of mistakes, miscalculations and missed designs by everyone else has rendered those efforts pointless.', 'In the beginning, General Motors came up with the first electric car in basically a century. Then they killed it … both the EV1 and the general idea of producing an electric car.', 'A decade later, General Motors effectively invented the plug-in hybrid, the Chevrolet Volt. Its roughly 40 miles of electric range would still be among the best on sale today (the second generation topped 50 miles), and the well-executed powertrain’s overall concept had the same benefits as modern PHEVs: Run on electricity for your commuting and daily errand running, have the gas engine on hand for longer trips. It worked and it worked well. Good job engineers! However …', 'As cool as the original Volt concept was (picture above), the eventual production model was decidedly not, disappointing everyone. It was also cramped with four seats only, thereby limiting its widespread appeal. The second generation was better-looking and more conventional, but that also meant it wasn’t able to declare its greenness to the world. Both further suffered from minimal marketing support and dealers uninterested in selling something more complicated than “V8 makes truck go.”', 'Meanwhile, the only other vehicle the Voltec plug-in powertrain found itself in was the Cadillac ELR, a tiny two-door coupe with a price tag so outrageously high we all thought it was a joke (OK, so there was also the Fisker Karma. There was eventually a more compelling Cadillac CT6 plug-in hybrid capable of 31 miles of e-range, but it was on sale for roughly 28 minutes before GM axed it. Come to think of it, GM also axed the CT6’s almost-mythical “Blackwing” engine option, so it’s not like curious about-faces are limited to the electric realm.)', 'Hindsight is 20/20, of course, but it always seemed like Voltec could be a winner – it just needed the right kind of vehicle surrounding it as well as marketing support. An Equinox-sized SUV with Voltec and unique styling seemed like a recipe for at least greater success than the Volt, even if it would need a bigger battery. The demand for the Toyota RAV4 Prime and Kia Sportage PHEV would indicate it wouldn’t have been foolhardy. ', 'Eventually, GM pulled the plug on the Volt, plug-in hybrids and regular hybrids, such as the Malibu, that effectively had the Voltec powertrain concept with smaller batteries and no electric-only range. They basically operated like Honda’s system. I suppose that’s what they can bring out from mothballs now, so they’re certainly restarting from a good spot.', 'But let’s also not forget that GM co-developed a hybrid system for its full-size trucks and SUVs, and although a bit underbaked as an overall concept, it was still something to build upon. GM could very well have a Silverado/Sierra answer to Ford’s excellent F-150 Power Boost hybrid today, but nope.', 'And that’s just hybrids. Let’s talk about the actual EVs. The Bolt was the first affordable EV that didn’t make you bite your nails with range anxiety the second you pulled out of the driveway. While the Leaf and E-Golf and yada yada yada all had ranges in the 100-mile vicinity, the Bolt blew them all away with about 250. It was also quick and reasonably fun to drive. Unfortunately, it was a tall, awkwardly styled dorkmobile of a hatchback that only the most ardent EV evangelists would desire. Dealers hated it even more than the Volt ‘cause they couldn’t charge you an arm and a leg for oil changes, etc. A successful refresh largely corrected the dorky styling and the stretched EUV version satisfied the needs of more family-oriented customers. With a big help from lower prices, the Bolt found finally found success. And then GM killed it.', 'To be fair, the Ultium platform shows great promise. It’s more advanced and allows for the mixing and matching of components to make various vehicles for various brands, including Honda and Acura. Unfortunately, there will be a gap between the Bolt and whenever its next-generation, Ultium-based replacement arrives. And also whenever the cheapest Equinox EV arrives. That’ll leave potential customers with nothing.', 'And speaking of nothing, that’s been a half-decent estimate for how many other Ultium-based vehicles have been produced. The Hummer EV and Cadillac Lyriq have been trickling out, while the Blazer EV fell flat on its face the second it jumped over the boards. Even then, Chevy was delaying the rollout of its various trim levels, with pricier ones coming first and cheaper ones coming in 2020-something or other. Honda to its credit is not doing that with the mechanically related Prologue.', 'At some point in that history lesson, I probably should’ve suggested putting on circus music or ""Yakety Sax."" Or banging a gong. Or dropping a gif of Captain Picard putting his forehead into his palm. It’s just been a mess. So much promise utterly wasted. One almost expects some sort of calamity or poor decision to befall the Corvette E-Ray any day now.', 'And yet! GM can still salvage this snowball of mismanagement. Even with Voltec covered in dust and Ultium firing out error codes like a Gatling gun, they’re in a vastly superior position to that of other car companies. It’s easy to see a very promising future filled with compelling plug-in hybrid SUVs, hybrid trucks and, yes, all the wonderful EVs we’ve already gotten a glimpse of. Can GM actually get out of its own way and make it happen? Well, that is the question, isn’t it?', 'You Might Also Like', ""Afeela Deep Dive: Our closest look yet at Sony Honda Mobility's electric sedan"", '2024 BMW i5 Review: 5 Series goes electric, better for it', ""Ford's free Tesla NACS adapter surfaces online""]"

Yardsticks, such as dividend yield, P/E or P/B, are commonly used to single out stocks trading at a discount."", 'However, while not taking into account the growth potential of a stock, these ratios might end up convincing us to invest in stocks that are at a discount just because of their poor show. This might often lead to “value traps” — a situation when these value picks start to underperform over the long run as the temporary problems, which once pulled down the share price, turn out to be persistent.', 'In such a case, even if you buy a stock at less than its fair value, you might still end up paying more.

This geographical advantage is further enhanced by the company's access to major ports, enabling it to capitalize on import and export traffic, thus reinforcing its position in the transportation sector."", ""Regulatory and Compliance Risks: The company's operations are heavily regulated by agencies like the STB, FRA, PHMSA, and EPA, which impose stringent standards and practices.

The necessity to transport hazardous materials also adds to the operational complexity and exposes the company to additional risks and liabilities."", ""Cybersecurity Vulnerabilities: CSX Corp's reliance on information technology systems exposes it to cybersecurity risks. Data breaches, cyber-attacks, or other IT incidents can lead to service interruptions, misappropriation of sensitive information, and operational difficulties.

Strategic partnerships or acquisitions could further expand the company's reach and enhance its service offerings."", ""Competitive Pressure: CSX Corp faces intense competition from other railroads, motor carriers, and alternative transportation modes. Competitors may offer more attractive pricing, service levels, or technological innovations, which could lure away customers. Additionally, industry consolidation could alter the competitive landscape, potentially diminishing CSX's market influence and bargaining power."", ""Economic and Market Volatility: Fluctuations in the global economy, trade policies, and energy markets can significantly impact demand for the commodities CSX transports. Economic downturns, trade embargoes, or shifts in energy consumption patterns could reduce freight volumes, affecting the company's profitability. Moreover, climate change poses risks to infrastructure and may necessitate substantial capital investments to mitigate its effects."", ""In conclusion, CSX Corp's SWOT analysis reveals a company with a solid financial foundation and strategic advantages stemming from its diverse revenue streams and expansive network. However, regulatory complexities, cybersecurity concerns, and competitive pressures present ongoing challenges. By capitalizing on technological advancements and market expansion opportunities, CSX can fortify its strengths and mitigate its weaknesses. Vigilance against external threats, such as economic volatility and competitive dynamics, will be crucial for sustaining its market position and driving future growth."", 'This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

An ABR of 1.44 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.', 'Of the 16 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 12 are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 75% and 6.3% of all recommendations.', 'Brokerage Recommendation Trends for RCL', 'Check price target & stock forecast for Royal Caribbean here>>>The ABR suggests buying Royal Caribbean, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.', 'Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.', ""This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements."", ""Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision."", 'ABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank', 'Although both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.', 'The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.', 'Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.', 'On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.', 'Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.', 'There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.', 'Should You Invest in RCL?', 'In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Royal Caribbean, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 8.3% over the past month to $9.65.', ""Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term."", ""The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Royal Caribbean.

The U.S. consumer price index for January was up 0.3% month-over-month and 3.1% on a year-over-year basis. This compared unfavorably with broad-based expectations of 0.2% and 2.95, respectively.Earlier, the Fed had pledged to cut interest rates several times in 2024 owing to a decelerating inflation trend in the later stages of 2023. However, given the recent inflationary data, the markets appear vulnerable to sudden downtrends. This, in turn, signifies that the markets need to brace for intense volatility owing to tempered expectations despite a relatively healthy U.S. economy and GDP data.Amid the uncertainty, investors often seek to employ time-tested winning strategies to fetch sustained profits. One of the most successful game plans to beat the blues is to bet on momentum stocks when value or growth investing fails to generate the desired profits.This approach primarily tends to follow the adage, “the trend is your friend.” At its core, momentum investing is “buying high and selling higher.” It is based on the idea that once a stock establishes a trend, it is more likely to continue in that direction because of the momentum that is already behind it. But before we delve deep into it, let us try to fathom why does the momentum strategy at all work?There are several behavioral biases that most investors exhibit in their decision-making. And these emotional responses, or rather mistakes, make the momentum strategy work.For example, some investors are anxious about booking losses and hence hold on to losing stocks for too long, hopeful of a rebound in prices. On the other hand, a few investors sell their winners way too early. Momentum investing is one of the best strategies to avoid making such errors in judgment.Furthermore, investors initially tend to underreact to news, events or data releases. However, once things become clear, they have a habit of going with the flow and overreacting, causing dramatic price reactions. These behavioral problems extend trends, thus opening up huge opportunities for momentum players.To sum up, momentum investing is a way to profit from the general human tendency to extrapolate current trends into the future. It is based on that gap in time before the mean reversion occurs, i.e., before prices become rational again.In this context, stocks like Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. RCL, Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN and Pinterest, Inc. PINS are worth betting on.Momentum strategies have been known to be alpha-generative over a long period and across market stages. So, this strategy is quite tricky to implement, as detecting these trends is no child’s play.Here, we have created a strategy to help investors get in on these fast movers and rake in handsome gains. Our screen will help you benefit from both long-term price momentum and a short-term pullback in price.', ""Percentage Change in Price (52 Weeks) = Top #50: This selects the top 50 stocks with the best percentage price change over the last 52 weeks. This parameter ensures we get the best stocks that have appreciated steadily over the past year.Percentage Change in Price (1 Week) = Bottom #10: From the above 50 stocks, we then choose those that are also among the 10 worst performers over a short one-week period.

All of these are costs which are going up for companies, and those are being passed on to the consumer.', 'Now, the utility industry is highly regulated. PG&E in California had to go ask for approval in order to hike rates out in California, Akiko, and those rates were hiked this year by 13%. They did receive that approval. And part of the money that they are recouping from that hike is in order to bury their lines after those wildfires out in California.', ""Now, some good news. The EIA says that this year electricity prices on average are set to decline by 1%. That's on average. That means in some parts of the country you will still see electricity prices going up. In other parts you will see rates going down but on average down 1%. Look, I spoke to one energy expert. They told it to me this way, sure, you may see prices decline by 1% in one year but then they go up by 8% the next Year that's an anomaly really, when it comes to the steep climb with electricity.""]"

242,a81fad16-b1e0-3057-bade-b13615c5aa15,VZ,2024-02-15,Better Telecom Stock: T-Mobile US vs. Verizon Communications,Motley Fool,https://finance.yahoo.com/m/a81fad16-b1e0-3057-bade-b13615c5aa15/better-telecom-stock%3A.html,1707993600,STORY,"['VZ', 'TMUS']","['The wireless communications industry in America has multiple companies but only a small group of viable competitors. AT&T, Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ), and T-Mobile US (NASDAQ: TMUS) control virtually the entire market. While these three competitors are relatively interchangeable in the eyes of most customers concerning the services they provide, their stocks have not performed the same over the past several years.', 'T-Mobile stock has obliterated its wireless competitors for the past decade, teaching investors valuable lessons about long-term investing. While Verizon has a seemingly dirt cheap price tag and a hefty dividend, here is why investors should focus on the big picture and own T-Mobile stock instead.', ""Verizon doesn't have a problem making money. The company generates over $37 billion in cash profits from its daily operations yearly, more than twice as much as T-Mobile. The most significant difference between the two companies is where that cash goes."", ""For starters, Verizon is committed to its dividend. Management has raised the payout for 20 consecutive years, and at the current share price, it yields a juicy 6.7%. That's fine, but dividends represent cash leaving the business. Verizon spends $11 billion on its dividend (almost all of its net income over the past year), which is that much less money Verizon has to invest in its wireless network to provide an excellent product to customers."", ""Additionally, Verizon has taken on a lot of debt over the years. Currently sitting on $150 billion in long-term debt, Verizon has 3.7 times as much debt as its annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). That's more money going toward interest payments and less financial flexibility."", 'Compare that to T-Mobile. It also pays a dividend, but it spends only 37% of its net income on it. T-Mobile also has debt on its balance sheet. However, its debt-to-EBITDA ratio is just 2.7. Less of its cash flow going to the dividend and less spent on servicing its debt means it can invest more freely in providing its customers with the best wireless service and products.', ""Most people don't care about the brand of their wireless carrier. Their choice comes down to how good a company's wireless performance is and how little they can pay for it. There are high barriers to entry for new wireless competitors in the U.S., but consumers can easily switch between the big three providers."", ""That's where T-Mobile has shined in recent years. According to analytics company Opensignal, T-Mobile has offered the fastest 5G upload and download speeds in the United States in seven consecutive semiannual tests. T-Mobile also has the most 5G reach by a considerable margin. Verizon did win in some niche categories like video and gaming, but T-Mobile seemingly offers the leading user experience today."", ""That has translated into business results. T-Mobile has added a net of 3.1 million new postpaid wireless phone customers in 2023, compared to a net loss of 132,000 for Verizon. In other words, T-Mobile is eating Verizon's lunch."", ""Verizon has a big dividend and only trades at a forward P/E of 8. Meanwhile, T-Mobile trades at a forward P/E of 17 and only yields 0.4% today. But Verizon's low price and high dividend haven't prevented T-Mobile from easily outperforming the stock."", ""That's because organic growth ultimately matters most, and T-Mobile is growing while Verizon's struggling."", 'Consensus long-term analyst estimates call for Verizon to grow its earnings by just 1% to 2% annually, versus over 20% for T-Mobile. Strong customer growth and lighter financial baggage have set the company up for robust earnings expansion.', 'T-Mobile is the obvious choice for any investors looking for total returns.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in T-Mobile US right now?', 'Before you buy stock in T-Mobile US, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and T-Mobile US wasn’t one of them.

Then, the pharmacy operator cut its dividend. That's a warning that investors need to keep in mind as they look at the current top three highest-yielding stocks: Verizon (NYSE: VZ), 3M (NYSE: MMM), and Dow (NYSE: DOW). Here's a quick look at each of these Dow Jones income stocks."", 'Verizon is one of the largest telecommunications companies in the United States, operating a large cellular network. The stock currently yields around 6.7%, which is notably more than you\'d collect from the ""average"" company, noting that the yield on the S&P 500 index is a paltry 1.4% or so. Verizon has increased its dividend annually for 19 consecutive years, which is a good sign but not enough to make the stock a buy.', ""Operating a telecommunications business requires a huge amount of capital investment. As such, companies in the industry tend to carry a lot of debt on their balance sheets. Verizon's leverage, however, is higher than that of its two main competitors. Verizon's leverage has fallen dramatically over the past decade, so it is moving in the right direction on this front. Given the importance of mobile phones and the growth of connected devices, the stock is probably worth a look. However, investors should still keep a close eye on the balance sheet here. A material deterioration in leverage from current levels would indicate a potentially worrisome increase in risk."", ""Iconic industrial company 3M has a widely diversified business and a long history of annual dividend increases behind it, at 65 years. That makes the company a\xa0Dividend King. The yield is an attractive 6.5%. There are a couple of big problems that suggest 3M isn't appropriate for most investors."", ""First off, the company is dealing with several legal and regulatory issues that will lead to billions of dollars in legal expenses. Management is working through the issues, including product liability related to military earplugs and the environmental impact of its production of forever chemicals. The big problem for investors is that the company can't discuss these topics in any detail until they have been resolved, leaving shareholders in the dark as to what is going on (and the ultimate risk that the headwinds pose). Second, the company is in the process of spinning off its healthcare business. It has little choice because it needs the cash that this transaction will create to pay its legal bills. A lot is going on, making this a special-situation stock right now that only more aggressive investors will want to own."", ""Dow is a large and diversified chemical manufacturer. Its dividend yield is around 5.2%. But, unlike Verizon and 3M, the company's dividend has been static for a number of years, and there's no sign that this trend is going to change anytime soon. That's a strike against the stock, given that inflation will slowly erode the buying power of a dividend that doesn't grow over time."", ""From a business perspective, there's another notable risk that investors need to consider. Much of what Dow produces comes from processing natural gas, which is a highly volatile commodity. So, the company's costs are volatile. Now add to this fact that a lot of the products Dow produces are themselves commodities, which means what it charges customers can be volatile, too."", 'As the above chart highlights, earnings can be pretty volatile, as well. So can the payout ratio. Add in the lack of dividend growth, and most investors will probably be better off looking at other high-yield stocks.', 'Investors looking at high-yield stocks need to be very careful not to get lured into a dividend trap like Walgreens turned out to be. That suggests that caution should be the first order of business. On this list, the risks at 3M and Dow appear like they outweigh the potential dividend rewards. And while Verizon seems like it is in a better position, investors should still make sure to pay close attention to its leverage, which is higher than that of its peers. That may even dissuade more conservative types from buying it in the first place.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in 3M right now?', 'Before you buy stock in 3M, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and 3M wasn’t one of them.

Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure.I will now turn it over to Chuck."", 'Charles H. Robbins', ""Thanks, Sami, and thank you all for joining us today. We delivered a solid Q2 performance with revenue coming in at the high end of our guidance range. Strong operating leverage across our business drove our margins, which exceeded the high end of our expectations and allowed us to deliver better-than-anticipated earnings per share. In Q2, we once again returned a total of $2.8 billion in value through dividends and share repurchases.We also announced today another increase to Cisco's dividend payout rate, reaffirming our ongoing commitment to returning significant value to our shareholders through consistent capital returns. Overall, our Q2 results continue to advance our strategic business transformation around driving higher levels of software subscriptions and annualized recurring revenue or ARR, both of which showed performance gains in the quarter.Our pending acquisition of Splunk also further supports our transformation strategy by fueling stronger growth, expanding our portfolio of software-based solutions and generating higher levels of ARR with roughly $4 billion in additional ARR expected upon closing and will make us one of the largest software companies in the world.Before turning to our performance in the quarter, I'd like to start by commenting on the demand environment. First, in terms of the macro environment, we are seeing a greater degree of caution and scrutiny of deals given the high level of uncertainty. As we're hearing this from our customers, it's leading us to be more cautious with our forecast and expectations. Second, as we discussed last quarter and subsequently saw in other technology provider results, customers have been taking time since the start of our fiscal 2024 to deploy the elevated levels of products shipped to them in recent quarters, and this is taking longer than our initial expectations. Third, we also continue to see weak demand with our telco and cable service provider customers. This industry has seen significant pressure, and they are adjusting deployment phasing, which is weighing on our business outlook.Given these factors, we are adjusting our expenses and investments to reflect the current environment. That said, for the product categories in which we can measure customer inventory absorption through connections to the cloud, we are seeing steady progress. However, based on conversations with customers, we still believe we are 1 to 2 quarters away from full implementation of their inventory, which, as I mentioned, is longer than we expected. We continue to track Meraki activations, which are moving slightly faster in wireless and slightly slower in switching. Using our Meraki business as a proxy for our wider enterprise networking portfolio, we expect the current implementation of shipped products to be broadly complete by the end of fiscal 2024.Looking at our wireless business as an example, we are encouraged by the number of orders of $1 million or more, which increased approximately 50% sequentially in Q2. This indicates that many wireless customers have finished absorbing what we've shipped to them and are preparing for larger deployments in the coming months. Our team is also partnering closely with customers to assist with this heightened focus on deployments of Cisco equipment on hand, contributing to our services revenue increase year-over-year. It's also worth noting that nonhardware-centric revenue in areas such as Security and Collaboration increased, and our Observability offerings grew double digits year-over-year. Finally, despite the near-term challenges, our win rates are stable and on a rolling 4-quarter basis, our market share remained steady in 3 of our 4 largest markets.Now moving on to our performance in Q2. As I mentioned earlier, our performance in the quarter was broadly in line with or better than our Q2 expectations. Given the trust our customers place in us and the criticality of our technologies to the outcomes our customers are seeking, I am confident about the foundational strength of our portfolio and our future growth opportunities. With our innovation, we deliver and enable our customers to deploy next-generation applications in a highly secure manner.As part of this, we help facilitate their growth through our products and services so that when our customers adopt new technologies, we grow alongside them. We continue to accelerate our innovation across high-growth areas. Last week at Cisco Live EMEA, we announced new capabilities in networking, furthering our vision for the Cisco Networking Cloud. We also announced several new capabilities across our Security, Collaboration and Observability portfolios, leveraging AI throughout.We also continue to capitalize on the multibillion-dollar AI infrastructure opportunity. This quarter, we announced the next phase in our partnership with NVIDIA to offer enterprises simplified, cloud-based and on-prem AI infrastructure. This includes both networking hardware and software to support advanced AI workloads. We are clear beneficiaries of AI adoption, and this partnership further demonstrates the central role we play in AI and the overall technology ecosystem. Our combined solution will be sold through our extensive global channel with professional services and support from key partners who are committed to helping businesses deploy their GPU clusters via Ethernet infrastructure.In webscale, we continue to see momentum with 3 of the top 4 customers deploying our hyperscale Ethernet AI fabric, leveraging Cisco-validated designs for AI infrastructure. While there is tremendous opportunity ahead, we are still in the early stages of adoption of AI workloads.In Security, we continue to execute against our product road map to deliver the industry's most comprehensive unified platform with end-to-end solutions. This quarter, we introduced Cisco Identity Intelligence, an analytics layer that pulls data from identity infrastructure and performs behavior-based assessments to help protect against identity-based attacks, which are at the forefront of cyber threats today. AI is also becoming more pervasive across the Cisco Security Cloud. For example, our new AI Assistant and Secure Access lets customers create security access policies using natural language prompts, reducing errors and speeding up policy administration by 70%. Our new security solutions like XDR and Secure Access are ramping quickly after being launched this fall with now over 230 Cisco XDR customers. Over the next 6 months, you can expect more meaningful announcements across the portfolio through our accelerated organic innovation and inorganic investments.In addition, we have now extended our AI-powered ThousandEyes into Cisco Secure Access, joining past integrations with AppDynamics, Webex, Catalyst and Meraki platforms. ThousandEyes allows our customers to understand the digital experience of users, applications and things through billions of daily measurements of the Internet and public SaaS as well as thousands of enterprise customers, creating best-in-class digital experiences for users.In Observability, we introduced the Cisco Digital Experience Monitoring application, providing deep insights into the performance of browser and mobile applications and efficient resolution of session-level issues. Our continued generative AI innovations build upon our existing platform capabilities, further enabling operations teams to focus on what matters most: minimizing tools for all, improving overall performance and delivering highly secure digital experiences.Going back to the pending Splunk acquisition, the combination of Splunk's complementary capabilities with ours and AI, Security and Observability will create an end-to-end data platform to enhance our customers' digital resiliency. We are excited that together, we will bring trusted innovation leadership, an outstanding go-to-market engine and a world-class culture that will help our customers achieve their technology outcomes with innovative products and solutions.I would also like to provide a brief update on timing. While the closing of the acquisition of Splunk remains subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions, given the positive progress to date on the required regulatory approvals, we now expect to close the transaction late in the first quarter or early in the second quarter of calendar year 2024, which is in our fiscal third quarter.Before I turn it over to Scott, let me summarize 3 key takeaways. First, we have reset our expectations for the second half of the year given the cautious macro environment, our customers absorbing high levels of inventory and ongoing weakness in service provider. Second, you can count on us to take a disciplined approach regardless of the environment. We remain committed to operating leverage, capital allocation and expense management. Lastly, our portfolio continues to get stronger and stronger every day. While we have work in front of us and despite the current environment, we remain confident in our long-term strategy. We are relentlessly focused on our commitment to driving long-term value for our shareholders and industry-leading innovation for our customers.I'll now turn it over to Scott to provide more detail on the quarter and our outlook."", 'Richard Scott Herren', ""Thanks, Chuck. Our Q2 results reflect solid execution again with strong margins and increasing operating leverage. For the quarter, total revenue was at the high end of our guidance range at $12.8 billion, down 6% year-over-year. Non-GAAP net income was $3.5 billion, down 3%, and non-GAAP earnings per share was above the high end of our guidance range at $0.87, down 1%.Looking at our Q2 revenue in more detail, total product revenue was $9.2 billion, down 9%, and service revenue was $3.6 billion, up 4%. Networking, our largest product category, was down 12%. We saw declines across switching, wireless and routed optical networking driven primarily by weakness in the enterprise and service provider and cloud markets.Security was up 3% with our Zero Trust offering growing double digits. Collaboration was up 3% driven by growth in collaboration devices and calling partially offset by a decline in meetings. Observability was up 16% driven by growth across the portfolio with continued strength in ThousandEyes network services. As Chuck mentioned, ThousandEyes helps monitor and assure digital experience everywhere, on-premise, Internet and the cloud.We continue to make progress on our transformation to more recurring revenue-based offerings. We saw strong performance in our ARR of $24.7 billion, which increased 6%, with product ARR growth of 9%. Total software revenue was flat at $4.2 billion, with software subscription revenue up 5%. 88% of our software revenue was subscription-based.Total subscription revenue increased 6% to $6.4 billion, which now represents 50% of Cisco's total revenue, an increase of 6 percentage points over last year. RPO was $35.7 billion, up 12% year-over-year. Product and service RPO both increased 12%. In total, short-term RPO was $17.9 billion, up 6%. Q2 product orders declined 12%, a significant improvement from Q1 as customers continue to work down product shipments from prior quarters.Looking at our geographic segments year-over-year, the Americas was down 10%, EMEA down 8%, and APJC was down 27%. In our customer markets, service provider and cloud was down 40%, enterprise was down 6%, and public sector was down 5%. Backlog at the end of Q2 has now returned to normal levels.Total non-GAAP gross margin came in at 66.7% up 280 basis points year-over-year and above the high end of our guidance range. Product gross margin was 65.2%, up 310 basis points. The improvement was driven primarily by lower freight and component costs and favorable product mix partially offset by negative impact on pricing. Service gross margin was 70.5%, up 140 basis points.Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 33%, up 50 basis points and exceeding the high end of our guidance range. Strong non-GAAP gross margin and continued cost management drove the leverage.Further, we are realigning our investments and expenses to reflect the current environment to help maximize long-term value for our shareholders. As part of our announced restructuring plan, we expect to impact approximately 5% of our global workforce with estimated pretax charges of approximately $800 million.Shifting to the balance sheet. We ended Q2 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $25.7 billion. Consistent with our expectations, operating cash flow was $800 million driven in large part by the timing of federal tax payments and the higher annual payment of the TCJA transition tax.This quarter, we returned $2.8 billion to shareholders comprised of $1.6 billion for our quarterly cash dividend and $1.3 billion of share repurchases. Year-to-date, we have returned $5.7 billion in value to shareholders, and we plan to continue our share repurchases at the current quarterly level throughout fiscal 2024. Increasing shareholder returns through greater operating leverage, maintaining a higher level of annual share repurchases and growing our dividend is consistent with our capital allocation strategy.Given the confidence we have in our business today, we announced we are raising our dividend by $0.01 to $0.40 per quarter. This dividend increase demonstrates our commitment to returning a minimum of 50% of free cash flow annually to our shareholders and our confidence in the strength of our ongoing cash flows.To summarize, we executed well with continued strong margins and increased operating leverage as we help our customers complete record deployments and implementations. We continue to progress our business model shift to more recurring revenue. We are strategically investing in innovation to capitalize on our growth opportunities and are committed to delivering long-term shareholder value.With regard to our proposed acquisition of Splunk, we continue to work through regulatory approvals and closing conditions and as Chuck mentioned, we're optimistic that it will close ahead of what we had originally anticipated. We have not included any impact from the Splunk acquisition in our forward-looking guidance.Turning to our guidance. As previously mentioned, we have reset our expectations for the second half of the year to account for the caution around macro uncertainty, the continued absorption by our customers of record levels of product shipments they received from us and the weakness of our service provider market. For Q3, our guidance is as follows. We expect revenue to be in the range of $12.1 billion to $12.3 billion. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 66% to 67%. Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range of 33.5% to 34.5%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.84 to $0.86.For fiscal year '24, our guidance is as follows. We expect revenue to be in the range of $51.5 billion to $52.5 billion. Non-GAAP earnings per share guidance is expected to range from $3.68 to $3.74. In both our Q3 and full year guidance, we're assuming a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 19%. Sami, let's now move into the Q&A."", 'Ahmed Sami Badri', 'Thank you, Scott. (Operator Instructions) Operator, can we move to the first analyst in the queue?', 'Operator', 'Amit Daryanani with Evercore.', 'Amit Jawaharlaz Daryanani', ""I'll ask both my questions upfront. Chuck, when I think about the lower revenue guide for the full year by about 500 basis points versus 90 days ago, can you just touch on how much of that do you think is the digestion getting extended versus the macro versus the telco weakness? And then how do you sort of think about getting back to a positive revenue cadence organically?And then as a follow-up, I'd love to just understand this, in media announcement you folks had, there's a bit of a perception that it's more about servers, less about networking. I would love for you to just flesh that out, what that means to Cisco."", 'Charles H. Robbins', ""Amit, thank you very much. So obviously, with the lower guide, we talked about the feeling that there's some macro uncertainty. We talked to our teams in preparation for this, and they obviously submitted their forecast. And what we really saw was what they previously told us 90 days ago relative to the second half versus what they told us a couple of weeks ago had changed materially, which means customers are pushing things out and putting a little more scrutiny on them. So that's the difference that we've seen.As far as trying to break down what percentage comes from each of those -- the 3, including the digestion issue as well as the telco and SP piece, I think it's pretty difficult to do, honestly. However, I will say that we think that the consumption of the elevated inventory levels should be -- we should be through that by the end of our fiscal year. We think that the SP telcos -- the SP telco and cable side of it, we're hopeful that in '25, they will begin investing again. We originally had anticipated that they would begin to invest in the second half of this year, and we no longer believe that to be true.And I think that -- so I think the consumption issue and the SP thing -- or the consumption issue is temporary through the end of the year. The macro thing is one that we're going to have to wait and see and the SP telco probably similarly. And all of these things led us obviously to reset the second half of the year.On the NVIDIA partnership, it is definitely Ethernet. I was in the meeting when we first talked about this with Jensen, and he agreed that we would include our Ethernet technology with their GPUs and creating the stack. There will also be servers as well, and there'll be multiple versions of this over time. So -- but it will include our Ethernet technology when they're connecting multiple clusters."", 'Operator', 'Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley.', 'Meta A. Marshall', ""Maybe you've mentioned service provider, but I guess -- just getting a sense of whether you're seeing more weakness on data center or edge or if it comes to kind of the 5 investment priorities that you had noted that enterprises had a couple of quarters ago. Are any one of those areas still getting prioritized significantly versus not getting prioritized significantly? And then just maybe as a second question, how are you seeing enterprises think about AI and think about where the budgets for AI are coming from? Just any commentary would be helpful there."", 'Charles H. Robbins', ""Yes. Thanks, Meta. So I would say that what we do see customers investing in is clearly cybersecurity. We see Observability as you saw the 16% growth rate. We even saw Collaboration positive this quarter, which was a good sign. They are at various phases of still dealing with this hybrid work situation. We had a very strong quarter with our devices, our video device businesses.We see customers investing in their customer experience through technologies like contact center. And so we see a lot of that. We see customers continuing to invest in their application rearchitecture, which leads to both Observability opportunities as well as the re-architecture of their networks to deal with the traffic flows that we've been talking about for a couple of years. I think the real issue right now is that we ship so much networking in our core business that, that's where the challenge is, that they're just trying to get all that implemented right now.As it relates to the enterprise and how they're thinking about AI, what I would tell you is that over the last 90 days, we began to see the pipeline for AI use cases in the enterprise began to emerge. And there's heavy work going on in financial services. I would say it's early in what they're trying to think through, but we are seeing opportunities arise. And I think that there have been some comments, not enough for me to translate this to a massive trend, but there were some comments from some of our field teams that they see customers holding budget back just to be ready to expend it on AI once they get their strategy fully baked. So that's about what I could tell you at this point."", 'Operator', 'David Vogt with UBS.', 'David Vogt', ""So maybe I just want to step back for a second, Chuck, and maybe for Scott also. If I look at your guide for this year, I mean, we're basically back to fiscal '19 revenue levels. So I'm just trying to think about how your longer-term model works in the context of that 5% to 7% guide that you laid out at the investor briefing a number of years ago as sort of customers digest product.Obviously, it would suggest that maybe there's some more share loss going on in the core networking portfolio, given some of the other parts of the business has grown. So I just want to kind of try to get a sense of how you're thinking about the portfolio today, given we're kind of back to fiscal '19. And then from a profitability standpoint, obviously, you've done a tremendous job, and I would imagine the cost cutting goes along those lines to keep margins higher. But is there an opportunity to use margin and maybe price going forward to take back some of the share if there's a disruption in the market by a potential strategic transaction in the marketplace today?"", 'Richard Scott Herren', ""Yes. David, I'll start and then Chuck, you can chime in on share. The way to think about the 5% to 7%, if you go back to when we gave that metric, you remember, it was in 2021, actually pre all of the supply chain volatility that we've seen. And since then, of course, we've seen the supply chain set in, which caused a spike in product orders and then a subsequent big building up of our backlog. As we cleared the backlog, we saw a spike in revenue. And so it's been difficult to look at year-on-year compares as all those dynamics were going on.What we're seeing now is as we've cleared the backlog, and we cleared it very quickly, given the strength of our supply chain team, that bottleneck has just moved downstream. So I don't think you can look at this year's revenue and try to somehow compare it to historical because of all the moving parts underneath the covers. What underpinned that 5% to 7% when we gave it to you was that's the aggregated growth of the TAM of the markets that we play in, right? And so at this point, we still see that as the longer term where we're headed.I think looking at year-on-year growth rates, I don't think you're going to see those growth rates begin to normalize until we work through the inventory that's in the field right now, which is one of the biggest headwinds we've got, right? And then we can get back to regular ordering and then you need to lap that, right? You need to go 4 quarters out to be able to compare it to a more normalized point. So I think that's the way you need to think about that longer term. But there's no change at this point. We'll update the longer-term model after we finish the acquisition of Splunk and can give you better insight into what we look like as a combined company."", 'Charles H. Robbins', 'Yes. David, on the share loss, I think if you look at the -- just look at the last published reports that came out after Q...', 'Richard Scott Herren', '3, calendar.', 'Charles H. Robbins', ""Calendar Q3, in our 4 largest markets -- so if you take campus switching, you take wireless and you take SP routing, we actually gained share. So I don't know where the share loss thesis is coming from. When you look at data center switching, you will see it show up as a share loss. But to be -- we have to understand that one of our major competitors there reports their webscale sales into data center switching, and we report our webscale sales into SP routing. So those turn into sort of apples and oranges categories. But the others, based on the last reports that were put out, we actually have gained share if you look at a rolling 4 quarter even over the last 3 years."", 'Operator', 'Simon Leopold with Raymond James.', 'Simon Matthew Leopold', ""I've got an easy one and a little bit harder one. I'll start with the easy one and then ask the other. It just looks like your order trajectory is getting somewhat better. So the orders this quarter, down 12%, not too bad. And I know you don't forecast orders, but maybe if you can talk about when you expect orders could turn positive again, given the comparison and the trend.The other question I wanted to see if you could discuss how you envision the AI clusters in terms of will the webscale operators choose multiple vendors in a single cluster or will they designate maybe different data centers to different suppliers? Or will they mix and match? How do you see the split playing out, particularly in the hyperscale opportunity? And I really mean this more longer term, '25, '26, not currently when we're dominated by InfiniBand, but when Ethernet starts taking more share."", 'Charles H. Robbins', ""Yes. Thanks, Simon. So on the order trajectory, I think what -- we clearly don't guide bookings. But what I would tell you is that even as our teams modified their second half outlook, the second half will still be more favorable than the first half. So your assessment of sort of the trajectory, I think, is valid, and I'll leave it at that.On the AI clusters, I think it's a good question because what you'll hear is us and competitors talking about a number of webscale players that are using our technology underneath GPUs, our Ethernet technology underneath GPUs. And so I think it's important to remember they always tend to have a dual vendor strategy. They always want 2 sources. And so we're both actually -- the 2 of us are actually playing in this space today. And I'd say today, they're completely homogenous clusters. And I think it's too early to tell whether there will be some benefit over time for them to mix those. My sense is, unless there's something that changes significantly or there's some sort of technology reason for GPUs to be mixed, which I can't speak to at this point, I don't think the underlying network will be mixed. I just don't think there's any benefit for them to do that."", 'Operator', 'Tal Liani with Bank of America.', 'Tal Liani', ""I have 2 questions. The first one is Security. The market is great. And we met 2 years ago and 3 years ago when you spoke about new strategy and going to market, but it's still only growing 3%. What is happening there? And what can you do to fix Security and benefit from this market growth? And then maybe I'll ask my follow-up."", 'Charles H. Robbins', ""Okay. Thanks, Tal. So I think over the last few quarters, I've been pretty consistent that we thought the second half of this fiscal year, we would start to see an acceleration of Security, and I can give you some highlights where we are seeing some of that -- some green shoots early. Some of the new innovation like XDR and Secure Access, Multicloud Defense suites are -- we're seeing good pipeline build with those technologies.XDR, we now -- we announced that in April of last year, we shipped it in August, and we have 230 customers, 230-plus customers on the platform today. And the important thing to remember is that it's a big platform play. And we actually typically see that as a 6- to 9-month sales cycle. So to have 230 customers already, I think, is a statement on the value that our customers are seeing. That's going to be a real important integration point with Splunk, by the way. So that we see. We see -- we feel good about the pipeline.From a demand perspective, just to give you some insight, the Americas, the demand was almost double digits this past quarter, which is the highest we've seen in a while. So I think we're seeing a lot of good indicators. And if you just watch over the next 6 to 9 months, you're going to see more and more innovation that comes out. And I think you'll begin to believe and see the results around that same time frame."", 'Operator', 'Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan.', 'Samik Chatterjee', ""Chuck, I'm going to, for my first question, ask you to go back to sort of the drivers of demand that you're seeing here. We walked away from the call last time sensing a sense of optimism about a sharp rebound when you see the inventory digestion complete. But I guess what I'm hearing from you today is even as that inventory digestion ends in fiscal '24, you're seeing a bit more of a macro impact on your customer demand. And are your expectations still sort of intact in terms of thinking about a more sharp rebound as you go into fiscal '25, if you can share what you're seeing from customers there?And for my follow-up, the NVIDIA partnership, how should we think about the impact of that on your AI order target of $1 billion? Or is it really most of that partnership that realizes beyond that sort of target window, target time frame?"", 'Charles H. Robbins', ""Thanks. I would say on the -- the thing that's changed from last quarter is that we do just see a little more caution with our customers. I don't want to over-rotate and say that it's a massive shift, but we definitely saw more caution. We talked with our sales leaders ahead of the call, and they indicate -- we asked them point-blank, was there more caution or the same caution from the prior quarter? And we heard more, a little bit more. And then we saw the pushout of the forecast. So that just tells us that there is a little bit more in the system. So therefore, I think we need a couple of quarters to see it play out before we can declare what's going to happen in fiscal '25.On the NVIDIA discussion, a couple of comments. We talked about the $1 billion of orders, which I know someone is going to ask me about at some point. And what I would say is that in the last 90 days, our pipeline of AI opportunities continue to grow. The pipeline is now almost 3x that particular number that we gave last time, which were more orders that we see in '25. The total pipeline is now about 3x that, roughly 3x that. And I would say that virtually none of that is anything associated with the NVIDIA partnership yet. It's all independent of that."", 'Operator', 'Ben Reitzes with Melius Research.', 'Benjamin Alexander Reitzes', ""Chuck, Scott, I wanted to ask about the HPE-Juniper deal. Are you seeing any uncertainty in the market near term? And how do you think that helps you long term? And if you -- Chuck, if you don't mind, just with regard to that last AI comment, your -- one of your competitors, obviously, is expecting quite a big pick up next year, next calendar year. Do you feel like that AI $3 billion in pipeline or so kicks in next year, next calendar year? Or what's your timing on that?"", 'Charles H. Robbins', ""Thanks, Ben. So I would say on the HPE-Juniper deal, the one area where they have meaningful overlap is in wireless, and I don't know if there's any connection to the fact that we had a 50% increase in $1 million-plus wireless deals sequentially. So it's hard to say. But I mean there is a lot of noise in the system or in the industry about what they do there, but I can't say specifically that any customers have talked to me about it, to be honest. So I think we're -- I think it's a little early for them to -- for the customers to be expressing that concern. They may be asking them directly, but they're not talking to us.On the timing, yes, I think we said fiscal '25, which starts in August of this year. And I think you probably should assume most of that is probably in the second half, I would guess, but we'll see how things play out. I think customers are going to move as fast as they possibly can, but we're still in the early strategy and planning stages right now on most of it. The pipeline stuff are well-defined use cases that are already in place with certain customers, and we're actually just working through the opportunities."", 'Richard Scott Herren', ""Yes. But Ben, our expectation is the majority of that $1 billion in orders will turn into revenue in our fiscal '25, just to be clear."", 'Operator', 'Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank.', 'Matthew Niknam', ""I'll keep it to one and one follow-up. So main question, just around inventory digestion. Is that dynamic primarily affecting enterprise and commercial customers? And can you talk a little bit about the visibility you've got towards this actually resolving itself by fiscal year-end? And then a follow-up just on gross margins. You were fairly stable sequentially, and I think the guide implies more of the same. So I'm just wondering, are we now largely past a lot of the supply chain dynamics or headwinds? Or has anything changed on the supply chain front?"", 'Charles H. Robbins', ""Yes. So I'll take the first, and then Scott, you can take the second. On the inventory digestion issue, I think it's -- I would say it's largely an enterprise and a service provider issue. And particularly the cloud providers, we think they've got probably in excess of 20-plus weeks of inventory that they're working through right now as they built up when the lead times were so long.We have a lot of our enterprise products that are tethered to the cloud for management perspectives. And so we see the lag between when we ship it to the customer and when they connected. I gave the Meraki example in my prepared remarks. And so we do have visibility, and we can actually see on some aspects of the portfolio how the time frame between shipments and connectivity is shrinking, and it's not shrinking as fast as we thought it would, which leads us to believe this is going to extend through the end of '24. So that's where we are. Scott, gross margins?"", 'Richard Scott Herren', ""Yes. What you saw in the quarter is, of course, gross margins continue to show a year-on-year improving trend, roughly flat, as you said, sequentially. There's a couple of dynamics. But to your question on where does this settle in, I think it settles in, in the range we're in right now, in the 66% to 67% range through the end of the year. There's both the things that are happening from a freight and delivery standpoint, freight costs with what's happening in the Red Sea have gone up slightly, and we continue to see a little bit of component pressure, although in the commodity sections, we're seeing some benefit there.The scale of the services ramp-up, as you -- obviously, services revenue trails the product revenue. We had those 3 really strong quarters of product revenue growth. We're seeing the tail of that now in our services revenue growth. And since a lot of the cost underneath our services are fixed, you get better leverage when that happens. So I think when you add all those together, we should settle in, in the 66% to 67% range. And the majority of, if not all of the supply chain constraints that we felt are behind us at this point."", 'Operator', 'Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs.', 'Michael Ng', ""I just have 2. First, just on the revenue guidance. I think based on the midpoint of it, the implied fiscal 4Q revenue guidance only implies about plus 1% quarter-on-quarter. Given that we're back to a normal backlog, what's preventing that from going back to a more normal level of seasonality? And then as a follow-up to Amit's question earlier on the NVIDIA AI deal, I just wanted to clarify. I understand that it's Ethernet, but will it be both NVIDIA's Spectrum-X as well as Cisco's Ethernet? And how will that be sold together, if that's the correct assumption?"", 'Richard Scott Herren', ""Michael, on the midpoint of the revenue guide, the math would lead you to what you just said. I think no one ever wants to have to reset guidance, much less have to do it twice. We -- as Chuck just said, as we look at all the various factors coming in from the field, we see caution. And I think you should expect that there's caution in our guide at this point."", 'Charles H. Robbins', 'On the NVIDIA front, I think, look, one of the key benefits that they see is leveraging our enterprise go-to market and our global ecosystem and partner community. And therefore, when we are -- when these solutions are flowing through our channels and our sales teams and our partners, it will be Cisco Ethernet.', 'Operator', 'George Notter with Jefferies.', 'George Charles Notter', ""I guess I'm just curious about -- are there any mechanisms or activities you guys are using to help accelerate the clearance of inventory from the channel? Any price discounting, any rebating, stock rotation? How are you taking an active approach here?"", 'Charles H. Robbins', ""I'll comment -- I'll make one quick comment. I think I said this in my prepared remarks as well. We've deployed a lot of transaction services for some of our larger customers just to help them do that. And I know that our sales teams were talking this week, Scott, maybe you remember or you have some more detail on looking at some partner incentives to help?"", 'Richard Scott Herren', ""Yes. We absolutely are working with the field on that. In a lot of cases, it boils down to a lack of the skilled resources required at both -- sometimes at our partner level, sometimes at the customer level to get that done. There's only so much you can do to accelerate it. We have put in place incentives to make that accelerate. To your other point on cancellations or stock rotation, we're seeing those continuing to be well below where they were prepandemic. So we're not seeing any of that -- any pressure on that front."", 'Operator', 'Woo Jin Ho with Bloomberg Intelligence.', 'Woo Jin Ho', ""Given that most of the weakness is going to be on the networking side, could you just talk a little bit more about the future software subscription renewal rates? You did a good job this quarter with software subscriptions going up 5%, but given that networking is poised to be down, I'm curious where that's heading going forward."", 'Richard Scott Herren', ""Yes. I think -- thanks for the question, Woo Jin. I think the way to think about it is we put a -- as you can imagine, when you built up the level of annualized recurring revenue that we have, we've put a huge amount of focus on both customer success and driving adoption and then turning that adoption into renewals. We've invested fairly heavily in that space over the last couple of years, and we're seeing renewal rates respond accordingly.When you look at where we're more software-heavy outside of networking, but in both security and collab, as you saw, we reported growth -- revenue growth in both of those categories. Observability is almost exclusively software, and we posted 16% revenue growth in observability. So we are seeing that actually trend in the right direction."", 'Operator', 'Tim Long with Barclays.', 'Timothy Patrick Long', ""One question, one follow-up. So first, maybe, Chuck, can you talk a little bit about the kind of margin growth trade-off with the head count reduction? Obviously protecting margin here, but how do you think about that trade-off given the challenging growth we've seen? And then just on a follow-up with all of the AI comments, Chuck, could you just remind us kind of where we are with -- from a product standpoint, are you seeing more traction for Silicon One or software or the full system products? If you could just give us a little color on kind of where you're seeing that pipeline growing?"", 'Charles H. Robbins', ""Yes. Thanks, Tim. So on the margin growth trade-off, we're always considering that, and we're very disciplined, though. And we think that gross margins are clearly a reflection of the value that your customers see and your technology and what you deliver. And if you look at a lot of our competitors and you look at some of the market share -- I mean, some of the gross margins that they have, that tells you that they're viewed more as a commodity. And I think that our customers see real value in what we deliver to them. So while we always look at margins versus growth, we also are -- we're just disciplined across both.On the AI front, Silicon One is a big play, clearly. We've delivered next-generation silicon into several of the cloud providers right now. We've got the Ethernet running in 3 of the 4 big ones. And we'll use the same silicon in the enterprise data center over time.We've got GPUs in our UCS platforms. And so it's evolving, but we have -- I tell our teams, unlike the original cloud transition that we talked on this call several times about how we were not prepared for the infrastructure play in the cloud world, I think we are absolutely ready and well equipped to succeed in this transition to AI. It will be a tailwind for us as we get into it over time."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.', 'Aaron Christopher Rakers', ""I'll stick to one, just building on that last question. I know over periods of time, you've talked a little bit about how large your webscale business is. Can you just remind us again the presence you have in some of the webscale opportunities either from a size -- and maybe ex the AI discussion, what kind of growth rates you're seeing, particularly with those webscale customers right now?"", 'Charles H. Robbins', ""So our team measures what -- their use cases or franchises or however you want to think about it, there are specific areas within the infrastructure that we identify for each of the webscale players. And Scott, keep me honest, I want to say we're designed into 16 or..."", 'Richard Scott Herren', '21.', 'Charles H. Robbins', ""21 of those. And so that's how I would think about it. I don't think that right now, if you looked at the growth numbers, they wouldn't be reflective of what's going on because they're just digesting inventory right now. So they're not in a position where they need to order a lot because lead times have normalized so much. So I don't think that's -- it's not even relevant. I think understanding those 21 use cases -- and as I said earlier, they want dual source, and they want dual source all the way down to the silicon level. In the traditional days with carriers, they wanted 2 vendors who would provide 2 different integrated systems. In this case, that may be the case with cloud, but they also look at silicon. They look at components. They're very deep on wanting to make sure that they have resiliency and optionality."", 'Richard Scott Herren', ""Aaron, the only thing I'd add is, and we said it earlier, there's no question that over time, given the way we're positioned, both from a complete box, a white box and a silicon standpoint, there's no question that AI is a tailwind for us longer term."", 'Operator', 'James Fish with Piper Sandler.', 'James Edward Fish', ""Scott, based on a couple of comments you made around gross margins. Just wondering, was supply chain starting to go the other way and supply more readily available? Could we see the price increases enacted in the past now have to be given back? And any sense to how should we think about the annualized cost savings on these reductions, understanding there are people here and it's difficulty and what areas you guys expect to kind of reduce down and if some of those reductions are filled elsewhere in terms of like a net basis on head count?"", 'Richard Scott Herren', ""Yes. On the price declines, you got to remember, go back to why we put the price increases in to begin with. And that was really to offset the higher cost that we were seeing from many of our suppliers as everyone was dealing with constraints, and supply/demand is pretty straightforward.What we haven't seen in the wake of this, some of the commodities, the prices have come down. Memory is a good example. What we haven't seen broadly is cost decreases coming in from our providers at this point. And so with that -- and you see that reflected in our gross margins, which have returned to a more normal range, but are still sitting in that 66% to 67% range. So I'm not anticipating at this point price declines, pending significant cost declines coming into us.On the cost savings, you can see where we are year-to-date. We've got a -- if you just look at operating expenses for a minute, year-to-date, operating expenses are modestly up. And after working our way through the restructuring that we discussed today, for the full year, we think they'll be modestly down. So I think that's probably the right way to think about it as you're looking to build your model."", 'Ahmed Sami Badri', ""Thank you, Jim.

I'm excited to join you today to share an update on Atmus. I will discuss our fourth quarter and full year financial results and our outlook for 2024. I will also share some of the significant progress we have made implementing our growth strategy."", ""First, let's discuss our performance in the fourth quarter. We drove strong financial performance in the fourth quarter, delivering an impressive finish to our first year as a public company. Sales were 400 million, compared to 385 million during the same period last year, an increase of approximately 4%. Adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter was 71 million, or 17.9%, compared to 53 million, or 13.9%, in the prior period."", 'Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter excludes 8 million of one-time stand-alone costs and 7 million for the same period last year. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.49 in the fourth quarter of 2023 and adjusted free cash flow was 30 million. Adjusted free cash flow excludes 4 million of one-time capital expenditures related to separation from Cummins. As expected, we saw some continued destocking and softer freight activity, which dampened revenues from our aftermarket.', 'This was offset by continued strong demand in U.S. first-fit markets. India markets remained strong. And in China, we saw demand slowly recovering.', ""Now, let's review our full year results. Sales for 2023 were 1.63 billion, an increase of approximately 4% from 2022. Adjusted EBITDA margin rose 300 basis points from the prior year to 18.6%. EBITDA has been adjusted for one-time separation costs, which were 29 million in 2023, compared to 9 million in 2022."", 'Adjusted earnings per share was $2.31 for the full year and adjusted free cash flow was 152 million. Free cash flow has been adjusted for 9 million of one-time capital expenditures related to our separation. Turning to our global markets now, I want to share some insight into the material drivers for our business and provide you with our guidance for 2024. Our business is diversified geographically, and the length of the cycle for aftermarket and first-fit varies.', ""In 2024, we anticipate first-fit and aftermarket will be countercyclical. Let's start with aftermarket for both on-highway and off-highway markets. As a reminder, aftermarket represents approximately 80% of our global revenues. We experienced softer freight activity and destocking during the second half of 2023 in on-highway markets."", 'In North America, which represents a significant portion of our business, we saw the Cass Freight Index down about 9% in the second half compared to prior year and down 5.5% over the full year. We believe we are largely through the destocking and expect on-highway aftermarket to improve as we move through 2024, driven by growth in freight activity. In global off-highway markets, we are monitoring several key industries. We expect construction in North America will be supported by resilient demand in nonresidential construction, which is aided, in part, by government infrastructure spending.', 'In Europe, we expect the weakness in construction activity to continue due to overall economic conditions. And global mining markets are expected to be relatively flat from a robust 2023. Based on these market assumptions, we anticipate overall aftermarket for on-highway and off-highway to be flat to up 3%. Turning to our global first-fit markets, our three key geographies are the U.S., China, and India.', 'In the U.S., we anticipate heavy-duty truck will be down 10% to 15% and medium-duty truck will be flat to down 5%. We expect the first half demand will remain robust before it begins to decline in the second half of 2024. The recovery in China has been sluggish, and we anticipate a continued muted recovery. We expect heavy-duty and medium-duty truck production to be in the range of down 5% to up 10%.', 'China is the most difficult market for us to forecast, leading to this wide range in outlook. In India, we see industry demand for trucks to be flat to up 5% for the year, driven by strong on-highway performance. As a result of these market drivers and our growth plans, we anticipate total revenue to be down 1% to up 3%, resulting in guidance for global sales in the range of 1.61 billion to 1.675 billion in 2024. We expect continued strong operational performance and to deliver adjusted EBITDA margins of 18.25% to 19.25%.', 'Additionally, we anticipate adjusted EPS will be in the range of $2.10 to $2.35. Now, I would like to take a moment to share the progress we have made on implementing our four-pillar growth strategy. The first pillar is to grow share in first-fit. While our first-fit business represents about 20% of our overall business, it is the foundation for driving recurring revenue in our aftermarket.', ""We are a leader in fuel filtration and crankcase ventilation products, and we are focused on growing this leadership position with global OEM customers. We are winning with the winners and have continued to secure Cummins' new vehicle platform. As an independent company, we also have the ability to accelerate growth with other leading global OEMs. Additionally, we are continually investing in new product development."", 'In 2023, we opened two new technical centers for key global markets. The first center opened in Wuhan, China and our second is our global capability center in Pune, India. Our second pillar is to accelerate profitable growth in the aftermarket. We are transforming our global distribution capabilities to provide our customers with industry-leading product availability.', 'We established three new distribution centers in Brazil, Mexico, and Dallas, Texas, and we have also transitioned our largest distribution center in Kentucky from Cummins. We have plans in place to establish independent distribution centers in Europe and Asia-Pacific in 2024. Furthermore, we have a unique multichannel path to diverse global markets, which includes an exclusive agreement with Cummins to distribute our products. At the same time, we are growing our distribution network and have expanded our presence in key independent channels in North America, Brazil, and Mexico.', 'This increase in channel presence will support continued growth in our aftermarket. The third pillar is transform our supply chain. We are investing in our manufacturing capacity to improve automation and provide our customers with industry-leading products. We completed our fully automated green cartridge production line in France.', 'In Korea, we are expanding our production capabilities for our NanoNet filtration media. These investments will continue to improve our operational excellence and operating costs. Our fourth pillar is to expand into industrial filtration markets. We intend to pursue this growth inorganically through a disciplined programmatic approach.', ""Our capital allocation priorities will continue to reflect our focus to grow, both organically and inorganically. In closing, I want to take the opportunity to provide you with an update on Cummins' announcement to launch the share exchange. As expected, Cummins has announced they will commence an exchange offer to fully split off their remaining interest in Atmus. We have filed a registration statement on Form S-4 with the Securities and Exchange Commission today in connection with the Cummins' announcement."", ""Pursuant to the exchange offer, common shareholders will have the opportunity to exchange their shares of Cummins common stock to shares of Atmus. Upon successful completion, Cummins will no longer be the controlling shareholder of Atmus. The completion of the exchange offer will be a significant milestone for Atmus, allowing us to unlock our full potential and accelerate the delivery of our growth strategy. I am proud of our Atmus team who've worked hard to deliver these results."", 'As I reflect on 2023, we made significant progress, and this fuels my belief in what is possible for Atmus as a fully independent company. I am even more excited for the opportunities we have in front of us in 2024. Now, I will turn the call over to Jack, who will discuss our financial results in more detail.', 'Jack Kienzler -- Chief Financial Officer', 'Thank you, Steph, and good morning, everybody. We delivered another strong quarter of financial performance in the fourth quarter. Sales were 400 million, compared to 385 million during the same period last year, an increase of approximately 4%. The increase in sales was primarily driven by pricing and the favorable impacts of currency, partially offset by a decrease in volume.', 'Gross margin for the fourth quarter was 106 million, an increase of 23 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. In addition to pricing, we also benefited from lower freight and commodities, which more than offset the impact of lower volumes. As a reminder, during the fourth quarter of 2022, we took action to significantly rightsize our inventory and experienced short-term operational inefficiencies as we slowed production. These actions did not repeat in 2023.', 'Selling, administrative, and research expenses for the fourth quarter were 58 million, an increase of 6 million over the same period in the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by higher administrative costs related to our separation from Cummins, in addition to the impact of higher variable compensation, driven by overall company performance. Joint venture income was 9 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of 2 million from 2022, due to increased performance at our joint ventures in India and China. This resulted in adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 71 million, or 17.9%, compared to 53 million, or 13.9%, in the prior period.', 'Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter excludes 8 million of one-time stand-alone costs and excludes 7 million for the same period last year. These one-time costs primarily relate to the establishment of functions previously co-mingled with Cummins such as information technologies, distribution centers, and human resources. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.49 in the fourth quarter of 2023, which was the same amount in the prior year. Higher interest expense incurred from debt issued at our IPO offset stronger underlying financial results.', ""Adjusted free cash flow was 30 million this quarter, compared to 63 million in the prior year. Last year, we generated significant cash flow from the reduction of our inventory as supply chains improved. Now, let's discuss our full year 2023 financial results. Sales were 1.63 billion, compared to 1.56 billion in 2022, an increase of 4%."", 'We benefited from 102 million of pricing actions, which were partially offset by 34 million of lower volume and 2 million of foreign exchange headwinds. Gross margin was 433 million, an increase of 74 million from 2022. In addition to favorable pricing, we saw commodities and freight improved by 41 million. This was partially offset by lower volumes and unfavorable manufacturing costs.', 'Selling, administrative, and research expenses for the full year 2023 were 217 million, an increase of 39 million compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by administrative costs related to the separation from Cummins and variable compensation. Variable compensation is higher this year as our employees delivered strong results relative to our plan. Our team will receive the payout of the incentive compensation in the first quarter of 2024, which will impact first quarter cash flow from operations.', 'Joint venture and other income was 37 million in 2023, compared to 32 million in the prior year, primarily due to increased performance of our India joint venture. Adjusted EBITDA was 302 million, or 18.6%, compared to 243 million, or 15.6%, in 2022. One-time costs related to separation were 29 million for the full year 2023, compared to 9 million in 2022. We believe these costs will be in the range of 5 million to 15 million in 2024 as significant progress on our separation was achieved in 2023.', 'The effective tax rate for 2023 was 24.3%, compared to 19.6% in 2022. The increase was driven by a change in the mix of earnings between U.S. and foreign operations related to a legal entity restructuring implemented in anticipation of the IPO and separation. For the full year 2023, adjusted EPS was $2.31, compared to $2.13 in 2022.', ""Higher interest expense incurred from debt issued at our IPO lowered results in 2023. For the full year 2023, adjusted free cash flow was 152 million, compared to 129 million in 2022. Strong profitability and a focus on working capital management generated robust cash flow, which was partially offset by increased interest expense. Now, let's turn to the strength of our balance sheet at the end of 2023."", 'We ended the year with 168 million of cash on hand, driven by strong free cash flow generation. Combined with the full availability of our 400 million revolving credit facility, we have 568 million of available liquidity. Our cash position and strong performance during 2023 has resulted in a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 1.4 times at the end of the year. Our balance sheet provides us with operational flexibility as we enter 2024 to focus on value creation and delivering total shareholder value by deploying capital for both continued organic growth and strategic inorganic initiatives.', 'In closing, I want to thank our global team for their commitment, which allowed us to deliver exceptional results during our first calendar year as a public company. We are looking forward to continuing our momentum as we execute on our strategy in 2024. Now, we will take your questions.', '', 'Operator', ""The floor is now open for your questions. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Joe O'Dea with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead."", ""Joe O'Dea -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst"", 'Hi. Good morning.', 'Jack Kienzler -- Chief Financial Officer', 'Good morning, Joe.', ""Joe O'Dea -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst"", 'I wanted to start on the revenue outlook. And so, aftermarket, flat to plus 3; total, down 1 to up 3. What are you thinking about for first-fit range and just any commentary on, you know, within that range, are you anticipating share gain, you know, any kind of sizing of share gain opportunity?', 'Steph Disher -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Yeah. Good morning, Joe. Thank you for your question. So, let's talk about the first-fit side, as you talked about."", ""And as a reminder, this drives about 20% of our revenue overall. The range I would point you to is at the low end, down 14%; and at the higher end, down 5%, with a mid-range of 9.5% down. That -- so that's the range we're seeing on market outlook, obviously heavily driven by the U.S. exposure to first-fit in our heavy-duty markets."", ""Medium duty, as I talked about, we expect not to be down quite as much given the inventory levels there. In terms of share gains, we do see some share gain, and I'd point you to our overall growth algorithm over the long run. Generally speaking, we see our market run at 2%, and we talk to price of 1% and share gains of 1% to 2%. And in this case, we've got it in at around 1%."", ""Joe O'Dea -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst"", ""And then just any kind of first half versus second half perspective on how you're thinking about it? You know, not sure to what degree first-fit demand is holding up better in the first half and if that would kind of slide that you'd see aftermarket come in in a stronger way in the back half."", 'Steph Disher -- Chief Executive Officer', ""The way we're seeing it is that we expect first-fit to remain pretty resilient through the first quarter and into the second quarter and then drop off more in the second half. Then on the aftermarket side, we actually expect that to be countercyclical. We'll have to see how this plays out, of course. We saw the aftermarket, particularly the on-highway markets in the U.S., significantly down in the third and fourth quarters."", ""I think I referenced it already, but that Cass Index is a good indicator of that for us. It was down 9% in the second half of 2023. So, as a comparative, as we head into the second half of 2024, we do expect an inflection point in freight activity in the aftermarket. We also expect we're all the way through destocking now, and so we see some positive tailwinds for us in the aftermarket in the second half."", ""Joe O'Dea -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst"", ""I appreciate those details. And then, Steph, wanted to ask on M&A and just any commentary on kind of progress with the pipeline over the last six to nine months and then what goals you're setting for the M&A team globally into 2024?"", 'Steph Disher -- Chief Executive Officer', ""So, as we've talked about that our strategy, the fourth pillar of our strategy is to expand into industrial filtration markets. Certainly very determined to pursue that strategy. We've been working both on clarifying our strategy, the target markets we want to enter into, and then what is our opportunity to win in those markets. So, a lot of the work in the last year with my strategy team and my leadership team has been in that space of what markets we want to target and then how we're going to win in those particular markets by leveraging our technology capabilities but also our global footprint and distribution ability."", ""And so, we have a good view of that, I would say. We are now -- we've been building a pipeline of M&A. We've been regularly reviewing M&A targets throughout the course of the last year. That's allowing us to fine-tune our aims, I suppose, I would describe it."", ""The -- we are going to take a very disciplined approach to M&A, and we are working through -- the goals I'm giving the team is obviously I want to expand into industrial filtration markets and see an acquisition and growth through that. But very much, this needs to be the right acquisition that balances growth aspirations that we have with generating and creating value and returns."", ""Joe O'Dea -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst"", ""That's helpful. Thank you."", 'Jack Kienzler -- Chief Financial Officer', 'Thanks, Joe.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Rob Mason with Baird. Please go ahead.', 'Rob Mason -- Robert W. Baird and Company -- Analyst', 'Yes. Good morning, Steph and Jack, and congratulations on the quarter. I wanted to probe just your thoughts around what the puts and takes could be in gross margin for the year in your outlook. And specifically, I was curious your view on, you know, where cost is and also any efficiency gains that you can speak to.', 'And then maybe lastly, just how you think the 5 million to 15 million of one-time costs would flow through just the reported gross margin?', 'Steph Disher -- Chief Executive Officer', 'OK. Good morning, Rob. Thanks for the question. I might ask Jack to take the lead on this one.', 'Jack Kienzler -- Chief Financial Officer', ""It's great. Good morning, Rob. Thanks for your question. So, I'll start first with kind of the impacts of price and volume from a gross margin perspective."", ""For the full year, as Steph alluded, we're envisioning price of about 1%. Some puts and takes from a volume perspective, again, with aftermarket, you know, hopefully improving year on year, offset a bit by first-fit reductions, and then we have some share gain initiatives. All three of those put together equates to roughly, you know, an offset, if you will, at the gross margin level. And so, as you think about that benefit of price, what we're expecting is a pretty healthy incremental gross margin backdrop, partially offset by some continued investment in our separation activities."", ""You know, as we've talked about, we still have a few of our distribution centers to decouple from Cummins over the course of 2024 and into the beginning of 2025, which will obviously drive some of those one-time costs, but also drive some inefficiencies, which are inherent as you decouple this."", 'Rob Mason -- Robert W. Baird and Company -- Analyst', 'So, is it fair to think about gross margins kind of flattish year over year with the full year that you just reported then?', 'Jack Kienzler -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah. I think, generally speaking, we would see, you know, probably some gross margin expansion, driven by that pricing activity. The other input, Rob, which we're keeping a close eye on, is the input costs, right? And so, our baseline assumption and what we're seeing right now is that commodities and freight remain relatively flat year on year. Obviously, if those dynamics change, then we'll revisit price in order to preserve our margin."", 'Rob Mason -- Robert W. Baird and Company -- Analyst', 'Understand. Just as a follow-up, you mentioned distribution centers that would expand into Asia, Europe. How should we think about those activities in the context of share gain opportunities, principally in the aftermarket, but should we look for outsized share gain opportunity internationally as a result of some of those actions?', 'Steph Disher -- Chief Executive Officer', ""So, Rob, I would say, firstly, that we've progressed through most of our distribution center transition from Cummins already. So, we obviously focused on the larger distribution centers first. These remaining distribution centers in Asia-Pacific and Europe is part of that transition. So, really servicing our existing business and transitioning those distribution centers across."", ""As part of our overall supply chain transformation, we do see opportunity in terms of product availability through our distribution network overall, and we do expect that to accelerate growth in our aftermarket. I would say that's integrated in the overall sort of share summary that I gave you earlier in that algorithm of the 1% to 2% at the top-line growth level is how we're still thinking about it right now. Obviously, we'll continue to push for accelerating that growth further."", 'Rob Mason -- Robert W. Baird and Company -- Analyst', ""That's great. Thanks, Steph."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.', 'Jerry Revich -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst', 'Yes. Hi. Good morning, everyone.', 'Jack Kienzler -- Chief Financial Officer', 'Good morning, Jerry.', 'Steph Disher -- Chief Executive Officer', 'Good morning, Jerry.', 'Jerry Revich -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst', ""Steph, I'm wondering if we can just go back to the M&A topic, and, you know, when you look at the range of outcomes based on your M&A pipeline, can you just give us a sense of how much capital you think you could put to work over the next 12 to 18 months? And, you know, I appreciate that there's a wide range of outcomes, but can you just give us a flavor for your level of optimism on ability to move the needle on that part of the strategy within, you know, 12-month time frame?"", 'Steph Disher -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Thanks for the question, Jerry. Look, I would say I don't have an M&A-specific deal to talk to you at this point sitting here. My expectation is our capital allocation priorities will be very much focusing on creating the flexibility for us to make the right M&A investment when we identify that. That would be the first thing I would say."", ""Obviously, we're balancing other things in our capital allocation priorities as well, but you should expect our capital allocation priorities to demonstrate that. In terms of the size of targets and what we're looking at, you know, as said before, that we're really looking at targets in that $50 million to $60 million revenue range, generally speaking. Now, I don't intend to be bound to that, but I'm expecting that we're taking a programmatic approach to acquisitions. We want to build out our capabilities and the creation of value as we progress for expanding into industrial filtration markets."", ""And so, it will be, you know, that size level of revenue and then, you know, subject to market multiples, which I won't speculate on here as to how that might translate into capital allocation. But hopefully that gives you at least some thinking around the prioritization and how it sits around our growth plan."", 'Jerry Revich -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst', ""OK. Thank you. And, you know, separately, the '27 engine regulations coming into play, you spoke about potential to gain new platforms earlier in the call. Any opportunities with the '27 changeover, either for share or content, for you folks?"", 'Steph Disher -- Chief Executive Officer', ""We continue to be focused on being a leader in fuel filtration and crankcase ventilation, in particular. We are targeting all of those opportunities to grow our share in those platforms, and we're having success. And so, we have, obviously, a very strong partnership with Cummins, which we'll continue. And we've been able to secure those platforms with Cummins."", ""And we will continue to look to win other businesses on those platforms, and we've had some success in that as well. But this is very much focused on growing our share in fuel and crankcase ventilation as we see that opportunity coming up for 2027."", 'Jerry Revich -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst', ""OK. Super. And, you know, lastly, on the comments front with the transition of Daimler medium-duty engines, you know, nearly 100,000 units over the next, call it, five or so years, is that a global opportunity for you folks? Would you be -- would you benefit across the board on that or are there any regions where you wouldn't participate in and, you know, how do you expect the cadence of that transition to play out as you plan your capacity?"", 'Steph Disher -- Chief Executive Officer', 'We would absolutely expect that to be a global opportunity for us and to play out over a period of time. Our investment -- we pre-planned, obviously, our investment in capacity, and we are investing in capacity to ensure that we can meet and service that demand and support our customers.', 'Jerry Revich -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst', 'Yeah. Thank you.', 'Steph Disher -- Chief Executive Officer', 'Thanks.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Please go ahead.', 'Andrew Obin -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', 'Hi, guys. Good morning.', 'Steph Disher -- Chief Executive Officer', 'Good morning.', 'Andrew Obin -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', ""Congratulations on a great quarter. Just a question, in terms of when you talk about your aftermarket, you sort of mentioned that destock is almost over. So, as I look at your forecast, what is the headwind embedded in your number from the destock for the year and what sort of -- you know, I guess I'm trying to sort of figure out sell-through versus sell-in."", 'Steph Disher -- Chief Executive Officer', ""It's interesting, Andrew, as you look at the aftermarket projection, and I've given a range, you know, aftermarket of 0% to 3% --"", 'Andrew Obin -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', 'Correct.', 'Steph Disher -- Chief Executive Officer', ""As part of our overall guidance, with a midpoint of 1.5%. And so, it's difficult to, I would say, disentangle some of the freight indices and the freight activity from the destocking activity. While you would think that the destocking activity is just the supply side issues, you know, I do think it is intermingled in the freight downturn that we saw in the Cass Index, for example, of 9% in Quarter 3 and 4. So, look, the best projection I can give you in aftermarket at this point as we turn that corner and as I said, it's going to be more weighted to the second half is my expectation, particularly as we saw those headwinds in the second half of 2023, that it will be in that range of the 0% to 3%."", ""We haven't seen the inflection point yet of -- particularly in the on-highway markets of that turning. We're still seeing depressed freight activity. As I said, the destocking we've seen mostly conclude, but we're still seeing the depressed freight activity. We'll need to see that turn before we can give any more optimism around the aftermarket outlook."", 'Andrew Obin -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', ""Well, Rusty Rush called the bottom on freight for this summer earlier today. So, there we go. Sorry, I couldn't resist. But you know him, he's a character."", ""So, just a different question. After your full separation from Cummins, is the board planning to revisit potential cash return to shareholders? I know folks asking questions on M&A. Is that the first priority? What's the thinking on sort of return of capital to shareholders? Thank you."", 'Steph Disher -- Chief Executive Officer', ""No, thank you for the question. We certainly will revisit that with our board as we move through the share exchange and the transition. That, obviously, is subject to the board's decision, but we would certainly look to revisit that. I think, Jack, it may be worth you just talking about how we're thinking about the capital allocation priorities."", 'Jack Kienzler -- Chief Financial Officer', 'Yeah, absolutely. And thanks for the question, Andrew. So, just a reminder, you know, we are coming out of 2023 in a position of strength from a balance sheet perspective. As I mentioned, 586 million of liquidity and 1.4 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA.', 'You know, our No. 1 priority is to continue to reinvest in the business to enable top-line growth across our growth platforms, in addition to, you know, a successful operational separation from Cummins, obviously continuing to fund strategic growth initiatives with a focus on expansion into industrial filtration markets. As Steph mentioned, we will take a disciplined approach to that M&A, balancing profitable growth with return on invested capital. And then, you know, as you mentioned, continuing to evaluate cash returns to shareholders, with a goal of delivering strong total shareholder return.', ""We did pay down the revolver inside of Q3, and so I wouldn't expect any significant debt reductions outside of the contractual ones that we highlight."", 'Andrew Obin -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', 'Terrific. Thanks so much.', 'Jack Kienzler -- Chief Financial Officer', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Bobby Brooks with Northland Capital Markets. Please go ahead.', 'Bobby Brooks -- Northland Capital Markets -- Analyst', 'Hey. Good morning, team. Thank you for taking my question. So, pretty strong year-over-year revenue.', 'Steph Disher -- Chief Executive Officer', 'Good morning, Bobby, and welcome.', 'Bobby Brooks -- Northland Capital Markets -- Analyst', 'Hey. Thanks, Steph. I really appreciate it. So, pretty strong -- so, you know, really strong year-over-year revenue growth in the fourth quarter.', ""You know, you've met -- obviously, you already mentioned that it was driven by pricing and favorable impacts of, you know, currency, but slightly offset by decreased volumes. So, I was just wondering if you could maybe help frame how much of an impact each of those factors were in the fourth quarter. And then also maybe discuss how those -- and I mean, you kind of already touched on it, but if anything incremental that you want to add on, how those factors influence your 2024 guide?"", 'Steph Disher -- Chief Executive Officer', 'Thanks. Jack, do you want to take this?', 'Jack Kienzler -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah, absolutely, and welcome, Bobby. Good to hear from you. The -- so the -- some of the quarter-over-quarter dynamics: pricing versus last year in the same quarter was about 17 million or just about 4% year over year, volume was about an $8 million headwind or about a 2% reduction, and then some FX benefits of about 5 million or slightly over 1%. So, that's kind of the top-line backdrop."", ""As Steph mentioned, you know, as we look at 2024, we would expect price to be about 1% of a benefit, share gains of about 1%, offset by, you know, just about 1% of a net volume headwind, again, with the impacts of first-fit offsetting the expected recovery in aftermarket. As we think about, you know, '24 versus '23, I have not embedded any significant FX movements based on what we see right now."", 'Bobby Brooks -- Northland Capital Markets -- Analyst', ""Got it. Appreciate that. And then kind of shifting to the next question, you know, of the 11 distribution centers you guys had exiting 2023, you know, could you just remind me how many of those are in, you know, APAC, Europe, and that, you know, you don't -- you plan to split off from Cummins and just planned to, you know, stand up as your own sole distribution centers? And then could you discuss the financial impacts you've seen from and what you've learned from standing up the Brazil, Mexico, and Dallas facilities and maybe how you will apply those learnings to the rest of your footprint?"", 'Steph Disher -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Thanks for that question. We have currently four of the 11 shared facilities still with Cummins. And so, we'll look to transition those over a progressive plan over the course of 2024. And I think South Africa extends into 2025 as the only remaining one beyond this calendar year."", ""They are certainly -- we're at the tail end, if I describe it that way, of our distribution center transition. Still obviously very important to us in terms of our global footprint. But as I talked about earlier, we have prioritized the Pareto or the 80% of distribution centers and have moved through those effectively. In terms of what we've learned and the opportunities, generally, we've been able to phase the work within the quarter."", ""I would say, obviously, there is some build of inventory inside a quarter as we make the transition of the different facilities and set all of that up. Generally speaking, we've been able to do that in the quarter. There are, you know, the systems transitions and facilities transitions as part of this. And all I would say, I guess, is with each one of these, you get slicker in how you manage it, and so I'm not expecting any issues with the ones that are ahead of us."", ""We have a clear plan. And I'd expect us to manage our -- you know, to support our customers through that transition very effectively given how much practice we've had."", 'Bobby Brooks -- Northland Capital Markets -- Analyst', ""Got it. That's really good color. And then maybe just touching on, you know, the fully automated line -- manufacturing line in France, could you maybe just remind us like the timeline of, you know, when that was completed and maybe talk about -- because I know you guys want to be -- you know, take the learnings from that. And obviously, you specifically chose to do that in a high-cost region, right, to see those benefits most."", ""And just -- so along with the timeline, just talk about maybe when you think you could get to a point where you're comfortable with the learnings to maybe apply that to, you know, your manufacturing footprint elsewhere?"", 'Steph Disher -- Chief Executive Officer', 'Yeah. So, automation, overall, is a key part of our supply chain transformation strategy. For reference, our largest manufacturing facility is in Mexico, in San Luis Potosi. And so, our strategy for automation varies by location, I would describe, and also by, you know, the different lines and opportunity sets.', ""And so, we very much focused on the green cartridge line as one of our bigger automation undertakings, and it's a fully automated line, as distinct from -- in some cases such as in Mexico, we're using assisted robotics, which really removes some sets of the activity in the manufacturing line, but not all of it. So, there's been a lot of learnings for us in France as we've installed the green cartridge line. That decision was taken last year. I think commissioned earlier this year."", ""We've been trying to scale that up. So, certainly, I expect efficiency benefits as we get into 2024 associated with that line, in particular, because just how that all works together has taken us some time to land. Also part of that green cartridge line, you know, is not just the automation of it, but just the production ability that we had, and this will give us much more speed than our existing green cartridge line that's more manual to be able to support the really growing demand for this particular product in Europe and beyond. So, we will continue to strategically invest in that kind of capacity."", ""You know, that's -- and I guess the matching there is what's the regional requirements, what are the global requirements, and then do we best service those through a fully automated line or this other end of the spectrum of just robotics to support parts of the line?"", 'Bobby Brooks -- Northland Capital Markets -- Analyst', ""That's great.

For more on the movie landscape in 2024, we're talking to MoviePass Co-founder and CEO Stacy Spikes. Stacy, thanks so much for joining us. And, look, your business relies on people going to the movies. So what do you make of a disappointing weekend like we just saw? And are there any concerns if we continue to see that underperformance for your business?"", 'STACY SPIKES: Yeah. Actually, January is always a soft period. I think you\'re seeing some restocking going on, where you had a lot of content move out, and it\'s starting to move back in. But you\'re seeing titles like ""Dune,"" which is coming in March, which is normally someone who\'s going to sit in the fourth quarter or, say, the summer coming out in March. So I think that that\'s normal. And I-- but I don\'t see any big concern over it.', ""- And, Stacy, your company MoviePass just achieved its first year of profitability. And it wasn't too long ago that you bought this company out of bankruptcy. How were you able to get to that profitability? And what were the lessons learned along the way?"", ""STACY SPIKES: Yeah. Well, the amazing thing about it was back when the company was sold and went through its issues, we actually had the ability to benefit from a lot of AI and machine learning upgrades that we just didn't have back then. That was a big difference. And then our new credit system that we introduced also really made a big change in the business model and the capability of being able to perform properly. So that's the two major updates that we were able to do that really helped everything."", ""- And how can you sustain this profitability especially, when you're in an industry where we're seeing a lot of turmoil, especially with the influx of streaming services?"", ""STACY SPIKES: Yeah, maybe we're bullish and long on it. But the reality is we're seeing that the studios who were creating content for the streamers have seen the benefit, where you see them repurposing titles. We've had last year a commitment from Apple with more than $1 billion and Amazon, and even Netflix committing to the theatrical experience. So I think you've got a pipeline lag that you're looking at."", ""But all in all, people are coming back. You saw a lot of young people starting to use theaters as concert venues with the Taylor Swift concert and Beyoncé. So we're seeing it become more of a live event. You're seeing more IMAX releases. So all in all, I actually feel really positive about it."", ""- And I want to pick up on that point with the pipeline lag. Because in terms of consumer demand, I'm assuming you see more sign-ups when there's actually a lot of movies in the theater, right? Like this past summer with Barbenheimer. You mentioned the lulls that we've had post-COVID, post-Hollywood strikes. So is there a way that you could attract users to your platform when you perhaps don't have a ton of movies? I know you mentioned some of those examples. But what other ways could you boost that demand?"", ""STACY SPIKES: Yeah. For us as a business model, the major tent poles aren't the drivers and people wanting a subscription platform where they're going to experiment more. We find that they're actually more interested in the independent titles. And that's where the experimentation happens."", 'So just with the ""Dunes"" and the ""Spider-Mans"" and the IMAX titles, that really wouldn\'t change our business. It\'s just not enough of those titles. But it\'s all the smaller ones like we saw with ""Origin,"" we saw with ""Poor Things,"" a lot of the ones that are the Oscar nominees. That\'s where 75% of our members are under the age of 35. And they like to experiment. So if you\'re going to end up on our platform, there\'s a lot of inventory sitting there.', ""- Yeah, that's interesting, especially since we've seen sequels and that known IP really driving some of the box office there. But in terms of competition, we've seen things like AMC Stubs, other types of reward programs. How are you looking to combat those types of competitors out there and really stay on top of the game?"", ""STACY SPIKES: Yeah, great question. So the difference between MoviePass is you can go to literally any theater. So as long as it accepts major credit cards, that theater is open to your system. And with AMC, you can only go to an AMC. So that is a loyalty program just for them. But on average, in our system, the average customer goes to 2.4 different theater locations. So they want the ability last minute to make a decision and say, maybe I go over here. Maybe I go over there. They're deciding that day based on what times the different movies will start. And it gives them that flexibility."", ""And then the other benefit with MoviePass is you still can have a loyalty program at those theaters and get your reward points for going there as well. So it's kind of a double win with MoviePass versus being locked into only one theater circuit that you can get benefits from."", '- All right. Stacy Spikes, thank you so much. I\'m planning to watch ""Poor Things"" tonight. So I\'m excited. I need to watch all my Oscar movies because we\'re heading into award season very, very quickly with the Oscars coming up. So thank you again.', 'STACY SPIKES: You got it. Enjoy.']"

Investors are approaching this event on a high note, as Roku's stock price has increased by 72% over the last year. But the stock also stands 80% below the all-time highs from the summer of 2021, so it's not all rainbows and butterflies."", ""As the streaming wars heat up, Roku finds itself at a critical juncture. This week's results will set the stage for a new era in Roku's story of user growth and global expansion. On the eve of a potentially game-changing business update, let me walk you through where I see Roku going over the next three years."", 'In the earnings call two years ago, Roku\'s management called their company ""a leader in a very large global opportunity."" The ad-supported Roku Channel reached the households of 80 million viewers, the number of active Roku users stood at 60 million accounts, and the long-term vision was that digital-streaming platforms will replace old-school media channels and advertising options over time.', ""Those were the early days of the inflation crisis, though. Economic issues put a roadblock in front of Roku's progress in many ways, starting with limited advertiser interest and an industrywide slowdown in streaming viewership. Sector giants (and crucial content partners for Roku) such as Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) and Walt Disney (NYSE: DIS) ran into brick walls worthy of the Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote (a pair of cartoon characters)."", 'So how did the next couple of years work out for Roku in this challenging market?', 'Well, the stock price is down more than 40% from the eve of that fourth-quarter update. But trailing revenues are up by 22%, Roku sported 76 million active accounts in the latest earnings report, and the streaming hours just keep rising. As it turns out, Roku can generate healthy viewership growth even while many of its content suppliers are struggling individually.', 'The inflation-flavored lean years may be behind the media market at this point. Netflix posted double-digit percentage growth in subscriber counts for the last two quarterly reports. Disney expects to restart its stalled subscriber growth in the spring and report streaming profits in fiscal year 2024. Both stocks soared on their recent earnings reports, setting the stage for a strong Roku update, too.', 'Beyond that potential jump, Roku should be off to new growth adventures, driven by healthier financials. Armed with robust cash flows and rekindled growth prospects, the company is ready to push harder on its international expansion ambition. On top of that bullish trend, the digital advertising market is coming back to life.', ""Assuming the world economy doesn't run into another crippling crisis along the way (famous last words, I know), I expect Roku's user count to cross 100 million names over the next three years. I don't expect a towering pile of profits, since the company should remain in a high-octane growth mode for the foreseeable future. Instead, Roku will probably make heavy investments in original Roku TV content, marketing its international products and services, and the short-term research and development budgets will create long-term business drivers."", ""Roku's growth story is far from over; it's merely entering an exciting new chapter. Investors considering Roku stock right now should weigh the company's growth prospects against the backdrop of a brutally competitive streaming market -- where this company can be a winner no matter which streaming service walks away with the most subscribers, viewing hours, or profits. The platform people use to interact with their favorite streaming services remains the same, and no one can hold a candle to Roku's dominant market share in this space."", ""As Roku navigates the complexities of the digital landscape, its stock trades at a modest 4 times trailing sales. Streaming is the indisputable future of entertainment, and Roku plays a leading role in this digital revolution. If you pick up a few Roku shares this week, you'll probably want to thank me for the tip in 2027."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Roku right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Roku, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Roku wasn’t one of them.

These two stocks are on a roll. But which one is the better buy today?"", ""The case for Amazon is pretty simple. It has no competition. Its two main businesses, e-commerce and Amazon Web Services (AWS), are way above any competitors. According to Statista, Amazon has 37.6% of the U.S. e-commerce market, with its closest competitor, Walmart, at only 6.4%.

It also expanded its same-day facilities, and items delivered overnight increased 65% year over year in the 2023 fourth quarter. Amazon's logistics network is unbeatable, so there's very little room for anyone to compete with Amazon in speed. That makes it more likely customers will keep turning to Amazon for essentials and more."", ""In AWS, Amazon has launched a large assortment of generative artificial intelligence (AI) services that help client companies work faster, with better results. It's booking deals for longer commitments with clients like Nvidia  and Salesforce, and this high-margin business should add high value to the Amazon whole for many years."", 'Its other businesses are ramping up as well.

It's a classic case of how winners keep on winning."", ""Disney's business doesn't have the same breadth as Amazon's, but it's also a collection of working parts in a robust entertainment machine.

Revenue was hampered by declines in linear networks, which comprise Disney's broadcast and cable channels. But the big story was the improvement in streaming losses, which contracted from nearly $1 billion to $138 million. That inspires confidence that Disney can come through on its commitment for streaming to become profitable by the end of the fiscal year."", 'With high-performing parks and streaming, Disney can get back to serious growth. CEO Bob Iger has also committed to getting content creation under control after several flops last year and concerns that the company is producing too fast, leading to lower quality. Disney has reduced volume, specifically at Marvel Studios, and it had six out of the top 10 streamed movies in 2023.', ""Another thorn in Disney's side has been ESPN. Up until now, the company hasn't made a strong effort to turn ESPN+, the streaming network, into a fully loaded channel, since much of that content is already on its cable network. But it announced a deal together with Fox and Warner Bros. Discovery last week to create a collective sports channel. It's also launching a separate ESPN network with an array of digital services to enhance the overall sports experience."", 'Disney is well-positioned to leap forward this year and continue to gain in the future.', 'Both of these companies have large businesses with many moving pieces and are at the top of their respective industries.

While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates."", 'The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 21. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.', ""While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise."", 'Zacks Consensus Estimate', 'This energy company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.58 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +34.9%.', 'Revenues are expected to be $4.91 billion, up 5.1% from the year-ago quarter.', 'Estimate Revisions Trend', 'The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.95% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.', 'Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.', 'Earnings Whisper', ""Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core."", 'The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.', ""Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only."", 'A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.', 'Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).', 'How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Exelon?', ""For Exelon, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.69%."", 'On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.', 'So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Exelon will beat the consensus EPS estimate.', 'Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?', ""While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number."", 'For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Exelon would post earnings of $0.68 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.67, delivering a surprise of -1.47%.', 'Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.', 'Bottom Line', 'An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.', ""That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release.

It's truly been a pleasure working with you. And I'd like to join you in welcoming Mark as your successor. Turning now to our Q4 results, I'm pleased to report that ACMI delivered a strong finish to a very successful 2023. Fourth quarter revenue grew to $995 million, and non-GAAP operating margin was 30%. Non-GAAP earnings per share in Q4 was $1.69, up 23% year-over-year, and up 22% in constant currency. For the full year, revenue was $3.81 billion, and non-GAAP operating margin was 30%. Full year non-GAAP earnings per share was $6.20, up 15% year-over-year, and up 16% in constant currency. Security revenue in Q4 grew 17% year-over-year, and was up 18% in constant currency, contributing nearly half of our total revenue in the quarter."", ""Security growth was driven in part by continued strong demand for our market-leading Guardicore Segmentation Solution, as more enterprises relied on Akamai to defend against malware and ransomware. Customers who purchased Segmentation in Q4 included one of the largest global tech firms in India, and a leading payment systems company based in Hong Kong that handles 15 million transactions a day. We've also seen strong interest in our new API Security Solution that we announced in August. Early adopters of this new solution include three major financial institutions, several major retail brands in Europe and North America, and a leading industrial automation company in Europe. Our customers are seeing the value of this new capability with several already paying over half $0.5 million per year for the service."", ""Akamai’s API Security Solution also earned recognition from industry analysts in Q4. KuppingerCole named Akamai an overall industry leader in their API security and management leadership compass report. And Gartner validated our strong and expanded API capabilities in its market guide for cloud, web application and API protection. Turning now to cloud computing, I'm pleased to say that we accomplished what we set out to achieve last year in terms of infrastructure deployment, product development, jumpstarting our partner ecosystem, onboarding the first mission critical apps from some major enterprise customers, and achieving substantial cost savings as we moved our own applications from hyperscalers to the Akamai Connected Cloud. After launching Akamai Connected Cloud."", ""After launching Akamai Connected Cloud last year, we rolled out 14 new core computing regions around the world, giving us a total of 25 overall. We also enhanced our cloud compute offering by doubling the capacity of our object storage solution and adding premium instances for large commercial workloads that are designed to deliver consistent performance with predictable resource and cost allocation. Also, our Akamai Global Load Balancer is now live. This integrated service is designed to route traffic requests to the optimal data center to minimize latency and ensure no single point of failure. Last year, we also amplified our go-to-market approach with our cloud computing partner program. The collaborative nature of the program provides a unique model for Akamai to engage with customers at a consultative level to deeply understand their requirements and pain points and to provide a complete solution leveraging the combined strength of the partner’s technology and Akamai's distributed compute platform."", ""We've already partnered with several leading SaaS and PaaS providers and cloud data and processing platforms. We're very pleased with the progress that we've made thus far and are looking forward to adding more new partnerships in 2024. We've also begun to gain traction with some of our largest customers as they migrate mission-critical apps onto our cloud platform. For example, one of the world's best-known social media platforms spent approximately $5 million on computing services with us last year and they're already on a run rate to do more than double that this year. Two of the world's best-known software companies recently signed on and are already spending about a quarter of a million dollars per month on cloud computing with Akamai."", 'In Q4, we also signed up a major global media measurement and analytics company and we displaced a hyperscaler when we signed Blu TV, the largest VOD streaming company in Turkey. The streaming customer told us that they found our platform to be simple to use, automated and intuitive, cloud agnostic for a smooth multi-cloud migration and affordable with very low egress cost, all backed by a trusted and reliable partner. In addition to exceeding our full-year cloud computing revenue goal of $500 million last year, we also derived significant cost savings by migrating several of our own applications from hyperscalers to Akamai Connected Cloud. Our bot manager and enterprise application access solutions were among the first to migrate. Together, these products are used by over 1,000 customers and they generate over $300 million in annual revenue for Akamai.', ""But all that is just the beginning. Today, we're excited to announce the next phase of our multi-year strategy to transform the cloud marketplace, taking cloud computing to the edge by embedding cloud computing capabilities into Akamai's massively distributed edge network. Akamai's new initiative, codenamed Gecko which stands for “Generalized Edge Compute”, combines the computing power of our cloud platform with the proximity and efficiency of the edge to put workloads closer to users than any other cloud provider. Traditional cloud providers support virtual machines and containers in a relatively small number of core data centers. Gecko is designed to extend this capability to our edge pops, bringing full stack computing power to hundreds of previously hard-to-reach locations."", ""Deploying our cloud computing capabilities into Akamai's worldwide edge platform will also enable us to take advantage of existing operational tools, processes, and observability, enabling developers to innovate across the entire continuum of compute and providing a consistent experience from centralized cloud to distributed edge. Nobody else in the marketplace does this today. In the latest implementation phase that we're announcing today, Akamai aims to embed compute with support for virtual machines into about 100 cities by the end of the year. We've deployed new Gecko-architected regions in four countries already, as well as in cities that lack a concentrated hyperscaler presence. These initial locations are listed in today's press release."", ""Following that, we plan to add support for containers. And then, we plan to develop automated workload orchestration to make it easier for developers to build applications across hundreds of distributed locations. We've been conducting early trials of Gecko with several of our enterprise customers that are eager to deliver better experiences for their customers by running workloads closer to users, devices, and sources of data. Their early feedback has been very encouraging, as they evaluate Gecko for tasks such as AI inferencing, deep learning for recommendation engines, data analytics, multiplayer gaming, accelerating banking transactions, personalization for e-commerce, and a variety of media workflow applications, such as transcoding. In short, I'm incredibly excited for the prospects of Gecko as we move full stack compute to the edge."", ""Turning now to content delivery, I'm pleased to report that Akamai remains the market leader by a wide margin, providing the scale and performance required by the world's top brands as we help them deliver reliable, secure, and near flawless online experiences. Our delivery business continues to be an important generator of profit that we use to develop new products to fuel Akamai's future growth. And it's an important driver of our security and cloud computing businesses, as we harvest the competitive and cost advantages of offering delivery, security, and compute on the same platform as a bundle. As we've noted in past calls, we're selective when it comes to less profitable delivery opportunities. And this is a discipline that we intend to maintain, and in some cases, increase in 2024."", ""To be clear, we still aim to be the best in delivery for our customers. And we believe that our disciplined approach will benefit our business by allowing us to focus more of our investment in security and cloud computing, which are now approaching two thirds of Akamai's revenue and growing at a rapid rate. In summary, we're pleased to have accomplished what we said we would do in 2023. Our cloud computing plans are taking shape as we envisioned. Our expanded security portfolio is enabling us to deepen our relationships with customers. And we continue to invest in Akamai's future growth while also enhancing our profitability. Now I'll turn the call over to Ed for more on our results and our outlook for Q1 and 2024. Ed?"", ""Ed McGowan: Thank you, Tom. I would also like to thank Tom Barth for his incredible service for 10 years as our head of investor relations. Now moving on to our results, let me start by saying that I'm very pleased with our fiscal 2023 year results, delivering $6.20 of non-GAAP earnings per share, capping off a year of double-digit earnings growth for our shareholders. Today I'll cover our Q4 results, provide some color regarding 2024, including some items to help investors better understand a few factors that will impact our upcoming results, and then close with our Q1 and full year 2024 guidance, starting with revenue. Q4 revenue was $995 million, up 7% year-over-year as reported and in cost and currency. We saw continued strong growth in our compute and security businesses during the fourth quarter."", 'Our compute business grew to $135 million, up 20% year-over-year as reported and in constant currency. We continue to be very pleased with the feedback regarding our cloud compute offerings, and we are very optimistic about the early traction we are seeing from enterprise customers. Moving to security, revenue was $471 million, growing 18% year-over-year and up 17% in constant currency. Our security revenue continues to be driven by strong growth in our Guardicore Segmentation Solution, in our industry leading web app firewall, denial of service, and bot management solutions. In addition, and as Tom mentioned, we are encouraged by the early traction of our new API security solution. During the fourth quarter, we signed 17 API security customers, including 4 with annual contract values in excess of $500,000 per year.', 'Our delivery revenue was $389 million, including approximately $20 million from the contracts we recently acquired from StackPath and Lumen. International revenue was $479 million, up 8% year-over-year, or up 6% in constant currency, representing 48% of total revenue in Q4. Finally, foreign exchange fluctuations had a negative impact on revenue of $4 million on a sequential basis and a positive $6 million benefit on a year-over-year basis. Moving to profitability. In Q4, we generated strong non-GAAP net income of $263 million, or $1.69 of earnings per diluted share, up 23% year-over-year or 22% in constant currency, and $0.07 above the high end of our guidance range. These stronger-than-expected EPS results were driven primarily by continued progress on the cost-saving initiatives we have previously outlined, and approximately $6 million in lower-than-expected transition services, or TSA costs, associated with the StackPath and Lumen contracts, as our services organization migrated the customers onto our platform much faster than we expected.', 'Q4 CapEx was $143 million, or just below 15% of revenue. We were very pleased with our continued focus on lowering the capital intensity of our delivery business. This effort, along with our very strong profitability, enabled us to deliver very strong free cash flow results in Q4. Moving to our capital allocation strategy, during the fourth quarter, we spent approximately $55 million to buy back approximately 500,000 shares. For the full year, we spent approximately $654 million to buy back approximately 8 million shares. We ended 2023 with approximately $500 million remaining on our current repurchase authorization. Going forward, our intention is to continue buying back shares to offset dilution from employee equity programs over time, and to be opportunistic in both M&A and share repurchases.', ""Before I move on to guidance, there are several items that I want to highlight in order to give investors some greater insight into the business. The first relates to our delivery revenue. In the first half of 2024, seven of our top 10 CDN customers' contracts come up for renewal. As we've discussed in the past, this type of renewal generally leads to an initial drop in revenue, and then we typically see revenue grow again as traffic increases over time. We have factored the expected outcome of these renewals into our Q1 and full year 2024 guidance. In addition, as Tom mentioned, we plan to continue to optimize our delivery business by focusing on how we charge certain high-volume traffic customers for their usage on our network, all with an eye on profitability."", 'For example, we plan to start charging a premium for higher-cost delivery destinations. We expect to continue to optimize the ratio of peak to day-to-day traffic, and we plan to negotiate different pricing for API traffic versus download traffic. Choosing to shed some less profitable traffic will result in a more balanced and profitable approach to pricing, which we believe is the right strategy for the company. Second, OECD member countries continue to work toward the enactment of a 15% global minimum corporate tax rate. And in particular, in December 2023, the Swiss Federal Council declared the rules in effect for Switzerland beginning in 2024. As a result, we anticipate that our non-GAAP effective tax rate will increase by roughly 1.5 to 2 percentage points, to approximately 18.5% to 19%.', 'We estimate this increase in our tax rate will have a negative impact on Q1 non-GAAP EPS of approximately $0.02 to $0.03 per diluted share, and a negative impact on full year non-GAAP EPS of approximately $0.12 to $0.15 per diluted share. The impact of this tax rate change has been factored into our Q1 and full year 2024 guidance. Third, we expect to generate significantly more free cash flow in 2024 compared to 2023 levels. This is primarily due to much lower capital expenditures in 2024, along with our continued focus on profitability. Please note that the full cost to build out our Gecko compute sites we announced earlier today is included in our Q1 and full year 2024 capital expenditure guidance. Fourth, I want to remind you of the typical seasonality we experience on the top and bottom lines throughout the year.', ""Regarding revenue, the fourth quarter is usually our strongest quarter. Regarding profitability, in Q1 we incur much higher payroll taxes related to the reset of Social Security taxes for employees who maxed out during 2023, and from stock vesting for employee equity programs, which tend to be more heavily concentrated in the first quarter. It's also worth noting that in Q3, our annual company-wide merit-based salary increases go into effect, so we tend to see higher operating costs in Q3 compared to Q2 levels. Finally, for 2024, we anticipate heightened volatility in foreign currency markets, driven by the unpredictable timing and magnitude of Federal Reserve policy changes and their impact on interest rates. With this in mind, forecasting the trajectory of FX in the latter part of the year poses a formidable challenge."", 'Thus, for the full year, we plan to provide annual revenue growth, security and compute revenue growth, non-GAAP EPS growth, non-GAAP operating margin, and CapEx only in constant currency based on 1231-2023 exchange rates. However, for the coming quarter, we will provide both as reported and constant currency guidance. As a reminder, we have approximately $1.2 billion of annual revenue that is generated from foreign currency with the Euro, Yen, and Great British Pound being the largest non-U.S. dollar sources of revenue. In addition, our costs in non-U.S. dollars tend to be significantly lower than our revenue and are primarily in Indian rupee, Israeli shekel, and Polish Zloty. Moving now to guidance. Our guidance for 2024 assumes no material changes, good or bad, in the current macroeconomic landscape.', 'For the first quarter of 2024, we are projecting revenue in the range of $980 million to $1 billion, or up 7% to 9% as reported, or 8% to 10% in constant currency over Q1 2023. At current spot rates, foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a positive $2 million impact on Q1 revenue compared to Q4 levels and a negative $4 million impact year-over-year. At these revenue levels, we expect cash gross margin of approximately 73% as reported and in constant currency. Q1 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be $305 million to $310 million. We anticipate Q1 EBITDA margins of approximately 42% to 43% as reported and in constant currency. We expect non-GAAP depreciation expense of $127 million to $129 million. We expect non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 29% to 30% as reported and in constant currency for Q1.', 'And with the overall revenue and spend configuration I just outlined, we expect Q1 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.59 to $1.64, or up 14% to 18% as reported, and 16% to 19% in constant currency. The EPS guidance assumes taxes of $56 million to $58 million based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 18.5% to 19%. It also reflects a fully diluted share count of approximately 155 million shares. Moving on to CapEx, we expect to spend approximately $146 million to $154 million excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest in the first quarter. This represents approximately 15% of total revenue. Looking ahead to the full year for 2024, we expect revenue growth of 6% to 8% in constant currency. We expect security revenue growth of approximately 14% to 16% in constant currency.', ""We expect compute revenue growth to be approximately 20% in constant currency. And we're estimating non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 30% in constant currency. And full year CapEx is expected to be approximately 15% of total constant currency revenue, which again includes the Gecko compute buildup. We expect our CapEx to be roughly broken down as follows. Approximately 3% of revenue for our delivery and security business, approximately 4% of revenue for compute, approximately 7% of revenue for capitalized software, and the remainder for IT and facility related spend. We expect non-GAAP earnings per diluted share growth of 7% to 11% in constant currency. And as we mentioned earlier, this non-GAAP earnings guidance is based on a non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 18.5% to 19%, and a fully diluted share count of approximately 155 million shares."", 'In closing, we are very pleased with a strong finish to 2023. We continue to be excited about our growth prospects and driving profitability across the business. Now Tom and I would like to take your questions.

Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) Please note this event is being recorded.I would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Barth, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.', 'Tom Barth', ""Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining Akamai's Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. Speaking today will be Tom Leighton, Akamai's Chief Executive Officer; and Ed McGowan, Akamai's Chief Financial Officer. Please note that today's comments include forward-looking statements, including statements regarding revenue and earnings guidance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. The factors include any impact from macroeconomic trends, the integration of any acquisitions and any impact from geopolitical developments.Additional information concerning these factors is contained in Akamai's filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. The forward-looking statements included in this call represent the company's view on February 13, 2024. Akamai disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect new information, future events or circumstances, except as required by law.As a reminder, we will be referring to some non-GAAP financial metrics during today's call. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP metrics can be found under the financial portion of the Investor Relations section of akamai.com.Before I turn the call over to Tom, I'd like to let everyone know that I have transitioned the Head of Akamai Investor Relations role to Mark Stoutenberg. Many of you have met Mark over the past year, and I'm confident you will find him extremely helpful about all things Akamai. I'll be moving into another role internally and want to thank Tom personally for bringing me into the Akamai culture 10 years ago. It's been a privilege to work with so many wonderful people both here at Akamai and, of course, all of you externally. I wish you all happiness and good fortune. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Tom."", 'F. Thomson Leighton', ""Thanks, Tom, and thank you very much for the terrific job that you've done over the last 10 years at Akamai. It's truly been a pleasure working with you. And I'd like to join you in welcoming Mark as your successor.Turning now to our Q4 results. I'm pleased to report that Akamai delivered a strong finish to a very successful 2023. Fourth quarter revenue grew to $995 million, and non-GAAP operating margin was 30%. Non-GAAP earnings per share in Q4 was $1.69, up 23% year-over-year and up 22% in constant currency. For the full year, revenue was $3.81 billion, and non-GAAP operating margin was 30%. Full year non-GAAP earnings per share was $6.20, up 15% year-over-year and up 16% in constant currency. Security revenue in Q4 grew 17% year-over-year and was up 18% in constant currency, contributing nearly half of our total revenue in the quarter. Security growth was driven in part by continued strong demand for our market-leading Guardicore segmentation solution as more enterprises relied on Akamai to defend against malware and ransomware. Customers who purchased segmentation in Q4 included one of the largest global tech firms in India and a leading payment systems company based in Hong Kong that handles 15 million transactions a day.We've also seen strong interest in our new API security solution that we announced in August. Early adopters of this new solution include 3 major financial institutions, several major retail brands in Europe and North America and a leading industrial automation company in Europe. Our customers are seeing the value of this new capability with several already paying over $0.5 million per year for the service.Akamai's API security solution also earned recognition from industry analysts in Q4. KuppingerCole named Akamai an overall industry leader in their API Security and Management Leadership Compass report. And Gartner validated our strong and expanded API capabilities in its Market Guide for Cloud Web Application and API Protection.Turning now to cloud computing. I'm pleased to say that we accomplished what we set out to achieve last year in terms of infrastructure deployment, product development, jump-starting our partner ecosystem, onboarding the first mission-critical apps from some major enterprise customers and achieving substantial cost savings as we moved our own applications from hyperscalers to the Akamai Connected Cloud. After launching Akamai Connected Cloud last year, we rolled out 14 new core computing regions around the world, giving us a total of 25 overall. We also enhanced our cloud compute offering by doubling the capacity of our object storage solution and adding premium instances for large commercial workloads that are designed to deliver consistent performance with predictable resource and cost allocation. Also, our Akamai global load balancer is now live. This integrated service is designed to route traffic request to the optimal data center to minimize latency and ensure no single point of failure.Last year, we also amplified our go-to-market approach with our cloud computing partner program. The collaborative nature of the program provides a unique model for Akamai to engage with customers at a consultative level to deeply understand their requirements and pain points and to provide a complete solution, leveraging the combined strength of the partner's technology and Akamai's distributed compute platform. We've already partnered with several leading SaaS and PaaS providers in cloud, data and processing platforms. We're very pleased with the progress that we've made thus far and are looking forward to adding more new partnerships in 2024.We've also begun to gain traction with some of our largest customers as they migrate mission-critical apps on to our cloud platform. For example, one of the world's best known social media platforms spent approximately $5 million on computing services with us last year, and they're already on a run rate to do more than double that this year. And 2 of the world's best known software companies recently signed on and are already spending about $0.25 million per month on cloud computing with Akamai.In Q4, we also signed up a major global media measurement and analytics company, and we displaced a hyperscaler when we signed BluTV, the largest VOD streaming company in Turkey. The streaming customer told us that they found our platform to be simple to use, automated and intuitive, cloud agnostic for a smooth multicloud migration and affordable with very low egress costs, all backed by a trusted and reliable partner.In addition to exceeding our full year cloud computing revenue goal of $500 million last year, we also derive significant cost savings by migrating several of our own applications from hyperscalers to Akamai Connected Cloud. Our Bot Manager and Enterprise Application Access solutions were among the first to migrate. Together, these products are used by over 1,000 customers, and they generate over $300 million in annual revenue for Akamai. But all that is just the beginning.Today, we're excited to announce the next phase of our multiyear strategy to transform the cloud marketplace, taking cloud computing to the edge by embedding cloud computing capabilities into Akamai's massively distributed edge network. Akamai's new initiative, code-named Gecko, which stands for Generalized Edge Compute, combines the computing power of our cloud platform with the proximity and efficiency of the edge to put workloads closer to users than any other cloud provider. Traditional cloud providers support virtual machines and containers in a relatively small number of core data centers. Gecko is designed to extend this capability to our edge PoPs, bringing full stack computing power to hundreds of previously hard-to-reach locations. Deploying our cloud computing capabilities into Akamai's worldwide edge platform will also enable us to take advantage of existing operational tools, processes and observability, enabling developers to innovate across the entire continuum of compute and providing a consistent experience from centralized cloud to distributed edge. Nobody else in the marketplace does this today.In the latest implementation phase that we're announcing today, Akamai aims to embed compute with support for virtual machines into about 100 cities by the end of the year. We've deployed new Gecko-architected regions in 4 countries already as well as in cities that lack a concentrated hyperscaler presence. These initial locations are listed in today's press release. Following that, we plan to add support for containers. And then we plan to develop automated workload orchestration to make it easier for developers to build applications across hundreds of distributed locations.We've been conducting early trials of Gecko with several of our enterprise customers that are eager to deliver better experiences for their customers by running workloads closer to users, devices and sources of data. Their early feedback has been very encouraging as they evaluate Gecko for tasks such as AI inferencing, deep learning for recommendation engines, data analytics, multiplayer gaming, accelerating banking transactions, personalization for e-commerce and a variety of media workflow applications such as transcoding. In short, I'm incredibly excited for the prospects of Gecko as we move full stack compute to the edge.Turning now to content delivery. I'm pleased to report that Akamai remains the market leader by a wide margin, providing the scale and performance required by the world's top brands as we help them deliver reliable, secure and near-flawless online experiences. Our delivery business continues to be an important generator of profit that we use to develop new products to fuel Akamai's future growth. And it's an important driver of our security and cloud computing businesses as we harvest the competitive and cost advantages of offering delivery, security and compute on the same platform as a bundle.As we've noted in past calls, we're selective when it comes to less profitable delivery opportunities. And this is a discipline that we intend to maintain and, in some cases, increase in 2024. To be clear, we still aim to be the best in delivery for our customers, and we believe that our disciplined approach will benefit our business by allowing us to focus more of our investment in security and cloud computing, which are now approaching 2/3 of Akamai's revenue and growing at a rapid rate.In summary, we're pleased to have accomplished what we said we would do in 2023. Our cloud computing plans are taking shape as we envisioned. Our expanded security portfolio is enabling us to deepen our relationships with customers, and we continue to invest in Akamai's future growth while also enhancing our profitability.Now I'll turn the call over to Ed for more on our results and our outlook for Q1 and 2024.

At these revenue levels, we expect cash gross margin of approximately 73% as reported and in constant currency. Q1 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be $305 million to $310 million. We anticipate Q1 EBITDA margins of approximately 42% to 43% as reported and in constant currency. We expect non-GAAP depreciation expense of $127 million to $129 million. We expect non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 29% to 30% as reported and in constant currency for Q1. And with the overall revenue and spend configuration I just outlined, we expect Q1 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.59 to $1.64 or up 14% to 18% as reported and 16% to 19% in constant currency. This EPS guidance assumes taxes of $56 million to $58 million based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 18.5% to 19%. It also reflects a fully diluted share count of approximately 155 million shares.Moving on to CapEx. We expect to spend approximately $146 million to $154 million, excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest in the first quarter. This represents approximately 15% of total revenue.Looking ahead to the full year for 2024, we expect revenue growth of 6% to 8% in constant currency. We expect security revenue growth of approximately 14% to 16% in constant currency. We expect compute revenue growth to be approximately 20% in constant currency. And we are estimating non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 30% in constant currency. And full year CapEx is expected to be approximately 15% of total constant currency revenue, which again includes the Gecko compute build-outs.We expect our CapEx to be roughly broken down as follows: approximately 3% of revenue for our delivery and security business, approximately 4% of revenue for compute, approximately 7% of revenue for capitalized software and the remainder for IT and facility-related spend. We expect non-GAAP earnings per diluted share growth of 7% to 11% in constant currency. And as we mentioned earlier, this non-GAAP earnings guidance is based on a non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 18.5% to 19% and a fully diluted share count of approximately 155 million shares.In closing, we are very pleased with the strong finish to 2023. We continue to be excited about our growth prospects and driving profitability across the business. Now Tom and I would like to take your questions. Operator?"", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from Fatima Boolani of Citi.', 'Fatima Aslam Boolani', ""Ed, I wanted to drill into the delivery, the segment performance and the guidance and some of the modeling points that you shared with us. I was hoping you could parse out for us, some of the organic traffic trends you saw in the platform parsed away from the traffic from the acquired contracts between StackPath and Lumen. And then to the extent you can talk about in time frame you have with regards to absorbing some of this additional acquired traffic from these contracts.And the last piece of the question here is also the guidance that we calculated to be 6% -- down 6% for delivery in 2024 implied by your guidance, full year guidance. Can you talk to what proportion of that traffic that you would have deemed lower quality being peeled off is maybe the reason why we're not seeing a more sharper improvement in the delivery franchise? And then I have a quick follow-up."", 'Edward J. McGowan', ""All right. Sure. Let me see if I can tackle all those for you. I'll start with the performance in Q4. So I'll break it down into a couple of buckets. So in Q4, we tend to see a stronger seasonal quarter for us. And we did see some of that. So from the retail customer perspective, we saw bursting roughly to the tune of about half of what we saw last year. And I think that has to do mostly with the 0 overage. As that's become more popular, we are seeing less bursting. If I look back a few years, that's down about 50% '22 compared to '21 and again, '23 compared to '22. Some of it could be macro factors, hard to tell. We're not really the best gauge for folks' consumption but more of their surfing.If I look at gaming, gaming was a better year. If I look last year, gaming was pretty weak. This year, it was pretty good. Gaming tends to be fairly lower-priced delivery, so you don't get as much upside in revenue. Video was up quarter-over-quarter but not as much as we saw in the prior year, so I would say kind of an okay fourth quarter from delivery. The one area that was probably the weakest was more in sort of high tech. So think about that as new connected devices, maybe it's connected TV or a new -- say, an iPad or something like that, printer drivers, that sort of stuff. That was much weaker than what we saw last year. Last year was a pretty good bump up in that category. So that really sort of sums up what the dynamics are in terms of the delivery business in Q4. And I looked at that not including the acquisition traffic.The second question you asked, if I wrote it down correctly, was the absorption of the traffic from the acquisitions. We've largely done that. The services team did a phenomenal job migrating over the customers. We did it in probably about 1/3 of the time that we had expected to be able to do that. There's still a few stragglers, but the transition services costs are immaterial. So that's why we didn't call that out. But that's largely been done.In terms of this year, why are we seeing a down 6%, if that's the math you're using, for delivery. A lot of it has to do with the renewals. Unfortunately, these larger customers, as we've talked in the past, we only have about 8 customers that are greater than 1% of revenue. And unfortunately, 7 of them are renewing in the first half of the year. That does have a bit of an impact on the delivery business. the majority of the revenue from those customers comes from delivery. We've seen this in the past. It seems like every 2 years, we kind of bump into this. Even though we try to sign staggered contracts, what happens often is someone might sign a 2- or a 3-year deal with a revenue commit, they'll spend that in a shorter period of time, and we just get a combination of renewals here.And then the other thing was on the shedding of traffic. So let me just get a little bit more specific with what we're doing. So last year, if you remember, we talked about being a bit more stringent with the peak to average ratios. We're going to continue to do that. We did a pretty good job. There's still a few customers we need to adjust. And that generally happens where customers will split -- and they have lots of day-to-day traffic and they might split that among 3 or 4 CDNs. And then they'll have peak events, whether that's a big video event or a big download event, and we get the disproportionate size of that peak. So you want to make sure you're compensated for that. So the way to do that is you get a higher percentage of the day-to-day or you just limit the peak. So we'll continue doing that. And sometimes, that may mean we lose a little bit of traffic, but that's okay because you can see the results in CapEx.The new thing that we're doing now is we've worked with product and IT to enable us to be able to build for very granular level on destinations. In the past, we generally would build based on large geos, say, for example, the U.S. or Europe or Asia. Now we're able to get one level deeper. And so we can go after some of the areas where our costs are a bit higher to deliver. It's unclear. We're assuming that customers have choice. They may decide to take that traffic somewhere else. Some of our competitors don't really focus as much on profit as we do. If that's the case, then that's okay with us. So I think as you -- as we try to factor all that in, those are the 2 driving factors as to why we're not seeing a better delivery performance in '24. I think I hit all your questions."", 'Fatima Aslam Boolani', ""You did, super comprehensive. And then easy one, just on the gross margins, you gave us the guidance for cash gross margin in the first quarter. But just qualitatively, if you can talk to us about some of the puts and takes at a full year level as we think about the mix of business changing, your focus on pricing discipline and just even U.S. international mix. Any sort of puts and takes in terms of the dynamics we should be thinking about COGS and cash gross margins for the full year? And that's it for me."", 'Edward J. McGowan', ""Sure. No problem. In terms of the cost of goods sold, I'll start with the good stuff that's going on in cost of goods sold. Obviously, you touched on the mix. So as we get a higher degree of security business, that obviously helps our gross margin line.And the second thing is the movement of our third-party cloud costs onto our own platform. We did a great job so far this year. Tom talked a bit about that in his prepared remarks. And we have more to go, and we have a road map to get that. So that will drive some significant savings. The downside or what's sort of contracting them or not expanding the margins as much, I should say, we could be going a bit higher, is that with the build-out of the Gecko sites, we'll incur some additional co-location costs. So as we start to build out those facilities, you don't have revenue to go against it. But also, as I talked about last year, when we built out some of the bigger sites, with the accounting rules, when you do long-term co-lo commitments or any kind of commitment for long-term leases, you have to straight line any commitments. So we end up with a bit of a disconnect between what we're paying in cash and what we're actually expensing. So we're able to offset that with the savings we get from the third-party cloud and the mix, but those are the underlying dynamics."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Frank Louthan of Raymond James.', 'Frank Garrett Louthan', ""How different is Gecko from what you're doing now with compute? Is this a new packaging of some of your products? Or is it something a little different? And then secondly, of the CDN business that you acquired last year, how much are you expecting that to fall off? I think the goal was to try to get it from other services. But what are you factoring in there?"", 'F. Thomson Leighton', ""Yes. I'll take the first question. Yes, Gecko is not packaging. Gecko is a new capability where we're going to be offering full stack compute in 100 cities by the end of the year and ultimately, in hundreds of cities. We're actually taking full stack compute, the kinds of services you get in Linode or a hyperscaler, and making that available in our edge PoPs. Now today, the edge PoPs, we have 4,000 and they run function as a service. We'll spin up JavaScript apps and 4,000 locations in over 700 cities in milliseconds based on user demand. But that's not full stack compute.Now we're going to be taking virtual machines and containers and supporting those in our edge platform. And that enables our customers to get much better performance and scalability, also lower cost because of the financial benefits we get from our edge platform. So it really becomes, I think, a very compelling cloud computing offering that just doesn't exist in the marketplace today. It's not a packaging thing at all. This is a new capability. And of course, ultimately, after we get the support for VMs and containers, we want to make it work just as we do function as a service, so that we'll be spinning up containers and VMs on demand where and when they're needed. And that capability doesn't exist today in the market. Ed, do you want to take the CDN question, the acquisition?"", 'Edward J. McGowan', ""Sure. Happy to do that. Yes. I would say, just as a reminder, when we acquired the businesses, we actually acquired selected customers. What we mean by that is we actually went through and we left some customers that we weren't going to take, for example, if someone violated our acceptable use policy, really small customers and then believe it or not, some that had pricing that we just didn't want to take. So we had already gone through sort of a selection process. If you recall, I had given guidance last quarter of about $18 million to $20 million for this quarter, and we hit the high end of that range, which I'm happy that we did. So we've largely been able to migrate over everything that we had hoped to. There were a few customers that churned. But by and large, we've gotten everything out of that acquisition or those acquisitions, I should say, there were 2 of them, that we had hoped to."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from James Fish of Piper Sandler.', 'James Edward Fish', ""First, just Tom Barth, look, you've been a class act and appreciate all the help over the years and just wanted to echo Tom Leighton and Ed's sentiment there. Really appreciate the help over the years. I wanted to circle over to security actually. Look, security was a little bit lower than I think we were all anticipating for Q4. I get that we have some drivers underneath that are helping the business. But did you see any pushout of deals and maybe that's contributing to your confidence around mid-teens growth for 2024? Help us kind of on the confidence for sustained mid-teens growth. And really, how is that selling outside the installed base and penetration of those new security packages going?"", 'Edward J. McGowan', ""This is Ed. Yes. I was actually pretty pleased with our performance, and I didn't see many deals push out. We didn't have any large license deals like we did in Q3. So that might be -- that always sort of skews some of the results. So we don't have any of that. But no deals that really pushed out from a security perspective. Very pleased with what we're seeing with Guardicore, continued great growth there. That's been phenomenal. And that's -- a lot of customers are being driven, new verticals and things like that. The channel has been doing phenomenally well there.We talked a lot about in our prepared remarks API security. I don't get surprised often, but I've been surprised with the ARPUs there. I've been very pleased with that. That's been very, very good to see. And the strength in -- we talked about the bundles that we have done a lot on the last call. That's continued to go very well, and we're seeing very strong growth in our WAF and in our fraud products, too, bot management and fraud protector. So really, strength across the board. Nothing so far from macroeconomic challenges. That always can change. You'll never know what can happen. But nothing that we saw in Q4.As far as the projections for this year, we feel pretty confident. We've generally been relatively conservative with our approach to security growth. We don't factor in any major type of attacks where sometimes we'll see a spike in demand or anything like that. So we feel pretty good with how security is going."", 'James Edward Fish', ""Maybe just to click down one level into Fatima's earlier question on the CDN side and something that Tom said as well in his prepared remarks. Is there any way to understand how much on the CDN side of the base you plan to essentially -- I don't want to say give away for free, but give away for free to get that compute revenue or help us understand kind of the dynamic between what we should expect between CDN and compute kind of dollar shifting?"", 'F. Thomson Leighton', ""Yes. I think you can't factor in any percentage there at this point. We have been in some discussions with some very large media companies where we would offer discounted or free delivery in return for a significant portion of the compute business. On balance, that would be a great trade for us, much more profitable and much more revenue because at the end of the day, big media companies will spend 10x on compute what they'll spend on delivery and even security. So this is something that we see the hyperscalers do. They will sometimes give away the delivery in return for getting the compute business because that's where the vast majority of the revenue is and very profitable. So we'll keep you advised as we go if that starts to make a material difference."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley.', 'Keith Weiss', ""Just one for Ed. Throughout [2020], we talked a lot about savings initiatives. We talked a lot about migrating a lot of workloads to (inaudible) savings. And I got to say, like just to put it bluntly, kind of disappointing about this point about the lack of margin expansion in the (inaudible). Is there something holding that back? Or is there some incremental investments perhaps behind Gecko that we're making instead of that? Or (inaudible) question is like, why not more margin (inaudible) given all the efficiency sort of improvements that you guys have been putting in (inaudible)."", 'Edward J. McGowan', ""Yes. I'll take this one, Tom. You broke up a little bit there, Keith, but I think I got the genesis of the question. So yes, we've done, I thought, a great job of making some acquisitions over the last few years, investing in our compute business, spending an awful lot to build out our compute facilities, adding a lot of functionality, growing our security business, doing acquisitions there as well and got back to 30% margin last year and continuing this year.We've always said that's been a pretty healthy spot to run the business. We're investing because we see opportunity for growth. And there's always a balance. You can't cut your way to greatness. Perhaps we could cut a few more points, but then what are we leaving on the table. I think we've been pretty disciplined and balanced with our approach in terms of investing for growth and returning to margin.We've got some pretty exciting areas. We're seeing great growth in API security. It's still early days there. The product will continue to get better. We're seeing good ARPUs there, so I'm very excited about what we're doing there. We made investments in go-to-market in Guardicore, and that certainly has paid off, and like investments in compute side show some early returns. So again, it's a balanced approach. We're in this for the long term, and I think we don't want to shoot ourselves in the foot and not go after some of these big opportunities that we have in front of us."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Mark Murphy of JPMorgan.', 'Mark Ronald Murphy', ""So Tom, you've done a very solid job with the compute business. And in the prepared comments, you mentioned onboarding of some mission-critical apps. Wondering if you could shed a little light on the pipeline of that kind of critical app that you see coming to you in 2024. And thus far, how well is your infrastructure handling the intensity of those larger workloads in terms of stability, reliability, uptime, et cetera? And then I have a quick follow-up."", 'F. Thomson Leighton', ""Yes. So signing on compute customers is a big focus for us this year. We have the basic infrastructure in place. Of course, now we're building out Gecko. But just with the basic infrastructure, we're already in 25 cities.We'll be looking to add on many more mission-critical apps from major enterprises. And some examples, you look at social media, live transcoding, we now have 2 giant companies using that on the platform, one for live sports broadcasting, another for live user-generated content. Another customer, we're hosting e-commerce sites for them in a way that performance is better because closer to the end user and less expensive. AI inferencing for ad targeting, personalizing content. And again, you want to do that really fast. And you just don't have time to backhaul that up into a centralized location. You want to be in a lot of locations around the world to get better performance. And again, we can do it at a lower cost. We've even got a large -- one of the world's largest banks now using us, our edge compute to register credit cards, their user credit cards with Apple Pay because Apple Pay requires you do the registration in 60 milliseconds. And the only way they can get that done fast is to do it on Akamai Connected Cloud.So really, a lot of different applications already on the platform, doing proofs of concept now. So the focus this year, and I think it's a good pipeline, is to be taking on many more mission-critical apps for major enterprises. And of course, we're the first big one. We've got enormous applications already running on the platform and very successfully. And we do it in a multicloud way. And as I talked about earlier, now we have the global load balancing built in and the failover capability, so that it does make for a reliable service that's high performing. So really excited about what's coming this year."", 'Mark Ronald Murphy', ""Yes. It's great to hear the tie-in with AI inferencing and Apple Pay as well. Ed, I wanted to ask you, you're providing the fiscal year guidance in constant currency. And of course, we all understand it's going to be very difficult to predict the actual fluctuations in the spot market. But if we looked at it at current FX levels, do you think it would skew that 6% to 8% revenue growth level higher or lower, I mean, if we were to try to translate it into reported U.S. dollars in our models right now today?"", 'Edward J. McGowan', ""Yes. Good question. And I think the CPI report today gave you a good view of how things can change so quickly. The market originally had thought there'd be a lot of rate cuts. And now all of a sudden, that doesn't look like it's going to happen. And obviously, currencies and interest rates are very closely aligned. So if you look -- well, I gave you the 12/31 number, so obviously, the dollar has gotten a bit stronger. I gave you the numbers in terms of the total non-U.S. dollars, so you can kind of do some math. It would still be in that range. Obviously, it would be a little bit of a headwind just given that the dollar has gotten stronger since 12/31. But I think you can take our Q1 guidance and sort of fold that in and think about the normal seasonality that you have and come up with an answer, but it would be in -- still be in that range, though."", 'Mark Ronald Murphy', ""And Ed, just to clarify, so it's still in that 6% to 8% range if we put it in the USD? Or are you saying it's still kind of mid-single digit but maybe something like a point lower?"", 'Edward J. McGowan', ""Well, no, I'd say if you're using the spot rate as of today, the simple math would suggest that it is, yes. If you looked at -- just take the midpoint of the guide, right? If I just use that and what the impact of the dollar has been, it's still in that range. Now you had asked could it (inaudible). Obviously, the dollar was at [101] back at 12/31, it was at [106] in November. And so it's bouncing all over the place. Obviously, if it were to move, you can do the math. 5 or 6 or points lower, you could potentially get on the other side of that. So again, it's just -- I may end up giving you guys a massive range that wouldn't be helpful. So what I'd rather do is just give you guys the tools that you can do it yourself and look at it, really get an understanding of the core business underneath that. (inaudible) I think, is much more important to understand."", 'Mark Ronald Murphy', 'I want to also thank Tom Barth for a lot of great interactions over the years.', 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Madeline Brooks of Bank of America.', 'Madeline Nicole Brooks', ""Just one on security. Outside of Guardicore, just wanted to touch on the rest of the Zero Trust portfolio trends that you've seen and maybe if you're feeling any additional competitive pressure now that the market has really expanded there. And then I have one follow-up."", 'F. Thomson Leighton', ""Yes. In web app firewall, we've been the market leader there for 10 years since we started that marketplace with web app firewall as a service. And after 10 years, you do get competition, but we're still the market leader by a good margin, and that's a good growth business for us. We've added a lot of capabilities on top, bot management and more recently, account protector, client-side protection, so that customers of commerce sites can stay safe by going to the site. You're going to need that now for compliance. There's brand protector. So that's identifying the phishing sites and keeping them from stealing user information. Of course, we've been doing denial of service protection for a long, long time now, market leadership position there.And then you have on the enterprise side, of course, Guardicore, as we talked about, doing very well. And I'm really excited about API security. I think over the longer term, that becomes as big a marketplace and just as important as web app firewall has become. And our goal there is to become the market leader. And already in the go-to-market motion, there's a strong synergy between web app firewall and API security. We built a very easy way to do a proof of concept for our web app firewall customers, and that's where we're getting a lot of early traction.Also, we've integrated with a lot of the load balancers and other firewalls out there, so that we can sign on new customers who are not using Akamai CDN or a web app firewall. So I think there's a variety of areas in security that are working very well for us."", 'Madeline Nicole Brooks', ""Got it. And then just one quick one on compute, too. I think if we think about earnings that have happened so far, especially with hyperscalers like AWS, Microsoft, Meta, we've kind of heard of this theme of the optimization inflection in terms of cloud computing, meaning maybe this year, we're going to see a little bit more investment in new workloads. I'm just wondering if you've heard of any of those trends among your customers who are thinking about compute for the first time or maybe if you're seeing increased appetite for compute for this coming year versus 2023."", 'F. Thomson Leighton', ""Yes. Compute is an enormous marketplace and growing rapidly, and there's always new applications that are being created and not just migrating from a data center into the cloud, but just brand-new applications. And so that's where we're seeing a lot of traction, also in some cases, lift and shift out of a data center or out of a hyperscaler. But it's just an enormous marketplace and a great place for us to operate. And even those that are optimizing that's sort of, I guess, not such a great thing for the hyperscalers, but we're part of that trend. It's great for us because we can help customers reduce cloud spend. And we've gotten very good feedback from our early adopters of Akamai Connected Cloud that they're saving a lot of money. So the trend to optimization is a positive thing for Akamai."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Rishi Jaluria of RBC.', 'Rishi Nitya Jaluria', ""Let me echo my colleagues in thanking Tom Barth. It's been a great decade working with you and really excited for your next chapter. I wanted to drill on to -- maybe going back to Gecko. I guess, number one, can you talk a little bit about edge inferencing and what those use cases look like? It's one of those things that we hear a lot of talk about in theory. But maybe in practicality as you're talking to your customers and having those conversations, what can that look like? And what positions Gecko uniquely for that?And then maybe financially, to the extent -- I know it's still early. Are you assuming real Gecko contribution on the compute line in your guidance for the year? Or is that something that as it gets traction, could lead to more upside beyond what you modeled?"", 'F. Thomson Leighton', ""Great. So let me start with edge inferencing. And so some of the examples I gave, that's exactly what's happening for commerce sites in figuring out in real time, what content you're actually going to give to the user that's coming to the site, ad targeting, what ad do they get? Anything that involves personalization.On the security side, a ton of inferencing is used to analyze real-time data. For example, even our own bot management solution, is that entity that's coming to the site, is it a bot or is it a human? And even if it's a human and they have the right credentials, is it the right human? And you use AI and inferencing for that, and you got to do it really fast. You can't afford to send it back to the centralized data center because you got a massive number of people that you've got to process in real time, especially if you're doing some kind of live event.And so being at the edge matters because you can be scalable, you can handle it locally, you get great performance. You can make it be real time. And Akamai's unique value proposition with Gecko is that we're going to be able to now support this not in a few cities, but in 100 cities by the end of this year. So anything you can put in a VM, virtual machine, which is most things, you're going to be able to do that in 100 cities and then ultimately, in hundreds of cities because we can put this in general Akamai edge PoPs. And then next will be containers, which is pretty much the rest of what you do in cloud computing. And then to be able to spin it all up automatically. It's a whole new concept for compute that I think is very powerful. And there's a high overlap of wanting to do that with inferencing engines, where you're trying to do something intelligent based on that end user or that entity that's interacting with the application.Now in terms of Gecko, we're just now in the early stages of getting it deployed. We're in 9 cities, we'll get the tenth new city up in another month or so. By the end of the year, we'll be in a total of 100 cities supporting compute. So not a lot of revenue is factored into the guidance based on Gecko for this year. That would come more next year. So this year's revenue guidance is based on the original 25 core compute regions that we've set up by the end of last year.Now we will deploy this, of course, just as fast as we can and as customers want to adopt it. And hopefully, we have the situation where we want to build out more, get more compute capacity because there's so much demand for compute on Akamai. Ed, do you have any color you want to add around the guidance there?"", 'Edward J. McGowan', ""No, I think you captured it right, Tom. We don't -- we're not really anticipating anything. I mean one thing we are doing this year is we are making changes to our comp plan with our reps, so that they all have to sell compute this year. So you could see things, reps get very creative. I learned in sales that comp drives behavior. So by leaning in here and making it something that all reps have to do, we should see a lot more use cases, a lot more opportunities, et cetera. So there's always a chance that we could be surprised here with the creativity of our field bringing us opportunities, but we did not factor in anything material as it relates to Gecko."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Michael Elias of TD Cowen.', 'Michael Elias', ""Two if I may. Just first on Gecko. Presumably, the PoPs that you have, they are already supporting security and delivery workloads. Just from an architecture perspective, can you help us think about what expanding the compute platform into these PoPs mean? Is it just additional co-location deployments and on the CapEx side, networking gear and servers? Any color that you could give there in terms of the mechanics of what the expansion would look like?And then second, Ed, last year, you were talking about elongation of enterprise sales cycles. Just curious what you're seeing in terms of the buying behavior of your customer base. Any notable callouts there?"", 'F. Thomson Leighton', ""All right. So I'll take the first one. With Gecko, that is generally speaking an existing Akamai edge PoPs. And in particular, they tend to be the larger ones where we already have a lot of equipment that's already connected into our backbone, and what we'd be doing is adding additional servers. And for compute, it would be a beefier server and additional co-lo for those servers. But all the other infrastructure is generally already there, and it's already connected in and we already have delivery and security operating there. So it does become a very efficient way for us to deploy Gecko. And Ed, do you want to take the second one there?"", 'Edward J. McGowan', ""Sure. Yes. So I think the trend, obviously, acquiring new customers is always challenging in an environment like this. The one probably exception to that is in the security space. That tends to be something that obviously, now with the requirements with the SEC reporting and added disclosure with CISOs being now potentially criminally charged for breaches and things like that, Audit Committees spending more and more time on cybersecurity as a topic. That tends to be a budget that: one, you don't typically cut; and two, you're generally adding to.But yes, new customers are challenging. I do think this kind of environment helps us what we were just talking about in the last few questions around optimizing cloud spend. Certainly, if you've seen what we've done, we've seen us put a tremendous amount of money. So I think that can also help us in this particular environment. But definitely, new customer acquisition is a bit more challenging, but we're still doing pretty well. Obviously, the environment can change. But it hasn't been a major factor for us yet."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Ray McDonough of Guggenheim Securities.', 'Raymond Michael McDonough', ""Maybe, Tom, just a follow-up to a prior question. As we think about Gecko and you mentioned that your edge sites right now don't have full stack compute. But how much work is done to be -- to converge what you already have at your edge sites and what you've done in terms of building out Linode's capabilities? Should we expect there to be a common software stack across both edge and centralized sites? And if so, is the plan to have that in place by year-end?"", 'F. Thomson Leighton', ""Yes. Great question. So what we're doing now is, as I mentioned in the last question, deploying more hardware in existing edge regions and generally the larger edge regions. We already have network there. We already have delivery, security located there. So there's some additional co-lo and servers. And yes, the goal is to put it all on one common software stack.Now initially, we have -- the Linode stack is moving into these edge PoPs for Gecko. But as we -- once we get the support for virtual machines and containers, then next, we want to add the software stack that we have for delivery and for security and for function as a service that automatically, for example, spins up JavaScript apps in milliseconds based on end-user demand. We want all of that to be operating on containers and VMs, so that you don't have to think ahead of time about how many VMs do you want in each of these hundreds of cities. It just happens based on end user demand. You automatically get new ones spun up, load balancing, failover, really a very compelling concept. And that doesn't exist in the cloud marketplace today. That is the vision. I think you really nailed it when you talked about the common software stack because only Akamai has that full edge platform today, that software stack around delivery and security that will be now including compute."", 'Raymond Michael McDonough', ""And maybe as a quick follow-up, Ed, as we think about the expansion of the Linode footprint last year, can you help us understand as much as you can, how much of the space currently built out was for internal use purposes to help with that third-party cloud savings versus space that's online now that's revenue generating? And I know we've talked about this in the past, but any color around what we should expect from a customer utilization perspective that might be embedded in your guidance as we move through year-end? That would be helpful."", 'Edward J. McGowan', ""Yes. Sure. So the majority of the growth in the compute guidance is going to come from enterprise compute. So the stuff that we built out for the last year. So if you kind of go back and look at the math in terms of -- we've kind of said roughly speaking, $1 of CapEx is $1 of revenue. You can kind of look at what we're doing for compute build-out now, what we did last year. We said we got about $100 million roughly for our -- all in for our internal use. So that leaves a pretty significant amount left for customer demand.Now obviously, the way people buy today, they pick a location, et cetera. So it's not going to be exactly a dollar for dollar right now, but it's a general rule of thumb. So I would say the majority of what we built out is for customer usage."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer.', 'Timothy Kelly Horan', ""Following up on Ray's question. So I'm assuming the goal here is to get to one single platform where customers can access the full range of services relatively easily on, I guess, one on ramp-up. When do you think you'll get there? And secondly, the Gecko product, it sounds like is this completely serverless? And is it a development platform also?"", 'F. Thomson Leighton', ""Yes. So I think one platform really in terms of being able to do everything together and all the same software so that we have our edge software running with the Linode software to spin up VMs and containers, that's not until 2025. We are, first, combining the infrastructure and of course, customers can buy the services as a package. We have common reporting now in many cases. But in terms of doing all the automatic spinning up and truly serverless use for VMs and containers, think 2025 for that. And let's see. So -- and what was the other question you had?"", 'Timothy Kelly Horan', 'So the new product, Gecko, it is primarily a serverless product, it sounds like. And do you have all the support there for developers to completely run their applications on this new platform?', 'F. Thomson Leighton', ""Yes. And it's -- well, it depends how you define serverless. Initially with Gecko, you would operate it the same way you would Linode. You decide how many VMs and containers you want in the various cities. And it is very developer-friendly, works just like Linode. So if you're familiar there, that would now work in -- well, at the end of the year, 100 cities for your virtual machines.Now if you define serverless to be -- which doesn't exist today at the marketplace for VMs and containers, they just spin up automatically like we do today for function as a service and for JavaScript, that's what comes 2025."", 'Timothy Kelly Horan', ""If you don't mind me asking me, it sounds a lot like what Cloudflare is doing, but you're saying it doesn't exist today. Can you maybe talk about a little bit what's different, what you're doing?"", 'F. Thomson Leighton', ""Yes. That's a great question. They don't support VMs or containers at all, never mind serverless or anything else, just -- they don't have support for that. They don't do this full stack cloud computing."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Alex Henderson of Needham.', 'Alexander Henderson', ""So it seems pretty clear that Guardicore has been a critical piece of your security growth and obviously is perturbing the overall growth rate. I was hoping you could give us some sense of what the security product lines, excluding Guardicore, look like in terms of their growth rates. Any sizing of that growth would be -- even a ballpark, would be quite helpful.And then second, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about your -- you mentioned inferencing, but I think it came in kind of as an afterthought as opposed to the primary focus. Can you talk about your involvement in AI inferencing at the edge and to what extent that requires either the 2025 kind of structure or what needs you have there and whether you're putting GPUs out of the edge in order to facilitate that?"", 'F. Thomson Leighton', ""Ed, do you want to go with the first one, and I'll take the second one?"", 'Edward J. McGowan', ""Sure. Why don't I go to the first one. On the spirit of it being a year-end call, I'll break out these numbers at a high level for you, but won't be doing it every quarter. So if I look at the -- what we used to -- what we called the app and API security bucket, that's our largest bucket, that includes bot management, our fraud products, our web app firewall, our new API security product. That's actually in Q4 growing over 20%. So that's been incredible. Guardicore itself, if I normalize for the onetime software that we did last Q4, is growing at about 63%. Infrastructure and services are growing sub-10%."", 'Alexander Henderson', 'Just to be clear, is this the full year growth rate? Or is this the fourth quarter growth rate?', 'Edward J. McGowan', ""This is the fourth quarter growth rate. The full year, I don't have (inaudible)."", 'Alexander Henderson', ""That's (inaudible). I just needed to know what it was."", 'F. Thomson Leighton', ""Okay. Yes. In terms of the question around inferencing and AI and so forth, yes, we're building full stack compute to have great performance at a lower price point and have that available in hundreds of cities. And one of the many things that you would do with that is AI inferencing, and that's not an afterthought. In fact, we've been using AI in our products for, well, 10 years. Bot management, for example, runs on Akamai Connected Cloud. It's one of many things that run on it.So not an afterthought. There is an enormous amount of buzz now about AI. And I think a lot of that is justified. And I think there's a lot more compute going to be consumed because of AI. And it is a strong use case among our customers that are using Akamai Connected Cloud. That said, it's not all AI. In fact, our biggest customers are doing media workflow, doing live transcoding. And that's not using AI. So I think AI is an important use case, one of several use cases.Now in particular, you asked '24 versus '25, it's being done already on our platforms. There's no need to wait until the end of the year unless you want to do it in 100 cities, then that comes at the end of the year. No need to wait to '25 when the instances are spun up automatically instead of by design ahead of time the way compute works today.So you talked about GPUs. Akamai has GPUs deployed. We're deploying more. We've used them in the past for graphics and going forward, probably use them for gen AI uses. We're not really deploying them right now in the edge PoPs. And that's not -- because you don't need to. It's not cost-effective. In the edge PoPs, you're going to be doing the inferencing. And for the inferencing, you can use GPUs, but we're also using CPUs. And right now, we get a better ROI on the CPUs. So I guess there's a lot of confusion there as well. Now GPUs are critical for doing training for especially large language models, and that's going to be done in the core and we're not supporting that as a key use case today.We could, in theory, right, we have all the technology to do it, but that's not where we're focused in terms of getting the best ROI for our platform. And for that matter, most of the work with these models, most of the compute is done when you're using them for the inferencing. You do the training and then you spend just so it learns, you get it ready to go, and then you operate it. And it's the operation where most -- the vast majority of the cycles are, and that can be done on CPUs and in many cases, the cases I mentioned, for personalization, for security, for data analytics. That's done on the edge more as good reason to be done there using CPU-based hardware."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Jonathan Ho of William Blair.', 'Jonathan Frank Ho', 'Just one question from me. How important is the global load balancing capability? And what does that maybe mean for your ability to either attract more customers or to drive revenue from that product?', 'F. Thomson Leighton', ""Yes. That's very helpful because it makes it much more scalable. You have failover, so much more reliable. And I think it's a basic capability, of course, we've had for forever it seems in delivery and security, and now that's available for compute. So I think that's important and that greatly increases the market we can go after for compute."", 'Operator', 'Our last question will come from Rudy Kessinger of D.A. Davidson.', 'Rudy Grayson Kessinger', ""Ed, if my math is correct, even if I exclude the $100 million in CapEx and compute last year intended for moving over internal workloads, between last year and this year, it looks to be about $400 million in compute CapEx. And going back to that kind of $1 in CapEx equals $1 of revenue capacity, $400 million in CapEx, roughly $200 million of compute growth '24 versus '22. Do you feel like you guys are maybe overbuilding at all? Or what gives you the confidence, I guess, in the pipeline and the ramping usage to spend so much on another round of build-out this year when we're not yet seeing growth accelerate, right? You're guiding to 20% growth next year that's flat with Q4."", 'Edward J. McGowan', ""Yes. So I'll just -- let me address that part first. So I would say if you look at the underlying components of what's growing, it's actually that enterprise compute opportunity that's growing very, very, very fast. Like those numbers, the percentages, would be kind of foolish to break out because they're going off of small numbers and adding to them very big numbers. Now also part of our strategy is to be competitive and have big core centers in many cities, and that does require a larger build-out. So there's a lot of capacity that we have to sell. And then also, we're seeing demand in certain cities. You have to build out more capacity where you're getting demand. And then the Gecko sites that we're building out, it's not a significant -- I mean, it's a decent amount of capital. But I think that is another big key differentiator for us. And as Tom mentioned, we think there's a big opportunity there.So I know a lot of people have been questioning us being able to take on large workloads, et cetera. We clearly have a lot of capacity out there. As I talked about earlier, we've made the change with our compensation plans where our reps now have to sell compute. So we're going to see a lot more at bats. We've done a tremendous amount with the platform in terms of adding functionality. We built out the platform, connected it to our backbone, and we have a lot of new compute partners. The platform is ready to be sold. So we're pretty optimistic about it. And I think we're building in a pretty responsible manner. As I talked about, our CapEx is relatively modest for this business right now. So I think we're in pretty good shape.And with that, that will end today's call. I want to thank everyone for joining, and have a great evening."", 'F. Thomson Leighton', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', ""The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation, and you may now disconnect.""]"

294,3cf724d1-cde2-3f7c-8d45-c12333b09f05,DVN,2024-02-15,Another Mega-Merger Is Brewing in the U.S. Shale Patch,Oilprice.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/another-mega-merger-brewing-u-010000496.html,1707958800,STORY,"['DVN', 'ERF.TO', 'ERF', 'XOM']","['The merger and acquisition deals are coming in the shale patch, at a rate almost too fast to document. Last week news broke about Devon Energy, (NYSE:DVN), and Canadian-based producer, Enerplus, (NYSE:ERF) opening merger talks. Enerplus has some choice acreage in the Bakken play that would be very attractive to Devon as it fills in a lot of gaps in its own prime Bakken acreage. They also hold some non-operated acreage in the Marcellus, that would likely be sold off as Devon has no other operation in that basin. The Bakken is home to some of the longest shale laterals, and the ERF “jigsaw puzzle” pieces would assist DVN greatly in maximizing the production from the play.', ""Details are sketchy at this point, and I wouldn't be surprised if ERF isn't holding out for a cash premium given the liquids-rich “dirt”- 68%, they own. That would be the smart play for their shareholders. DVN has reached for its checkbook in its last couple of deals, for\xa0RimRock, and\xa0Validus. The stocks of both companies are off from peaks set in Q-3 of last year, DVN about 30% and ERF about 15%. This is the time to be merging with companies that can contribute immediately to the bottom line, and synergistically make Newco potentially a better entity than the two were separately. That’s what’s supposed to happen anyway."", 'The question arises, should Devon be the one buying? Here’s the problem with the moves Devon has made employing this fill-in-the-gaps, “bolt-on” strategy, from a shareholder perspective. They aren’t getting paid for it by the investing community! Perhaps ERF should be buying Devon’s Bakken acreage. The industrial logic works that way as well. We will table that thought for now, but return to it as we close out the article.', 'Put aside other factors, such as declines in oil and gas prices, and focus only on one thing. When Devon bought the RimRock acreage in June of 2022, the share price was $69. When they bought Validus in August of 2022, the stock price was $65. Since those halcyon days of 2022 when people talked glibly of $100 WTI going back to $120, DVN stock has nose-dived, along with WTI, to be fair, into the low $40’s. $2.7 bn in cash later and investors have lost 40% of their capital. This is the sort of thing that attracts activist investors, and it wouldn’t surprise me to see\xa0Engine #1\xa0or\xa0Carl Icahn\xa0take a sizeable position to get board seats and start swinging a meat axe.', 'In this article, we will compare a couple the Devon/ERF potential merger with another M&A transaction now in process. There are some glaring differences that should put the proposed deal between Devon and Enerplus in the proper frame.', 'There is a limit to how far you can go comparing a Super Major like ExxonMobil, (NYSE:XOM) and even a large U.S.-focused shale producer like Devon Energy. That said, the “Industrial Logic” behind the XOM deal with Pioneer is evident if you look at the pro forma acreage footprint in the Midland basin, in the slide below. The difference between what ExxonMobil is doing with its merger with Pioneer and what Devon is proposing to do with Enerplus is that the former is enhancing its core acreage position in the most prolific shale basin in the country. It remains to be seen if XOM shareholders will reap any bounty, at least over the short term, from this deal. XOM stock was $112 in October, of 2023 when it was announced, and trades just above $100 today.', 'Devon, on the other hand, has been expanding into other shale plays, to take advantage of regional aspects of each. The problem with that approach is Devon has not performed in the top percentile in these other basins, nor have they delivered growth to their shareholders.', 'As noted, Devon’s share price has collapsed with each additional deal, while the management of Pioneer has delivered growth to its shareholders by focusing on expanding its empire in the Permian. In 2021\xa0PXD’s $6.4 bn acquisition of Double Point Energy\xa0raised some eyebrows coming on the heels of its $7.6 bn (cash and debt assumption) acquisition of\xa0Parsley Energy. Nearly $14 bn in acquisitions in half a year, for a company Pioneer’s size was a bold move by management.', 'Pioneer filings', 'Pioneer wasted no time in monetizing assets from the Parsley Energy pickup, selling the\xa0Delaware basin acreage to Continental Resources\xa0for $3.25 bn in late 2021. Shareholders of Pioneer received $21.68 in regular and special dividends in 2022, and capital growth from $140 per share in early 2021 to the final sales to XOM of $253 per share. By any measure, shareholders of Pioneer have benefited from the shrewd empire-building in the Midland basin.', 'Scott Sheffield, Pioneer’s long-time CEO, and the architect of the empire in the Midland basin that drew ExxonMobil’s eye, is retiring this year at the top of his game. Capping his career with the company sale to XOM, he is set to receive a payout of cash and stock of $151 mm, according to this\xa0Bloomberg article. I expect few PXD shareholders will begrudge him this magnificent payday.', 'Let’s now look closer at what Devon hopes to achieve with the multi-billion dollar acquisition of Enerplus.', 'Here is what Devon management told us about the RimRock acreage pickup. The slide directly below discusses its ""industrial logic."" As you can see, the rationale was obvious as the RimRock acreage facilitated several aspects of shale development laterals, optimized well spacing, critical mass-higher output, in theory-lower production costs, and enhanced logistics.', ""They ticked every box, and shareholders were promised that increased free cash flow generation would result and increased amounts of cash would be returned to them. As previously noted, Devon Energy's stock went from $69 to $65 per share in just a few months. What actually happened? Free cash declined from 60% of operational cash flow-OCF in 2021 to 40% of OCF in 2022. What about shareholder returns?"", 'Dividends paid out to shareholders went from $1.97 in 2021 to $5.17 in 2022 but declined to $2.87 in 2023. If you add the value of share buybacks-$4.65, over this period, it gets better, but at a total of $12.67 all-in, Devon shareholders have fared much more poorly than PXD shareholders, with no capital appreciation to sweeten the medicine!', 'Now we come to the basics of what ERF might mean to DVN. Or what DVN’s Bakken acreage might mean to Enerplus.', ""The fit between ERF's footprint in Dunn, and McKenzie counties becomes apparent when you transpose it against DVN's current footprint in the slide above. The Industrial Logic only gets better with the two combined, when you look at the blocky acreage in Willams County. The three counties mentioned here are in the top ten and top twenty shale-producing counties nationally, according to my industry sources."", ""There is another aspect to DVN's interest in ERF. Enerplus is killing it in productivity. If you look at the slide above the YoY growth rate from 2021 to 2022 is 13%. DVN's Williston output by comparison has been fairly flat during this period. Industry sources confirm to me that ERF is one of the top producers in this basin, landing in the top 15 nationally. In their last conference call, DVN management noted a decline in the Bakken and a shift of capital focus to the Delaware basin."", ""Finally, on LOE-lease operating costs. Company filings reveal that ERF is light years ahead of DVN, coming in at $10.75-11.00 in Q-3, vs $13.04 for DVN. DVN reports a cash margin in the Williston of $32.14 on realized pricing of $52.64. If they had ERF's numbers it would correlate to an 8% bump higher."", ""DVN last paid $23K per acreage to RimRock, so I expect that will be a starting point for ERF's consideration. An equivalent offer for their 236K acres would total in the neighborhood of $5.4 bn, making quite a windfall for ERF shareholders with the company's current capitalization of $3.15 bn."", 'I expect the cash side of this deal is the hard part. After shelling out ~$900 mm for RimRock and $1.8 bn for Validus in the last couple of years, DVN only has $1.3 bn in cash on the books. Just hypothesizing, if they were to put $1 bn in cash and use debt for 40% of it, leaving a share exchange for the other ~45%-say ~$2.0 BN, the cash flow would pay out the purchase pretty quickly. Figuring price realizations at $55, and a cash margin of $35, with ~160K BOEPD of combined production would pay out in a year. But that’s been true of the other acquisitions well, and so far, there is nothing to show for it.', ""At that sale price, ERF would bring $5.4 bn in new capitalization, ~$1 bn in EBITDA and ~100K BOEPD to DVN, and almost no debt, moving DVN's EV/EBITDA metric incrementally a little higher (taking into account the new $2.0 bn in debt to close the deal) to around 3.4X from 3.0X. On a flowing barrel basis, it also moves up a bit to $52K from $46K per barrel. So the likelihood that shareholders will benefit from a deal where their basic financial metrics worsen defies logic."", 'The past is not necessarily a prologue. This deal could be the one that justifies itself with rewards to shareholders. Nothing in our review suggests this, quite the reverse, actually, but we have to allow for the possibility. The date for Devon’s 2024 annual meeting hasn’t been set yet. Typically it’s in early June. If enough disgruntled shareholders show up, it could be a raucous affair. They have ample reason to be unhappy.', 'By David Messler for Oilprice.com', 'More Top Reads From Oilprice.com:', 'Why Is Azerbaijan Hosting the World’s Most Important Climate Change Conference?', 'New Electrode Revolutionizes Hydrogen Production from Seawater', 'Wyoming Rare Earth Discovery Could Shake Up Global Markets', 'Read this article on OilPrice.com']"

We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made today to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this call."", 'I would now like to introduce Chris Cocks. Chris?', ""Chris Cocks: Thanks, Kern, and good morning, everyone. For more than a year now, you've heard me outline Hasbro's strategy to refocus on play behind a philosophy of Fewer, Bigger, Better. Fewer SKU’s that drive higher impact. Bigger investment behind winning brands in more focused categories. And Better innovation driven by a renewed leadership team and a focus on kids, parents, and fans, our consumers, the lifeblood of Hasbro. We laid out a blueprint for a more focused and profitable company with a number of growth initiatives built on a diverse portfolio of some of the most iconic brands in the toy and game industry. While business transformations take time, I'm pleased with how much we accomplished in 2023, setting the table for a 2024 punctuated by strong profit growth and momentum in renewing Hasbro's innovation engine."", ""We're entering 2024 with a healthier balance sheet, a leaner cost structure, and an operational rigor that will maintain and build on these improvements in the quarters ahead. In 2023, we took substantial action to bolster our balance sheet. At the end of the year, we closed our deal with Lionsgate on eOne Film and TV, allowing us to focus our investments on higher return, play-focused initiatives across toys, games, and digital. Proceeds from the deal allowed us to reduce our debt by approximately $400 million. As we shipped our entertainment strategy to an asset light and partner-led model, we took a $1 billion impairment, a noncash item in Q4, which reflects the sale of eOne, and a change in outlook for the balance of our own and operated production efforts."", 'This shift frees up more capital for us to reinvest in toys, games, and particularly our digital future. Between hard work from our sales and operations teams and some of the financial actions we took at the end of the quarter, we entered 2024 with inventories down over 50% year-over-year, which is well below 2019 levels. We also took steps to improve our structural profitability, exiting a number of low or negative profit businesses that we have shifted to a licensed-out model. Finally, we are driving better than expected cost savings through our operational excellence work. Unlocking crucial investment capacity as we seek to connect with fans of all ages and across all play patterns. Previously, we communicated $350 million to $400 million in annual run rate savings.', ""We're updating our target to $750 million of gross savings by the end of 2025, with half of it dropping to the bottom line. This allows us to reinvest in our business, meaningfully improve our cash flows, and return cash to our shareholders, which we are committed to continuing through our category-leading dividend. Since I became CEO in 2022, Hasbro's returned almost $1 billion to shareholders and paid down over $0.5 billion in debt. While 2023 was challenging and we still expect the toy industry to face near-term headwinds, we believe we're taking the necessary steps to turn around our consumer products business. Wizards and Digital Gaming is coming off a banner year led by MAGIC, Universes Beyond, the success of Baldur's Gate III from our partners at Larian, and Monopoly Go! from Scopely."", ""2024 is about returning consumer products to profitability, investing for long-term momentum in games, and driving significant improvements in Hasbro's bottom line, fueled by operational discipline and renewed product innovation. In short, we're putting all the right pieces together to keep investing in our growth initiatives while expanding the ways our franchises reach fans through digital games. We expect the next year we'll likely see continued headwinds in the toy category. We're exiting 2023 with our retail inventory down around 20%. While we think Hasbro's retail inventory is in a healthy position, across the industry a lot of older discounted inventory still remains in the market. The consumer remains value conscious and we anticipate entertainment will be less of a tailwind in the year ahead, behind a reduced box office slate."", ""Anticipating these headwinds, we made necessary choices to get our cost structure and inventory positions healthy. Accelerating a number of cost savings initiatives by several quarters. Since I became CEO, we have significantly enhanced our consumer insights capabilities and upgraded our design and toy leadership. In 2024, we'll see more and more of the resulting innovation improvements as these capability upgrades come to market across our portfolio. As such, we believe we're in a good position to at least pace the industry this year with innovation and share trends accelerating to ahead of market as we head into 2025. Turning around a product pipeline is key, with the right people and the right insights. At the end of the day, it's all about great product."", ""In the back half of 2023, we started to see the first evidence of our new team and products working. Take FURBY, for example. This was a product we took our time testing and iterating based on consumer insights. It paid off as FURBY was one of the top new toy introductions in 2023. We continued the FURBY craze in December with the launch of Furblets, another hit introduction, and we're excited to continue building this franchise in 2024. 2023 was also a strong year for our TRANSFORMERS franchise. On the back of the hit movie, Transformers Rise of the Beasts from our partners in Paramount, driving point of sale growth of 35%. We have some exciting activations planned as we celebrate the brand's 40th anniversary in 2024, as well as the star-studded animated movie, Transformers One, coming this summer along with fresh merchandise."", ""This year also marks PEPPA PIG’s 20th birthday. We'll be celebrating with new, innovative products and an entertainment special featuring A-list talent Katy Perry and Orlando Bloom. After gaining share in the arts and crafts category in 2023, with another strong year including our ultimate ice cream truck, the Play-Doh team continues to innovate, expect more creative surprises and new cross-brand collaborations in the year ahead. In action figures, we are leaning into our category-leading collaboration with The Walt Disney Company for their Marvel Superheroes Assemble marketing campaign, featuring new price points and products across our lines, including all new preschool fun with Spidey and His Amazing Friends. For Star Wars, we're excited to expand our best-selling Lightsaber Forge Kyber Core series and introduce our new $7.99 Epic Series 4-inch action figures."", ""We saw an incredibly strong launch from Beyblade X last year in Japan from our partners at Takara Tomy and are eagerly anticipating the U.S. launch this summer, What we believe will be one of the hottest new toys of 2024. It's an exciting product that we think long-time collectors and kids fresh to the franchise will be thrilled with. The blaster category continues to be under pressure, but we also continue to believe this is a strong and enduring play pattern for fans of all ages. This year we'll be introducing new innovation into the category, featuring a new performance start technology, pop off-the-shelf design and attractive pricing up and down the range. Board Games continues to be a leading category for us, and one we anticipate will grow in the year ahead."", ""Twister Air was a number one new game across the G-10 markets in 2023, according to Sircano. Thanks to an innovative new augmented reality experience. You're going to see a renewed focus on expanding genres, leveraging our reach and distribution strength to introduce more cool new games than ever, and working with some of the brightest designers in the industry to give their games a platform they deserve. Whether it's adult party games, family card games, casual strategy, or extending mega hits like Monopoly, 2024 will be a big year for gaming from Hasbro. Speaking of games, Wizards and Digital outperformed our guidance in 2023, driven by a series of blockbuster hits. MAGIC had another record year in ‘23 with a string of amazing new sets, including our best-selling set of all time, The Lord of the Rings: Tales of Middle-Earth."", ""While a product like Lord of the Rings creates a tough comp in 2024, we have some unique sets that fans are eagerly anticipating, including March's Fallout, a new commander-focused Universes Beyond product line, this summer's Modern Horizons III, the sequel to our prior best-selling set of all time, and this September's charming new world, [Bloom World]. We continue to see the power of our franchises play out with our digital licensing partners. Monopoly Go! from partners and Scopely is the number one mobile game launch of all time in the U.S., outperforming the launches of global phenomena like Pokemon Go and Candy Crush, and the fastest mobile title to reach $1 billion in the U.S., and the game continues to break records. In Q4 alone, the game drove more than $800 million in revenue worldwide for Scopely."", ""As far as our financial participation goes for revenue and profit, it's like having the equivalent of $1 billion movie supporting Monopoly, except every year, with the impact growing sequentially as the game works through our minimum guarantees and marketing allowances. Baldur's Gate III from our partners of Larian continues to win awards around the world and is one of the highest rated video games of all time. We expect a long tail into 2024 and beyond for this mega hit. Last but not least, we have a compelling new lineup of adventures, core rulebooks, and new digital first offerings for D&D as we celebrate this iconic brand's 50th anniversary. We'll launch the biggest update to fifth edition since its introduction in 2014, reinventing everything from the artwork of our iconic monsters, to new classes, to new mechanics, to bold new ways to bring to life the world of D &D digitally."", ""All of this will add up to more and more impressive product as the year goes on, leading into an even brighter 2025. We look forward to sharing more about 2025. All new brands, entertainment collaborations, and a chance to really show what this team is capable of later this year. Wrapping up, 2023 was a challenging year, but not without significant wins. Wins we believe augur the Hasbro to come. A company rededicated to play, innovation, and fun for fans of all ages. Last year, we launched a top toy with FURBY. We won a Game of the Year award with Twister Air. And we wowed tens of millions with Monopoly Go! Transformers Rise of the Beast, Baldur's Gate III, and Magic Lord of the Rings, all while cleaning up the business, selling eOne, paying down debt, and clearing excess inventory, which makes for a healthier, stronger Hasbro to start 2024."", ""I'm excited to see the results to come. I'd now like to turn over the call to Gina to share more about our detailed results and to provide guidance for the year. Gina?"", ""Gina Goetter: Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. 2023 marked an important milestone in our transformation towards a more streamlined and profitable toy and game company. As Chris mentioned, transformations take time and amidst the tough industry backdrop, I'm proud of the progress the Hasbro team made over the past several quarters in resetting the business and getting us in the best position for 2024. Before I touch on the financial highlights from the past year, I want to recap three major actions we took and how to think through their impacts. First, we successfully closed the sale of the eOne Film and TV business to Lionsgate, and we used the proceeds to reduce debt by $400 million, which will result in annual interest expense savings of approximately $25 million."", 'In addition to reducing our leverage, the sale of eOne frees up capital to invest in higher growth initiatives, while allowing us to continue monetizing Hasbro IP in an asset-light structure. In conjunction with the sale and the change in the business strategy for family brands, namely PEPPA PIG and PJ Masks, we recorded a noncash, goodwill and intangible asset impairment of approximately $1 billion, which you will see in our reported results. As we look to 2024, besides the reduction in interest expense, we also expect to see an improvement in operating margin, as well as an improvement to cash flow, given the reduction in production spending. Second, in Q4, we accelerated efforts to clean up our excess inventory. As I had mentioned last quarter, we were focused on starting 2024 in a cleaner position.', 'And we would remain agile in taking actions consistent with broader category momentum. While we landed within our revenue guidance, we did not see the holiday season pickup that we were hoping for, and as a result took more aggressive actions in bringing inventory levels down over 50% from the prior year. Our inventory is now running well below pre-pandemic levels, and we believe this improved position will allow us to drive higher value retail distribution and return focus to upcoming toy and game innovation. We also expect annual savings of roughly $10 million from exiting overflow locations previously used to store excess inventory. And while this was the right decision for the long-term health of the business, the near term impact from accelerating this cleanup resulted in a roughly $130 million noncash impact to operating income.', ""Lastly, as part of our operational excellence program, we made the difficult decision in Q4 to reduce the size of our workforce. While these decisions are never easy, this move will enable cost savings, which will improve profitability and fuel investments towards long term growth around toy and digital games innovation. Moving to our financial results and business segment highlights, in Q4 we saw a continuation of the trends seen throughout much of the year. Total Hasbro revenue of $1.3 billion was down 23% versus last year. Wizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming revenue increased 7% behind ongoing contributions from the award winning Baldur's Gate III and Monopoly Go! Consumer products declined 25% due to the planned business exits, broader category declines, and an enhanced focus on clearing inventory."", ""Q4 adjusted operating loss of $50 million was down year-on-year, mostly driven by nonrecurring and noncash charges of $168 million which includes the $130 million of inventory write off. We believe the cleanup efforts are behind us as we are starting 2024 at much healthier levels compared to prior years and our retail inventory is at an acceptable level. Q4 adjusted net earnings were $52 million with diluted earnings per share of $0.38, also down versus the prior year, primarily due to the aforementioned nonrecurring charges. For the full year 2023, total Hasbro revenue of $5 billion was down 15% versus 2022 and within our previously stated guidance range. Wizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming revenue grew 10%, ahead of our guidance benefiting from the success of Baldur's Gate III, MAGIC: THE GATHERING, and Monopoly Go! Consumer products revenues were down 19% for the full year driven by planned business exits, softer industry trends, and stronger inventory management on behalf of our retailers."", ""Adjusting for the exit of brands and markets, revenue would have declined by 15%. And despite the tougher category backdrop, we delivered some bright spots within our toy portfolio, including Transformers, Twister Air, Furby, and GI Joe. On a reported basis, the Entertainment segment revenue declined by 31% as the writers' and actors' strikes impacted content deliveries. Family Brands revenue grew 6% from streaming deals of animated content in support of Hasbro's brands. Total Hasbro Inc. 2023 adjusted operating profit was $477 million, down 48% versus last year, primarily driven by the nonrecurring expenses, as well as lower revenues. 2023 adjusted net earnings of $349 million, or $2.51 per diluted share, was down 44% versus last year. Besides the charges for inventory, earnings were negatively impacted by content impairments and higher royalty expense, partially offset by our cost savings program and a one-time tax benefit."", ""Operating cash flow for the full year was $726 million, well ahead of our guidance and nearly double from the prior year, driven mostly by a working capital benefit of approximately $350 million due to the inventory cleanup efforts. We ended the year with $545 million in cash on our balance sheet and reduced debt by approximately $500 million. We also returned $388 million of capital to our shareholders via dividends. Before I move to guidance for 2024, I want to frame how we are thinking about the year ahead from an operational perspective, and in particular, how we're looking to turn around the consumer product business. In 2023, we took the necessary steps in our transformation to reset the business. This year, with the right foundation in place, we are focused on reinvigorating innovation across the portfolio, while continuing to drive operational rigor, which we expect to pave the way for sustainable profitable growth."", ""The near-term model that we're building is one where cost productivity provides the fuel to innovate and grow the business. And in 2024, there remains a significant opportunity to improve the underlying profitability, while rebuilding its innovation engine. These two go hand-in-hand and align with our overarching strategy of focusing on Fewer, Bigger, and Better brands. Over the past several quarters, we have been mobilizing around this imperative and taking actions to simplify and prioritize resources on our largest portfolios and biggest bets. One of the single biggest contributors to complexity reduction relates to our product portfolio. Moving into 2024, we have eliminated about half of our SKUs. These SKUs were only 2% of our revenue and were duplicative and unprofitable, quashing the network and creating cost for us and our retailers."", 'Along similar lines, we made the decision to move to an out-license model for brands where we determined the respective path to scale and profitability as an owned and operated entity did not meet our internal threshold. In 2024, for Real Friends, an Easy-Bake Oven will transition. While there are short-term impacts to revenue from this model shift, we ultimately can expect greater operating profit dollars from out-license IP and it allows us to focus resources back to our core brands. In 2023, we started the work to streamline our supply chain and improve the efficiency of the organization. And in 2024, we will be continuing these efforts by reaching further upstream to unlock value in our product design and manufacturing processes. We are taking an organization-wide focus across the supply chain, brandings, product development, procurement, and manufacturing to identify waste and redefine the right design-to-value equation for each product.', ""Ultimately, this will culminate in higher margins and contribute to an improved play experience. We started this work last year on select brands within our Hasbro gaming portfolio and will be rapidly extending this approach to two of our biggest brands, NERF and Play-Doh. Also, within our supply chain, we are building new capabilities within planning and forecasting to ensure that inventory levels, both owned and retail, remain within the desired threshold. We made significant progress coming out of 2023 and these updated processes and tools will ensure that we maintain a healthy inventory position. Since coming on board at Hasbro, I've talked about the imperative to bring costs down within managed expenses to stop the dynamic of overhead growing faster than revenue, particularly within the consumer product segment."", ""In December, we announced the next round of actions to address the organizational structure. We have also introduced zero-based budgeting as a tool to help us optimize our spending and ensure dollars invested are driving the right actions in our in-support of our strategy. And finally, we are continuing to enhance our capabilities around consumer insights, revenue growth management, and marketing effectiveness as core drivers in strengthening our foundation and enhancing product development. Looking forward to the 2024 holidays, we have more innovation compared to last year that's backed by insights and stronger pricing precision. This, coupled with stronger planned execution with our retailers, will enable Q4 growth across the toy business."", ""Turning to guidance for 2024 and looking more closely at the two main operating segments, total Wizards revenue is forecasted down 3% to 5%. The decline is primarily a result of the strong growth delivered in 2023 behind the launch of Baldur's Gate III and the Magic Lord of the Rings set. Looking at each of the pieces, we are planning for growth within D&D with the upcoming update of the fifth edition and the continued expansion of D&D beyond. MAGIC will have the same number of releases in 2024 as last year, but revenue will be flat to down as we count Lord of the Rings. It's important to call out that MAGIC will be back to growth in 2025 as we expand our Universes Beyond lineup. Licensed digital games will be relatively flat. The revenue from Baldur's Gate III will begin to taper down as we move through the year and will be partially offset by the continued momentum of Monopoly Go! With the success of the game, we are now anticipating that we will begin to record revenue higher than the contract's minimum guarantee in the back half of the year."", ""From a phasing standpoint, we expect Wizards revenue to grow in the front half with a decline coming in the back half as we comp the huge launches. Wizards operating margin will be between 38 % and 40%, which will be up 200 to 400 basis points versus last year. The margin improvement is a result of a favorable mix shift within digital, lower royalty rates across MAGIC, and strong cost management within operating expenses. Margin are also benefiting from supply chain cost productivity more than offsetting the inflation. For Consumer products, revenue will be down 7% to 12%. About half of the decline is due to actions we've taken to improve profitability, including the planned business exits, as well as a reduction in unprofitable closeout revenue given the significant inventory cleanup executed at year end."", 'The other half of the decline is a result of prevailing category trends. Overall, we are planning to grow share in the categories in which we compete and are leaning into innovation green shoots with step ups in Hasbro gaming, Beyblade, Play-Doh, FURBY, and NERF. And we are also adopting a more agile approach with our marketing dollars to better target consumers and increase the effectiveness of the spend. We are forecasting revenue trends will improve as we move through the year with steeper declines in Q1 and Q2 and stabilization coming in the back half of the year behind innovation, marketing effectiveness, and maintaining healthy retail inventory levels heading into the holidays. A key focus for 2024 is improving the profitability of toys.', 'And we are forecasting operating margins to be between 4% and 6%, which is 500 to 700 basis points better than last year. Approximately 400 basis points of improvement is driven by the lap of the nonrecurring inventory charges. And this is almost completely offset by the anticipated volume declines and associated deleverage impact. The additional margin expansion is driven by a combination of favorable product mix due to less close-up volume, supply chain cost savings more than offsetting inflation, reduced complexity across the network, and operating expense reductions. Margin will also be positively impacted from the work on SKU elimination and design the value, which I mentioned earlier. For Entertainment, stripping out the impact of the eOne divestiture, revenue will be down approximately $15 million versus last year.', 'And operating margin will show significant improvement driven by operating expense reductions, as well as lapping the impact of the D&D movie impairment in 2023. We will continue to report entertainment as a separate segment for 2024, albeit on a much smaller base. As part of the 2024 guidance, we are increasing our gross cost savings target through 2025 from the $350 million to $400 million communicated in December to $750 million. Through 2023, we have delivered approximately $220 million of gross cost savings and anticipate a sizable step up as we move through the next two years. Roughly half of the gross cost savings will drop to the bottom line as we focus on improving profitability and the remaining dollars will be reinvested back into the business to support growth initiatives including the reinvigoration of toy innovation and the continued investment in the gaming business.', 'With the improvement and operating margin across all segments, Total Hasbro Inc. EBITDA is forecasted to be $925 million to $1 billion, up $215 million to $290 million versus the prior year. The positive impact from the cost structure reset as well as the lack of the one-time inventory cleanup in 2023 is more than able to offset the revenue decline and cost inflation. We are planning for relatively flat-owned inventory levels in 2024 and estimate approximately $225 million of project capital to support growth initiatives and invest back into the infrastructure as we continue to rebuild the underpinning of the operation. Ending cash will be slightly down versus 2023, driven by relatively flat-owned inventory levels, increased capital project spending, and additional costs associated with the restructuring actions announced in December.', ""From a capital allocation standpoint, our priorities remain to first, invest behind the core business. Second is to return cash to shareholders via the dividend and third to continue progressing towards our long-term leveraged targets and pay down debt. As you heard Chris mention, we remain committed to our category-leading dividend and believe that the changes that we've made within working capital to free up cash, as well as the changes we're making on the broader cost structure, provide enough cash flexibility to deliver on the capital allocation priorities.

The company in a Tuesday earnings announcement posted a Q4 operating loss of $1.2 billion.', 'For the full year, Hasbro’s revenue fell 15% to $5 billion from $5.9 billion a year earlier. The company saw an operating loss of $1.54 billion, including $1.3 billion of impairment charges related to divesting eOne, as well as nonrecurring inventory costs and royalty expenses.', ""Hasbro's full-year outlook anticipates revenue for its consumer products segment will be down 7% to 12%.\xa0The company also raised its cost-cutting target to $750 million from its previous goal of $350 million to $400 million by the end of 2025."", ""Hasbro's Q4 results stand in stark contrast to Mattel, which reported net sales of $1.6 billion for Q4, up 16%\xa0from $1.4 billion a year ago. Mattel's full-year net sales were flat at $5.4 billion."", '“While we landed within our revenue guidance, we did not see the holiday season pickup that we were hoping for,” CFO Gina Goetter said on a Tuesday earnings call,\xa0according to a Seeking Alpha transcript.', 'However, CEO Chris Cocks said in a statement that Hasbro is starting the new year with a healthier balance sheet, a leaner cost structure and the ability to invest in the business. Goetter echoed that sentiment.', '“As we navigated the current environment, we took aggressive steps to optimize our inventory, reset the cost structure, and sharpen our portfolio focus on play with the eOne film and TV divestiture,” Goetter said.', 'Goetter said during a Tuesday earnings call that Hasbro took three actions to help improve performance\xa0in 2023. First, it sold its eOne film and TV business to Lionsgate for $500 million and used the proceeds to reduce its debt by $400 million. The move will also result in annual interest expense savings of about $25 million. Second, the company accelerated its efforts to clear excess inventory, reducing its owned inventory by 51% versus last year. Inventory is now below pre-pandemic levels, Goetter said. Lastly, Hasbro in December said it planned to eliminate about 900 jobs\xa0in order to improve profitability and fuel long-term growth investments, Goetter said.', 'Another part of the company’s long-term revamp included eliminating half of its SKUs. Goetter said they represented just 2% of revenue and were duplicative and unprofitable for the company and retailers. Hasbro’s toy and game brand portfolio includes Dungeons & Dragons, GI Joe, Nerf, My Little Pony, and Transformers, which had a related movie release last year.', 'That movie,\xa0“Transformers: Rise of the Beasts,”\xa0drove point-of-sale growth of 35%, Cocks said. The company also plans to launch new products, promotions and content this year in celebration of the Transformers’ 40th anniversary.', 'However, full-year revenue for Hasbro’s entertainment segment fell 31%. The company said that was due to last year’s Hollywood writers’ and actors’ strikes. Revenue in its consumer products segment fell 19%\xa0for the year due to category trends, business exits and inventory management. Hasbro did report full-year growth for its Transformers and G.I. Joe properties. It also relaunched its Furby property last year. The Wizards of the Coast and digital gaming segment was up, rising 10% and driven by an increase in revenue from licensed digital gaming through titles like Baldur’s Gate III and Monopoly Go.', 'This story was originally published on Retail Dive.

In this article, we look into the 30 unhappiest countries in the world and understand the factors that contribute to the pervasive sense of unhappiness among their populations.', ""It's important to remember that happiness or unhappiness are very subjective so it is not very simple to determine a single metric to measure it; however, there are certain needs essential to all humans that help make this process easier. The World Happiness Report, published annually by the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network, provides valuable insights into the subjective well-being of nations based on factors such as GDP per capita, social support, life expectancy, freedom to make life choices, generosity, and perceptions of corruption."", 'One of the main reasons why people in some countries are unhappier than others is because of poverty. According to the World Bank, over 70% of the population in countries like Zimbabwe and Madagascar live below the national poverty line. Economic hardship deprives individuals of basic necessities, perpetuating a cycle of despair and hopelessness. In Zimbabwe, for example, the poverty rate was estimated at 70.1% in 2019, contributing to widespread dissatisfaction and discontent among its citizens.', 'Unfavourable economic climate leads to political instability, which is another prominent reason that adds to unhappiness, fostering an atmosphere of fear, uncertainty, and despair. In Afghanistan, ongoing conflict and insurgency have led to widespread displacement and suffering, with over 54% of the population living below the poverty line. Afghanistan also ranks among the lowest in the world on the Global Peace Index, 2023, with a score of 3.644 out of 5, which highlights the pervasive impact of conflict on the well-being of its people.', ""The political instability, economic crisis, and disputes over nationalization policies contributed to Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM)’s, a major multinational oil and gas corporation, decision to significantly reduce its operations in Venezuela. As a result, the company's production and investments in the country declined, impacting its presence in the Venezuelan oil industry. In 2007, the Venezuelan government nationalized the assets of several foreign oil companies, including Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM). "", 'This move led to a dispute between Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) and the Venezuelan government over compensation for the expropriated assets.

And Republican- and Democratic-governed states have different visions of this—vastly different.', 'Though the concept is nothing new, it’s gaining steam and poised to potentially become a permanent feature of the economy of the 2020s. “Child labor remains a key issue in state houses across the country in 2024,” Nina Mast, state economic analyst for the progressive, union-affiliated think tank Economic Policy Institute, told Fortune. “While the industry-backed movement to weaken child-labor protections continues to make progress, lawmakers and advocates for youth are fighting back in an increasing number of states.”', 'Mast is alluding to her think tank’s research showing that one particular industry overwhelmingly benefits from ambiguities in the federal laws governing child labor, to which many red states have responded by loosening regulations and lowering age limits.', 'That one industry is fast food.', 'This past January alone, eight states “introduced or took new actions” on proposed legislation that would reduce child-labor protections, per EPI research. These proposed laws involve children working more hours without breaks (and longer during their school weeks), clocking into factory or roofing jobs with dangerous conditions, or even looking after other children younger than themselves “without direct supervision.”', 'Since 2021, there have been attempts at legislation in 28 states to pierce holes in child-labor protections. As of 2024, 14 states have introduced counter legislation made to bolster child-labor protections, per EPI. This is at times contradictory, with the same states trying to introduce laws that roll back and bolster child-labor protections.', 'Even the jobs that don’t necessarily violate the law are targeting a vulnerable group. “We can’t ignore that—as a result of longstanding exemptions in US labor law—agriculture is the deadliest industry for young workers (accounting for over half of work-related fatalities even though it employs a small share of children), though they may not be employed in violation of child labor laws,” Mast said.', 'The minimum guidelines for youth employment were set decades ago, in 1938, as part of the federal Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). Even so, many of the current policies on child and teen labor remain contested state by state as FLSA doesn’t cover everything like the hours older teens can work, or the permits needed for certain jobs.', 'Many of the new laws regarding child labor, Mast says, are focused on “increasing penalties, mandating workers’ rights education, and expanding the legal remedies available to victims of illegal child labor.” And Mast notes there’s a “concerning trend” of young employees working in treacherous jobs such as roofing and meatpacking.', 'As sectors like the childcare industry grapple with shortages due to insufficient pay and grueling hours, politicians turn to the children themselves. Many of the fields where teens have traditionally been employed are dealing with staffing issues.', 'Unsurprisingly, the field that had some of the highest turnover during the Great Resignation is also the largest employer of youth: Leisure and hospitality hires the most children, outpacing all other industries, Mast told Fortune, and within hospitality it\'s restaurants, and within restaurant\'s it\'s fast food. As Mast\'s analysis says: ""Child labor violations in the food industry, most often in the form of hours violations for 14-15 year-olds, have skyrocketed over the past ten years and have been driven by restaurants that operate on a franchise model.""', 'Famed fast-food companies like McDonald’s and Popeyes have come under fire recently, representing a larger surge in the field’s violation of child-labor laws by making teens work more extended days and operate hazardous kitchen equipment.', ""When contacted for comment, McDonald's told Fortune that its 2,000-plus network of franchisees, operating as independent small business owners, make their own hiring decisions on their restaurant teams. It also noted the large scope of people employed both by the company and franchisees—over 800,000 people at nearly 14,000 restaurants."", 'For its part, McDonald\'s said it ""provides ongoing training opportunities and resources – such as recommended best practices around hiring, scheduling and restaurant safety – to help franchisees ensure compliance with minor labor laws"" and said it takes every Department of Labor violation seriously.', '""We do not believe these complaints reflect the experience of the vast majority of teenage crew members, who are working at McDonald’s restaurants in age-appropriate roles and looking for meaningful jobs in their local communities,"" the company said.', ""Popeye's did not respond to requests for comment."", 'When introducing a law that would loosen federal protections by extending work hours for teenaged workers ages 14 to 15, U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson (R-S.D.) said the following: “If a teen can participate in a basketball game until 9 p.m. on a school night, they should also have the option to work a part-time job if they want to.” What Johnson doesn’t mention is that these jobs can be taxing, involve low pay, require working hours way past 9 p.m. on a weekday, and bear dangerous conditions not even close to said intramural sports.', 'Outsourcing labor to a vulnerable group also has potential effects on the rights of the workforce as a whole. The mentality is: Why pay an adult what they’re worth if you can get a desperate child to do the job cheaper?', '“The consequences are potentially disastrous,” Reid Maki, director of the Child Labor Coalition, told the Associated Press. “You can’t balance a perceived labor shortage on the backs of teen workers.”', 'During a time of high inflation, Americans have embraced their reputation for loving fast food, turning even more to the relatively cheap fries-and-burger combo. Dining out and going out is not just more expensive, it’s also more socially taxing as many people continue to prefer more solitary habits long after the lockdown was first issued four years ago. Perhaps our pandemic-fueled introversion and inflation-era budgeting have only added fire to the fast-food industry. But while we lean more on these chains, they lean more on children, the not-so-secret purveyors of your next milkshakes.', 'This story was originally featured on Fortune.com']"

If you are not interested in learning about the US meat industry, head straight to the 5 Most Meat Eating States Per Capita.', 'In the United States, dietary habits vary significantly from state to state, and one intriguing aspect is meat consumption. Some states like Texas, Nebraska, Oklahoma, and Missouri, among others, stand out for their per capita meat consumption, reflecting cultural preferences, agricultural traditions, and economic factors. Understanding meat consumption patterns across different states provides valuable insights into regional food cultures and their impact on health, the environment, and the economy.', 'The worldwide meat industry is experiencing significant growth, with market value expected to surge from $897.5 billion in 2021 to over\xa0$1.3 trillion by 2027. In the United States alone, projections indicate a 4.39% growth from 2024 to 2028, resulting in a market volume of $157.10 billion in 2028. Notably, multinational giants like Tyson Foods, Inc. (NYSE:TSN), Cargill, Inc., and Smithfield Foods, Inc. are actively pursuing new product developments, mergers, and acquisitions to solidify their positions in the market.\xa0', ""Despite this growth, there's a subtle shift in consumption patterns within the U.S. Meat consumption, a significant dietary component, has fluctuated. While the average U.S. resident consumes 224.6\xa0pounds of meat annually, indicating a historical rise compared to 1970, recent years have witnessed a slight decline in meat sales. Overall meat sales by volume in U.S. groceries have dipped by\xa04%\xa0year-over-year and 6% over the past two years, signaling changing consumer behaviors.\xa0"", ""When examining per capita meat consumption in the U.S., it's evident that beef holds a prominent position, with the average person consuming 82 pounds annually, well above the global average of 19.8 pounds per year. However, this decline in meat consumption has spurred a wave of disruptions in the industry, prompting the emergence of alternative products.\xa0"", ""The meat market in the USA is experiencing significant shifts in consumer preferences, influencing market trends and consumption patterns. According to the Power of Meat study, consumers' focus on value, product quality, and animal welfare drives purchasing patterns. The study also highlights that higher prices and increased meals at home have led to a sales record for meat, with dollar sales reaching\xa0$81.8 billion\xa0in 2022, despite a 5.6% decline in volume compared to 2020. "", 'Additionally, the willingness to pay a premium for high-grade, grass-fed, and locally-grown meat products reflects the growing demand for differentiated and specialty meat products. Furthermore, there is a rising focus on organic and natural meat products and grass-fed and free-range options, indicating a shift towards more sustainable and environmentally friendly choices.\xa0', 'In the US beef market, consumer preferences drive remarkable growth, with an increasing demand for specific attributes such as grass-fed and organic beef, which has led to a significant shift in production practices, marketing strategies, and product offerings in the beef industry. The market is expected to achieve a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of\xa03.12%\xa0between 2022 and 2027, translating into a substantial increase in market size.\xa0', ""The Economic Research Service of the\xa0USDA\xa0emphasizes that changes in consumer preferences, relative prices, and available leisure time drive the allocation of meat budgets between beef, chicken, and pork. US consumers' substituting poultry meat for beef is the most significant change in meat consumption patterns over the past 30 years.\xa0"", 'Meanwhile, on a global scale, meat consumption has been steadily increasing, with certain countries showing rapid growth rates. Factors such as population growth, urbanization, and rising incomes in developing countries have contributed to this trend. While developed countries like Germany, the United States, and Japan rank among the top meat consumers, developing nations often have lower per capita consumption rates.

A question-and-answer session will follow. Please limit your Q&A participation to 1 question. I will now turn the call over to Ward."", 'C. Howard Nye', ""Jacklyn, thank you. Good morning, and thank you so much for joining today's teleconference. I'm pleased to report 2023 was the safest and most profitable year in Martin Marietta's history. We delivered both record financial performance, eclipsing $2.1 billion in adjusted EBITDA and also world-class safety results, achieving a world-class total injury incident rate for the third year in a row and a world-class lost-time incident rate for the seventh consecutive year. This year was also highlighted by several portfolio enhancing transactions significantly strengthening both the durability of our business and our balance sheet and which cumulatively positions us well to continue delivering sustainable growth. Our 2023 achievements were accomplished despite a macroeconomic environment encumbered by restrictive monetary policy, a housing slowdown and heightened geopolitical tensions, that our team was able to successfully overcome these challenges further underscores the continued success of our strategic operating analysis and review or SOAR plan, the vitality of our purposely curated geographic footprint, our team's steadfast execution of our proven value over volume commercial strategy and the resiliency and earnings power of our aggregates led business. Subsequent to year-end, on January 12, we closed the acquisition of Albert Fry & Sons, a leading aggregates producer in Colorado, expanding our aggregates platform in the high-growth Denver metropolitan area. More recently, on February 11, 2024, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the Alabama, South Carolina, South Florida, Tennessee and Virginia aggregates operations of Blue Water Industries, a closely held pure-play aggregates producer with a portfolio of 20 active operations and attractive Southeast markets, including Nashville, Knoxville and Miami, consistent with our SOAR plan upon closing of the Blue Water Industries acquisition, which is expected to occur later this year, subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. These 2 pure-play aggregates transactions will not only add approximately 1 billion tons of high-quality reserves in specific SOAR targeted markets, but also enhance the product mix of our portfolio. Assuming these transactions have closed on January 1, 2024, we would have expected these 2 acquisitions to generate approximately $180 million of adjusted EBITDA in 2024, more than offsetting the adjusted EBITDA divested in the February 9, 2024, sale of the company's South Texas Cement and related concrete business. As we turn the page to 2024, favorable commercial dynamics underpinned by our value over volume pricing strategy and giving effect to the recently closed Colorado acquisition and Texas divestiture, we expect to deliver consolidated adjusted EBITDA of $2.24 billion at the midpoint. However, assuming these transactions and the recently announced Blue Water Industries acquisition had all been completed as of January 1, 2024, we would have expected the new portfolio to generate adjusted EBITDA of $2.37 billion in 2024 at the midpoint. Before discussing our full year 2023 results, I'll highlight a few notable takeaways from our record fourth quarter. Aggregates pricing increased 15%, driving product line gross profit of $328.6 million, a year-over-year increase of 36.8% and gross profit per ton of $7.04, a year-over-year increase of 39.8%, both fourth quarter records. While aggregate shipments decreased 2.1%, these financial results clearly demonstrate the success of our sales team's commitment to receiving appropriate commercial consideration for our valuable and long-lived reserves, the primary and disproportionate organic earnings growth driver of our business. Turning now to our full year 2023 results. As previously noted, we established new financial records in each of the following year-over-year metrics. Consolidated total revenues of $6.8 billion, a 10% increase. Consolidated gross profit of $2 billion, a 42.1% increase. Earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $19.32, a 41% increase. Adjusted EBITDA of $2.1 billion, a 33% increase and aggregates gross profit per ton of $6.93, a 46.4% increase. Moreover, we successfully implemented midyear price increases across the majority of our markets as we endeavor to pass through persistently high cost inflation. Shifting now to our full year 2023 operating performance beginning with aggregates. Aggregate shipments declined 4.3%, the combined result of our value over volume strategy and softer demand in certain Midwest and Southwest markets, partially offset by continued strength in key Southeast markets. Aggregates pricing increased to 18.9% or 17.2% on a mix-adjusted basis as pricing fundamentals remain attractive. Texas cement shipments decreased 3.4% to 4 million tonnes. Pricing increased 22% or 21.6% on a mix-adjusted basis, driven by favorable supply-demand dynamics in the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex. Turning to our targeted downstream businesses. Ready-mixed concrete shipments decreased 12.1%, but that reduction was largely driven by the April 2022 divestiture of the company's Colorado and Central Texas concrete businesses. Pricing increased a robust 20.4%. Asphalt shipments increased 3.5% and pricing increased 6.7%. Before providing end market trends and our 2024 outlook, Jim will now discuss our full year financial results, Jim?"", 'James A. J. Nickolas', ""Thank you, Ward, and good morning, everyone. As Ward mentioned, we completed the sale of our South Texas cement plant and related concrete operations last week on February 9. While these businesses were classified as held for sale on the balance sheet as of December 31, revenues and profits from these operations through the divestiture date are included in the earnings from continuing operations. Accordingly, the revenues and profits from these assets are included in both 2023 as reported earnings from continuing operations and in our 2024 earnings guidance through the February 9 close date. The revenues and profits from the Colorado assets acquired on January 12, 2024 also are included in our forward earnings guidance. Lastly, the Blue Water Industries transaction has not yet closed and remain subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory review. Accordingly, the contributions from the pending acquisitions are not included in our 2024 earnings guidance. That said, we will provide updated earnings guidance after closing Blue Water transaction, which is expected to occur later this year. The Building Materials business posted full year 2023 revenues of $6.5 billion, an increase of 10.3% and gross profit of $1.9 billion, a notable 43.7% increase year-over-year, both new records. The aggregates business achieved all-time record revenues in 2023, growing 10.9% to $4.3 billion. Gross profit increased 40.1% to $1.4 billion, and gross margin increased 660 basis points to 32%. Again, both all-time records. Now pricing growth more than offset lower shipments, further demonstrating how the disciplined execution of our value over volume, commercial strategy, yields, higher profits and higher margins even without the benefit of growing volumes. Our Texas Cement business extended its track record of outstanding performance and once again delivered record top and bottom line results. Revenues increased 17% to $725.5 million and gross profit increased 64.6% to $333.6 million, driven primarily by favorable supply-demand dynamics in the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex and energy cost tailwinds. As a reminder, the new finish mill at our Midlothian, Texas plant in North Texas is expected to be fully operational in the third quarter of 2024, adding approximately 450,000 tons of incremental high-margin annual production capacity. Turning to our targeted downstream businesses. Our Concrete revenues increased 5.9% to $1 billion and gross profit increased 44.2% to $102 million, driven primarily by pricing gains and mega project contributions, which more than offset higher upstream raw material and delivery costs. Asphalt and paving revenues increased 12.6% to $887.1 million. Gross profit increased 34.7% to $109 million. The result of strong demand and lower bitumen costs. Magnesia Specialties full year revenues increased 3.8% to $315.4 million, while gross profit increased 6.9% to $97.1 million. Strong pricing and energy cost tailwinds more than offset weaker demand in certain magnesia end markets, including TPO roofing and cobalt mining. We continue to balance our long-standing disciplined capital allocation priorities to responsibly grow our business. In 2023, we invested $650 million of capital into our business and returned $324 million to shareholders through both an increased dividend and share repurchases. Since our repurchase authorization announcement in February of 2015, we have returned a total of $2.6 billion to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.4x as of December 31, assuming The Albert Frei & Sons and Blue Water Industries acquisitions and South Texas Cement and related concrete operations divestiture were effective as of January 1, 2024, after giving effect to the impacts of these transactions, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio would have been 1.85x, just below our targeted range of 2 to 2.5x, which would provide ample dry powder to take advantage of additional value-enhancing acquisitions. With that I'll put the call back to Ward to discuss end market trends."", 'C. Howard Nye', ""Jim, thanks so much. We're enthusiastic about Martin Marietta's prospects in 2024 and beyond. We anticipate healthy demand in public and heavy nonresidential construction will largely offset softness in the residential sector and expected moderation in light nonresidential construction. However, anticipated decreases in mortgage rates should provide tailwinds in residential demand and an uptick in single-family home construction as evidenced by recent Starts data. As you've heard us say for years in this business, where you are matters. And Martin Marietta is uniquely positioned to capitalize on these long-term secular trends. Infrastructure activity is expected to remain resilient as funds from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act or IIJA, along with record state Department of Transportation or DOT budgets, as well as voter-approved state and local transportation-related ballot initiatives coalesce this for years of steady investment and demand. The value of state and local government highway, bridge and tunnel contract awards, a leading indicator for our future product demand, grew 8% to $113 billion in 2023. According to the American Road and Transportation Builders Association or ARTBA, Texas, Colorado, California, Georgia and Florida, key Martin Marietta states are among some of the largest growing markets based on contract awards. Importantly, our investment in our nation's infrastructure continues to maintain broad bipartisan support. During the November 2023 election, voters approved 88% of transportation-related state and local ballot initiatives, representing approximately $7 billion of additional infrastructure funding. We expect this enhanced level of federal, state and local infrastructure investment will yield steady, multiyear demand in this important aggregates-intensive often countercyclical end market. Moving to nonresidential and starting with heavy industrial, strong demand for large manufacturing and heavy side energy projects is expected to counterbalance ongoing moderation in warehouse and data center construction from its COVID peak. Construction spending from manufacturing in the United States continues to trend positively with the December seasonally adjusted annual rate of spending for 2023 at $214 billion, a 61% increase from the December 2022 value of $133 billion. Manufacturing projects continue to be supported by health demand from the ongoing reshoring of critical product supply chains, including semiconductors and electric vehicle battery manufacturing. As an example, in the fourth quarter of 2023, Toyota announced an $8 billion expansion to the battery manufacturing campus in North Carolina, bringing their total investment to approximately $14 billion. This incremental investment solidifies North Carolina is Toyota's central hub for lithium ion battery production in North America with this campus having over 7 million square feet. Importantly, our quarries are well positioned to supply the aggregates needs for this type of multiyear project. Shifting to light nonresidential, while demand remained resilient through 2023 despite higher interest rates, high office vacancy rates and tighter commercial lending additions, we expect 2024 demand in this segment to moderate as it generally follows single-family residential development with a lag. Given the structural housing deficit and favorable population trends in key Martin Marietta markets, we fully expect the affordability-driven single-family residential slowdown will recover as interest rates decline further and monthly mortgage payments become relatively more affordable. Although there's still near-term uncertainty, we're encouraged by recent trends in single-family housing starts, a leading indicator of aggregate demand which were 1 million units in December, an increase of 16% from a year ago. Looking ahead, we expect 2024 to be another record year for Martin Marietta. As previously mentioned, we anticipate flat aggregate shipments as infrastructure and large-scale nonresidential projects should largely offset softness in the residential and light nonresidential sectors. With steady product demand supporting favorable commercial dynamics and the disciplined execution of our value over volume strategy, we expect double-digit aggregates pricing growth to overcome inflationary pressures and lead to expanded gross margins and unit profitability growth, combined with contributions from our cement, downstream and Magnesia Specialties businesses and contributions from our recently acquired Colorado assets, we are confident in our expectations for consolidated adjusted EBITDA of $2.24 billion at the midpoint. To conclude, we're extremely proud of our record-setting performance in 2023. We demonstrated our ability to successfully navigate another challenging macroeconomic environment and deliver superior returns for shareholders. As we begin the new year, our teams remain committed to employee health and safety, commercial and operational excellence, sustainable business practices and the execution of our SOAR 2025 initiatives as we build the safest, best-performing and most durable aggregates-led public company. We look forward to continuing our strong momentum in driving responsible and profitable growth in 2024 and beyond. If the operator will now provide the required instructions, we'll turn our attention to addressing your questions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Your first question is from Trey Grooms from Stephens.', 'Trey Grooms', 'You guys have been quite busy and first wanted to congratulate you and the team on the recent acquisition announcement, they look like great assets and a great fit for you guys.', 'C. Howard Nye', ""Thank you very much. It was a busy weekend, I'll tell you that."", 'Trey Grooms', ""Yes, bet it was. On that note, Jim, and you touched on it, but could you -- could you help us with a bit more detail on how to bridge the guide for the full year? Maybe help us understand and quantify what is included, what is not included as we look at the guide for '24?"", 'James A. J. Nickolas', ""Yes, sure. Happy to do that. So we've closed now on 2 transactions, the acquisition of Albert Frei. And that -- you can think about that maybe between $40 million and $45 million of EBITDA coming from that business. And then we've also closed the divestiture of our South Texas Cement and Ready Mix business. And you can think about that as around $170 million of EBITDA that was divested. So those are coming out of what you would have seen may be from the 2023 view. The Blue Water acquisition, call it, $135 or so million of EBITDA that is not. That would be a full year run rate view that is not included in our guide. We will, of course, include that when that closes, we'll update our guidance for that additional EBITDA at that point. But hopefully, that provides the necessary ins and outs for you to make that work."", 'Trey Grooms', ""Yes. That's super helpful. Got it. And 1 more, if I could. I'm located not too far from some of your locations. And it's no secret January weather was tough, particularly here in the South where we aren't used to snow and ice or sub-freezing temps for long periods of time. Can you help us on maybe how to think about that in 1Q? And anything else to note that maybe we should be aware of as we think about this first quarter."", 'C. Howard Nye', ""Trey, thanks a lot. I mean, that's a really good question because as you recall, last year in Q1 weather was actually disproportionately good. And I think when people saw Q1 numbers, they thought, wow, that's really something. And you know what I've long said, the first quarter can largely be made or broken by the last 2 weeks in March. But if you do have really challenging weather in January and February, it can put you back a little bit. So to that end, you should expect a different cadence. I'm going to turn to Jim and ask him to give you some more detail on what that cadence will likely look like this year. So Jim back to you for a moment on that please."", 'James A. J. Nickolas', ""Yes. So Q1 2023, as Ward mentioned, was unseasonably good. That year Q1 represented 15% of our gross profit. I'm speaking on a consolidated basis. So it's not a product by product, but on a consolidated basis, 15% of gross profits were earned in Q1. Again, it's a lower profit quarter. So small changes can have big percentage impacts. And then pointing out, as you did the weather this year is worse in Q1. I'm now going to guess around 11.5% of our gross profits would occur in Q1 of this year. So that's about a 350 basis point drop. I would say with Q2, 3 and 4 would each be about a little bit more than 1 percentage points increasing versus what they were last year. Again, that's percentages of total yearly profits. Does that help?"", 'Trey Grooms', ""Yes, sir. I got it. That's super helpful."", 'C. Howard Nye', ""Just 1 bit more color on that. So obviously, January was a really challenging month for customers and everyone else as you would imagine, February, as we've seen good weather come through, the business has done what we would have thought. So I think that's important to note as a footnote to what Jim just took you through. Trey, thanks for the question."", 'Operator', 'Your next question is from Stanley Elliott from Stifel.', 'Stanley Stoker Elliott', 'Ward, Jim, congratulations on another successful year. Ward, maybe a good time to get an update on how you guys are thinking about SOAR 2025. I mean you effectively doubled the market cap since that came out in 2020, 2021, any comments on, I guess, the execution thus far, maybe how are you thinking about recent future and future portfolio moves and maybe tie that back into your commercial efforts?', 'C. Howard Nye', ""Stanley, thanks for the question. You're right. I mean, we've been really disciplined, very thoughtful in each of our SOAR 5 year increments. So if you go back in time and remember the first one came out in 2010, and that was through '15. Then in '15, we did SOAR 2020 then most recently, again, very cleverly SOAR 2025. And we've been able in each of those to effectively double our market cap. And we're almost there now.And obviously, we still have some track ahead of us in SOAR 2025. I would say a couple of things. One, the commercial execution that you've seen has focused on is something that we will continue to be focused on. I think you see it in what we've given relative to our guide this year. Again, we're looking at ASP increases at 11% at the midpoint. And again, I think it's important to state Stanley, that does not contemplate mid-years. That's the same type of conversation we had in 2023 as well. And you'll recall that we came back and actually had mid-years in more than half of our markets. So again, we'll come back and revisit that at half year and see where that is.The other thing that I think is important to keep in mind is you've seen what I think is a lot of very productive, very appropriate M&A. I think it's totally consistent with what we've sent to the market. We are an aggregates-led business. And part of what I moved by, if we look at simply what's occurred so far this year, 2 large transactions with assets coming into the organization, obviously, Blue Water still has some time to go through the Hart-Scott process.But we'll close on that transaction between Blue Water and what we've done without Frei & Sons, those are 2 pure-play aggregates businesses. And what I'm particularly moved by as well, if we look at our pipeline, that's what our pipeline looks like too. I do believe our company is positioned from a quality growth perspective and a very compelling and it's an overused term, but I almost think unique position as well. So will commercial discipline be a piece of it? You bet.Well, operational excellence be a piece of it. And we think it will continue to be, particularly as we bring these businesses into our hold. But again, our ability to do shareholder value increasing transactions, we think here in the near term, medium term and long term is a fundamental differentiator for our business. And if we think about what value creation looks like for Martin Marietta and its shareholders, we think those are the key drivers. But Stanley, I hope that's helpful in response to your question."", 'Operator', 'Your next question is from Anthony Pettinari from Citi.', 'Anthony James Pettinari', ""The gross profit per ton guidance of $8.40, I think, implies cost per ton up maybe mid-single digit year-over-year, if I got that right. And I'm just wondering if you could bridge that between maybe some of your different cost inputs and any kind of assumptions around cost categories and maybe energy for the balance of the year."", 'C. Howard Nye', ""Happy to take. I'll ask Jim to go through and give you a bucket by bucket view. But overall, you're entirely right. If we're just looking at general inflation, it's going to be in the mid- to high single digits range. That can obviously move around a little bit, but there are some components of our business that are seeing higher pieces of inflation. I think it's important to say that labor is actually not one of those. Those numbers continue to be in a very comfortable place, both for our workforce and for our company, but let Jim take you through some of the puts and takes on some of the other inputs."", 'James A. J. Nickolas', ""Yes, you're right. It's about 7% inflation on the COGS -- on the aggregates business, COGS per ton. So here are the items that are above 7% or north of 7%. Oil lubricants, we're expecting to be up quite a bit explosive, still remain high. The parts and equipment for the plants, also (inaudible) ZIP code -- so those are the areas that are pushing it above 7%, areas that are pushing it below 7% are, as Ward mentioned, labor, which is our biggest cost component and also diesel, electricity, nat gas. Those are not expected to be headwinds in 2024. So those are the large buckets, I would say, that are deviating from the 7%, some are more than 7%, others are well below the 7%. But on a blended basis, that's where we're ending up."", 'Anthony James Pettinari', 'Got it. Got it. And the assumption for diesel is just current prices or...', 'James A. J. Nickolas', ""There's a smidge of a headwind in for diesel, not much of current spot prices."", 'C. Howard Nye', ""We hope we've been a bit punitive to ourselves. We'll see how that plays out, Anthony."", 'Operator', 'Your next question is from Angel Castillo from Morgan Stanley.', 'Angel Castillo', 'Just was curious on the recent acquisitions. I was wondering if you could help us quantify a little bit more or give us a little bit more color as to kind of upside opportunity on the pricing side as you look at those assets in those regions in terms of bringing those more -- to the value over volume strategy?', 'C. Howard Nye', ""Well, look, if we look at the overall businesses and looking at the prior business in Colorado, they were doing somewhere between 3.5 million and 4 million tons [per stone prem]. Denver is a very attractive marketplace. We'll have to see how that plays out. But you can go back over time and get a good sense of commercially at least how we've approached those markets. As you can imagine, the barriers to some degree of entry and hard rock can be quite high in a number of markets.So we feel very good about our team in Colorado. They're very cost conscious. They're very commercially focused. And we think the marketplace in Denver will continue to be very attractive for an extended period of time. Keep in mind, if we go back -- let's call it, 13 years. We had no significant business at all in Colorado. We look up and down the Front Range today. We're the clear leader in aggregates up down the I-25 corridor.Remember, that's where 80-plus percent the population in Colorado lives. And again, the biggest piece of it being in Denver. And now between the Walstrum Quarry, which we picked up and our Spec Agg Quarry, a very attractive position in that marketplace. If we go and look at Blue Water, obviously, that transaction has not closed. We're going through the Hart-Scott process soon and we're hoping to have that done half year-ish; heavy on the ish, by the way. It could clearly push into the second half of the year. If we look at the overall tonnage, that's going to be around 13 million tons of stone. But importantly, if you look at the markets which gives us a nice footprint, these are markets that we've long talked about wanting to have a natural position. And so certainly, we find ourselves in Nashville. Certainly, we find ourselves in Knoxville. Now we find ourselves in a much more significant way in South Florida and around Miami.So if you go back and take a look at the slide presentation that we gave to the analysts and investors in February of 2021, we talked about a series of markets that we wanted to enter. We talked about Northern California, Southern California, Arizona, in and around Austin, Texas. We talked about Middle Tennessee, we talked about South Florida, and we talked about in Northern Virginia.We are literally in a place now that we're putting checks in most of those boxes. So again, if you take a look at the overall pricing at these facilities relative to our corporate average, it's modestly below our corporate average. So again, I'm hoping I'm giving you something directionally that you can work with. But that gives you a sense of the market, it gives you a sense of the overall volume. I do think we will operationally bring increased efficiencies to these markets, and we're thrilled to, #1, have already brought the Frei team into the Martin Marietta fold, and we look forward to bringing the Blue Water team into our organization as well. So hopefully, Angel, that response to your question."", 'Operator', 'Your next question is from Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs.', 'Jerry David Revich', ""I'm wondering if we just take a step back, historically, in a [flat end demand] environment, the industry has realized 4 points of price or less. And obviously, we're putting up much better performance here in the price cost spread widening. As you think about what the industry learned over the course of the hyperinflation period, I guess, do you think the fear of inflation stays with the industry beyond this year? Or could we return to slower pricing cadence in '25 towards that historical rate. I know it's super early, but I feel like the industry got burned with inflation, (inaudible) on the upside. I'm wondering -- does that change the mindset for obviously, you folks and others in your markets?"", 'C. Howard Nye', ""Well, Jerry, the only thing I can speak to is Martin Marietta, of course. And I would say several things. One, obviously, inflation has moved significantly over the last couple of years. And we took the actions that were smart and prudent to protect our company as that went up. Secondly, at least here in our company, we recognize that having these long-lived reserves is significant. We're sitting here today at current extraction rates with reserves in excess of 70 years.Something that I think we talk about inside our company as these reserves are worth more tomorrow than they are today. In some geographies, it's very difficult to replicate or replace the reserves. And I think as we think long term, and that's how we tend to think about this business. If we go back to one of the questions that was earlier, they were asking about SOAR and the fact that we look at our business in 5-year increments. But the simple fact is, Jerry, we think about our business in terms of decades, not years, not 5 years, but really decades. And as we look at it through that lens, we recognize that we have the product that is absolutely essential in every form of heavy side development.You don't need asphalt in every piece of it. You don't need concrete in every piece of -- but you need the aggregates in absolutely every piece of it. So from our perspective, as we look at what aggregate sells for on a per ton basis and then we consider, one, its vitality to a product or to a project, and its overall cost relative to the project, we think we're actually adding more to an individual project than we're costing a project. That's how we think about what we're doing.So if we go back to the notion of will commercial excellence continue to be a driver for our organization, and I think make our pricing look fundamentally different going forward than it did, say, a decade ago. Yes, I think it probably will. Do I think operationally, we will continue to bring great value to the organization by making our businesses better faster, safer, more efficient, et cetera? Yes, I think we will. But I also think that what you should expect from us, and this ties to a degree to it as well, Jerry, is we will continue to be a very responsible, very visionary acquirer of attractive businesses in attractive geographies. And I think if you take those building blocks that I've taken you through, it gives you a good sense of how to think about the business overall from a commercial perspective."", 'Jerry David Revich', ""Really appreciate the color. And then you folks have been super busy over Super Bowl weekend. And I'm wondering if you look at the M&A pipeline today now that we're wrapping up the last deal, hopefully, that announced soon. The M&A pipeline from here, Ward, what's the range of outcomes in terms of how much more capital we can deploy over the balance of '24, you predicted '24 was going to be a really active M&A year. And I'm just wondering how much is left or there to do based on what's in the pipeline?"", 'C. Howard Nye', ""Jerry, that's a great question. So here's the way that I would encourage you to think about it. Let's assume that Frei closed, which it is, and now just assume the Blue Water was closed. We'd be leveraged at about 1.85x. So keep in mind, through a cycle, we like to be leveraged 2 to 2.5x. So we're still, despite that degree of acquisitive activity, we're still below where we would typically like to be.So my point is this, when we've seen attractive transactions before, we haven't done it a lot, but we've gone over 3 times. We've delevered actually very quickly and easily when we've done that. I continue to believe that there will be more transactional activity this year. I would be disappointed if there's not. You're right on our Q3 call back in November. I said at that time, I thought 2024 would be a pretty busy year. Obviously, we're about 1.5 months into it. It's been a really busy year already. But Jerry, the fact is that I think there's going to be more, I'd be disappointed if there wasn't and you should expect it to be more pure stone type transactions, Jerry."", 'Operator', 'Your next question is from Philip Ng from Jefferies.', 'Philip H. Ng', ""Congrats on a really strong quarter. If I take your guidance, Jim, I think you're calling for flattish volumes for the full year. Not too dissimilar to what you told us back on the 3Q call, but I believe your guide now includes AFS, so that would imply maybe volumes are a little softer, but everything that you mentioned, Ward, sounded pretty constructive. So I just want to make sure we're -- one, we're not overthinking about this. And when you look out to the back half, I mean, you kind of talked about rates coming down, that could be a good guide for housing. Could volumes kind of inflect in the back half and go into 2025? Is there a good way to think about the trajectory for us?"", 'C. Howard Nye', ""Phil, thanks for your question. A couple of things that I would say. #1, you're right. I mean, if we're looking at bringing in Frei, and let's call it, 3.5 million tons, one thing that happened in our sale of the Hunter Cement Plant is we're actually doing some stone production there as well that was going into the cement production. So in fairness, that was probably about 2 million tonnes. So really, if you start taking a look at what went the other way in the 100 transaction, what's going this other way near term and Frei, keep in mind that you've got a fairly seasonally impacted business in Colorado as well. Again, I think it leads you back to that relatively flattish.So I wouldn't strain too hard on what those numbers look like because there's just enough movement on the surface of it that it could put you in a much more comfortable place (inaudible) look and feel flat. To your point, though, I do believe if we see interest rate reductions and we see a steady, albeit somewhat slow recovery in housing and then what's likely to be degrees of light non-res that comes behind that in the second half of the year. I'm not sure how much is going to push volumes up and half too. I think it certainly could push volumes up and have to. I think what it's really doing is it's setting up 2025 to be even a more productive year. Obviously, on the infrastructure side, we think it's going to be pretty constructive all by itself. I mean if you think about the fact that we're looking at what's happened on highway contract awards and you're looking at basic and LTM from December 2019 through 2023, that's got almost an 11% CAGR involved in it. And then we're looking at our top 10 states and DOT budgets themselves that are up on average, 10%. And here's some percentages to keep in mind.Texas, which had a really heady budget is up 24%. Florida, which has been at record levels, it's up 9%. North Carolina, our home court is up 11%. Minnesota, when we bought the business there from Tiller several years ago, we said that was a really attractive DOT. It's up about 38%. So again, as we're looking at public, we think that that's going to be pretty compelling. Even as we sit and move to non-res, if we're looking at manufacturing, the reshoring that we mentioned in our opening comments, is pretty significant. We continue to see more activity in that space. I also called out what we're seeing consistently in energy. We got a new battery plant in Kokomo, Indiana. There's some new one coming in the Bowling Green, Kentucky. But what I've been a bit surprised by and I think this may be more geographic intensive as well or sensitive is even in the areas that have had degrees of slowing warehouses and data centers, I mean we've got 4 data centers under construction right now in Eastern Nebraska and Western Iowa. And there's a new one that looks like it's coming online in Covington, Georgia. So again, if we look across our geographic footprint and recognize that we've been very selective in the where. Do I think there's a prospect that you could see some upside in the second half of the year on volumes? Yes, I do. I think that cadence that Jim spoke to earlier, it's important to keep in mind because clearly, we're not going to have a Q1 this year that looked like Q1 last year. But again, I think Q2, Q3 and Q4 could be attractive, recognizing, hey, pretty heady Q4. We just had this year, too. Again, Phil, I hope that's helpful and constructive on the volumes and what the end users look like."", 'Operator', 'Your next question is from Tyler Brown from Raymond James.', 'Patrick Tyler Brown', ""Jim, I'm curious about the CapEx guide. So it was a little bit higher than maybe we had expected, just considering the South Texas sale -- just curious what all is in that CapEx number. Was there a sizable Midlothian spend in there? May be outside land acquisition. It just seems like 9.5% CapEx to sales feels a bit higher than normal, just particularly considering flattish volume."", 'James A. J. Nickolas', ""Yes, good question. Our range is between 8% to 10%, typically, 9% is the most common at the midpoint. But we do have a couple of large projects in there. And you're right, the finish mill 7 is among those that's one of the larger spends in 2024 as we wrap up that project. Another one is our Beckmann plant in San Antonio is getting a significant upgrade there as well. So the 2 largest items that are helping to push it up a little bit more than normal, but still well within the range of what I think is typical for us."", 'C. Howard Nye', ""Tyler, let me add this too because Jim nailed it. He's exactly right. The other thing that we're seeing, though, on occasion, and we've seen it more in the last few months is real estate purchases tends to be highly opportunistic. And when the right real estate shows up, you don't always know when it's going to parachute in, and we have to have the ability to be pretty agile around that. So we're looking at some real estate purchases as well that we think will be important in the near, medium and again, long-term for Martin Marietta, but broadly very much in that range that Jim spoke to, but those are some of the moving parts, both above the water and under the water."", 'Operator', 'Your next question is from Kathryn Thompson from Thompson Research Group.', 'Kathryn Ingram Thompson', 'A lot of focus on all the great M&A and divestiture activity since November, certainly a busy holiday season through Super Bowl. But one of the changes also too is just in the cadence and the type of flavor of capital expenditure, CapEx as you divest some cement and take on more aggregate-focused assets. Could you walk through what this does for free cash cadence and also how we should think about capital expenditure given the change in mix? And then thoughts on capital allocation going forward given recent activity?', 'C. Howard Nye', ""So I'm going to start with capital allocation, and then come back to Jim, and he can just talk you through more degrees of CapEx and how things can move around. If you think about the capital allocation, Kathryn, one of the more elegant things about our company is that stays pretty consistent. Our view is our best first dollar spent is on the right transaction. And again, I think our teams are good at that. I think they're good at identifying the deals. I think they're good at going through the contracting process. I think they're good at the integration process. I think they're good at the synergy realization process. So the right transactions will be #1 on capital allocation, #2, and Jim will take you through more specifics, we'll be reinvesting in the business.As you know, if you're in the business of crushing stone, you're in the business of destroying iron. So the fact is we will stay probably in those ranges that Jim spoke about a few minutes ago, but he will go in more detail. And then lastly, is returning of cash to shareholders through 2 things: a meaningful and sustainable dividend, and we say both of those words very intentionally and share buybacks at the right time. So the capital allocation priorities simply do not change. Now more to your question on how does this portfolio evolution that we've seen change the way that we look at CapEx for that average, Jim."", 'James A. J. Nickolas', 'Yes. So I would expect it to go either be very constant with historical levels or maybe a little bit higher as we as we look to replant many of our aggregate plants to keep them efficient and highly automated. So as far as cadence for the year, I would expect it to be similar to last year and the year before Q1 and Q4 a little bit heavier on the CapEx, Q2 and Q3 a little bit lighter. But of course, the things that can throw that out of whack -- on occasion would be the occasional opportunistic generation of land purchase. That would be something that could, of course, (inaudible) percentages and historical patterns out of kilter. But hopefully, that answers the question, Katy.', 'C. Howard Nye', ""And Kathryn, let me add one more note to that as well because keep in mind, when we're doing replants or otherwise, we're doing those because the income rates of return on those projects is so compelling. We almost would feel silly if we didn't do them. At the same time, part of what's so compelling about an aggregates business is we have the capacity if we need to, and we did it in COVID, and we've done it before, to pull back on that CapEx lever if we ever need to. We don't see a need to do that. We think we can do it very constructively.We think we can do it in a very value-additive way. But again, I think as you just step back from our industry compared to others, and you look at the degrees of agility that we can bring to something like CapEx in a heavy industry is decidedly different and we think it's advantage Martin Marietta. So again, we hope that's responsive to your question. Jim's got one more point."", 'James A. J. Nickolas', ""One more point, kind of an overall cash perspective, Kathryn. So our operating cash flow grew tremendously this year. I'm comparing year-over-year now. Our CapEx did grow, but our cash conversion ratio improved in '23 over '22 meaningfully. So we're very mindful of our cash flow. We think it's good and getting better even with slightly higher CapEx in 2024. We think that trend will continue."", 'Kathryn Ingram Thompson', 'Okay. Great. And very helpful. And just one quick clarification on guidance on interest expense, that you released today, seeing a little light, but just wanted to hopefully can give a little bit of clarification on your interest expense guidance.', 'James A. J. Nickolas', ""Sure. Yes. It's actually, it's net interest expense. So it's gross interest expense of, call it $160 million; interest income of, call it, $100 million. So net interest expense of about $60 million at the midpoint."", 'Operator', 'Your next question is from Timna Tanners from Wolfe Research.', 'Timna Beth Tanners', ""I wanted to follow up a little bit on the benefits you're seeing from IIJA. And any color you can provide on the cadence that you're seeing there and your visibility. We all saw the ARTBA awards data, and it's been quite strong, but kind of leveled off over the last several months. So just wondering if you can provide some more color on what you're seeing there."", 'C. Howard Nye', ""Thank you for the question. #1, we are starting to see that weekend to pull through. And what I would say, obviously, when you're looking at what you and I know, is a $1.2 trillion bipartisan law that's the big amount of money. That's $110 billion to roads. It's $66 billion for railroad maintenance. It's $42 billion for port and airport infrastructure. But what's important is to start drilling down and seeing what's going on in many respects on a state-by-state or at times MSA-by-MSA basis. So if we look at where NCDOT is, for example, their budgets up 11%. They're obviously going to see nice federal money flowing through as well. What we're basically seeing is they're increasing infrastructure funding here by $7 billion over the next decade.So again, that starts to give you a good sense of how that money is flowing through. Texas, they're looking for FY '24 to be another record year of lettings. That's going to be at about almost $14 billion. By the way that's up about 15% year-over-year. Their unified transportation plan for FY '24 is expected to exceed $100 billion. Again, that's an 8% increase. So again, the federal funds that are flowing through are a big part of that. And particularly moved by what we've seen happen in Florida because again, the recent Florida '24 budget increased to $17 billion. Again, that's an all-time high, over what had been an all-time high last year. But again, as we think about what Florida is able to do because of what they're seeing from IIJA you've got the Moving Florida Forward initiative that was announced in late Q3, that's going to bring $4 billion from general revenue surplus into transportation in that state. And even as we look at what's going on in California, their recently passed FY '24 budget includes $20.5 billion for Caltrans and that's still a 5% year-over-year increase from FY '23. So if we're looking at where the states are, what they're doing with their budgets, how they're taking these funds that are also coming from the federal government. It's a pretty compelling story, as we sit back and look at it. Jim's got a few things, he wants to add as well Timna."", 'James A. J. Nickolas', ""Yes. Our volumes were down 2% for the quarter, but I'll point out our infrastructure volumes were actually up 6%. So we think those are -- we're seeing it's coming through those infrastructure volumes."", 'Timna Beth Tanners', ""Okay. That's helpful. And just one follow-up on all the M&A discussion. You've highlighted an appetite for bolt-ons -- but obviously, you also highlighted that you have spare bandwidth or capacity, if you will, in your debt leverage. So I'm just wondering for the right deal, are you willing to kind of tap the capital markets? Or is it still just kind of a priority for bolt-ons as you look ahead?"", 'C. Howard Nye', ""For the right transaction, we would certainly do that, Timna. And again, we've demonstrated the capacity if we've done the right transactions to bring down leverage very, very quickly in the organization. So we'll just have to look at them on a transaction-by-transaction basis. But the short answer is a lot of these, if they came along, you're only going to see them once. And it again can be very opportunistic and sitting at 1.85x levered today, even having done all that we will have done this year taking into account Frei and Blue Water. We've got a lot of dry powder right now."", 'Operator', 'Your next question is from Michael Dudas from Vertical Research.', 'Michael Stephan Dudas', ""So following on the acquisition opportunities, just 2 thoughts. One, as you're going through your plan to SOAR '25 and maybe beyond, is there a percentage or a mix of aggregates that you're targeting for the contribution for the whole company? And given that you've divested South Texas in a very efficient and cooperative manner with the purchaser, are there opportunities on the sell side that, again, as you move to that mix target or where you want to be that could emerge over the next 6 to 12 months?"", 'C. Howard Nye', ""Mike, thanks for the question. I mean, #1, if we look at where we're going to be after the transactions that we've done, our 2024 pro forma gross profit mix would be at 77% aggregates. I mean, should you expect that number to continue to grow? The answer is yes, you should. But I would say this too, and I think this is so important to state. The cement operation that we have in Midlothian, Texas is a fantastic cement business. It's a long way from the Gulf of Mexico, we have our Southwest headquarters in Dallas. We're the largest aggregates producer in Dallas. We're the largest cement producer in Dallas. That business has just from my perspective, eye watering margins, we like the businesses that we have very much. And if we've got the ability, desire and capacity to go and grow our aggregates business, which we do and take that number that I just gave you 77% push that to 80% and then beyond that, frankly, you should expect us to do that. If we go back through the way that we've long described ourselves, we've said we're aggregates led, with strategic cement, with targeted downstream. I mean, those are again, very well-conceived, well thought out adjectives before each one of those businesses. And what you're seeing us to this year is totally consistent with an aggregates-led business and building a business that can outperform through cycles and we think that's so vital to what we're doing. And that's part of what's so important about also this value over volume philosophy that we're bringing to our business. So yes, you should expect to see that aggregates number continue to go up. And again, that's very consistent with the pipeline that we're looking at today."", 'Operator', 'Your next question is from Keith Hughes from Truist.', 'Keith Brian Hughes', ""So a question on cement and the remaining cement business for '24, what kind of price, volume, expectations do you have in the guide."", 'James A. J. Nickolas', ""I'll give you some of that, Keith. It's getting increasingly challenging for us to give too much granularity around that Cement business because that's the only cement business that we have. So I'm torn between -- I want to make sure I'm transparent giving you everything that you need. I also don't want to put ourselves at a remarkable competitive disadvantage. So I'll give you an overall sense -- obviously -- I'll give you what I can with that -- so look, we obviously kept the larger of the 2 Cement businesses, from a volume perspective, it's going to be modestly over 2 million tonnes. From a pricing perspective, we're looking at an increase in North Texas of around $15 per ton. That increase -- if I were you, I'd be modeling that more in an April time frame as opposed to a January time frame.Obviously, you saw very attractive margins in that business last year. And what I would suggest to you is our aim would be on a full year basis to maintain the types of margins in that business that you saw in the overall Cement business last year in Texas. So Keith, I hope that gives you broadly what you need."", 'Operator', 'Your next question is from Garik Shmois from Loop Capital.', 'Garik Simha Shmois', ""I wanted to just follow-up on aggregates pricing. The outlook is in line with how you framed it, coming out of the 3Q call, but -- and we appreciate your value over volume strategy, but there was a competitor last week that spoke to both trying to take share this year and pricing maybe a little bit more closely to inflation or the rate of deflation that they were seeing.I'm wondering if maybe you're seeing a change in the conversations at all with aggregates pricing going into this year? Are those becoming maybe a little bit more difficult? Maybe I'm over thinking here, but I just thought I'd ask the question on how those discussions have been going."", 'C. Howard Nye', ""No, Garik. It's a fair question. The conversations have actually been pretty constructive with our customers. And keep in mind, several things happen. #1, location is going to matter a lot. #2, relationship is going to matter a lot. #3, I think the swing factor in some places may be what degrees of midyears declined. Again, the only place right now that we've already got stated midyears are in California, where we told people basically we're coming out of the gate in 2024, we're $2 a ton up, and then we're going to do another $2 a ton at midyear. Keep in mind, too, that most of our customers are not the owner. They tend to be a general first-year tier sub, second tier sub, third tier sub, et cetera, and they tend to be cost-plus themselves. And if we're looking at being 10% of the cost of a road, 2% of the cost of a home and somewhere between those 2 numbers on a nonres project, the price of the stone usually isn't why a project goes or why a contractor gets the job.But at the same time, we're placing that stone once it goes out of our gate, it can be pretty challenging. So look, do I think -- do I think we will see years and years of price performance like we saw in 2023? No, I don't think that's going to be the norm. Do I think we're trending more towards -- what I think the norm will be from Martin Marietta this year? Yes, I think we probably are. And to me that feels like an appropriate place for us to be given the economy, given the difficulties that you can have in replacing some of these reserves in some of these key markets.Remember, we have some urban quarries and locations that trying to find opportunities to come back behind quarries if they're depleted would be hugely challenging. And building new quarries will put you further away from the city centers and take degrees of efficiency away. So again, I hope that gives you, #1, a philosophy on how we approach it. #2, what our dialogue looks like with our customers; and #3, how I think it's going to play out, at least from Martin Marietta over a period of years."", 'Garik Simha Shmois', ""No, that's helpful. Just wanted to follow up just quickly just on cement margins, recognizing the increasing importance in size in that segment. With the finish mill coming on later this year, is there any choppiness or inefficiencies that we should be aware of?"", 'James A. J. Nickolas', ""No, I don't think so. To the extent -- I mean, we're going to be very disciplined about bringing that online. It won't be disruptive to price. We think we'll be able to bring it online gradually in terms of operational approach as well as marketplace impact. It will be very disciplined, and we think it won't be very disruptive at all. So we're not looking for any kind of noticeable effect from external view on this point. And margins should be enhanced when those come online. So we think it's really going to fit the market is sold out by and large, and we think it will fit nicely with the growing demand there."", 'Operator', 'Your next question is from David MacGregor, Longbow Research.', 'Joseph Nolan', ""This is Joe Nolan, on for David. I just had one quick question on the aggregates volumes guidance, you provided up or down 2%. Just within that, what would be the primary drivers that you're monitoring to drive the high end or low end? And just within that, can you talk about how the value over volume strategy might play into that?"", 'C. Howard Nye', ""Yes, happy to. I mean, here's a good way to think of it, and this is not a bad -- laboratory to give it some thoughts. So if we look in Q2, volume is down 2%. So last year, we were at 47.7%. The year just ended 46.6%. If we're really looking at that and saying, what were your swing markets or what are you swing factors? Value over volume was probably modestly over 1 million tons of that.So again, if we think -- what we actually had a better return for shareholders. We kept those reserves in the ground or we kept them in stockpiles. We'll sell them another day, we'll sell them for higher. And that was your primary driver. There was some degrees as well chronicle of market softening in degrees of residential and nonres. But the biggest piece of that was value over volume. So if we're looking at what swing factors can be, as Jim pointed out, in the quarter, we saw infrastructure volumes up 6%, that wasn't a surprise, but really it was a nice affirmation of what's happening.So if we continue to see public grow sensibly, if we see res start to do, we're not predicting it, but you can certainly see that res could have a nice recovery beginning in half 2. We think that's important. And again, as we're looking at these mega projects, if we're looking at nonres projects of size and of scale, depending on how some of those play out, it doesn't take a lot of those. I mean, it could take 1 or 2 of those to really change the trajectory of degrees of volume. And obviously, we're still having significant conversations on a number of large nonres projects in the Gulf of Mexico and if some of those go -- I think those are your swing factors, Joe, as you think about volumes. So I hope that helped."", 'Operator', 'Your next question is from Adam Thalhimer from Thompson Davis.', 'Adam Robert Thalhimer', 'You talked about data center weakness in Q4. That surprised me. What are you seeing going forward there?', 'C. Howard Nye', ""Well, I'm not sure it was so much -- I was talking more broadly about what some of the writers have said. I think what I was saying is, in our world, it hasn't been as down as people would have thought. Now keep in mind, it was against a really tough comp. So that's more of than anything else. But if you just look at general trade publications, they're going to say, look, in warehousing and data center, you're going to start to see some moderation simply because the comps were so high. I guess my point was not all markets are going to be equal. And I think when we start looking at the southeastern, southwestern and interestingly, these midwestern markets, where there's a lot of data center activity, which was why I was calling out, in particular, part of what's happening in Nebraska and Iowa because those have been actually really resilient markets in that particular space, Adam. So it was something I was really calling out high degrees of weakness. It was more, comps are tough and the overall commentary around that is a little bit softer than in some other areas. But again, I think we're holding up better than most."", 'Adam Robert Thalhimer', ""Okay. And then clients ask me this, I'll just ask you, are we still early and you guys seeing the benefit from IIJA?"", 'C. Howard Nye', ""Yes. I think -- look, I think if we're talking about that in innings, I mean we're in the very early innings of that. I mean, I think as a practical matter, 2024 is really the first year that we're going to start to see significant stone go aggregates on IIJA. So here's the way I would think of it, Adam. '24 on that is going to be better than '23, '25 is likely to be better than '24, and I think '26 could be better than '25. So in baseball parlance, we're not anywhere near the seventh inning stretch. I mean we're in a very healthy spot right now, and it's likely to be that way for a number of years."", 'Operator', 'There are no further questions at this time.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the global chocolate market, sweet innovations in the chocolate industry, and chocolate companies being innovative by going directly to the Top 5 Chocolate Companies in the World by Revenue.', ""Chocolate is the epitome of comfort food. Every country on the globe has its own chocolate-related culture and manufacturing. Whatever its form, chocolate is virtually universally liked, whether it's as a staple of your diet or an occasional indulgence.\xa0"", 'Chocolate is a confection made from cacao beans, which are harvested, fermented, dried, roasted, and ground into cocoa mass, being the main component of chocolate. After further processing, this mass can be made into a variety of kinds of chocolate, such as milk chocolate, white chocolate, and dark chocolate.\xa0', ""Recent years have seen strong growth in the global chocolate market size, estimated at $119.39 billion in 2022. Consumer awareness of the advantages of eating high-quality chocolate for their health continues to be the primary market driver. The increasing desire for chocolate that is sugar-free, vegan, organic, and gluten-free will also be a driving force behind product demand in the upcoming years, which is anticipated to sweeten and grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.1% from 2024 to 2030 according to Grand View Research. The global chocolate market was impacted by the COVID-19 epidemic. The National Confectioners Association (NCA) State of Treating Report 2021 states that during the pandemic period in 2020, chocolate sales increased by 4.2%. While the government's lockdowns hindered market expansion, individuals stocked up on packaged and processed foods during the epidemic, which in turn raised demand for chocolates. According to Grand View Research, on a global scale, the European chocolate market held a 47.41% revenue share in 2023. The growing demand for dark chocolate among consumers in the region propels regional market growth."", ""Growing consumer awareness is driving a significant change in the chocolate industry. Specialty chocolate demand is expected to rise, according to the National Confectioners Association's (NCA) State of Treating Report 2021. Chocolate that is organic, vegan, gluten-free, and sugar-free is becoming increasingly popular. Single-origin and bean chocolates, prized for their unique tastes, are on the rise. Research from organizations such as the Cleveland Clinic, which links dark chocolate to better blood circulation, suggests that mental health awareness is impacting the amount of dark chocolate consumed. The latter also reported that, due to its minimal processing, dark chocolate has the highest amount of flavonoid-rich cocoa beans (cocoa), making it the healthiest type of chocolate. "", ""Dark chocolate sales are predicted to sweeten from $65,615.7 million to around $1,31,934.4 million, with a value-based compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.2%, as per Persistence Market Research. In an exciting move to broaden its chocolate options, Mars Wrigley India 2023 launched and started producing GALAXY FUSIONS Dark Chocolate, which boasts an astonishing 70% cocoa content. By adding a delicious dark chocolate variety, this calculated decision would strengthen Mars Wrigley India's position in the molded chocolate market and expand the GALAXY brand range."", 'Moreover, in the chocolate sector, ethical and environmental standards are becoming essential. Concerns over the ethical and environmental implications of cocoa manufacturing are growing among consumers. In response, businesses are making investments in fair trade policies, transparent supply chains, and sustainable sourcing.

The biotech giant continues to build on an incredible wave of growth brought about by its highly successful cystic fibrosis drug franchise. The company brought in profits of $3.6 billion on revenue of $9.8 billion in the full year 2023.', ""However, the company may be looking at just the beginning of its growth potential. It's developing multiple promising candidates across a variety of disease areas, many of which address rare conditions for which there are minimal effective treatment options."", ""Management plans to launch five new products by 2028.

Vertex estimates that the currently addressable market for VX-548 numbers around 90 million patients."", 'The future looks bright for this healthcare stock as it continues to derive growth from its existing portfolio of drugs and looks to future potential blockbusters that may be just on the horizon.', 'Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) is trading up over 50% from a year ago as the growth stock has regained favor with some investors after a volatile period. While many streaming stocks have dealt with growth decelerations following the pandemic peak when many consumers had little to do but view content for hours on head, Netflix is regaining its footing in a major way.', ""Bear in mind, Netflix is still the leading streaming provider in the U.S. with a robust market share of around 44%. There are certainly plenty of competitors, but with the global streaming market set to hit a valuation of $109 billion this year, there's room for multiple players."", 'The company generated net cash from operating activities of $1.7 billion in the final three months of 2023 alone. Full-year 2023 revenue came in at $34 billion, with net income totaling $5.4 billion, representing respective increases of 7% and 20% from 2022.', 'Netflix ended the year with about 260 million paid streaming memberships globally. That was a 13% increase from a year ago, and an even more notable 56% increase from four years ago, right before the pandemic began. The company is having tremendous success in growing its subscriber base, partly due to a series of initiatives in the last 12 to 18 months.', 'Starting last spring, it initiated a full-throttle crackdown on password sharing. This was a few months after launching its ad-supported tier, a more cost-effective option that runs at just $6.99 a month and allows access on two devices along with a wide range of content viewing options. Subscribers seem more than willing to pay for that viewing option and sit through some ads in the process for a monthly fee that runs about the same price as a couple of cups of coffee.', 'In fact, ad-supported-tier subscribers jumped 70% in the final quarter of the year compared to the previous quarter. Incidentally, that ad-supported tier alone now boasts 23 million active monthly users at last count, compared to the 15 million reported just in November.', ""There's so much room left for this company to run.

However, its shares have had quite a run recently as a resurgence in travel, coupled with the platform's resilience, have rekindled investor interest in the stock. The shares are trading up by around 30% over the trailing 12 months alone."", ""The company's effectiveness in facilitating both sides of a travel accommodation arrangement has led to considerable growth. Plus, the potential ahead is enormous. Management estimates Airbnb's total addressable market at $3.4 trillion.

Experiences include activities like tours and classes that guests can book in their chosen stay location."", 'People use Airbnb for all sorts of reasons, from vacations to business trips to long-term living arrangements, and this diversity is helping to drive the business forward even in a difficult macro environment. In fact, the cohort of guests living on Airbnb continues to account for a substantial portion of overall bookings.', 'In the third quarter of 2023, long-term stays of 28 days or longer comprised 18% of gross nights booked, while approximately 25% of long-term stays were for reservations of three months or more. Nights reserved for more than three months on Airbnb rose 20% in the third quarter of 2023 on a year-over-year basis.', 'In total, nights and experiences booked on Airbnb jumped 14% in the quarter compared to the prior-year period, while revenue rose 18% year over year to $3.4 billion.

Is Vertex stock too expensive right now?', ""Let's acknowledge right out of the gate that a P/S multiple of more than 11x is usually viewed as sky-high. For example, the S&P 500 currently trades at only 2.72x sales. However, it's not a great approach to compare the valuations of biopharmaceutical stocks with those of other industries because the dynamics shaping their respective markets are very different."", ""How does Vertex's P/S ratio stack up against its biopharma peers? It still seems quite expensive. The average P/S multiple for biotech stocks in January 2024 (the latest data available) was 6.44x, according to New York University's Stern School of Business Professor Aswath Damodaran."", ""Granted, there are a couple of big biopharma stocks with steeper valuations than Vertex. Eli Lilly's\xa0and Novo Nordisk's shares trade at 20.6x sales and 16.2x sales, respectively. It should be noted, though, that both of these drugmakers have diabetes and weight-loss drugs that some analysts think could become all-time bestsellers."", ""But Vertex's P/S ratio isn't nearly as worrisome when we look at the company's past valuations. Actually, it's on the low end of the historical range."", ""Unfortunately, this comparison isn't perfect. The Vertex of 10 years ago had significantly greater growth prospects in treating CF than the company does today."", ""That leads me to an important point in the discussion of Vertex's valuation. We should look to the future and not to the past. The P/S ratio of over 11x is based on Vertex's trailing-12-month sales. What matters more is the company's expected sales going forward."", 'Vertex provided full-year 2024 revenue guidance of between $10.55 billion and $10.75 billion. The midpoint of this range gives the company a forward P/S multiple of a little over 10x. That still seems pricey.', ""However, Vertex's future beyond 2024 should be much more exciting. Sales for newly approved gene-editing therapy Casgevy should accelerate after the initial ramp-up this year. Goldman Sachs\xa0projects the rare blood disorder treatment could generate peak annual sales of $3.9 billion."", 'Other analysts are more conservative, though, with the consensus peak sales estimate of around $2.2 billion. Vertex will also have to split the net profits 60-40 with its partner, CRISPR Therapeutics.', 'The company could have two other new products on the market in 2025. It plans to file for regulatory approvals this summer for a vanzacaftor triple-drug combo targeting CF and non-opioid pain drug VX-548. Both appear to hold the potential to rake in $2 billion or more in sales.', ""If you've been keeping score, Vertex has a realistic chance of adding at least $6 billion in annual sales over time from new products that have either recently launched or could launch next year. These opportunities make the company's valuation much more palatable."", ""We're not finished, though. Vertex is also advancing experimental APOL1-mediated kidney disease (AMKD) drug inaxaplin into late-stage testing. AMKD affects more patients worldwide than CF does -- and there are no approved therapies that treat the underlying cause of the disease."", ""There's an argument that Vertex is actually a bargain based on another widely used valuation metric. Vertex's price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio, using five-year earnings growth projections, is 0.57. Any PEG multiple of 1 or below is considered to be attractive. Vertex's PEG ratio is lower than nearly every other big biopharma stock on the market."", ""It's possible that the growth forecasts for Vertex could be overly optimistic or the company's late-stage pipeline candidates could flop. I wouldn't bet on it, though. Vertex has a good track record of success when it advances programs into phase 3 testing."", ""I don't think this stock is too expensive at all.

352,2c76fd2b-3c12-3eff-8b35-156472e31e0d,KO,2024-02-15,Analysts Have Made A Financial Statement On The Coca-Cola Company's (NYSE:KO) Annual Report,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-made-financial-statement-coca-102445977.html,1707992685,STORY,['KO'],"[""The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) last week reported its latest full-year results, which makes it a good time for investors to dive in and see if the business is performing in line with expectations. It was a credible result overall, with revenues of US$46b and statutory earnings per share of US$2.47 both in line with analyst estimates, showing that Coca-Cola is executing in line with expectations. The analysts typically update their forecasts at each earnings report, and we can judge from their estimates whether their view of the company has changed or if there are any new concerns to be aware of. We've gathered the most recent statutory forecasts to see whether the analysts have changed their earnings models, following these results."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Coca-Cola ', ""Following last week's earnings report, Coca-Cola's 17 analysts are forecasting 2024 revenues to be US$45.8b, approximately in line with the last 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are predicted to expand 10% to US$2.74. Yet prior to the latest earnings, the analysts had been anticipated revenues of US$47.0b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$2.72 in 2024. The consensus seems maybe a little more pessimistic, trimming their revenue forecasts after the latest results even though there was no change to its EPS estimates."", 'The average price target was steady at US$65.93even though revenue estimates declined; likely suggesting the analysts place a higher value on earnings. It could also be instructive to look at the range of analyst estimates, to evaluate how different the outlier opinions are from the mean. There are some variant perceptions on Coca-Cola, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$74.00 and the most bearish at US$59.00 per share. Even so, with a relatively close grouping of estimates, it looks like the analysts are quite confident in their valuations, suggesting Coca-Cola is an easy business to forecast or the the analysts are all using similar assumptions.', ""Another way we can view these estimates is in the context of the bigger picture, such as how the forecasts stack up against past performance, and whether forecasts are more or less bullish relative to other companies in the industry. We would highlight that Coca-Cola's revenue growth is expected to slow, with the forecast 0.2% annualised growth rate until the end of 2024 being well below the historical 6.1% p.a. growth over the last five years. By way of comparison, the other companies in this industry with analyst coverage are forecast to grow their revenue at 4.9% per year. Factoring in the forecast slowdown in growth, it seems obvious that Coca-Cola is also expected to grow slower than other industry participants."", ""The most important thing to take away is that there's been no major change in sentiment, with the analysts reconfirming that the business is performing in line with their previous earnings per share estimates. On the negative side, they also downgraded their revenue estimates, and forecasts imply they will perform worse than the wider industry. Even so, earnings are more important to the intrinsic value of the business. The consensus price target held steady at US$65.93, with the latest estimates not enough to have an impact on their price targets."", 'Keeping that in mind, we still think that the longer term trajectory of the business is much more important for investors to consider. We have estimates - from multiple Coca-Cola analysts - going out to 2026, and you can see them free on our platform here.', ""We don't want to rain on the parade too much, but we did also find 1 warning sign for Coca-Cola that you need to be mindful of."", 'Have feedback on this article?

But overall consumer sentiment remains strong."", 'For more on beverage trends and the overall health of the US consumer, we\'re joined by Duane Stanford, who is the ""Beverage Digest"" Editor and Publisher. Duane, great to have you here with us this morning. I mean, if there\'s one common denominator that you\'re seeing in some of the reports that are coming out from these major consumer packaged goods and beverage-- food and beverage companies, what would that be?', ""DUANE STANFORD: Right now, everyone's waiting to see exactly what happens with the consumer-- how much consumers are pressured by the economy. We've got a real bifurcation between the top end of the spectrum on the income level and the lower end. The lower end is the one that would be most concerning. That's where you would start to have some impacts to either volume sales and also the ability to price, you know, your beverages. So companies are generally feeling optimistic about what's going to happen as the year progresses. But it's something that everyone's watching very closely."", ""RACHELLE AKUFFO: And as you-- there's always this want to compare Pepsi with Coca-Cola. Pepsi, obviously, broader in the snack space versus the more pure play with beverages for Coca-Cola here. How do you think we should be looking at those two brands?"", ""DUANE STANFORD: Yeah. I think that's something that people don't always quite grasp when they're looking at these companies. When they're on the store aisle, I mean, they're battling it out every single day. And the frontline workers are going at each other tooth and nail."", ""But when you look at the companies as a whole, they have very different strategies. PepsiCo, a huge part of its business-- half its business is in snacks. And that's a very profitable part of their business. So they're looking to always make sure they can maximize investments in the snack business."", ""And so a lot of times what they're doing is balancing those investments with what they do on the beverage side. So, you know, that sometimes leads to decisions when it comes to how much share they're willing to try to take by lowering prices. On the Coke side, on the other hand, they are a beverage play."", ""That's their primary-- that is the category they compete in. And so they have just a very different investment profile. That's why you often see situations where Coke is leading on share. PepsiCo is falling behind on share at times. And they're constantly trying to get that level right as it compares to snacks. So it's something to really keep in mind when you look at those two companies in terms of how they compete."", ""BRAD SMITH: Yeah. Spot on, Duane. And I'm sure many Americans consumed multiple snacks last week for the Super Bowl, I mean, myself included. Consumers right now, though, we're complaining that packaged goods are-- they're getting smaller. And shrinkflation is real. And it's certainly caught the attention of many Americans, including one of the Americans at the top of the totem pole, President Biden. Take a look at what he had to say about shrinkflation, and we'll get your reaction on the other side."", ""JOE BIDEN: When buying snacks for the game, you might have noticed one thing-- sports drinks bottles are smaller. A bag of chips has fewer chips, but they're still charging you just as much. I've had enough of what they call shrinkflation. It's a ripoff."", ""BRAD SMITH: So there's shrinkflation, and then there's, perhaps, another thread of the mind of profit-led inflation as well here. I mean, where do we toss this one up? Where does it settle?"", ""DUANE STANFORD: I mean, this is something that the food and beverage companies have dealt with going back well over a decade, even during the Great Recession. PepsiCo, particularly, because they have such a large snack business, which is typically a place where you're going to find more of that sort of pricing strategy-- instead of raising the price of the shelf, you take more out of the bag in order to equalize that and make it easier, especially for lower income consumers-- that's something that they've had to contend with for some time, the backlash against that."", ""We just came off a period of extreme pricing growth across all food and beverage. Beverages and snacks were included in that. That pricing is starting to subside. And EEO companies, as part of their strategy, are going to use that as a mix. They're going to do it. They're not going to stop."", ""It's really all about, how do you communicate that? And how do you make sure that you're not going too far at any given time to really turn those consumers against your brands?"", ""RACHELLE AKUFFO: And speaking of that, Duane, I want to talk about just a potential trend that you see for the year. There's always some, no pun intended, flavor of the month here. What do you see as being a top theme that some of these beverages, both alcoholic and non-alcoholic, will be leaning into?"", ""DUANE STANFORD: Yeah. I mean, one of the things for carbonated soft drinks has been flavors. Flavors are overindexed with young consumers, Gen Z consumers, multicultural consumers. So that's really been a real part-- important part of the industry. It's about a third of carbonated soft drink sales on a dollar basis in the US-- things like root beer, orange, lemon lime, root beer."", ""So that's a pretty important trend. And of course, zero sugar is extremely important. The companies like Coca-Cola and PepsiCo are really leaning into their zero sugar cola products, and also turning most of their beverages, making sure that all of them have some sort of zero sugar offering for consumers who want that as an option. So those are two big things that we're seeing right now, for sure."", 'BRAD SMITH: I\'m learning a lot about my co-host right now, Duane. She just Slacked me and said she does not like root beer. I love root beer. Duane, we\'ll get your take on this perhaps next time we have back on. Duane Stanford, ""Beverage Digest"" editor and publisher, thanks so much for taking the time.']"

In 2023, we achieved our near-term goals, while also positioning our business for the long-term. Our all-weather strategy delivered 8% comparable earnings per share growth despite greater than expected 7% currency headwinds. Today, we are leveraging our scale globally and winning locally, which gives us confidence that we can deliver on our 2024 guidance. This morning, I'll talk about the global consumer landscape, then I'll highlight how our strategy and enhanced capabilities are making us a more agile and effective organization. And finally, John will discuss our financial results and our 2024 guidance. During the quarter, we benefited from strong performance across many of our markets."", 'However, some were impacted by elevated inflation and others by geopolitical tensions and conflict. We delivered 12% organic revenue growth, which included 2 points of volume growth, continuing a positive volume trend for the year. Throughout, we continue to invest in our business to provide the right portfolio of brands and packages to retain and attract more drinkers. We drove industry growth and delivered value share gains in the quarter and for the full year. We achieved these results by effectively navigating a number of headwinds and capitalizing on tailwinds across our markets. During the quarter, we saw strong consumer demand across Australia, India, Latin America, Japan and South Korea. In North America, consumer spending in aggregate is holding up well.', ""And in Europe, consumers remain cost conscious. In Africa and China, the macro environment remains uncertain. And in the Middle East, tensions have resulted in some shapes in consumer behavior that have had an impact on our business. Another important fact that I highlight is the inflationary pressures, which are moderating or stabilizing across most of our markets. To keep consumers in our franchise, we are leveraging our revenue growth management capabilities to tailor our offerings and price pack architecture to meet consumers' evolving needs. In North America and Europe, while inflation is moderating, the cumulative impact of inflation is pressuring certain consumer segments we're seeking value. Throughout 2023, we increased our affordability offerings and one volume and value share in both regions."", 'In Latin America, despite double digit inflation during the fourth quarter, we grew volume 4% and increased household penetration and basket initiatives. There are a few pockets of the world that are experiencing hyperinflation. John will later speak to how this dynamic is impacting our business. However, I did want to mention that our local franchise operating model allows us to navigate through hyperinflationary environment and then gain an advantage over the long-term. Across our business, we continue to prioritize agility and focus on improving every aspect of how we operate. An important part of this is our marketing transformation. To recruit the next generation of drinkers, our marketing has shifted from a TV centric model to a digital first organization that balances local intimacy, scale and flexibility.', ""Our digital mix has gone from less than 30% in 2019 to approximately 60% of our total media spend. In 2023, we stood up Studio X, the digital ecosystem that brings this altogether. We created physical hubs in each of our operating units to integrate disciplines, standardized data and technology and step change our capabilities. Creative, media, social and production capabilities and now operating at scale connected by our global network structure. In our previous model, it took several months to create a TV ad. Now, we're producing thousands of pieces of digital content that are contextually relevant and measuring these results in real-time. Studio X is driving tangible results. For example, Coke Studio which originated in Pakistan and taps into consumers' passion for music has been scale to our top 40 markets."", ""The campaign uses packaging as digital portals to access real magic experiences, which have generated more than 1.2 billion YouTube views and a 100 million music streams this year, resulting in strong recruitment of Gen Z drinkers. We're engaging differently with consumers and is delivering results. In 2023, according to Cantor, Coca-Cola brand value increased $8 billion. Coke is now the 10th most valuable brand in the world, up seven spots from the prior year. In the US, Sprite was named by Morning Consult as the number one beverage brands for Gen Z drinkers. We were also named one of the top 10 innovative companies in augmented and virtual reality by Fast Company. Our innovation agenda is increasing our competitive advantage across our products, packaging and equipment."", ""Taste is the starting point. Simply put, people want drinks to taste great. To drive superiority across our total beverage portfolio, we're continuing to build capabilities to tap into unique insights in taste and aroma sciences. We're applying digital tools, ingredient processing technology and AI to create bolder and more successful innovations. Coca-Cola Zero Sugar is an ongoing example of how superior taste drives demand, with volume that grew 5% in 2023, leading to continued volume and value share gains. We are applying learnings from this multiyear success and driving taste superiority elsewhere in our sparkling portfolio. In 2023, we launched Sprite and Fanta reformulations in 25 markets, delivering mid-single digit volume growth in those markets and driving overall sparkling flavors value share gains."", ""Outside of our sparkling portfolio, we're dialing up flavor profiles, adding functional benefits and expanding into new categories. In Japan, we relaunched Georgia Coffee, which generated broader customer interest and led to value share gains. In the US, fairlife’s Core Power and nutrition plan of a high protein dairy without compromising taste. In 2023, fairlife grew volume 15%, its 9th consecutive year of double digit volume growth. We're also seeing continued promising results from FUZE Tea across Europe, Jack and Coke in the Philippines, Flashlight in Mexico, among many others. In 2023, innovation contributed to approximately 30% of gross profit growth and our success rates have nearly tripled compared to 2019 levels. Our revenue growth management execution capabilities continue to be distinct advantages."", ""As demonstrated by our ability to deliver volume and transaction growth, despite ongoing inflationary pressures. We're working with our bottling partners to capture every opportunity available to create significant value for consumers and customers. By offering a total beverage portfolio in the right packages and at the right price points, we're driving category expansion and becoming more relevant to more consumers and customers. In North America, we're evolving packaging options across more distribution points, drive affordability and premiumization. On the affordability side, our 1.25 liter PET bottles are now available in 80% of supermarkets and our 16 ounce can distribution increased by 14 points in convenience stores during 2023. We're also focused on premiumization through the expansion of our mini can offerings."", ""During the quarter, we launched 15 pack mini cans in grocery and club channels. In Europe, we're leveraging the same playbook, but adapting it to local needs. In Spain, our 1.25 liter PET package is offered at a compelling price point and it drove 16% volume growth and increased household penetration in 2023. In Italy, Britain and Ireland, we drove premium single serve mini cans, a smaller package offerings to generate positive mix and incremental retail sales. Our franchise system uniquely combines the benefits of scale and knowledge sharing with the know-how needed to execute for customers and win locally in many different operating environments. For example, approximately 70% of purchase decisions are influenced at point of sale, our systems stepped up in-store displays during the quarter which drove incremental retail sales and cross selling opportunities."", ""Putting it all together, we created $15 billion in incremental retail sales for our customers in 2023, more than any other beverage company. This was our sixth year in a row as the leader in value creation. While we're pleased with our progress, we recognize there's still much work to be done to capture the vast opportunities available. Our system is galvanized to move further and faster. Before I hand over to John, I want to acknowledge that none of this could happen without the unwavering dedication of our employees. And so as we turn to 2024, we expect the year will bring new challenges and opportunities. And we'll remain ready to respond through continuing to improve execution of our strategy across our total beverage portfolio. I look forward to sharing more next Tuesday at CAGNY and I encourage everyone to listen in."", 'With that, I will turn the call over to John.', ""John Murphy: Thank you, James. And good morning, everyone. In the fourth quarter and throughout 2023, we delivered strong results. During the quarter, we grew organic revenues 12% which was in-line with our full year organic revenue growth. Unit case growth was 2% and it was positive in each quarter of 2023. Concentrate sales grew 1 point ahead of unit cases, driven primarily by one additional day in the quarter. Our price mix growth of 9% in the quarter was driven by three factors. One, 2023 pricing actions across most of our markets. Two, hyperinflationary pricing that I'll speak to in just a moment. And three, some mix which is mostly timing related. Comparable gross margin for the quarter was up approximately 140 basis points."", ""Driven by underlying expansion and a slight benefit from bottle refranchising. Partially offset by the impact of currency headwinds. Comparable operating margin expanded approximately 40 basis points for the quarter. This was primarily driven by strong topline growth, partially offset by currency headwinds and an increase in marketing investments. The positive volume and topline growth that we're realizing today demonstrates the effectiveness of our marketing spend. Below the line, comparable other income declined primarily due to the operating environment in Argentina. Putting it all together, fourth quarter comparable EPS of $0.49 was up 10% year-over-year, despite higher than expected 13% currency headwinds. Before moving on, I wanted to discuss the impact of a few hyperinflationary markets on our fourth quarter results."", ""During the quarter, inflation intensified and exceeded 60% across these markets. In aggregate, while they represent less than 5% of our total volume, this degree of inflation creates a cosmetic distortion to our underlying results. In the fourth quarter, these markets contributed more than 3 points of our price mix and most of our currency headwinds, including an outsized impact to comparable other income from balance sheet remeasurement in Argentina. They did not, however, have a material impact on our earnings per share results. In hyperinflationary markets it's either impractical or impossible to hedge our currency exposure. And to manage it, we use our full suite of revenue growth management tools, including pricing actions to keep pace with local market inflation."", ""We have been operating a long-time in these markets and we expect to be in them for a long-time to come. We work hand-in-hand with our local bottling partners and our focus will be to continue to nurture the strong relationships we have with our consumers and customers. And to ultimately prevail longer-term. So while we will continue to experience volatility of this nature in a few markets, it's important to keep in mind they are operated locally, they are typically self-funding and they have not impeded our overall ability to grow earnings per share. As we move forward, we are confident that our business model and the many levers within it will allow us to deliver on our overall objectives. In 2023 free cash flow was $9.7 billion, which increased from the prior year."", '2023 free cash flow included a transition tax payment of approximately $720 million, which was approximately $340 million higher than the prior year and included approximately $230 million in M&A related payments. Our underlying free cash flow growth was largely attributable to strong operational performance and working capital benefits. If you exclude the full impact of the transition tax in M&A related payments, our adjusted free cash flow conversion ratio would be within our target range of 90% to 95%. Our balance sheet remains strong. And our net debt leverage of 1.7 times EBITDA is below our targeted range of 2 times to 2.5 times. During the fourth quarter, in addition to offsetting dilution from the exercise of stock options by employees, we repurchased additional shares in anticipation of expected proceeds from bottler refranchising.', ""As James mentioned, we anticipate 2024 will bring new challenges and opportunities. However, through our all-weather strategy, we've proven we can deliver in many different operating environments. Our 2024 guidance builds on the underlying momentum of our business. We expect organic revenue growth of 6% to 7% and comparable currency neutral earnings per share growth of 8% to 10%. We anticipate hyperinflationary pricing will continue to play a role in 2024, but it will moderate throughout the year. We continue to make significant progress towards refranchising company owned bottling operations. Bottler refranchising is expected to be a 4 point to 5 point headwind to comparable net revenues and a 2 point headwind to comparable earnings per share."", 'But will have a positive impact on both our margins and the return profile of our business. Based on current rates and our hedge positions, we anticipate an approximate 2 point to 3 point currency headwind to comparable net revenues and an approximate 4 point to 5 point currency headwind to comparable earnings per share for full year 2024. Notably, much of our anticipated 2024 currency headwinds are attributed to hyperinflationary markets with a meaningful impact in the fourth quarter. Our underlying effective tax rate for 2024 is expected to be 19.2%. All in, we expect comparable earnings per share growth of 4% to 5% versus $2.69 in 2023. We expect to generate approximately $9.2 billion of free cash flow in 2024 through approximately $11.4 billion in cash from operations, less approximately $2.2 billion in capital investments.', ""The $11.4 billion of cash from operations includes two items to highlight, transition tax payments of approximately $960 million, an increase of approximately $240 million versus 2023, payments associated with various M&A transactions of approximately $560 million, an increase of approximately $330 million versus 2023. Driven by our underlying cash flow generation and current balance sheet strength, we have ample flexibility to both reinvest in our business to drive growth and return capital to our shareowners. A significant portion of our expected capital investment increase is to build capacity for fairlife and for our India business, both of which experienced robust growth in 2023. Related to capital return, we have an unwavering priority to grow our dividend as we've done with 61 consecutive years of dividend increases."", ""With respect to share repurchases, we will be flexible in our approach. Typically, we've repurchased shares to offset any dilution from the exercise of stock options by employees in the given year. Our capital allocation policy prioritize agility. And we're committed to taking the right actions needed to drive the long-term health of our business and create value for our stakeholders. There are some considerations to keep in mind for 2024. The first quarter of 2024 will be impacted by the timing of concentrate shipments in the fourth quarter of 2023 in some markets and cycling our strongest volume growth quarter from the prior year. We estimate the ongoing conflict in the Middle East had approximately 1 point of impact on volume growth during the fourth quarter of 2023."", ""It's unclear how long this impact will last. In November 2023, the U.S. Tax Court rendered its supplemental opinion related to our ongoing dispute with the Internal Revenue Service. We intend to move forward on appeal and vigorously defend our position. We have ample balance sheet flexibility to fund any payment related to the appeal. Finally, due to our reporting calendar, there will be one less day in the first quarter and two additional days in the fourth quarter. So in summary, we're pleased with what we accomplished in 2023, we're building on our capabilities to continue the underlying momentum across our markets, we're progressing on our refranchising agenda and we're reinvesting in our system to drive long-term growth. We have great confidence, we can deliver on our 2024 guidance and long-term commitments."", ""With that, operator, we're ready to take questions."", 'See also 20 Fastest Growing Energy Companies in the US and 20 Cheapest Places to Retire with Good Healthcare.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

361,2ee5fa47-fb3c-3b0e-9a4d-260aca1f038e,INCY,2024-02-15,Incyte Corporation (NASDAQ:INCY) Yearly Results Just Came Out: Here's What Analysts Are Forecasting For This Year,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/incyte-corporation-nasdaq-incy-yearly-110335934.html,1707995015,STORY,['INCY'],"['As you might know, Incyte Corporation (NASDAQ:INCY) recently reported its yearly numbers. Results were roughly in line with estimates, with revenues of US$3.7b and statutory earnings per share of US$2.65. The analysts typically update their forecasts at each earnings report, and we can judge from their estimates whether their view of the company has changed or if there are any new concerns to be aware of. So we collected the latest post-earnings statutory consensus estimates to see what could be in store for next year.', ' Check out our latest analysis for Incyte ', ""Taking into account the latest results, the current consensus from Incyte's 19 analysts is for revenues of US$4.15b in 2024. This would reflect a solid 12% increase on its revenue over the past 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are predicted to leap 34% to US$3.57. Before this earnings report, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$4.12b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$3.77 in 2024. So it looks like there's been a small decline in overall sentiment after the recent results - there's been no major change to revenue estimates, but the analysts did make a minor downgrade to their earnings per share forecasts."", ""The consensus price target held steady at US$76.01, with the analysts seemingly voting that their lower forecast earnings are not expected to lead to a lower stock price in the foreseeable future. There's another way to think about price targets though, and that's to look at the range of price targets put forward by analysts, because a wide range of estimates could suggest a diverse view on possible outcomes for the business. There are some variant perceptions on Incyte, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$92.00 and the most bearish at US$58.00 per share. This shows there is still a bit of diversity in estimates, but analysts don't appear to be totally split on the stock as though it might be a success or failure situation."", ""Of course, another way to look at these forecasts is to place them into context against the industry itself. We can infer from the latest estimates that forecasts expect a continuation of Incyte'shistorical trends, as the 12% annualised revenue growth to the end of 2024 is roughly in line with the 14% annual growth over the past five years. By contrast, our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in a similar industry are forecast to see their revenues grow 17% per year. So although Incyte is expected to maintain its revenue growth rate, it's forecast to grow slower than the wider industry."", ""The biggest concern is that the analysts reduced their earnings per share estimates, suggesting business headwinds could lay ahead for Incyte. Fortunately, the analysts also reconfirmed their revenue estimates, suggesting that it's tracking in line with expectations. Although our data does suggest that Incyte's revenue is expected to perform worse than the wider industry. The consensus price target held steady at US$76.01, with the latest estimates not enough to have an impact on their price targets."", ""Following on from that line of thought, we think that the long-term prospects of the business are much more relevant than next year's earnings. We have forecasts for Incyte going out to 2026, and you can see them free on our platform here."", 'We also provide an overview of the Incyte Board and CEO remuneration and length of tenure at the company, and whether insiders have been buying the stock,  here.', 'Have feedback on this article?

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Ben Strain, Associate Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Ben."", ""Ben Strain: Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, and welcome to Incyte's fourth quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Before we begin, I encourage everyone to go to the Investors section of our website to find the press release, related financial tables and slides that follow today's discussion. On today's call, I'm joined by Hervé, Barry, Pablo, Steven and Christiana, who will deliver our prepared remarks and will participate in the Q&A. I would like to point out that we will be making forward-looking statements, which are based on our current expectations and beliefs. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties and our actual results may differ materially. I encourage you to consult the risk factors discussed in our SEC filings for additional detail. I will now hand the call over to Hervé."", 'Hervé Hoppenot: Thank you, Ben, and good morning, everyone. So, on Slide 5, we achieved another strong year with 2023 product and royalty revenues growing 14% versus 2022 to reach $3.7 billion, continuing the strong performance we have delivered since 2018. We also achieved [a symbolic] (ph) milestone in the fourth quarter. Total product and royalty revenue reached $1 billion quarterly for the first time, driven by the continued growth of Jakafi and successful launch of Opzelura. So, moving to Slide 6, 2023 Jakafi net sales were $2.6 billion, growing 8% versus the prior year with growth across all indications year-over-year. And Opzelura saw strong momentum in 2023, growing 162% to $338 million, driven by new patient and refills in both AD and vitiligo.', 'We expect Opzelura to continue to be a key contributor to growth in the next year. On Slide 7, our clinical pipeline has the ability to deliver transformative therapies to patients across multiple programs and provides the opportunity for 10 high-impact launches by 2030, as presented recently in San Francisco. Importantly, some of the programs highlighted on this slide are de-risked as they are post proof of concept, including axatilimab, which has been submitted to the FDA for approval, RUX cream in pediatric atopic dermatitis to be submitted to the FDA by mid-year, RUX cream in HS where we have randomized Phase 2 data, and povorcitinib, where we are in Phase 3 in HS, vitiligo and in PN, where we are on track to initiate a Phase 3 study this year.', ""Each of these programs have the potential to address a significant market and provide an opportunity to contribute to the top-line before the end of the decade. I would also like now to highlight the recent transaction with MorphoSys on Slide 8. As described in the press release we issued last week, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with MorphoSys, which gave us exclusive global rights for tafasitamab, also known as Monjuvi or Minjuvi. This acquisition provides a number of benefits to Incyte in the short term. First, going forward, we will now record all revenues from Monjuvi in the US, while eliminating MorphoSys' share of the royalties ex US and all future milestone to MorphoSys. Second, we will realize significant operating efficiencies and cost synergies in US commercialization and in global development by removing redundant position and redundant external expenses and by simplifying the org chart."", ""Therefore, in 2024, this deal will add to Incyte's revenue and will have a limited impact on operating income. For the future, while the currently approved indication of relapsed/refractory DLBCL represents a smaller opportunity for tafasitamab, we see upside potential in second line follicular lymphoma and marginal zone lymphoma with Phase 3 data expected later this year and in first line DLBCL, for which Phase 3 data are expected in 2025. These programs have been co-funded by MorphoSys until now and, if positive, Incyte will fully benefit from the upside from this indication. And this acquisition will be value accredit for Incyte in all scenarios. I will now turn the call over to Barry, who will discuss our commercial performance in more detail."", 'Barry Flannelly: Thank you, Hervé, and good morning, everyone. Starting with Jakafi on Slide 10. In the fourth quarter, Jakafi net product revenue grew 7% year-over-year to $695 million and grew 8% for the full year to $2.6 billion. Total patients increased 6% in 2023, with growth being seen across all indications. We experienced some variation in Jakafi dynamics during the fourth quarter, including an increase in patients on free drug as well as an inventory fluctuations. Recall, inventory grew down modestly in Q3 and rebounded in the fourth quarter. Additionally, we anticipate the increase in patients on free drugs seen at the end of 2023 to reverse and return to more normalized levels through 2024, supported by the lower out-of-pocket expenses under the Part D redesign.', 'Christiana will provide more details on these dynamics in her prepared remarks. We continue -- and we expect continued growth of Jakafi and have updated the full year net product revenue guidance for 2024 to a range of $2.69 billion to $2.75 billion. As highlighted on Slide 11, Jakafi continues to maintain its leadership and market share in MF, driven by its unmatched product profile. Based on market research, other competitors have not had an impact on Jakafi in regards to total patient market share or new patients, and is consistent with our expectations. Jakafi demand remains strong and we expect continued future growth driven by maintaining its leadership as standard of care in myelofibrosis, growth opportunities in polycythemia vera and chronic graft-versus-host disease, as well as earlier use in chronic GvHD.', 'Additionally, we anticipate the positive changes in out-of-pocket expenses for Medicare Part D patients to contribute to the growth in the coming years, with the biggest impact starting in 2025. Turning to Slide 12 and Opzelura fourth quarter performance. Opzelura net product revenues in the fourth quarter were $109 million, up 78% when compared to the same quarter last year. Total 2023 full year net sales grew 162% versus 2022 to reach $338 million. US patient demand increased during the quarter with total prescriptions growing 77% year-over-year and refills growing by 22% versus the prior quarter. The weekly prescription trend, as shown on the right, demonstrates typical end of Q4 dynamics, as well as the continued growth of Opzelura, which is coming from both atopic dermatitis and vitiligo.', ""In AD, growth was primarily driven by Opzelura's efficacy and impact on inflammation and itch. In vitiligo, where Opzelura is the only approved treatment for repigmentation, growth was driven largely by refills, improved access and our educational initiatives. We remain very optimistic about the long-term potential of Opzelura as we continue to see strong uptake. The launch continues to be strong and it's gaining positive momentum with both physicians and patients as Opzelura becomes established as one of the best recent dermatology launches. Looking at the first 27 months post FDA approval, Opzelura continues to outperform other dermatology products on a launch aligned basis when measured by monthly dermatologists prescribed TRxs on the left and when comparing quarterly net revenues on the right."", ""The successful launch of Opzelura is driven by its compelling product profile, its ability to address significant unmet need in both atopic dermatitis and vitiligo and our strong market access relative to competition where we continue to improve access and growing net sales. Turning to Slide 14, we have a number of initiatives in place for Opzelura to drive demand in 2024 in both AD and vitiligo. We know that based on Opzelura's compelling efficacy and safety, healthcare professionals want to use Opzelura sooner in the treatment algorithm. In addition to securing improved access for 2024, we are also continuing to look for ways to improve utilization management and we have an exceptional value proposition that supports these advancements. For vitiligo, we continue to drive patient awareness through consistent marketing campaigns with the goal of educating and inspiring these patients with positive real-world patient experiences."", ""We believe this will drive further demand and activate patients to discuss treatment options with their dermatologists. With that, I'll turn the call over to Pablo."", ""Pablo Cagnoni: Thank you, Barry, and good morning, everyone. I want to highlight some of the key R&D milestones that we accomplished in 2023 and to provide a framework for how we are evolving our R&D focus with near-term goals to increase the rigor of our decision making, accelerate the progression of our pipeline and to optimize our resource allocation. As you can see on Slide 16, we have three areas of focus where we're building a robust and diverse portfolio of medicines for the treatment of MPNs and graft-versus-host disease, oncology and inflammatory diseases. We're advancing a pipeline to deliver impactful innovation with a focus on best-in-class and our first-in-class differentiated medicines in areas with large unmet medical needs."", 'Our discovery process is targeting pathway-centric and leverages cross program knowledge and deep biology expertise in our established disease areas of interest to identify and prosecute novel targets as well as disease and genotype-specific dependencies with a mortality agnostic approach. In addition to our established small molecules expertise, we have expanded our drug discovery capabilities to include monoclonal antibody discovery in-house and have access to bispecific antibody discovery capabilities through our partnership with Merus. Turning now to Slide 17, we made significant advancements across all three priority areas of focus in the R&D portfolio in 2023. In MPNs and graft-versus-host disease, we submitted the BLA for axatilimab for the treatment in third line chronic graft-versus-host disease.', 'We presented updates for our BET and ALK2 inhibitors in MF and highlighted our new potentially transformative therapies for MF, PV and ET, our mutant CALR monoclonal antibody, which is enrolling well in a Phase 1 study and our JAK2 V617F inhibitor for which we plan to initiate a Phase 1 study in the next month. In oncology, we initiated several monotherapy and combination studies with our small molecule oral PD-L1 inhibitor and highlighted early signs of clinical activity with our small molecule CDK2 inhibitor. Additionally, we unveiled a new program in development, our KRASG12D inhibitor, which entered the clinic earlier this year. Steven will provide more detail on the KRASG12D program in his prepared remarks. In dermatology, we continue to maximize the potential of ruxolitinib cream.', ""In 2023, Opzelura was approved in Europe for vitiligo as the first and only approved treatment for repigmentation. We also presented positive Phase 3 data in pediatric atopic dermatitis and announced that the primary endpoint was met in a randomized Phase 2 study in patients with hidradenitis suppurativa. For povorcitinib, we presented a positive randomized Phase 2 data in vitiligo and initiated two Phase 3 studies for patients with extensive vitiligo. We also announced that povorcitinib had met the primary endpoint in a randomized Phase 2 study in patients with prurigo nodularis, and we initiated two randomized Phase 2 studies, one in patients with asthma and another in patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria. We believe that with ruxolitinib cream and povorcitinib, we'll be the only company with the ability to address a broad spectrum of patients from mild to severe, potentially providing both the topical and oral option for a number of indications, including prurigo nodularis, hidradenitis suppurativa and vitiligo."", ""Apart from an exhaustive list of all the R&D achievements in the past year, this demonstrates that 2023 was a very successful impactful year for Incyte and it serves as a foundation for a number of pivotal trials that will deliver results in the next few years. As you can see from Slide 18, we anticipate that 2024 will be another very exciting year with multiple clinical and regulatory milestones. Steven will provide more details on these, but I would like to highlight certain events. Within our oncology pipeline, we believe that our potentially best-in-class CDK2 inhibitor is an active agent and we look forward to sharing data as well as our development plan later this year. In addition, the pivotal trial of tafasitamab in patients with follicular and marginal zone lymphoma, also known as inMIND, we'll read out later this year, and we look forward to sharing those results."", 'We submitted a BLA for axatilimab late last year and we look forward to working with the FDA to make axatilimab available to patients with chronic graft-versus-host disease later this year and to initiate additional combination studies in patients with less pre-treated chronic graft-versus-host disease. Within our dermatology portfolio, we expect to submit the sNDA for Opzelura for pediatric atopic dermatitis and expect multiple data readouts throughout the year. With that, I would like to pass the call to Steven, who will provide further details on our clinical development pipeline.', 'Steven Stein: Thank you, Pablo. Starting on Slide 20, in December, we presented more than 40 hematology and oncology abstracts, including a plenary presentation at the ASH Annual Meeting. Key highlights included a plenary scientific session, which featured the full data from AGAVE-201, evaluating axatilimab, an anti-CSF-1R monoclonal antibody in patients with chronic graft-versus-host disease and additional data from the Phase 1/2 study of zilurgisertib, Phase 1 data from our BET inhibitor and preclinical data of the JAK2V617F inhibitor. For our BET inhibitor, dose escalation is ongoing. In monotherapy and in combination therapy, we are seeing reductions in spleen length and volume as well as improvements in both symptoms and hemoglobin, suggesting that this is an active compound.', 'We plan on advancing this program to Phase 3 later this calendar year. As we get closer, we will provide additional details on study design and timing. Based on the efficacy and favorable safety profile seen in the Phase 2 AGAVE-201 pivotal study, the BLA for axatilimab was submitted to FDA for approval for the treatment of patients with chronic graft-versus-host disease. We anticipate a decision by the FDA in the second half of 2024 and are excited by the possibility of bringing a new treatment option to these patients. We continue to expand and advance our IAI and dermatology portfolio, as seen on Slide 22. For ruxolitinib cream, we recently presented positive Phase 3 data in pediatric patients, where RUX cream met its efficacy endpoints for both Investigator Global Assessment treatment success and EASI-75.', 'We expect to submit the sNDA by the middle of 2024 with potential approval in 2025. We also disclosed that RUX cream met the primary endpoint in the Phase 2 study in mild to moderate hidradenitis suppurativa, and we expect to present those results at a medical conference later this year, while a Phase 3 study is being evaluated. Ruxolitinib cream is also currently being evaluated in two Phase 3 studies in prurigo nodularis and two Phase 2 studies in lichen planus and lichen sclerosus, with data expected for both later this year. Povorcitinib, our oral JAK1 inhibitor is currently being evaluated in Phase 3 studies in hidradenitis suppurativa and vitiligo, and we have recently announced that povorcitinib met the primary endpoint of greater than or equal to a 4 point improvement in the itch NRS across all three treatment groups in a Phase 2 study in prurigo nodularis.', 'We expect the full data set at a medical conference later this year and Phase 3 planning is underway. Our earlier stage dermatology program, our IL-15 receptor beta antibody, has begun evaluation in healthy volunteers. Moving to Slide 23. Last week, at the European Hidradenitis Suppurativa Foundation Conference, we presented additional data from the open label extension of Phase 2 study of povorcitinib in HS. As a reminder, povorcitinib demonstrated dose dependent efficacy in patients with HS during the initial placebo control period at week 16. The data presented demonstrate that treatment with povorcitinib through week 52 resulted in a decrease in disease severity as classified by the International HS Severity Scoring System, or IHS4. At week 52, a significant decrease in disease severity was observed with approximately 25% of patients achieving an IHS4 score of zero, which represents the complete resolution of abscess, nodule and draining tunnels.', ""On Slide 24, an additional analysis was maintenance of response, which demonstrates that povorcitinib treated patients who achieved a response at week 16 were likely to maintain the HiSCR response through week 52. Both of these datasets build upon povorcitinib's potential as a best in disease medicine for patients suffering from HS. As a reminder, two Phase 3 studies evaluating povorcitinib in HS, STOP-HS1 and STOP-HS2, are ongoing and enrolling very well. Our high-potential oncology pipeline is currently focused on three advanced programs. The first is tafasitamab, which has currently been evaluated in two Phase 3 studies in patients with follicular and marginal zone lymphoma and in patients with previously untreated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma."", ""We're expecting Phase 3 results for follicular and marginal zone lymphoma or the inMIND study in the second half of this year with the first line diffuse large B-cell lymphoma front line study readout in 2025. The second is our small molecule oral PD-L1 program. We have multiple ongoing studies as monotherapy or in combination with other agents such as axitinib, adagrasib and ipilimumab, and we expect to have combination data later this calendar year. And the third program is our small molecule CDK2 inhibitor, where we recently announced early signs of clinical activity with multiple patients demonstrating partial responses. We expect to share data as well as the development plan later this calendar year. On Slide 26, we recently announced that INCB161734, a potent, selective and orally available KRAS G12D inhibitor recently entered the clinic in a Phase 1 study."", 'This program has shown encouraging preclinical anti-tumor activity in xenograft models with no currently approved G12D targeting agents could address a high unmet need. As a reminder, the KRAS G12D mutation is found in approximately 40% of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, 15% of colorectal cancer, and 5% of non-small cell lung cancer, and could thus represent a significant opportunity for Incyte if successful. In summary, we anticipate a number of upcoming pipeline updates in 2024, including sharing top line results from both the Phase 2 studies in RUX cream in HS and povorcitinib in PN at a medical conference in the first half of this year. Second half of the year is looking to be catalyst-rich period, as highlighted on Slide 20, that we anticipate -- includes but is not limited to an approval with axatilimab, Phase 3 results from tafasitamab and the initiation of a number of Phase 3 studies including with our BET inhibitor.', 'With that, I would like to turn the call over to Christiana for the financial update.', 'Christiana Stamoulis: Thank you, Steven, and good morning, everyone. 2023 was another year of strong financial performance with total product revenues of $862 million for the fourth quarter of the year and $3.2 billion for the full year, representing a 13% and 15% year-over-year increase, respectively. Total royalty revenues, which are primarily comprised of royalties from Novartis for Jakavi and Tabrecta, and royalties from Lilly for Olumiant were $150 million in the fourth quarter and $523 million for the full year, up 13% and 8%, respectively, compared to 2022. Total revenues grew 9% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior-year period, reaching the $1 billion mark, an important milestone for Incyte. For the full year, total revenues were $3.7 billion.', ""Turning to Jakafi on Slide 30. Jakafi net product revenues were $695 million for the fourth quarter and $2.6 billion for the full year 2023. In 2023, Jakafi net sales grew 8% compared to the prior year. Jakafi sales were negatively impacted by a significant increase in free drug in the fourth quarter of the year, driven by an increase in the number of patients seeking support from Incyte's Patient Assistance Program. The impact of the increase in free drug was more than offset by an increase in channel inventory levels. This increase was in anticipation of patients moving into paid demand starting in Q1 of 2024. The increase in Q4 channel inventory levels represented $46 million in sales. Turning now to Opzelura, net product revenues for the fourth quarter were $109 million, representing a 78% increase year-over-year, driven primarily by increased patient demand."", ""For the full year, total Opzelura net product revenues were $338 million, representing a 162% increase compared to the prior year. Moving on to Slide 32 and our operating expenses on a GAAP basis. Total R&D expenses were $444 million for the quarter, representing an 11% year-over-year decrease, which was primarily as a result of the $70 million upfront payment made as part of the Villaris acquisition in Q4 2022 and partially offset by the $20 million development milestone payment to former Villaris shareholders in the fourth quarter of 2023. For the full year 2023, total R&D expenses were $1.6 billion, representing a 3% year-over-year increase. This increase was primarily due to the progression of our pipeline and was mainly offset by lower upfront and milestone expenses in '23."", 'Total SG&A expenses were $294 million for the fourth quarter and $1.16 billion for the year. The year-over-year increase of 8% for the fourth quarter and 16% for the full year were mainly due to increased sales and marketing activities for Opzelura in both the US and Europe, unfavorable effects and timing of certain G&A related expenses. Moving on to 2024, I will now discuss the key components of our guidance on a GAAP basis, which includes revenues and expenses related to the recent acquisition of the exclusive global rights to tafasitamab, but excludes any potential impact related to the accounting treatment of the $25 million purchase price paid. For Jakafi, we expect net product revenues to be in the range of $2.69 billion to $2.75 billion, on track to achieve our long-term guidance of over $3 billion in net product revenues by 2028.', 'We expect net product revenue growth to be driven exclusively by continued demand growth, and be partially offset by lower net pricing as a result of IRA imposed price increase caps and continued growth in 340B volumes. As in previous years, we expect the gross to net adjustment to be higher in the first quarter of the year relative to the previous quarter and subsequent quarters due to the higher deductibles and our share of the donut hole for Medicare Part D patients, which are primarily impacting the first quarter of the year. While for Opzelura we will not be providing full year guidance at this point, in the first quarter, we expect to see again the effect of typical Q1 dynamics on net sales, including higher patient out-of-pocket costs due to the planned deductibles resetting at the beginning of the year and the impact of holidays, medical conferences and other events on dermatology product sales.', 'As of a result, Q1 Opzelura net product revenues are expected to be below the previous quarter and the subsequent quarters and represent a smaller share of the full year net product revenues, consistent with what we saw in 2023. For other hematology/oncology products, which now include Iclusig, Pemazyre, Monjuvi and Minjuvi, we expect total net product revenues to be in the range of $325 million to $360 million, which at the midpoint represents approximately 47% growth over 23%. Turning to operating expenses on a GAAP basis, we expect COGS to range from 7% to 8% of net product revenues, which is in line with 2023. R&D expense is expected to be in the range of $1.72 billion to $1.76 billion, representing 7% growth at the midpoint versus 2023, primarily driven by the progression of our pipeline.', 'We expect SG&A expense for the year to be in the range of $1.21 billion to $1.24 billion, representing 6% year-over-year growth at the midpoint, primarily driven by the inclusion of sales and marketing expenses associated with Monjuvi in the US under SG&A, whereas prior to the acquisition of full product rights, they were included under the collaboration profit or loss share. Operator, that concludes our prepared remarks. Please give your instructions and open the call for Q&A.', 'Operator: Certainly. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session.

The WM team delivered a remarkably strong finish to 2023 driving fourth operating EBITDA 15% higher. This accelerated earnings growth led to full-year operating EBITDA that exceeded the high-end of our most recent guidance range by nearly $25 million and achieved the midpoint of our original expectations from the beginning of the year. Our strong financial results for both the quarter and the year were powered by our collection and disposal business. This performance starts with disciplined organic revenue growth that exceeded our expectations. And once again, our success in managing the middle of the P&L really stands out in our results, as our teams continue to make progress in optimizing our cost structure with the help of technology and automation.', ""When you combine our revenue performance with the improvement in operating costs, we saw widening of our price-to-cost spread and increased profitability. Operating EBITDA margin reached a record 29.9% in the fourth quarter and full-year margin expanded 90 basis points 28.9%. As 2024 kicks-off, we're confident that our continued focus on optimizing our cost structure and executing on sustainability growth projects sets us up for another year of outsized growth. We anticipate operating EBITDA growth of 7.7% at the midpoint of our guidance, which translates to more than $450 million of which $115 million comes directly from our sustainability growth investments. We remain excited about the economic and environmental benefits of expanding our renewable natural gas and recycling platforms."", ""Our execution is tracking well and we expect to commission five new renewable natural gas facilities by the end of the year reaching 30% of our run rate renewable natural gas volume growth. We're also on-track to complete automation upgrades at 10 recycling facilities and add three recycling facilities in new markets in 2024. Turning to capital allocation, you'll hear from Devina, on this topic in more detail, but I want to stress our confidence and our ability to continue to allocate capital to all of our priorities. This includes investing in our high-return sustainability growth projects, acquiring accretive businesses and returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Our tuck-in acquisition pipeline is robust, and there are some indications that 2024 could have heightened activity in this regard."", ""We're committed to a disciplined approach to acquiring companies ensuring that any deals we pursue yield appropriate returns particularly given the high-returns in sustainability opportunities. In closing, I want to thank the entire WM team for another great year. We were just at the WM Phoenix Open last week and I've said before, we work hard for this event to create a representation of the bigger company with a central focus on people and the environment. We've been the title sponsor for 15 years now and the tournament's been recognized as the largest zero waste sporting event in the world for 12 years running. It makes me proud to see the WM team out there making waste diversion operations run smoothly and demonstrating our sustainability leadership so well."", ""I look forward to working with this great team in 2024 as we continue to drive growth by executing our operating plans and progressing our investments in technology, automation and sustainability. I'll now turn the call over to John, to discuss our operational results."", ""John J. Morris: Thanks, Jim, and good morning. We're more than pleased with the strong operational performance our team achieved in 2023 showing continuous improvement throughout the year with standout results in the fourth quarter. During this period, operating expenses as a percentage of revenue improved 240 basis points year-over-year landing at 60.3% and marking our second best quarterly performance ever. This improvement was primarily fueled by our collection and disposal business benefiting from the robust operating leverage of our strategic cost optimization. Our proactive measures to accelerate and improve cost efficiency included leveraging technology to manage labor, managing repair and maintenance costs and optimizing our overall cost structure."", ""These initiatives led to a substantial improvement in WM's cost to serve metrics, bringing estimated unit cost inflation to low-single-digits by the fourth quarter. When combined with solid results from our pricing initiatives, we greatly enhanced overall margins. Our strong second half performance translated into full-year operating expenses as a percentage of revenue of 61.7%, an improvement of 70 basis points. That momentum has carried into 2024 and is evident in our January results even as we face severe weather in some areas we serve. Two of the key cost categories driving our operating improvements are labor and repair and maintenance. On the labor front, this begins with our persistent focus on reducing turnover. In the fourth quarter, we achieved a noteworthy milestone as driver turnover reaches lowest point at 18.4%, showing improvement as the year progressed."", 'Additionally, our strategic automation initiatives are yielding positive results in collection efficiency with all three lines of business improving meaningfully in the fourth quarter compared to last year. The results of our technology and automation investments gained traction in the latter part of 2023, leading to significant strides in labor cost management. We expect this to continue into 2024 as we broaden the deployment of our tools across additional sites. Turning to repair and maintenance, with a full lot of trucks received in 2023, we successfully removed over a 1,000 excess assets from our operation, improve the age of our routed fleet and reduce truck rental utilization by nearly 60% since the beginning of 2023. Throughout 2023, our emphasis remained on streamlining maintenance processes, which has resulted in enhanced technician productivity, reduced overtime expenses and diminished reliance on external repair services.', ""This is paid off in the form of lower repair and maintenance costs in both dollars and as a percentage of revenue compared to 2022. We accomplished all this with an unwavering commitment to safety and by enhancing the quality of our fleet. We're proud of the strides we made throughout 2023 and look forward to sustained progress. Another core element of the equation that fueled our strong financial results is disciplined organic revenue growth. Growth from price and volume in the collection and disposal business totaled 6.3% for the year, which outpaced our expectations. Our pricing programs continue to be focused on striking the right balance between maximizing customer lifetime value and increasing price to recover higher costs. Our full-year churn rates remain at the lower-end of historical range at about 9% and the year-over-year improvement underscores our consistent delivery of quality service to our customers."", ""Looking ahead to 2024, we anticipate sustained momentum in our disciplined pricing programs to result in core price between 6% and 6.5% and yield approaching 5%. We remain committed to maximizing customer lifetime value up while securing pricing that exceeds our cost inflation. We've seen that spread improve as 2023 progressed and we are confident that our teams are poised to deliver another successful year ahead. Turning to volumes, our fourth quarter collection and disposal volume grew by 1.9% on a workday adjusted basis. Growth was primarily driven by MSW landfill and commercial collection, two bellwethers for demand of our services. Overall growth in landfill volumes was somewhat muted due to the elevated volumes from the Hurricane Ian clean up in 2022."", ""Some of the recent quarters, residential collection volumes declined modestly due to our intentional shedding of low margin contracts as we work to ensure that we achieved acceptable returns for all parts of our business. You can see the benefits of this focus because while our residential collection volumes declined, total revenue and earnings in this line of business both improved. This is a winning equation and we'll continue to execute on the strategy in the year ahead. Organic revenue growth in all collection lines of business remains as positive and operating EBITDA continues to grow. In the fourth quarter, new business grew and net services increases remain firmly positive reflecting our quality of service and focused differentiation."", ""Looking ahead to 2024, our guidance anticipates collection and disposal volume approaching 1%, mirroring the performance achieved in 2023. And finally, I want to convey my appreciation to our frontline teams for their unwavering commitment to delivering safe and reliable service to our customers and communities on a daily basis. It's their efforts that made 2023 successful and laid the groundwork for growth in the years ahead. I will now turn the call over to Devina, to discuss our 2023 financial results and 2024 financial outlook in greater detail."", ""Devina A. Rankin: Thanks, John, and good morning. Cost optimization was a significant theme in the fourth quarter and throughout 2023. Our team was pleased that our collective focus delivered WM's best ever full-year SG&A as a percentage of revenue of 9.4%. The 20 basis point improvement from prior year was realized through investments in customer facing technology, leveraging enhanced back office systems to become more efficient and a continuous focus on optimizing our spend. We're pleased with the progress made to improve this measure, while at the same time investing in our talent, customer engagement channels and technology capabilities. SG&A optimization delivered 20 basis points of our 90 basis point expansion and adjusted operating EBITDA margin in 2023."", 'The remaining 70 basis points was from the collection and disposal business, which benefited from a combination of fuel price impacts and operating efficiencies. We gained meaningful traction in optimizing labor efficiency and repair and maintenance costs in our collection disposal business in the back half of the year, lifting our full-year adjusted operating EBITDA margin to 28.9%. This result is 30 basis points ahead of the high-end of our expectations and positions us to continue to deliver margin expansion in the year ahead. Our operating performance translated into robust cash flow in 2023. Our full-year cash flow from operations grew to $4.719 billion and our free cash flow before sustainability growth investments was nearly $2.7 billion.', 'Each of these cash flow measures finished the year near the high-end of our initial guidance range. This result demonstrates our strong earnings growth, effective management of interest and taxes and optimizing cash conversion and our disciplined capital expenditure management processes. During 2023, we returned $2.44 billion to shareholders, paying $1.14 billion in dividends and repurchasing $1.3 billion of our stock. In addition, we spent $173 million on traditional solid waste and recycling acquisitions to grow our business. We accomplished all of this while accelerating our sustainability growth investments for future growth and development and maintaining our targeted leverage ratio of about 2.75 times.

We expect these projects to contribute run rate adjusted operating EBITDA of about $800 million by the end of 2026. This outlook utilizes the same pricing assumptions we've used consistently, a $125 per ton for recycled commodities and $26 per MMBtu for renewable natural gas. We have a great deal of confidence in the value of the projects that are underway and we're enthusiastic about the strong complement they provide to our existing business."", ""In conclusion, 2023 has clearly illustrated that we are driving growth through our diligent focus on optimizing our business, investing in technology and automation, and growing our leadership and sustainability.

GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with DVA.', ""DaVita Inc (NYSE:DVA), a leading provider of dialysis services, has recently filed its 10-K report on February 14, 2024. The company operates over 3,000 facilities worldwide, predominantly in the U.S., and treats more than 240,000 patients annually. With a market capitalization of approximately $9.2 billion as of mid-2023, DaVita Inc stands as a significant player in the healthcare sector. The company's financial performance reflects its strong position, with a focus on government payers in the U.S. dialysis reimbursement landscape and a strategic push towards international expansion and integrated care offerings."", ""Market Leadership and Brand Reputation: DaVita Inc's commanding presence in the U.S. dialysis market, with over 35% market share, is a testament to its brand strength and operational excellence. The company's focus on clinical quality and innovation has cemented its reputation as a leader in kidney care. This market dominance is not only a competitive advantage but also provides economies of scale, enabling DaVita to negotiate favorable terms with suppliers and insurers."", ""Integrated Care Model: The company's patient-centric care models and value-based culture have led to the development of comprehensive care strategies. These strategies span from early diagnosis and prevention to end-of-life care, which enhances patient outcomes and satisfaction. DaVita's integrated approach positions it well to adapt to evolving healthcare demands and to capitalize on the growing trend towards holistic treatment plans."", 'Dependence on Government Reimbursement Rates: With two-thirds of U.S. sales tied to government reimbursement rates, primarily Medicare, DaVita Inc is susceptible to changes in healthcare policy and reimbursement schemes. This reliance can lead to financial volatility if government policies become unfavorable. Moreover, while commercial insurers account for a small percentage of U.S. patients, they contribute significantly to profits, indicating a potential vulnerability if insurer relationships are strained.', ""Regulatory Compliance Risks: The healthcare industry is highly regulated, and DaVita Inc's operations are no exception. The company's extensive regulatory environment requires significant resources to ensure compliance. Any failure to adhere to these regulations could result in severe penalties, including fines, loss of certifications, and exclusion from federal healthcare programs, which could materially impact the company's financial health and reputation."", ""International Expansion: DaVita Inc's international operations have shown steady growth, with 367 outpatient dialysis centers in 11 countries. This international footprint presents an opportunity for further expansion into new markets, leveraging the company's expertise and reputation to capture market share and diversify revenue streams beyond the U.S. market."", 'Innovation and Digital Health Ventures: Through DaVita Venture Group (DVG), the company is well-positioned to invest in digital health, pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and innovative care delivery models. These investments could lead to breakthroughs in kidney care, offering DaVita a chance to lead the market in new and emerging technologies and treatment modalities.', 'Intense Competition: The U.S. dialysis industry is highly competitive, with new entrants and established players vying for market share. DaVita Inc faces competition for acquisition targets, patients, and qualified personnel, which could affect its growth strategy and market position. The company must continuously innovate and maintain high-quality care to remain competitive.', ""Changing Healthcare Legislation: The healthcare industry is subject to frequent legislative changes, which can significantly impact DaVita Inc's operations. Changes in federal and state healthcare legislation or regulations could alter the reimbursement landscape, impose additional compliance costs, or restrict the company's business practices, potentially affecting its profitability and strategic direction."", 'In conclusion, DaVita Inc (NYSE:DVA) exhibits a robust market presence and brand reputation, underpinned by its integrated care model and strategic international expansion.

However, challenges such as a slowdown in residential activities, given high borrowing costs, weather-related impacts, and elevated labor costs, may hinder overall performance.Per the latest Earnings Trends report, the fourth-quarter earnings season has so far seen releases from approximately 70.7% of the construction sector’s market capitalization on the S&P 500 Index. Of them, the sector’s total earnings are down 2.5% from the year-ago period on 1.8% higher revenues, with 87.5% beating earnings per share (EPS) estimates and 62.5% beating revenue estimates.With the help of the Zacks Stock Screener, we have identified three construction stocks, namely\xa0 JELD-WEN Holding, Inc. JELD, Floor & Decor Holdings, Inc. FND and Vulcan Materials Company VMC, which are poised to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this earnings season.', ""The Construction sector's performance in the fourth quarter of 2023 showcases distinct trends across residential and non-residential segments.For residential-focused companies, challenges persist amidst higher mortgage rates and escalating costs of materials and labor. Consequently, these firms are expected to report lower earnings compared to the same period last year, reflecting softened demand due to higher mortgage rates. However, factors such as the enduring aspiration for home ownership, limited availability of existing homes, modest repair and remodeling activities, and a commitment to cost management contribute to sequential growth.Conversely, non-residential industry players stand to benefit from heightened demand for infrastructure solutions aimed at advancing energy transition and enhancing reliability, safety, and efficiency. Strong global trends in infrastructure modernization, energy transition, national security, and potential supply-chain investments bolster quarterly results. Additionally, investments in telecommunications networks, especially in 5G technologies, further support performance. Meanwhile, construction companies' business operations are susceptible to weather-related risks in the fourth quarter. Nonetheless, the extension of the construction season due to a mild winter this time is expected to contribute to the growth.Overall, prudent cost-saving measures, disciplined project management, robust funding programs, and increased demand for road repair and maintenance, coupled with strategic acquisitions, underpin the sector's performance. These actions have expanded geographical reach and product offerings, driving growth during the quarter."", 'The overall estimate picture is a mixed one for the broader Zacks Construction sector amid challenges associated with the soft residential market, weather-related headwinds, high expenses and labor constraints from the year-ago perspective. Per the latest Earnings Trends report, construction sector earnings are expected to inch up 0.4% for the fourth quarter. This indicates almost the same picture from the third quarter of 2023 growth of 0.9%. Revenues are projected to increase 3.6%, suggesting a deceleration from 5.4% growth registered in the prior quarter.', 'Given the headwinds, it is not easy to find stocks with the potential to trump earnings estimates.

Among them, 38% opted for Europe as their destination. Several European nations offer a high quality of life at affordable prices, making them attractive to US retirees.', 'The increasing living costs in the US are putting pressure on savings accounts, prompting concerns about securing a larger nest egg for retirement.

Excluding significant variances, earnings per share increased 6% over 2022, at the top end of our 2023 outlook.

In contrast, the select, large banks we own, including Wells Fargo & Company, actually saw deposit inflows and increasing profits, reinforcing our thesis that high-quality financial services companies remain among the most misunderstood and attractive sectors of the market. This stress test models a dramatic recession—one meaningfully worse than the great financial crisis of 2008-2009. It includes a 3.5% decline in gross domestic product, a 10% unemployment rate, a 37% decline in residential real estate, a 40% decline in commercial real estate and a 55% decline in the stock market. The resilience and strength required to weather such an economic storm combined with proven economies of scale in branding and technology should drive DNYVF market share gains and growth for years to come.

Dan?', 'Dan Houston: Thanks, Humphrey, and welcome to everyone on the call. This morning I will discuss key milestones and highlights from the fourth quarter and full year 2023 as we continue to execute our strategy with discipline and focus, and deliver strong results for our customers and shareholders. Deanna will follow with additional details of our results, the investment portfolio, our capital position, as well as our 2024 outlook. 2023 was a great year for Principal. We delivered on our ambitious outlook for the enterprise despite a wide range of macro issues, including significant geopolitical events and global inflation. These factors resulted in elevated market and interest rate volatility, which impacted investor risk appetite and increased allocations to cash and cash equivalents.', 'Our diversified and integrated business model continued to prove resilient despite these challenges and generated robust fourth quarter and full year results. Starting on slide three, we reported $1.6 billion of full year 2023 non-GAAP operating earnings or $6.55 per diluted share. Excluding significant variances, earnings per share increased 6% over 2022, at the top end of our 2023 outlook. Our strong capital position and full year free capital flow enabled us to deliver on our capital deployment strategy. We invested for growth in our businesses and returned more than $1.3 billion of capital to shareholders through share repurchase and common stock dividends, nearly 90% of net income excluding exited businesses. As shown on slide four, we reported $441 million of non-GAAP operating earnings or $1.83 per diluted share in the fourth quarter.', 'We ended 2023 with $695 billion of total company managed AUM, up over 9% from 2022. While markets were volatile throughout the year, they finished the year strong. Market performance and foreign currency tailwinds more than offset outflows on a full year basis. Adjusting for the large withdrawal as we discussed last quarter, we generated a positive $350 million of PGI institutional net cash flow in the fourth quarter, driven by real estate and fixed income flows. Retail net cash flow for us and the asset management industry remains challenged, as approximately $6 trillion of assets remain in money market funds or cash equivalents. We continue to benefit from diversification of distribution channels among institutional, retail, retirement, private assets and international geographies.', 'Our organic growth rate measured by net cash flow as a percentage of beginning of period assets has proven more resilient than our active management peers over the last 12 months. As interest rates retreat from their peak, we were well positioned with the right strategies as investors began to reallocate back into risk-based assets. The pipeline of committed yet unfunded real estate mandates remains strong, currently over $6 billion that we’ll put to work opportunistically. We continue to grow our in-house capabilities, including Principal alternative credit, our direct lending franchise that recently surpassed $2 billion in borrower commitments since we launched in 2020. We have generated an 11% IRR since inception and the current portfolio yield is 13%, making this a compelling offering for our clients.', 'This is yet another testament of our dedication to providing differentiated investment capabilities to clients across all asset classes. Turning to slide six, investment performance improved significantly across Morningstar rated funds and composites, particularly in our retirement-focused asset allocation strategies. While there have been some quarterly fluctuations, we’re focused on generating consistently strong long-term performance for our clients. In Principal International, we ended the quarter with a record $180 billion of total reported AUM. The increase was driven by a combination of market performance, foreign exchange tailwinds and over $2 billion of positive cash flows through 2023, evenly split between Latin America and Asia.', 'While the Asia economy continues to face headwinds, we are still confident about the region’s long-term potential. We welcomed a new President of Latin America in November, Pablo Sprenger. Pablo joins Principal with more than 20 years of industry experience, most recently as CEO of SURA Investments. His deep knowledge of our markets and the customer segments we serve will be valuable in driving growth across the region. Turning to U.S. Retirement, we generated strong growth in revenue and earnings in the fourth quarter. Our focus on revenue generation and continued expense discipline helped drive the full year margin above the top end of our guidance range, while we continue to invest for future growth. Business fundamentals remain very healthy.', 'We generated a strong growth in transfer deposits over the fourth quarter of 2022, including a 9% increase in fee-based and 36% increase in spread-based transfer deposits. These strong results were driven by growth in the retirement plan sales, as well as robust pension risk transfer sales, which exceeded targeted returns. Total RIS reoccurring deposits increased 12% over the year ago quarter, including a 14% increase in the SMB segment. This growth was primarily driven by an increase in participant deferrals and employer matches in retirement plans. While we were pleased to see plan lapses moderate in the fourth quarter, which is typically an active quarter for plan transitions and lineup changes, participant withdrawals increased over the year ago quarter.', 'All in, we saw significant improvement in account value net cash flow compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. For the full year, RIS sales increased 9% over 2022, driven by a 17% increase in fee-based transfer deposits and nearly $3 billion of pension risk transfer sales. We continue to leverage our favorable market position with a full suite of retirement and workplace solutions, and like the good momentum we’re seeing in our retirement platforms heading into 2024. In Specialty Benefits, record full year sales, as well as strong retention, employment and wage growth, contributed to a 9% growth in premium and fees over both the fourth quarter of 2022 and full year. Attractive segments within the SMB market remain underpenetrated and we are confident in our ability to serve these customers with a meaningful value proposition.', 'Sales in Specialty Benefits so far this year are tracking to our expectations, and importantly, retention is also strong. These factors give us confidence we will continue to grow faster than the market in 2024. In Life, premium and fees for the total block increased 5% over the fourth quarter of 2022, including a 26% increase in the business market segment. Our focus on the business market is resonating with distribution partners and has more than offset the runoff in our legacy retail block. I’m excited about the growth opportunities across Principal and remain confident that our focus on higher growth markets combined with our integrated product portfolio and important distribution partnerships will continue to create value for customers and shareholders.', 'At our core, we remain committed to providing individuals, businesses, communities and markets access to essential financial tools, products and guidance, and we see strong demand for our brand of expertise and support in today’s environment. Before turning it over to Deanna, I’d like to highlight an important recognition we received this quarter, included on slide five, along with other 2023 awards and recognition. For the 12th consecutive year, Principal Asset Management was once again named a Best Place to Work in Money Management by Pensions & Investments, earning this recognition every year since the inception of the award. Recognition like this helps us benchmark progress, attract and retain talent, and stand out in the marketplace.', 'I’d be remiss if I didn’t also take a moment to recognize Pat Halter, President of Principal Asset Management, who announced his retirement after 40 years with the company. I will miss Pat as a business leader and also as a very trusted advisor. I wish he and his family much success in the next phase of their life. He has guided Principal Asset Management through significant growth, including further diversification of its active, special investment capabilities into private markets and new geographies. I’d also like to congratulate Kamal Bhatia, who has assumed the role as President of Principal Asset Management. Kamal joined the company in 2019 as an industry veteran with significant experience in investment solutions, business strategy, client engagement and product development.', 'We close 2023 with momentum across our diverse portfolio businesses. Our success is a testament to the focus and hard work of our nearly 20,000 dedicated global employees. Their ongoing commitment to excellence and to our customers enabled us to seize opportunities and set the stage for future growth. Deanna?', 'Deanna Strable: Thanks, Dan. Good morning to everyone on the call. This morning, I’ll share the key contributors to our financial performance for the quarter and full year, updates on our investment portfolio, our current capital position, as well as details of our outlook for 2024. Full year reported net income was $623 million. Excluding exited business, net income was $1.5 billion for the full year with credit losses of $81 million. Fourth quarter net income, excluding exited business was $299 million with $27 million of credit losses. As a reminder, the income from exited business is non-economic and is driven by the change in the fair value of the funds withheld embedded derivative. It doesn’t impact our capital or free cash flow and can be extremely volatile quarter-to-quarter.', 'Full year credit drift and losses were modest and better than our expectations at the beginning of the year. Excluding significant variances, full year non-GAAP operating earnings was $1.7 billion or $6.92 per diluted share. This was a 6% increase in EPS over 2022 at the top end of our 3% to 6% outlook and included $436 million in the fourth quarter or $1.81 per diluted share. As detailed on slide 24, significant variances impacted fourth quarter non-GAAP operating earnings by a net positive $5 million on both a pre-tax and after-tax basis and $0.02 per diluted share. The significant variances included strong encaje performance largely offset by lower variable investment income. Looking at macroeconomics in the fourth quarter, the S&P 500 daily average was slightly higher than the third quarter of 2023 and 16% higher than the fourth quarter of 2022.', 'While the S&P 500 Index increased 24% from the end of 22, the daily average increased just 4% from the 2022 daily average. In addition, the S&P 500 performed better than mid-cap, small-cap and international equities, as well as fixed income and alternatives. Relative to our 2023 outlook, the daily average increase was lower than our typical 6% price appreciation assumption, but it was higher than expected heading into the year. Foreign exchange rates were a headwind relative to the third quarter, but a tailwind compared to the fourth quarter of 2022 and on a trailing 12-month basis. Margins across the enterprise remained strong as we took actions to reduce expenses to align with revenue, while investing for growth and increasing scalability.', 'On a full year basis, compensation and other expenses increased modestly over 2022 despite elevated severance expense of $20 million in the fourth quarter and $30 million for the full year. Turning to the business units, the following comments exclude significant variances and demonstrate our ability to meet or exceed most of our 2023 guidance ranges. Starting with RIS, fourth quarter pre-tax operating earnings were very strong and increased 22% over the fourth quarter of 2022 driven by growth in the business and strong revenue retention, higher net investment income and favorable markets. Full year net revenue growth of 4% and the 39% margin were at the high end of our guided ranges. Our focus on profitable revenue growth is paying off and was aided by favorable macroeconomic impacts.', 'PGI’s pre-tax margin of 35% for the full year was within our guided range, a strong result compared to many of our peers, reflecting disciplined expense management, while navigating a pressured revenue environment. PGI’s full year revenue growth was slightly below our guided range given the market volatility, as well as the industry trend of money moving to money market funds in 2023. At $34 million for the full year, performance fees ended the year in line with our outlook despite a pressured real estate market. This compares to a very strong year in 2022, which had $70 million. Performance fees are dependent on market conditions as to when we can optimize alpha generation in the portfolio. Principal International ended the year strong with full year revenue growth of 9%, a 32% margin and an 11% increase in pre-tax operating earnings over 2022.', 'Results benefited from growth in the business, higher AUM, positive net cash flow and foreign currency tailwinds. Both revenue growth and margin were within our guided ranges. Specialty Benefits continued to deliver in 2023 with a 9% growth in premium and fees, a 15% margin and a 17% increase in pre-tax operating earnings compared to full year 2022. This was fueled by another year of record sales, strong retention and employment and wage growth, as well as a more favorable loss ratio. All of our metrics for specialty benefits were within our guided ranges. In Life, growth in premium and fees was within our guided range as our focus on business solutions is outpacing the roll-off of the legacy block. Margin was slightly below our guided range primarily due to lower net investment income as we right-sized the assets backing the business post-transaction.', 'Shifting to our investment portfolio, it remains high quality, aligned with our liability profile and well-positioned for a variety of economic conditions. We revalued the office real estate portfolio again in the fourth quarter as we have done quarterly throughout 2023. The commercial mortgage loan portfolio remains healthy. The average loan-to-value of 49% increased modestly throughout 2023, as we expected while the debt service coverage ratio remained stable at 2.5 times, reflecting the quality of our portfolio and our disciplined investment approach. Specific to our office exposure in the CML portfolio, there were 10 loans that matured in 2023, reducing our office loan exposure by 12%. All loans were paid off and resolved. We did not have any loan extensions or foreclosures in 2023.', 'Looking at the 2024 office maturities, the underlying metrics are generally strong, with an average loan-to-value of 66% and debt service coverage ratio of 3.8 times. We only have one maturity in the first quarter and it paid off in January. We’re actively managing and remain confident in the outcome of the remaining 10 maturities, eight of which are slated for the second half of the year. Turning to capital and liquidity, we ended the year in a very strong position, with $1.7 billion of excess and available capital, including approximately $935 million at the holding company, which is above our $800 million targeted level, $375 million in our subsidiaries and $375 million in excess of our targeted 400% risk-based capital ratio, which was 427% at the end of the year.', 'Our capital position and free cash flow reflect robust fourth quarter results and actions we took to increase capital efficiency, including the establishment of an affiliated Bermuda reinsurance entity and the closure of certain guaranteed retirement products in Hong Kong. Combined, these actions freed up more than $200 million of capital in the fourth quarter. On a full year basis, we delivered 100% free capital flow conversion, including organic generation within our 75% to 85% targeted range. As shown on slide three, we returned $1.3 billion to shareholders in 2023, including $700 million of share repurchases and $625 million of common stock dividends. This included more than $400 million of capital returned to shareholders in the fourth quarter, with approximately $250 million of share repurchases and $160 million of common stock dividends.', 'Last night we announced a $0.69 common stock dividend payable in the first quarter, a $0.02 increase from the dividend paid in the fourth quarter and in line with our targeted 40% dividend payout ratio. This demonstrates our confidence in continued growth and overall performance. We remain focused on maintaining our capital and liquidity targets at both the life company and the holding company, and will continue a balanced and disciplined approach to capital deployment. Turning to our outlook for 2024, starting on slide 13, we are well positioned to deliver on our enterprise long-term financial targets in 2024, with 9% to 12% growth in earnings per share and 75% to 85% free capital flow conversion. In regards to EPS, benefits from growth in the business, favorable macroeconomic tailwinds and higher share repurchases are expected to more than offset continued pressure on real estate, Asia and a higher effective tax rate.', 'Our higher growth, higher return and more capital efficient portfolio will continue to drive an increase in return on equity and we expect to achieve our 14% to 16% targeted range in 2025. We remain committed to returning excess capital to shareholders and are targeting $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion of capital deployments in 2024. This includes $800 million to $1.1 billion of share repurchases and a 40% dividend payout ratio. Our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase authorization for $1.5 billion. This is in addition to nearly $300 million remaining under the prior authorization at the end of the year. Our guidance assumes run rate variable investment income. As usual, we’ll quantify the impacts to reported results from higher or lower than expected variable investment income as a significant variance on our earnings calls throughout the year.', 'Slide 21 provides details of our alternative investments. Our portfolio is more heavily weighted to real estate, with a smaller allocation to private equity and hedge funds. Variable investment income is difficult to predict, but if the current macro environment persists throughout 2024, we expect continued pressure on prepayment fees and real estate returns. Turning to our business units, our outlook for 2024 is grounded in our long-term guidance. We included some modeling considerations on slide 14, noting where we expect to perform on an adjusted basis relative to our targeted long-term ranges. In RIS, benefits from macroeconomic tailwinds and growth in the business are expected to drive revenue growth at the high end or slightly above our long-term guidance, and margin at the upper end of our range.', 'In PGI, revenue growth is expected to be at the lower end of our long-term guidance, as benefits from market tailwinds are partially offset by continued pressure on real estate revenue and impacts from recent redemptions. In Principal International, margin is expected to be in line with 2023 and we’re expecting low single-digit revenue growth, reflecting the impact of foreign currency translation and continued macro headwinds in Asia. While the closure of the guaranteed retirement products will impact revenue and earnings in Asia, Latin America is expected to continue to deliver strong earnings growth. In benefits and protection, we expect favorable loss ratios and Specialty Benefits to persist in 2024 and expect to be toward the lower half of our long-term range.', 'The margin for Life Insurance is expected to be slightly below the long-term range but improve from 2023. Before opening for questions, I want to remind you of a few seasonality impacts. In PGI, the first quarter is typically our lowest quarter for earnings due to the seasonality of deferred compensation and elevated payroll taxes. And in Specialty Benefits, dental claims are typically higher in the first half of the year. These factors contribute to the pattern of free capital flow, which is typically lightest in the first quarter and increases throughout the year. We have good momentum as we start 2024 with a strong capital position and we are well positioned to deliver on our long-term financial targets. We are grounded in our growth drivers of retirement, asset management, and benefits and protection and executing on a strategy focused on continuing to drive long-term shareholder value.', 'This concludes our prepared remarks.

According to the report, motor vehicle premiums surged by a staggering 20.3% in December 2023 from a year earlier in December 2022. This has been the largest increase in motor vehicle insurance premiums since the mid-70s. Auto insurance premiums are primarily rising due to the inflating cost of labor and car parts supported by the general expansion of car prices over the past few years. According to the report, auto insurance policies may not see an unexpected surge over the next 12 months. The report highlights that auto insurance prices have rarely contributed to the rise in inflation in the past. On the contrary, auto insurance prices were responsible for 15% of headline price increases in the fourth quarter of 2023. However, the impact auto insurance prices may have on the monetary policy over the next 12 months is rather ambiguous.

The company's financial performance reflects a solid foundation, with a market capitalization of $24,527.2 million as of June 30, 2023.

This dominance is further cemented by long-term contracts, such as those with military bases, providing stable and regulated-like returns."", ""Financial Stability: The company's financial tables reveal a strong balance sheet, with significant cash from the sale of its New York subsidiary and a market capitalization that reflects investor confidence. AWK's ability to generate consistent revenue streams from its regulated markets provides financial stability and the capacity to invest in infrastructure and growth initiatives."", ""Regulatory Constraints: AWK operates in a highly regulated environment, where decisions by governmental and regulatory bodies can significantly impact rates, capital structure, and investment returns.

In addition, the interest rate payable in cash on the secured seller note has increased from 7.00% per year to 10.00% per year until maturity, in recognition of higher market interest rates and removal of American Water’s right to require early repayment of the note. The maturity date of the amended note of December 9, 2026, remains unchanged. The increased interest income is expected to approximate $0.10 per share per year through the note’s maturity.', 'Dividends', 'On December 6, 2023, the company’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend payment of $0.7075 per share of common stock payable on March 1, 2024, to shareholders of record as of February 8, 2024.', '2023 Fourth Quarter and Year-End Earnings Conference Call', 'The conference call to discuss the fourth quarter and year-end 2023 earnings, 2024 EPS guidance, and affirmation of long-term targets will take place on Thursday, February 15, 2024, at 9 a.m. Eastern Standard Time.

In Coca-Cola and PepsiCo's latest quarterly results, the soft drink makers are seeing a drop in volume sold in North America thanks to ongoing price hikes. But overall consumer sentiment remains strong."", 'For more on beverage trends and the overall health of the US consumer, we\'re joined by Duane Stanford, who is the ""Beverage Digest"" Editor and Publisher. Duane, great to have you here with us this morning. I mean, if there\'s one common denominator that you\'re seeing in some of the reports that are coming out from these major consumer packaged goods and beverage-- food and beverage companies, what would that be?', ""DUANE STANFORD: Right now, everyone's waiting to see exactly what happens with the consumer-- how much consumers are pressured by the economy. We've got a real bifurcation between the top end of the spectrum on the income level and the lower end. The lower end is the one that would be most concerning. That's where you would start to have some impacts to either volume sales and also the ability to price, you know, your beverages. So companies are generally feeling optimistic about what's going to happen as the year progresses. But it's something that everyone's watching very closely."", ""RACHELLE AKUFFO: And as you-- there's always this want to compare Pepsi with Coca-Cola. Pepsi, obviously, broader in the snack space versus the more pure play with beverages for Coca-Cola here. How do you think we should be looking at those two brands?"", ""DUANE STANFORD: Yeah. I think that's something that people don't always quite grasp when they're looking at these companies. When they're on the store aisle, I mean, they're battling it out every single day. And the frontline workers are going at each other tooth and nail."", ""But when you look at the companies as a whole, they have very different strategies. PepsiCo, a huge part of its business-- half its business is in snacks. And that's a very profitable part of their business. So they're looking to always make sure they can maximize investments in the snack business."", ""And so a lot of times what they're doing is balancing those investments with what they do on the beverage side. So, you know, that sometimes leads to decisions when it comes to how much share they're willing to try to take by lowering prices. On the Coke side, on the other hand, they are a beverage play."", ""That's their primary-- that is the category they compete in. And so they have just a very different investment profile. That's why you often see situations where Coke is leading on share. PepsiCo is falling behind on share at times. And they're constantly trying to get that level right as it compares to snacks. So it's something to really keep in mind when you look at those two companies in terms of how they compete."", ""BRAD SMITH: Yeah. Spot on, Duane. And I'm sure many Americans consumed multiple snacks last week for the Super Bowl, I mean, myself included. Consumers right now, though, we're complaining that packaged goods are-- they're getting smaller. And shrinkflation is real. And it's certainly caught the attention of many Americans, including one of the Americans at the top of the totem pole, President Biden. Take a look at what he had to say about shrinkflation, and we'll get your reaction on the other side."", ""JOE BIDEN: When buying snacks for the game, you might have noticed one thing-- sports drinks bottles are smaller. A bag of chips has fewer chips, but they're still charging you just as much. I've had enough of what they call shrinkflation. It's a ripoff."", ""BRAD SMITH: So there's shrinkflation, and then there's, perhaps, another thread of the mind of profit-led inflation as well here. I mean, where do we toss this one up? Where does it settle?"", ""DUANE STANFORD: I mean, this is something that the food and beverage companies have dealt with going back well over a decade, even during the Great Recession. PepsiCo, particularly, because they have such a large snack business, which is typically a place where you're going to find more of that sort of pricing strategy-- instead of raising the price of the shelf, you take more out of the bag in order to equalize that and make it easier, especially for lower income consumers-- that's something that they've had to contend with for some time, the backlash against that."", ""We just came off a period of extreme pricing growth across all food and beverage. Beverages and snacks were included in that. That pricing is starting to subside. And EEO companies, as part of their strategy, are going to use that as a mix. They're going to do it. They're not going to stop."", ""It's really all about, how do you communicate that? And how do you make sure that you're not going too far at any given time to really turn those consumers against your brands?"", ""RACHELLE AKUFFO: And speaking of that, Duane, I want to talk about just a potential trend that you see for the year. There's always some, no pun intended, flavor of the month here. What do you see as being a top theme that some of these beverages, both alcoholic and non-alcoholic, will be leaning into?"", ""DUANE STANFORD: Yeah. I mean, one of the things for carbonated soft drinks has been flavors. Flavors are overindexed with young consumers, Gen Z consumers, multicultural consumers. So that's really been a real part-- important part of the industry. It's about a third of carbonated soft drink sales on a dollar basis in the US-- things like root beer, orange, lemon lime, root beer."", ""So that's a pretty important trend. And of course, zero sugar is extremely important. The companies like Coca-Cola and PepsiCo are really leaning into their zero sugar cola products, and also turning most of their beverages, making sure that all of them have some sort of zero sugar offering for consumers who want that as an option. So those are two big things that we're seeing right now, for sure."", 'BRAD SMITH: I\'m learning a lot about my co-host right now, Duane. She just Slacked me and said she does not like root beer. I love root beer. Duane, we\'ll get your take on this perhaps next time we have back on. Duane Stanford, ""Beverage Digest"" editor and publisher, thanks so much for taking the time.']"

Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure.I will now turn it over to Chuck."", 'Charles H. Robbins', ""Thanks, Sami, and thank you all for joining us today. We delivered a solid Q2 performance with revenue coming in at the high end of our guidance range. Strong operating leverage across our business drove our margins, which exceeded the high end of our expectations and allowed us to deliver better-than-anticipated earnings per share. In Q2, we once again returned a total of $2.8 billion in value through dividends and share repurchases.We also announced today another increase to Cisco's dividend payout rate, reaffirming our ongoing commitment to returning significant value to our shareholders through consistent capital returns. Overall, our Q2 results continue to advance our strategic business transformation around driving higher levels of software subscriptions and annualized recurring revenue or ARR, both of which showed performance gains in the quarter.Our pending acquisition of Splunk also further supports our transformation strategy by fueling stronger growth, expanding our portfolio of software-based solutions and generating higher levels of ARR with roughly $4 billion in additional ARR expected upon closing and will make us one of the largest software companies in the world.Before turning to our performance in the quarter, I'd like to start by commenting on the demand environment. First, in terms of the macro environment, we are seeing a greater degree of caution and scrutiny of deals given the high level of uncertainty. As we're hearing this from our customers, it's leading us to be more cautious with our forecast and expectations. Second, as we discussed last quarter and subsequently saw in other technology provider results, customers have been taking time since the start of our fiscal 2024 to deploy the elevated levels of products shipped to them in recent quarters, and this is taking longer than our initial expectations. Third, we also continue to see weak demand with our telco and cable service provider customers. This industry has seen significant pressure, and they are adjusting deployment phasing, which is weighing on our business outlook.Given these factors, we are adjusting our expenses and investments to reflect the current environment. That said, for the product categories in which we can measure customer inventory absorption through connections to the cloud, we are seeing steady progress. However, based on conversations with customers, we still believe we are 1 to 2 quarters away from full implementation of their inventory, which, as I mentioned, is longer than we expected. We continue to track Meraki activations, which are moving slightly faster in wireless and slightly slower in switching. Using our Meraki business as a proxy for our wider enterprise networking portfolio, we expect the current implementation of shipped products to be broadly complete by the end of fiscal 2024.Looking at our wireless business as an example, we are encouraged by the number of orders of $1 million or more, which increased approximately 50% sequentially in Q2. This indicates that many wireless customers have finished absorbing what we've shipped to them and are preparing for larger deployments in the coming months. Our team is also partnering closely with customers to assist with this heightened focus on deployments of Cisco equipment on hand, contributing to our services revenue increase year-over-year. It's also worth noting that nonhardware-centric revenue in areas such as Security and Collaboration increased, and our Observability offerings grew double digits year-over-year. Finally, despite the near-term challenges, our win rates are stable and on a rolling 4-quarter basis, our market share remained steady in 3 of our 4 largest markets.Now moving on to our performance in Q2. As I mentioned earlier, our performance in the quarter was broadly in line with or better than our Q2 expectations. Given the trust our customers place in us and the criticality of our technologies to the outcomes our customers are seeking, I am confident about the foundational strength of our portfolio and our future growth opportunities. With our innovation, we deliver and enable our customers to deploy next-generation applications in a highly secure manner.As part of this, we help facilitate their growth through our products and services so that when our customers adopt new technologies, we grow alongside them. We continue to accelerate our innovation across high-growth areas. Last week at Cisco Live EMEA, we announced new capabilities in networking, furthering our vision for the Cisco Networking Cloud. We also announced several new capabilities across our Security, Collaboration and Observability portfolios, leveraging AI throughout.We also continue to capitalize on the multibillion-dollar AI infrastructure opportunity. This quarter, we announced the next phase in our partnership with NVIDIA to offer enterprises simplified, cloud-based and on-prem AI infrastructure. This includes both networking hardware and software to support advanced AI workloads. We are clear beneficiaries of AI adoption, and this partnership further demonstrates the central role we play in AI and the overall technology ecosystem. Our combined solution will be sold through our extensive global channel with professional services and support from key partners who are committed to helping businesses deploy their GPU clusters via Ethernet infrastructure.In webscale, we continue to see momentum with 3 of the top 4 customers deploying our hyperscale Ethernet AI fabric, leveraging Cisco-validated designs for AI infrastructure. While there is tremendous opportunity ahead, we are still in the early stages of adoption of AI workloads.In Security, we continue to execute against our product road map to deliver the industry's most comprehensive unified platform with end-to-end solutions. This quarter, we introduced Cisco Identity Intelligence, an analytics layer that pulls data from identity infrastructure and performs behavior-based assessments to help protect against identity-based attacks, which are at the forefront of cyber threats today. AI is also becoming more pervasive across the Cisco Security Cloud. For example, our new AI Assistant and Secure Access lets customers create security access policies using natural language prompts, reducing errors and speeding up policy administration by 70%. Our new security solutions like XDR and Secure Access are ramping quickly after being launched this fall with now over 230 Cisco XDR customers. Over the next 6 months, you can expect more meaningful announcements across the portfolio through our accelerated organic innovation and inorganic investments.In addition, we have now extended our AI-powered ThousandEyes into Cisco Secure Access, joining past integrations with AppDynamics, Webex, Catalyst and Meraki platforms. ThousandEyes allows our customers to understand the digital experience of users, applications and things through billions of daily measurements of the Internet and public SaaS as well as thousands of enterprise customers, creating best-in-class digital experiences for users.In Observability, we introduced the Cisco Digital Experience Monitoring application, providing deep insights into the performance of browser and mobile applications and efficient resolution of session-level issues. Our continued generative AI innovations build upon our existing platform capabilities, further enabling operations teams to focus on what matters most: minimizing tools for all, improving overall performance and delivering highly secure digital experiences.Going back to the pending Splunk acquisition, the combination of Splunk's complementary capabilities with ours and AI, Security and Observability will create an end-to-end data platform to enhance our customers' digital resiliency. We are excited that together, we will bring trusted innovation leadership, an outstanding go-to-market engine and a world-class culture that will help our customers achieve their technology outcomes with innovative products and solutions.I would also like to provide a brief update on timing. While the closing of the acquisition of Splunk remains subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions, given the positive progress to date on the required regulatory approvals, we now expect to close the transaction late in the first quarter or early in the second quarter of calendar year 2024, which is in our fiscal third quarter.Before I turn it over to Scott, let me summarize 3 key takeaways. First, we have reset our expectations for the second half of the year given the cautious macro environment, our customers absorbing high levels of inventory and ongoing weakness in service provider. Second, you can count on us to take a disciplined approach regardless of the environment. We remain committed to operating leverage, capital allocation and expense management. Lastly, our portfolio continues to get stronger and stronger every day. While we have work in front of us and despite the current environment, we remain confident in our long-term strategy. We are relentlessly focused on our commitment to driving long-term value for our shareholders and industry-leading innovation for our customers.I'll now turn it over to Scott to provide more detail on the quarter and our outlook."", 'Richard Scott Herren', ""Thanks, Chuck. Our Q2 results reflect solid execution again with strong margins and increasing operating leverage. For the quarter, total revenue was at the high end of our guidance range at $12.8 billion, down 6% year-over-year. Non-GAAP net income was $3.5 billion, down 3%, and non-GAAP earnings per share was above the high end of our guidance range at $0.87, down 1%.Looking at our Q2 revenue in more detail, total product revenue was $9.2 billion, down 9%, and service revenue was $3.6 billion, up 4%. Networking, our largest product category, was down 12%. We saw declines across switching, wireless and routed optical networking driven primarily by weakness in the enterprise and service provider and cloud markets.Security was up 3% with our Zero Trust offering growing double digits. Collaboration was up 3% driven by growth in collaboration devices and calling partially offset by a decline in meetings. Observability was up 16% driven by growth across the portfolio with continued strength in ThousandEyes network services. As Chuck mentioned, ThousandEyes helps monitor and assure digital experience everywhere, on-premise, Internet and the cloud.We continue to make progress on our transformation to more recurring revenue-based offerings. We saw strong performance in our ARR of $24.7 billion, which increased 6%, with product ARR growth of 9%. Total software revenue was flat at $4.2 billion, with software subscription revenue up 5%. 88% of our software revenue was subscription-based.Total subscription revenue increased 6% to $6.4 billion, which now represents 50% of Cisco's total revenue, an increase of 6 percentage points over last year. RPO was $35.7 billion, up 12% year-over-year. Product and service RPO both increased 12%. In total, short-term RPO was $17.9 billion, up 6%. Q2 product orders declined 12%, a significant improvement from Q1 as customers continue to work down product shipments from prior quarters.Looking at our geographic segments year-over-year, the Americas was down 10%, EMEA down 8%, and APJC was down 27%. In our customer markets, service provider and cloud was down 40%, enterprise was down 6%, and public sector was down 5%. Backlog at the end of Q2 has now returned to normal levels.Total non-GAAP gross margin came in at 66.7% up 280 basis points year-over-year and above the high end of our guidance range. Product gross margin was 65.2%, up 310 basis points. The improvement was driven primarily by lower freight and component costs and favorable product mix partially offset by negative impact on pricing. Service gross margin was 70.5%, up 140 basis points.Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 33%, up 50 basis points and exceeding the high end of our guidance range. Strong non-GAAP gross margin and continued cost management drove the leverage.Further, we are realigning our investments and expenses to reflect the current environment to help maximize long-term value for our shareholders. As part of our announced restructuring plan, we expect to impact approximately 5% of our global workforce with estimated pretax charges of approximately $800 million.Shifting to the balance sheet. We ended Q2 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $25.7 billion. Consistent with our expectations, operating cash flow was $800 million driven in large part by the timing of federal tax payments and the higher annual payment of the TCJA transition tax.This quarter, we returned $2.8 billion to shareholders comprised of $1.6 billion for our quarterly cash dividend and $1.3 billion of share repurchases. Year-to-date, we have returned $5.7 billion in value to shareholders, and we plan to continue our share repurchases at the current quarterly level throughout fiscal 2024. Increasing shareholder returns through greater operating leverage, maintaining a higher level of annual share repurchases and growing our dividend is consistent with our capital allocation strategy.Given the confidence we have in our business today, we announced we are raising our dividend by $0.01 to $0.40 per quarter. This dividend increase demonstrates our commitment to returning a minimum of 50% of free cash flow annually to our shareholders and our confidence in the strength of our ongoing cash flows.To summarize, we executed well with continued strong margins and increased operating leverage as we help our customers complete record deployments and implementations. We continue to progress our business model shift to more recurring revenue. We are strategically investing in innovation to capitalize on our growth opportunities and are committed to delivering long-term shareholder value.With regard to our proposed acquisition of Splunk, we continue to work through regulatory approvals and closing conditions and as Chuck mentioned, we're optimistic that it will close ahead of what we had originally anticipated. We have not included any impact from the Splunk acquisition in our forward-looking guidance.Turning to our guidance. As previously mentioned, we have reset our expectations for the second half of the year to account for the caution around macro uncertainty, the continued absorption by our customers of record levels of product shipments they received from us and the weakness of our service provider market. For Q3, our guidance is as follows. We expect revenue to be in the range of $12.1 billion to $12.3 billion. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 66% to 67%. Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range of 33.5% to 34.5%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.84 to $0.86.For fiscal year '24, our guidance is as follows. We expect revenue to be in the range of $51.5 billion to $52.5 billion. Non-GAAP earnings per share guidance is expected to range from $3.68 to $3.74. In both our Q3 and full year guidance, we're assuming a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 19%. Sami, let's now move into the Q&A."", 'Ahmed Sami Badri', 'Thank you, Scott. (Operator Instructions) Operator, can we move to the first analyst in the queue?', 'Operator', 'Amit Daryanani with Evercore.', 'Amit Jawaharlaz Daryanani', ""I'll ask both my questions upfront. Chuck, when I think about the lower revenue guide for the full year by about 500 basis points versus 90 days ago, can you just touch on how much of that do you think is the digestion getting extended versus the macro versus the telco weakness? And then how do you sort of think about getting back to a positive revenue cadence organically?And then as a follow-up, I'd love to just understand this, in media announcement you folks had, there's a bit of a perception that it's more about servers, less about networking. I would love for you to just flesh that out, what that means to Cisco."", 'Charles H. Robbins', ""Amit, thank you very much. So obviously, with the lower guide, we talked about the feeling that there's some macro uncertainty. We talked to our teams in preparation for this, and they obviously submitted their forecast. And what we really saw was what they previously told us 90 days ago relative to the second half versus what they told us a couple of weeks ago had changed materially, which means customers are pushing things out and putting a little more scrutiny on them. So that's the difference that we've seen.As far as trying to break down what percentage comes from each of those -- the 3, including the digestion issue as well as the telco and SP piece, I think it's pretty difficult to do, honestly. However, I will say that we think that the consumption of the elevated inventory levels should be -- we should be through that by the end of our fiscal year. We think that the SP telcos -- the SP telco and cable side of it, we're hopeful that in '25, they will begin investing again. We originally had anticipated that they would begin to invest in the second half of this year, and we no longer believe that to be true.And I think that -- so I think the consumption issue and the SP thing -- or the consumption issue is temporary through the end of the year. The macro thing is one that we're going to have to wait and see and the SP telco probably similarly. And all of these things led us obviously to reset the second half of the year.On the NVIDIA partnership, it is definitely Ethernet. I was in the meeting when we first talked about this with Jensen, and he agreed that we would include our Ethernet technology with their GPUs and creating the stack. There will also be servers as well, and there'll be multiple versions of this over time. So -- but it will include our Ethernet technology when they're connecting multiple clusters."", 'Operator', 'Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley.', 'Meta A. Marshall', ""Maybe you've mentioned service provider, but I guess -- just getting a sense of whether you're seeing more weakness on data center or edge or if it comes to kind of the 5 investment priorities that you had noted that enterprises had a couple of quarters ago. Are any one of those areas still getting prioritized significantly versus not getting prioritized significantly? And then just maybe as a second question, how are you seeing enterprises think about AI and think about where the budgets for AI are coming from? Just any commentary would be helpful there."", 'Charles H. Robbins', ""Yes. Thanks, Meta. So I would say that what we do see customers investing in is clearly cybersecurity. We see Observability as you saw the 16% growth rate. We even saw Collaboration positive this quarter, which was a good sign. They are at various phases of still dealing with this hybrid work situation. We had a very strong quarter with our devices, our video device businesses.We see customers investing in their customer experience through technologies like contact center. And so we see a lot of that. We see customers continuing to invest in their application rearchitecture, which leads to both Observability opportunities as well as the re-architecture of their networks to deal with the traffic flows that we've been talking about for a couple of years. I think the real issue right now is that we ship so much networking in our core business that, that's where the challenge is, that they're just trying to get all that implemented right now.As it relates to the enterprise and how they're thinking about AI, what I would tell you is that over the last 90 days, we began to see the pipeline for AI use cases in the enterprise began to emerge. And there's heavy work going on in financial services. I would say it's early in what they're trying to think through, but we are seeing opportunities arise. And I think that there have been some comments, not enough for me to translate this to a massive trend, but there were some comments from some of our field teams that they see customers holding budget back just to be ready to expend it on AI once they get their strategy fully baked. So that's about what I could tell you at this point."", 'Operator', 'David Vogt with UBS.', 'David Vogt', ""So maybe I just want to step back for a second, Chuck, and maybe for Scott also. If I look at your guide for this year, I mean, we're basically back to fiscal '19 revenue levels. So I'm just trying to think about how your longer-term model works in the context of that 5% to 7% guide that you laid out at the investor briefing a number of years ago as sort of customers digest product.Obviously, it would suggest that maybe there's some more share loss going on in the core networking portfolio, given some of the other parts of the business has grown. So I just want to kind of try to get a sense of how you're thinking about the portfolio today, given we're kind of back to fiscal '19. And then from a profitability standpoint, obviously, you've done a tremendous job, and I would imagine the cost cutting goes along those lines to keep margins higher. But is there an opportunity to use margin and maybe price going forward to take back some of the share if there's a disruption in the market by a potential strategic transaction in the marketplace today?"", 'Richard Scott Herren', ""Yes. David, I'll start and then Chuck, you can chime in on share. The way to think about the 5% to 7%, if you go back to when we gave that metric, you remember, it was in 2021, actually pre all of the supply chain volatility that we've seen. And since then, of course, we've seen the supply chain set in, which caused a spike in product orders and then a subsequent big building up of our backlog. As we cleared the backlog, we saw a spike in revenue. And so it's been difficult to look at year-on-year compares as all those dynamics were going on.What we're seeing now is as we've cleared the backlog, and we cleared it very quickly, given the strength of our supply chain team, that bottleneck has just moved downstream. So I don't think you can look at this year's revenue and try to somehow compare it to historical because of all the moving parts underneath the covers. What underpinned that 5% to 7% when we gave it to you was that's the aggregated growth of the TAM of the markets that we play in, right? And so at this point, we still see that as the longer term where we're headed.I think looking at year-on-year growth rates, I don't think you're going to see those growth rates begin to normalize until we work through the inventory that's in the field right now, which is one of the biggest headwinds we've got, right? And then we can get back to regular ordering and then you need to lap that, right? You need to go 4 quarters out to be able to compare it to a more normalized point. So I think that's the way you need to think about that longer term. But there's no change at this point. We'll update the longer-term model after we finish the acquisition of Splunk and can give you better insight into what we look like as a combined company."", 'Charles H. Robbins', 'Yes. David, on the share loss, I think if you look at the -- just look at the last published reports that came out after Q...', 'Richard Scott Herren', '3, calendar.', 'Charles H. Robbins', ""Calendar Q3, in our 4 largest markets -- so if you take campus switching, you take wireless and you take SP routing, we actually gained share. So I don't know where the share loss thesis is coming from. When you look at data center switching, you will see it show up as a share loss. But to be -- we have to understand that one of our major competitors there reports their webscale sales into data center switching, and we report our webscale sales into SP routing. So those turn into sort of apples and oranges categories. But the others, based on the last reports that were put out, we actually have gained share if you look at a rolling 4 quarter even over the last 3 years."", 'Operator', 'Simon Leopold with Raymond James.', 'Simon Matthew Leopold', ""I've got an easy one and a little bit harder one. I'll start with the easy one and then ask the other. It just looks like your order trajectory is getting somewhat better. So the orders this quarter, down 12%, not too bad. And I know you don't forecast orders, but maybe if you can talk about when you expect orders could turn positive again, given the comparison and the trend.The other question I wanted to see if you could discuss how you envision the AI clusters in terms of will the webscale operators choose multiple vendors in a single cluster or will they designate maybe different data centers to different suppliers? Or will they mix and match? How do you see the split playing out, particularly in the hyperscale opportunity? And I really mean this more longer term, '25, '26, not currently when we're dominated by InfiniBand, but when Ethernet starts taking more share."", 'Charles H. Robbins', ""Yes. Thanks, Simon. So on the order trajectory, I think what -- we clearly don't guide bookings. But what I would tell you is that even as our teams modified their second half outlook, the second half will still be more favorable than the first half. So your assessment of sort of the trajectory, I think, is valid, and I'll leave it at that.On the AI clusters, I think it's a good question because what you'll hear is us and competitors talking about a number of webscale players that are using our technology underneath GPUs, our Ethernet technology underneath GPUs. And so I think it's important to remember they always tend to have a dual vendor strategy. They always want 2 sources. And so we're both actually -- the 2 of us are actually playing in this space today. And I'd say today, they're completely homogenous clusters. And I think it's too early to tell whether there will be some benefit over time for them to mix those. My sense is, unless there's something that changes significantly or there's some sort of technology reason for GPUs to be mixed, which I can't speak to at this point, I don't think the underlying network will be mixed. I just don't think there's any benefit for them to do that."", 'Operator', 'Tal Liani with Bank of America.', 'Tal Liani', ""I have 2 questions. The first one is Security. The market is great. And we met 2 years ago and 3 years ago when you spoke about new strategy and going to market, but it's still only growing 3%. What is happening there? And what can you do to fix Security and benefit from this market growth? And then maybe I'll ask my follow-up."", 'Charles H. Robbins', ""Okay. Thanks, Tal. So I think over the last few quarters, I've been pretty consistent that we thought the second half of this fiscal year, we would start to see an acceleration of Security, and I can give you some highlights where we are seeing some of that -- some green shoots early. Some of the new innovation like XDR and Secure Access, Multicloud Defense suites are -- we're seeing good pipeline build with those technologies.XDR, we now -- we announced that in April of last year, we shipped it in August, and we have 230 customers, 230-plus customers on the platform today. And the important thing to remember is that it's a big platform play. And we actually typically see that as a 6- to 9-month sales cycle. So to have 230 customers already, I think, is a statement on the value that our customers are seeing. That's going to be a real important integration point with Splunk, by the way. So that we see. We see -- we feel good about the pipeline.From a demand perspective, just to give you some insight, the Americas, the demand was almost double digits this past quarter, which is the highest we've seen in a while. So I think we're seeing a lot of good indicators. And if you just watch over the next 6 to 9 months, you're going to see more and more innovation that comes out. And I think you'll begin to believe and see the results around that same time frame."", 'Operator', 'Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan.', 'Samik Chatterjee', ""Chuck, I'm going to, for my first question, ask you to go back to sort of the drivers of demand that you're seeing here. We walked away from the call last time sensing a sense of optimism about a sharp rebound when you see the inventory digestion complete. But I guess what I'm hearing from you today is even as that inventory digestion ends in fiscal '24, you're seeing a bit more of a macro impact on your customer demand. And are your expectations still sort of intact in terms of thinking about a more sharp rebound as you go into fiscal '25, if you can share what you're seeing from customers there?And for my follow-up, the NVIDIA partnership, how should we think about the impact of that on your AI order target of $1 billion? Or is it really most of that partnership that realizes beyond that sort of target window, target time frame?"", 'Charles H. Robbins', ""Thanks. I would say on the -- the thing that's changed from last quarter is that we do just see a little more caution with our customers. I don't want to over-rotate and say that it's a massive shift, but we definitely saw more caution. We talked with our sales leaders ahead of the call, and they indicate -- we asked them point-blank, was there more caution or the same caution from the prior quarter? And we heard more, a little bit more. And then we saw the pushout of the forecast. So that just tells us that there is a little bit more in the system. So therefore, I think we need a couple of quarters to see it play out before we can declare what's going to happen in fiscal '25.On the NVIDIA discussion, a couple of comments. We talked about the $1 billion of orders, which I know someone is going to ask me about at some point. And what I would say is that in the last 90 days, our pipeline of AI opportunities continue to grow. The pipeline is now almost 3x that particular number that we gave last time, which were more orders that we see in '25. The total pipeline is now about 3x that, roughly 3x that. And I would say that virtually none of that is anything associated with the NVIDIA partnership yet. It's all independent of that."", 'Operator', 'Ben Reitzes with Melius Research.', 'Benjamin Alexander Reitzes', ""Chuck, Scott, I wanted to ask about the HPE-Juniper deal. Are you seeing any uncertainty in the market near term? And how do you think that helps you long term? And if you -- Chuck, if you don't mind, just with regard to that last AI comment, your -- one of your competitors, obviously, is expecting quite a big pick up next year, next calendar year. Do you feel like that AI $3 billion in pipeline or so kicks in next year, next calendar year? Or what's your timing on that?"", 'Charles H. Robbins', ""Thanks, Ben. So I would say on the HPE-Juniper deal, the one area where they have meaningful overlap is in wireless, and I don't know if there's any connection to the fact that we had a 50% increase in $1 million-plus wireless deals sequentially. So it's hard to say. But I mean there is a lot of noise in the system or in the industry about what they do there, but I can't say specifically that any customers have talked to me about it, to be honest. So I think we're -- I think it's a little early for them to -- for the customers to be expressing that concern. They may be asking them directly, but they're not talking to us.On the timing, yes, I think we said fiscal '25, which starts in August of this year. And I think you probably should assume most of that is probably in the second half, I would guess, but we'll see how things play out. I think customers are going to move as fast as they possibly can, but we're still in the early strategy and planning stages right now on most of it. The pipeline stuff are well-defined use cases that are already in place with certain customers, and we're actually just working through the opportunities."", 'Richard Scott Herren', ""Yes. But Ben, our expectation is the majority of that $1 billion in orders will turn into revenue in our fiscal '25, just to be clear."", 'Operator', 'Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank.', 'Matthew Niknam', ""I'll keep it to one and one follow-up. So main question, just around inventory digestion. Is that dynamic primarily affecting enterprise and commercial customers? And can you talk a little bit about the visibility you've got towards this actually resolving itself by fiscal year-end? And then a follow-up just on gross margins. You were fairly stable sequentially, and I think the guide implies more of the same. So I'm just wondering, are we now largely past a lot of the supply chain dynamics or headwinds? Or has anything changed on the supply chain front?"", 'Charles H. Robbins', ""Yes. So I'll take the first, and then Scott, you can take the second. On the inventory digestion issue, I think it's -- I would say it's largely an enterprise and a service provider issue. And particularly the cloud providers, we think they've got probably in excess of 20-plus weeks of inventory that they're working through right now as they built up when the lead times were so long.We have a lot of our enterprise products that are tethered to the cloud for management perspectives. And so we see the lag between when we ship it to the customer and when they connected. I gave the Meraki example in my prepared remarks. And so we do have visibility, and we can actually see on some aspects of the portfolio how the time frame between shipments and connectivity is shrinking, and it's not shrinking as fast as we thought it would, which leads us to believe this is going to extend through the end of '24. So that's where we are. Scott, gross margins?"", 'Richard Scott Herren', ""Yes. What you saw in the quarter is, of course, gross margins continue to show a year-on-year improving trend, roughly flat, as you said, sequentially. There's a couple of dynamics. But to your question on where does this settle in, I think it settles in, in the range we're in right now, in the 66% to 67% range through the end of the year. There's both the things that are happening from a freight and delivery standpoint, freight costs with what's happening in the Red Sea have gone up slightly, and we continue to see a little bit of component pressure, although in the commodity sections, we're seeing some benefit there.The scale of the services ramp-up, as you -- obviously, services revenue trails the product revenue. We had those 3 really strong quarters of product revenue growth. We're seeing the tail of that now in our services revenue growth. And since a lot of the cost underneath our services are fixed, you get better leverage when that happens. So I think when you add all those together, we should settle in, in the 66% to 67% range. And the majority of, if not all of the supply chain constraints that we felt are behind us at this point."", 'Operator', 'Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs.', 'Michael Ng', ""I just have 2. First, just on the revenue guidance. I think based on the midpoint of it, the implied fiscal 4Q revenue guidance only implies about plus 1% quarter-on-quarter. Given that we're back to a normal backlog, what's preventing that from going back to a more normal level of seasonality? And then as a follow-up to Amit's question earlier on the NVIDIA AI deal, I just wanted to clarify. I understand that it's Ethernet, but will it be both NVIDIA's Spectrum-X as well as Cisco's Ethernet? And how will that be sold together, if that's the correct assumption?"", 'Richard Scott Herren', ""Michael, on the midpoint of the revenue guide, the math would lead you to what you just said. I think no one ever wants to have to reset guidance, much less have to do it twice. We -- as Chuck just said, as we look at all the various factors coming in from the field, we see caution. And I think you should expect that there's caution in our guide at this point."", 'Charles H. Robbins', 'On the NVIDIA front, I think, look, one of the key benefits that they see is leveraging our enterprise go-to market and our global ecosystem and partner community. And therefore, when we are -- when these solutions are flowing through our channels and our sales teams and our partners, it will be Cisco Ethernet.', 'Operator', 'George Notter with Jefferies.', 'George Charles Notter', ""I guess I'm just curious about -- are there any mechanisms or activities you guys are using to help accelerate the clearance of inventory from the channel? Any price discounting, any rebating, stock rotation? How are you taking an active approach here?"", 'Charles H. Robbins', ""I'll comment -- I'll make one quick comment. I think I said this in my prepared remarks as well. We've deployed a lot of transaction services for some of our larger customers just to help them do that. And I know that our sales teams were talking this week, Scott, maybe you remember or you have some more detail on looking at some partner incentives to help?"", 'Richard Scott Herren', ""Yes. We absolutely are working with the field on that. In a lot of cases, it boils down to a lack of the skilled resources required at both -- sometimes at our partner level, sometimes at the customer level to get that done. There's only so much you can do to accelerate it. We have put in place incentives to make that accelerate. To your other point on cancellations or stock rotation, we're seeing those continuing to be well below where they were prepandemic. So we're not seeing any of that -- any pressure on that front."", 'Operator', 'Woo Jin Ho with Bloomberg Intelligence.', 'Woo Jin Ho', ""Given that most of the weakness is going to be on the networking side, could you just talk a little bit more about the future software subscription renewal rates? You did a good job this quarter with software subscriptions going up 5%, but given that networking is poised to be down, I'm curious where that's heading going forward."", 'Richard Scott Herren', ""Yes. I think -- thanks for the question, Woo Jin. I think the way to think about it is we put a -- as you can imagine, when you built up the level of annualized recurring revenue that we have, we've put a huge amount of focus on both customer success and driving adoption and then turning that adoption into renewals. We've invested fairly heavily in that space over the last couple of years, and we're seeing renewal rates respond accordingly.When you look at where we're more software-heavy outside of networking, but in both security and collab, as you saw, we reported growth -- revenue growth in both of those categories. Observability is almost exclusively software, and we posted 16% revenue growth in observability. So we are seeing that actually trend in the right direction."", 'Operator', 'Tim Long with Barclays.', 'Timothy Patrick Long', ""One question, one follow-up. So first, maybe, Chuck, can you talk a little bit about the kind of margin growth trade-off with the head count reduction? Obviously protecting margin here, but how do you think about that trade-off given the challenging growth we've seen? And then just on a follow-up with all of the AI comments, Chuck, could you just remind us kind of where we are with -- from a product standpoint, are you seeing more traction for Silicon One or software or the full system products? If you could just give us a little color on kind of where you're seeing that pipeline growing?"", 'Charles H. Robbins', ""Yes. Thanks, Tim. So on the margin growth trade-off, we're always considering that, and we're very disciplined, though. And we think that gross margins are clearly a reflection of the value that your customers see and your technology and what you deliver. And if you look at a lot of our competitors and you look at some of the market share -- I mean, some of the gross margins that they have, that tells you that they're viewed more as a commodity. And I think that our customers see real value in what we deliver to them. So while we always look at margins versus growth, we also are -- we're just disciplined across both.On the AI front, Silicon One is a big play, clearly. We've delivered next-generation silicon into several of the cloud providers right now. We've got the Ethernet running in 3 of the 4 big ones. And we'll use the same silicon in the enterprise data center over time.We've got GPUs in our UCS platforms. And so it's evolving, but we have -- I tell our teams, unlike the original cloud transition that we talked on this call several times about how we were not prepared for the infrastructure play in the cloud world, I think we are absolutely ready and well equipped to succeed in this transition to AI. It will be a tailwind for us as we get into it over time."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.', 'Aaron Christopher Rakers', ""I'll stick to one, just building on that last question. I know over periods of time, you've talked a little bit about how large your webscale business is. Can you just remind us again the presence you have in some of the webscale opportunities either from a size -- and maybe ex the AI discussion, what kind of growth rates you're seeing, particularly with those webscale customers right now?"", 'Charles H. Robbins', ""So our team measures what -- their use cases or franchises or however you want to think about it, there are specific areas within the infrastructure that we identify for each of the webscale players. And Scott, keep me honest, I want to say we're designed into 16 or..."", 'Richard Scott Herren', '21.', 'Charles H. Robbins', ""21 of those. And so that's how I would think about it. I don't think that right now, if you looked at the growth numbers, they wouldn't be reflective of what's going on because they're just digesting inventory right now. So they're not in a position where they need to order a lot because lead times have normalized so much. So I don't think that's -- it's not even relevant. I think understanding those 21 use cases -- and as I said earlier, they want dual source, and they want dual source all the way down to the silicon level. In the traditional days with carriers, they wanted 2 vendors who would provide 2 different integrated systems. In this case, that may be the case with cloud, but they also look at silicon. They look at components. They're very deep on wanting to make sure that they have resiliency and optionality."", 'Richard Scott Herren', ""Aaron, the only thing I'd add is, and we said it earlier, there's no question that over time, given the way we're positioned, both from a complete box, a white box and a silicon standpoint, there's no question that AI is a tailwind for us longer term."", 'Operator', 'James Fish with Piper Sandler.', 'James Edward Fish', ""Scott, based on a couple of comments you made around gross margins. Just wondering, was supply chain starting to go the other way and supply more readily available? Could we see the price increases enacted in the past now have to be given back? And any sense to how should we think about the annualized cost savings on these reductions, understanding there are people here and it's difficulty and what areas you guys expect to kind of reduce down and if some of those reductions are filled elsewhere in terms of like a net basis on head count?"", 'Richard Scott Herren', ""Yes. On the price declines, you got to remember, go back to why we put the price increases in to begin with. And that was really to offset the higher cost that we were seeing from many of our suppliers as everyone was dealing with constraints, and supply/demand is pretty straightforward.What we haven't seen in the wake of this, some of the commodities, the prices have come down. Memory is a good example. What we haven't seen broadly is cost decreases coming in from our providers at this point. And so with that -- and you see that reflected in our gross margins, which have returned to a more normal range, but are still sitting in that 66% to 67% range. So I'm not anticipating at this point price declines, pending significant cost declines coming into us.On the cost savings, you can see where we are year-to-date. We've got a -- if you just look at operating expenses for a minute, year-to-date, operating expenses are modestly up. And after working our way through the restructuring that we discussed today, for the full year, we think they'll be modestly down. So I think that's probably the right way to think about it as you're looking to build your model."", 'Ahmed Sami Badri', ""Thank you, Jim.
