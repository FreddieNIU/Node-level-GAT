A copy of the same can be downloaded here. The fund outperformed in the first quarter by returning 16.59%. The market also performed well with the S&amp;P 500 index returning 7.50% and the Russell 1000 Growth index returning 14.37% in the same period. In addition, please check the fund’s top five holdings to know its best picks in 2023.RiverPark Large Growth Fund highlighted stocks like The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) in the first quarter 2023 investor letter. Headquartered in Westlake, Texas, The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) is a savings and loan holding company. On May 8, 2023, The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) stock closed at $47.63 per share. One-month return of The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) was -7.89%, and its shares lost 26.25% of their value over the last 52 weeks. The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) has a market capitalization of $86.625 billion.RiverPark Large Growth Fund made the following comment about The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:""The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW): SCHW shares were our top detractor for the quarter as bank stocks sold off aggressively following the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. Despite the bulk of Schwab’s $7 trillion of assets being in the brokerage business, the company does have a large deposit base on which it earns net interest income. While Schwab has seen asset growth increase as depositors look for safety, the company has seen persistent cash sorting (depositors moving cash from deposits to money market funds to generate higher yields). This sorting has two negative consequences: first, it reduces the firm’s profitability because Schwab earns more in net interest income on assets on deposit than it does on management fees from money market funds, and second, it forces Schwab to sell assets held by its bank subsidiary to fund the cash transfers into money market funds. Because of the recent rapid rise in interest rates, these asset sales could cause Schwab to realize trading losses. We think this latter scenario is unlikely for two reasons: first, following historical patterns from past cycles, we believe the cash sorting trend will slow in the coming months, and second, Schwab has enough available liquidity from other sources to fund nearly 100% of its deposit base without selling marked-down securities.Schwab and TD Ameritrade (which Schwab acquired in October 2020) have been the leading share gainers in the discount brokerage industry over the last decade, with both generating substantial organic asset growth while also growing operating margins and remaining amongst the price leaders on all products. With these two businesses now combined, revenue and expense synergies should accelerate in 2023, and we believe the company will be in an even stronger position to gather assets and drive long-term margins and free cash flow in the years to come.""Story continuesBest bank stocks for 2021Jonathan Weiss/Shutterstock.comThe Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) is not on our list of 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds.

You should consider the Schwab Fundamental U.S. Large Company Index ETF (FNDX), a passively managed exchange traded fund launched on 08/13/2013.The fund is sponsored by Charles Schwab. It has amassed assets over $10.71 billion, making it one of the larger ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Value segment of the US equity market.Why Large Cap ValueLarge cap companies usually have a market capitalization above $10 billion. Overall, they are usually a stable option, with less risk and more sure-fire cash flows than mid and small cap companies.Carrying lower than average price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios, value stocks also have lower than average sales and earnings growth rates. Considering long-term performance, value stocks have outperformed growth stocks in almost all markets; however, they are more likely to underperform growth stocks in strong bull markets.CostsWhen considering an ETF's total return, expense ratios are an important factor, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts in the long term if all other factors remain equal.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.25%, putting it on par with most peer products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 2.06%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsIt is important to delve into an ETF's holdings before investing despite the many upsides to these kinds of funds like diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Information Technology sector--about 17.20% of the portfolio. Financials and Healthcare round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, Apple Inc (AAPL) accounts for about 4.47% of total assets, followed by Microsoft Corp (MSFT) and Berkshire Hathaway Inc Class B (BRKB).Story continuesThe top 10 holdings account for about 20.13% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskFNDX seeks to match the performance of the Russell RAFI US Large Co. Index before fees and expenses. The Russell RAFI US Large Company Index measures the performance of the large company size segment by fundamental overall company scores.The ETF has added roughly 3.12% so far this year and is down about -0.07% in the last one year (as of 05/08/2023). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $47.76 and $57.54.The ETF has a beta of 1 and standard deviation of 18.49% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 735 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesSchwab Fundamental U.S. Large Company Index ETF carries a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 (Hold), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Thus, FNDX is a reasonable option for those seeking exposure to the Style Box - Large Cap Value area of the market. Investors might also want to consider some other ETF options in the space.The iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF (IWD) and the Vanguard Value ETF (VTV) track a similar index. While iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF has $49.54 billion in assets, Vanguard Value ETF has $100.77 billion. IWD has an expense ratio of 0.18% and VTV charges 0.04%.Bottom-LineRetail and institutional investors increasingly turn to passively managed ETFs because they offer low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency; these kind of funds are also excellent vehicles for long term investors.To learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Welcome to Western Digital's Fiscal Third Quarter 2023 Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Peter Andrew, Vice President, Financial Planning and Analysis of Investor Relations. You may begin.T. Peter AndrewThank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me today are David Goeckeler, Chief Executive Officer; and Wissam Jabre, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements including expectations for our product portfolio, cost reductions, business plans and performance, demand and market trends and financial results based on management's current assumptions and expectations and as such, does include risks and uncertainties. We assume no obligation to update these statements. Please refer to our most recent financial report on Form 10-K and other filings with the SEC for more information on the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. We will also make references to non-GAAP financial measures today. Reconciliations between the non-GAAP and comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the press release and other materials that are being posted in the Investor Relations section of our website. With that, I will now turn the call over to David for introductory remarks.Story continuesDavid V. GoeckelerThank you, Peter. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining the call to discuss our 2023 third quarter results. Western Digital's third quarter performance exceeded expectations with core metrics at the high end of our guidance range, demonstrating the company's resilience in a challenging market environment. We reported third quarter revenue of $2.8 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of 11% and a non-GAAP loss per share of $1.37. .Over the last several years, our team is focused on enhancing business agility and delivering a range of innovative, industry-leading products that address the increasing data storage demands of our customers. The groundwork we laid combined with the actions we have taken since the beginning of this fiscal year to rightsize and refocus our business have enabled us to navigate a dynamic environment.I am pleased that we delivered non-GAAP gross margin at the higher end of our guidance range due to strong execution across both our HDD and Flash businesses. In HDD, our early actions to streamline our manufacturing footprint and focus our product offerings on delivering the best value for our data center customers have resulted in gross margin upside and profitable market share gains in HDD. In Flash, our broad go-to-market strategy anchored on our enviable retail franchise and a strong client SSD portfolio enabled us to optimize bit placement and bolster gross margin. During the fiscal third quarter, we saw signs of demand stabilizing across various end markets. In consumer, our Flash and HD results were consistent with the expectations we shared in January. In client, demand for each major product area came in better than we expected across PC OEM, channel, mobile and gaming. In cloud, demand for capacity enterprise hard drives improved, whereas the demand for flash drive was consistent with our expectations set in January. Before I jump into updates on our HDD and Flash businesses, I would like to reiterate that the strategic review process is ongoing, and we will provide updates as we have them. I'll now turn to the business update, starting with HDD. During the fiscal third quarter, our HDD revenue improved sequentially with growth in capacity enterprise offsetting seasonal declines in retail and client. During the quarter, our 22 terabyte CMR drive became the highest volume product among all of our 20-terabyte-and-above capacity points, demonstrating our leadership position at this capacity point. In addition, we expect to complete qualification of our 26 terabyte UltraSMR technology in the fiscal fourth quarter. These innovative products provide multi-generation benefits to our customers. Turning to Flash. Total exabyte shipment came in higher than expected in consumer, mobile, PC OEM and channel products. Despite the industry experiencing the worst downturn in over a decade, Western Digital delivered positive product gross margin, excluding underutilization charges driven by our unique combination of premium retail brands, broad go-to-market channels and low-cost flash supply from our joint venture fab with Kioxia. Furthermore, we continue to see encouraging signs of price elasticity-driven content growth in retail flash led by WD_BLACK SSD optimized for gaming as well as mobile PC OEMs and channel within client. On the technology front, BiCS6 achieved its anticipated cost crossover during the quarter. Moreover, on March 30, Western Digital and Kioxia announced our next-generation BiCS8 node, a groundbreaking technology that builds upon the success of BiCS5 and BiCS6. This new technology is based on circuit bonded to array architecture which provides several benefits, including reduced cycle time, faster yield ramp, better lateral scaling and industry-leading I-O performance when compared to products based on circuit under array architecture. We continue to aggressively productize BiCS8 for a broad range of applications, which will position Western Digital for success as business conditions improve. As we look to the fiscal fourth quarter, in hard drives, overall demand will be impacted by ongoing inventory digestion at cloud customers and a sustained decline in client. However, we are beginning to experience improved demand at certain customers in China. In Flash, we are seeing signs of stabilization and content increase per unit. PC OEMs have emerged from inventory digestion and are now shipping closer to end demand. Gaming will remain strong, while enterprise SSD for cloud applications will remain soft. We anticipate modest growth in bit shipments into the fiscal fourth quarter. Before I hand the call over to Wissam, I would like to thank the Western Digital team for the response efforts they made in addressing the network security incident we disclosed on April 2. Our team took proactive and precautionary measures to secure our operations and successfully executed on our business continuity plans. With that, I'll turn it over to Wissam.Wissam G. JabreThank you, David, and good afternoon, everyone. Fiscal third quarter results reflected the challenging market environment with continued pressure on revenue and profitability. Total revenue for the quarter was $2.8 billion, down 10% sequentially and 36% year-over-year. Non-GAAP loss per share was $1.37. Looking at end markets, cloud represented 43% of total revenue at $1.2 billion, down 2% sequentially driven by an increase in capacity enterprise drive shipments which was offset by a decrease in flash shipments. Nearline bit shipments were 79 exabytes, up 31% sequentially. Year-over-year, revenue declined 32%, primarily due to a decline in shipments of both hard drive and flash products as well as price decreases in Flash.Client represented 35% of total revenue at $1 billion, down 10% sequentially and 44% year-over-year. On both a sequential and year-over-year basis, the decrease was driven by price declines across our flash products and lower client SSD and hard drive shipments for PC application. Finally, consumer represented 22% of total revenue at $0.6 billion, down 22% sequentially and 29% year-over-year. Sequentially, the decrease was due to a seasonal decline in shipments of both retail hard drive and flash products as well as price declines in retail flash. The year-over-year decrease was driven by lower retail hard drive shipments and price declines in flash. Turning now to revenue by segment. HDD revenue was $1.5 billion, up 3% sequentially and down 30% year-over-year. Sequentially, total HDD exabyte shipments increased 15% and average price per hard drive increased 10% to $109. On a year-over-year basis, total HDD exabyte shipments decreased 23%, and average price per unit increased 9%. Flash revenue was $1.3 billion, down 21% sequentially and 42% year-over-year. Sequentially, flash ASPs were down 10% on a blended basis and 12% on a like-for-like basis. Flash bit shipments decreased 14% sequentially and 1% year-over-year. Moving to costs and expenses. Please note that my comments will be related to non-GAAP results unless stated otherwise. Gross margin for the fiscal third quarter was 10.6%, down 6.8 percentage points sequentially and 21.1 percentage points year-over-year. This includes $275 million of charges for manufacturing underutilization, inventory write-downs and other items. HDD gross margin was higher than anticipated at 24.3%, up 3.6 percentage points sequentially and down 3.4 percentage points year-over-year. Sequentially, the increase was primarily due to higher capacity enterprise volume as well as lower manufacturing costs and underutilization related charges. Underutilization charges were less than projected at approximately $40 million or 2.7 percentage points, partially benefiting from the actions to streamline our manufacturing footprint and offsetting other charges of $22 million. Flash gross margin was negative 5%, down 19.5 percentage points sequentially and 40.6 percentage points year-over-year. Underutilization charges associated with the reduced manufacturing volumes were approximately $160 million or 12.2 percentage points, less than expected as we focused on lowering manufacturing costs. During the quarter, we incurred $53 million of flash inventory write-down charges resulting from projected selling prices falling below the cost of inventory. We continue to tightly manage our operating expenses, which were at $602 million for the quarter, down $57 million sequentially and $138 million year-over-year. Operating loss in the quarter was $304 million driven by underutilization charges inventory write-downs and other items totaling $275 million. Income tax expense was $60 million. Despite the consolidated loss, we continue to have taxable income in certain geographies resulting in taxes payable in those areas. Fiscal third quarter loss per share was $1.37, inclusive of a $9 million dividend cost associated with the convertible preferred equity. Operating cash flow for the third quarter was an outflow of $381 million, and free cash flow was an outflow of $527 million. Cash capital expenditures, which include the purchase of property, plant and equipment, and activity related to our flash joint ventures on the cash flow statement was $146 million. Gross debt outstanding was $7.1 billion at the end of the fiscal third quarter. Trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA at the end of the third quarter, as defined in our credit agreement was $2.5 billion, resulting in a gross leverage ratio of 2.8x compared to 2.1x in the fiscal second quarter. As a reminder, our credit agreement includes $0.7 billion in depreciation add-back associated with the flash joint ventures. This is not reflected in our cash flow statement. Please refer to the earnings presentation on the Investor Relations website for further details. At the end of the quarter, total liquidity was $5.3 billion, including cash and cash equivalents of $2.2 billion, undrawn revolver capacity of $2.25 billion and unused delayed drawn term loan facility of $875 million. Before I cover guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter, I'll discuss the business outlook. We expect HDD revenue to decrease sequentially due to ongoing inventory digestion at cloud customers. We expect flash revenue to decrease sequentially as modest growth in bit shipments is more than offset by ASP declines. We expect flash bit shipment growth to accelerate in the first half of fiscal year 2024. In the fiscal fourth quarter, total gross margin will be negatively impacted by underutilization charges and flash pricing. We continue to tightly manage our cost structure through this dynamic environment and expect operating expenses to be below $600 million. For fiscal year 2023, we project gross capital expenditures to be approximately $2.2 billion and cash capital expenditures to be approximately $0.8 billion. The projected cash capital expenditures represent more than a 50% reduction from our forecast as we entered fiscal year 2023 and approximately 35% reduction from fiscal year 2022. I'll now turn to guidance. For the fiscal fourth quarter, our non-GAAP guidance is as follows. We expect revenue to be in the range of $2.4 billion to $2.6 billion. We expect gross margin to be between 3% and 5% which includes underutilization charges across flash and HDD totaling $220 million to $240 million. We expect operating expenses to be between $580 million to $600 million. Interest and other expenses are expected to be approximately $90 million. We expect income tax expense to be between $60 million and $70 million. We expect loss per share of $2.20 to $1.90, assuming approximately 321 million shares outstanding. I'll now turn the call back over to David.David V. GoeckelerThanks, Wissam. Over the past few quarters, we have successfully ramped a series of industry-leading storage products and commercialized innovative technologies while concurrently rightsizing our cost structure. Our proactive actions have positioned Western Digital favorably for the future as demand gradually returns to normal levels.In closing, I would like to thank our team members for their unwavering commitment in advancing innovative products and driving operational efficiency. Their exceptional efforts have allowed Western Digital to deliver industry-leading gross margins across our HDD and Flash businesses despite the challenging and rapidly changing landscape. Additionally, I am immensely proud to share that Western Digital has been honored for the fifth consecutive year as one of the world's most ethical companies by the Ethisphere Institute. This recognition is a testament to the dedication and support of our people worldwide, and we remain committed to upholding the highest ethical standards in all that we do. Okay. I look forward to your questions. Let's open it up.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from C.J. Muse from Evercore.Christopher James MuseI guess I'd love to get a sense for where you're seeing demand stabilize versus where you still see pockets of inventory. And as part of that, I guess, embedded in your revenue guide, it looks like you're kind of suggesting HDD down maybe 10% to 15%, SSD down 5% to 10%. So I guess is that kind of the right way to think about it? And then as part of that, where do you think we're seeing stabilization? And where do you think we need to work down inventory some more?David V. GoeckelerC.J., thanks for the question. Good to hear from you as always. Yes, I think as we talked about in consumer, we're seeing some stabilization there as far as demand. PC OEM, we've been talking about now for 3-plus quarters, and I think we see them mainly shipping to true demand. I mean nobody is building inventory right now, but we think the inventory correction there is mostly behind us. Our channel business performed really well this past quarter, I think, above what our expectation was; the inventory issue is still very much in data center, and it's very lumpy. We have some big cloud customers that are consuming. We have others that are really in full inventory digestion and aren't taking anything. So that market is still where we see a lot of a lot of inventory digestion going on. And I would expect that to be lumpy for the next couple of quarters. We are seeing some signs of stabilization in China. We talked about that. I think it's setting up for a recovery in the second half of the year, a lot more activity around RFPs and discussions about what demand is going to look like in the second half. So that's a bit of an overview of where we see the market. I think on your numbers, you're probably down a little more than we are on HDD. I think that's probably more a single-digit kind of number on a sequential basis.Christopher James MuseVery helpful. And as a quick follow-up, can you kind of walk us through what you're thinking today in terms of underutilization charges beyond the June quarter?David V. GoeckelerYes. Well, let's talk about it for each business. I mean I think in HDD -- and I'm sure Wissam will have a little bit to add here as well, HDD which is the smaller part of the number, but still significant, we're going to see a drop in volume next quarter. So we'll see some underutilization there. On the Flash side, we continue to underutilize the fab. We're managing it in a very dynamic way, kind of week-to-week, month-to-month to make sure we fully understand demand and keep our inventory in a position where we want it. And so -- but we will definitely see underutilization on both sides of the business next quarter.Wissam G. JabreYes. And just to add -- C.J, sorry, just to add a bit more color. I think we -- in our guide, we're estimating around $220 million to $240 million, the range of underutilization charges. And by business, this is roughly 2/3 Flash, 1/3 HDD -- or 1/3 HDD.OperatorOur next question comes from Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley.Joseph Lawrence MooreGreat. You mentioned that you're taking lower cost or market charges on NAND. Can you talk about the methodology there? Is that -- do you pool that and then take a charge overall? Or is it any time any individual product falls below the market price, you adjust it down?Wissam G. JabreSo Joe, with respect to our LCM charges, we do it at the finished good product level. It is not pooled.Joseph Lawrence MooreGot it. Okay. And then in terms of the underutilization charges and things like that, do you know how the covenants are going to be defined? Are you going to be able to remove those charges from the EBITDA number as defined in the covenant?Wissam G. JabreThose are typically allowed to be added back per our credit agreement to the EBITDA.OperatorThe next question comes from Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo.Aaron Christopher RakersYes. Just to build on that last question, just to be safe, your gross margin expectation in this current quarter, I'm guessing the commentary assumes that you're not expecting another inventory charge in the Flash business? And if so, why not?Wissam G. JabreSo Aaron, we typically factor into our guidance all the expectations. And when we exited Q3, just like a typical quarter, we do our reserve reviews and we take the -- we make sure that the balance sheet is properly stated. And so based on our forecast, everything is baked into the guidance. Typically, we have a small amount in the guidance just like we did also in the past quarter.Aaron Christopher RakersOkay. And then I guess my follow-up question is on the hard disk drive business. I can appreciate you guys seeing some cloud customers kind of -- it sounds like purchased really no product this last quarter. I'm guessing from a competitive perspective, how would you characterize the current environment? Have you seen increased price aggressiveness? How do you guys think about the discussion around HAMR and your road map going forward, et cetera?David V. GoeckelerYes. I mean I think there's always price pressure in this market, Aaron. But we've been very disciplined about the value of our products. I think one of the things we feel very good about is we've been investing in our HDD road map, things like OptiNAND, ePMR, UltraSMR. These products are really now starting to ship in volume. We talked about the 22-terabyte CMR drive was the highest volume drive at 20 and above. So we feel very good about where the portfolio is, about where it's going. We've got a number of very large customers qualifying SMR right now. That's clearly the next step in the data center. Our UltraSMR product there, the [2060.] We talked about we'll finish up calls this quarter and start deploying next quarter. So we feel like we've got a portfolio that is aligned with what the market needs. And that's showing up in kind of how we're able to monetize that portfolio and not have to compete on price. So future technologies like HAMR will be there. We're still a ways away before that product is going to be a volume-type product. The volume products are the [22s] going and then SMR are going to be the big volume products over the next couple of years. And after that, we'll get to HAMR. And we feel confident about that technology. It's been in development for a long time. We're in the final stages of it as an industry. And I think everybody is excited that it will be the road map for 30 and above when we need it.OperatorOur next question comes from Sidney Ho from Deutsche Bank.Shek Ming HoI want to ask about the network security breach. Can you give us an update on the recovery there? It looks like your operations are back to normal levels. But have you experienced -- or do you expect any more issues with production or your ability to ship products?David V. GoeckelerYes. We've been very transparent about that incident. When we noticed it, we let folks know. We took our -- we basically disconnected ourselves from the public Internet to protect ourselves and then restore the environment. We still have capabilities inside the companies. And the factories were operational throughout that. Clearly, a tremendous amount of work by the team, but we feel like we're nearly all the way back now as far as operation. We've got to bring the store online in here in another week or so. But it was really, really good to see our business continuity plans. You don't want to rely on them too often, but when we had to, they were there and they kept the company moving forward.Wissam G. JabreSidney, I just wanted to add that for fiscal Q3, we don't have any impact in the numbers to the network security.Shek Ming HoOkay. That's great. Maybe my follow-up question is Samsung in early April talk about the cutting production. I'm curious if your conversation with your customers have changed since that announcement? And related to that, do you expect the June quarter to be the bottom for your bargains for your Flash business?David V. GoeckelerI would say we have -- I mean, obviously, we have very robust conversations with our customers all the time. I wouldn't pin the tone of those conversations on to how any one particular player in the market is acting or what they're doing. We stay very focused on our business. As far as -- whereas the bottom, I mean, we expect the market to come into balance as we go through the second half of the year. I think we're clearly taking a lot of actions in our own business to closely manage it. Supply and demand, keep the utilization of the fab close to where our demand is, so we manage our inventory. Clearly, we're going through one of the most severe downturns in a while. But we think as we move through the second half of the year, the market will get in -- will come into balance.OperatorOur next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini from SIG.Mehdi HosseiniOne near term and more to do with inventory. Your inventories are absolute dollar value keeps going higher. And I want to understand how the mix is changing between wafers, finished good and other materials? Is there any way you can give us a color how incremental changes are happening for different categories within our inventory? And I have a follow-up.Wissam G. JabreYes. We typically don't break that out as much on the call. This is a bit too much detail, Mehdi, for me to discuss here. The one comment I would make, though, when we think of inventory, our operations team is really focused on minimizing where we can. So we basically try to stage it in the places that makes the most sense from a demand perspective.Mehdi HosseiniLet me rephrase the question. How do you -- how should we think about the risk of inventory write-down?Wissam G. JabreThe -- I mean, the inventory write-down typically is -- it's really based -- the ones -- that was, for instance, I called out is based on basically the inventory value relative to where the market price is. And so if -- when prices decline by a lot, then we do have to take a closer look and see if there's any impact. But that's -- yes, that's what I would say about that.Mehdi HosseiniSo would -- are you assuming that the rate of price decline is moderating, so maybe that would minimize the downside risk?Wissam G. JabreWhat I'm saying is we -- what I'm saying is at the end of every quarter, our balance sheet is properly stated because we do look at where the inventory value is versus where the demand is and the prices most particularly at the finished good level. And so where we see differences, we have to adjust our inventory value. Otherwise, it is properly stated. I guess your question is more around trying to predict where the price is going. And we typically don't necessarily do that.Mehdi HosseiniOkay. And then the question for David, looking at longer term, more than just one quarter. I think there is some confusion or unknown factor how new type of AI would impact demand for HDD versus SSD. Do you have any view how this incremental demand created? These are expensive working stations. How is it going to impact SSD versus HDD?David V. GoeckelerWe're doing analysis on that, Mehdi. What I would say is, to me -- I'll even go a little longer term, bigger picture. This just reinforces the value of stored data. I think that it just seems like there's this constant ways for people can figure out how to use all the data they've stored to do very productive things with it. And I think the latest is training these AI engines. And so we just think it's another element of the long-term value of data storage and it's just a big secular tailwind for the HDD business and the enterprise SSD business. I mean, again, you know that they're both -- they both have big TAMs in the data center, and they're both growing. And we think this is another reason why people will store more data is because they can monetize it in different ways in the future.Mehdi HosseiniBut I guess I was hoping you would shed some light as to how the HDD CAGR would change. I don't think this is going to lift the TAM for each different types of stores at the same rate. Is there any thoughts that you can share with us?David V. GoeckelerI think it will -- HDD is the lion's share of storage in the cloud. So you would expect that's where the bigger lift would be across those 2 technologies.OperatorThe next question comes from Shannon Cross from Credit Suisse.Shannon Siemsen CrossMy first is, as you look at what you're doing on OpEx in terms of holding in cost, how do you think about the -- how you're -- where you're investing? And how are you making those decisions? And how should we think about potential impact to future projects at this point? And then I have a follow-up.David V. GoeckelerYes. We've been very -- obviously, we've been -- one of the things we've been building into the business over the last several years as we've restructured the business as more agility and the ability to proactively respond to the market we're in. I think that's kind of the hallmark of the organization we're trying to build is agile and dynamic. But clearly, on top of that, Shannon, we went to a business unit structure for a reason. It's because we have 2 very, very focused organizations with very sophisticated leaders in them that is constantly doing the ROI analysis of where we put our OpEx, and we get the most out of it. And I think quite frankly, that's led to the portfolio we have today. I think we have the best portfolio we've ever had.And that's an effort that goes on constantly, continuously. And so as we continue to draw down OpEx to resize the business to the realities of what the market are -- is. We've built the capability over the last couple of years to do that in a way where we can make sure we're going to get -- first of all, the OpEx we spend, we get the best ROI out of it, the best return and that we make sure that we're making -- we're taking actions to the business that don't harm the long-term value of it, and we make the right decision on a day-by-day, week-by-week, month-by-month basis. So I think this is really a capability we've built in the last 3 years, and I think it's serving us well right now to make sure that we are we're not cutting in ways that are going to impact the long-term health of the business.Shannon Siemsen CrossThat was helpful. I'm curious -- and maybe I'm trying to make lemonade out of lemons. But I'm just wondering, as you've cut capacity on the HDD side, and you've had these underutilization charges, are there things that you've learned in terms of maybe how you manufacture in the past ways to drive incremental productivity? I'm just thinking it's kind of -- it's certainly a unique time to maybe take a step back and look how things are -- how things have been done and what you can do in the future.David V. GoeckelerI'll make a few comments. I suspect Wissam will have a few comments as well. I mean this is -- there's been a lot of focus on this in the last year of how do we become more efficient, how do we automate more. Several of our factories have won World Economic Forum Lighthouse awards for automation. How do we rescale our employees? And how do we just -- we've been very focused on driving a level of automation, driving productivity and just lowering our fixed cost asset base in the HDD business. And I think our fixed -- I don't think, I know, our fixed costs in that business are now the lowest they've been in well over a decade. So I think that's paying off in the way we're able to generate margin in the business, that lower volume levels. And then as the volume starts to pick back up, we've got capacity to meet what the market needs, and I think we'll do that at a much lower cost basis.Wissam G. JabreYes. I mean the one thing I would add also, in addition to what David said, some of the activities that we drive in terms of the manufacturing side are taken back into the development organizations to think about things that come on platforms and the ability to improve on the way our products are designed for manufacturing efficiency, even increasing manufacturing efficiency going forward. And of course, with that comes a better cost structure.OperatorOur next question comes from Krish Sankar from TD Cowen.Krish SankarDavid, first question is on your NAND ASP decline in March quarter, seems to be better than what your competitors had. I'm just kind of curious, any puts and takes if you talk about your specific pricing versus competition in March, how to think about it in June? And along the same path, you mentioned the supply-demand balance later this year and bit shipment for Flash growing. Are you baking in some kind of a mobile recovery that's going to help you drive that? And then I have a follow-up.David V. GoeckelerYes. I think on pricing, it's kind of the same story all the time, right? Whether it's a down market, upmarket, mid-cycle market, which is -- really have a diverse portfolio. We've talked about this a lot from retail to the channel business, PC OEMs, enterprise SSD, gaming has become a very nice part of the portfolio and growing part of the portfolio. And it's just that -- mobile, obviously, is a big part of our portfolio. And it's just mixing across that where we get the best return, right, putting our supply and our bits in the places where we can get the best return. I do think that, that is a -- that go to -- that breadth of go-to-market is in markets that we can reach literally from every single consumer to the largest technology companies in the world and kind of everything in between. And just the ability to mix across that with a strong portfolio and a strong set of brands as well, SanDisk, SanDisk Professional, WD_BLACK, puts us in a good position to get the best return on our supply. Next quarter, we don't really want to comment on future pricing. It's all into the guide. We've talked about the individual markets. What I would say is we're pricing in or we're putting in what we think is going to do on an individual market-by-market basis and then how we'll mix that next quarter.Krish SankarGot it. Got it. And then I have a follow-up on the CMR side, it's kind of nice to see the total like 23 terabyte is now bigger than 20 terabytes in terms of volume. How should we expect that to grow? And what is its impact on gross margin?David V. GoeckelerI think that's our focus -- on a CMR drive, that's our focused capacity point and it's significantly ahead of other CMR drives above 20. So -- or above the 20 terabyte drive. We expect that to be our premier drive for the next -- until we have a different CMR product in that part of the business. So we expect that to be a very good growth engine, and we've talked a lot about that drive of -- it provides a lot of value. It provides a lot of TCO value for our customers. And we -- it contributes an appropriate amount of margin from that perspective as well.OperatorOur next question comes from Wamsi Mohan from Bank of America.Ruplu BhattacharyaIt's Ruplu filling in for Wamsi today. David, I think maybe another pricing question for you. I think you talked about price elasticity. Could you just elaborate a little bit on what exactly you're seeing either in flash or in HDD? And a related question to that is there's some worry that maybe a lot of memory inventory might be built again this quarter from the likes of some OEMs like Apple because they want to maximize their favorable component pricing, do you think this could lead to a further elongation in the recovery of the market, even though in the near term it might get a little bit tighter. So just your thoughts on that. And what exactly are you seeing in price elasticity?David V. GoeckelerI think the elasticity in NAND is mainly what I was talking about. I mean, we're seeing PC OEM up mid-20s year-over-year on capacity. I think it really interesting number to me is the elasticity across our consumer franchise, which is tens to hundreds of millions of devices we sell a year in that channel up 1/3 year-over-year on capacity per unit. Gaming up more than that, and mobile up even more than that. So I think we're seeing the market work. Even in the midst of a great downturn, you expect -- well, especially in the midst of a great downturn, you expect to see elasticity start to kick in, and we are starting to see that across the portfolio. What was the second part of the question, again?T. Peter AndrewIt was about customer...Ruplu BhattacharyaIt was for mobile...David V. GoeckelerPrebuying. Yes. I think you do see -- I think we are seeing instances of that. I wouldn't say it's pervasive, but we see instances of it. And I think it -- I think maybe it's a sign of where the customers think we are in the cycle as well.Ruplu BhattacharyaGot it. So for my follow-up, if I can ask a quick one to Wissam. How are you thinking about free cash flow going forward? I mean is it -- what needs to happen to get to positive free cash flow? And is that possible in this calendar year? So just your thoughts on that? I mean, how are you looking at working capital and thinking about free cash flow?Wissam G. JabreYes, Ruplu. So we are totally focused on free cash flow. As you've seen us since the beginning of the year, we've been very proactive on OpEx, reducing that quite a bit on CapEx as well as taking underutilization to manage and preserve our cash and not build inventory. And so this is very important to us.In fact, we continue to make improvements. I mean, if you look at our CapEx trend, it's gone down quite a bit. This year, we'll probably be spending approximately if not even more than 35% below last year. With respect to the next few quarters, we typically do not guide for free cash flow. But what I could say is that this is, as I said, a top priority for us and is a big focus, as you would imagine, as we navigate the dynamic environment.OperatorThe next question comes from Tom O'Malley from Barclays.Thomas James O'MalleyMy first one is related to the HDD side of the business. Your competitor recently talked about a recovery that initially was expected to be in June and is now pushed out to the December quarter. Could you just frame the way that you're thinking about the recovery? Is it kind of in line with that? You're obviously guiding the HDD business down, but any color you could give on the back half of the calendar year about when you expect that business to recover?David V. GoeckelerYes. I think, Tom, it's -- I would say as we go through the second half of the year, it will get better. The issue is that these revenue levels and these unit levels, it's just very lumpy. You have very large customers that if they buy or not buy, it can impact the TAM and the available market in a very significant way. So -- and that's what we're experiencing next quarter. I mean, this quarter, we saw things were a little better than we thought on capacity enterprise shipments. We'll see a sequential decline in that, and then we're expecting to go back up as we go in the second half of the year. But I expect it to be lumpy as we go through this inventory digestion because a lot like we saw in the PC OEM space, a lot of customers are just completely focused on inventory digestion, which is basically new purchases just go to 0. And customers at this scale with this kind of business that has an impact. So I expect to see a lumpiness over the next several quarters. I do have a level of optimism about China in the second half of the year. We're seeing better activity there. And so we expect to see that improve in the second half of the year as well, which should also help the business.Thomas James O'MalleyHelpful. And then just a follow-up is on the flash side. You guys talked about a mix of customer behavior, right, where some are still consuming inventory and then others are more aggressively purchasing to various degrees. I don't want you to speak on specific customers, but we've heard this across the ecosystem, particularly through this earnings period here where there is a discrepancy in terms of spend. Could you help maybe just frame where you're seeing that spend? Is there a certain type of customer that's spending more than others? Or is it really just random where guys came in with certain inventory levels and are working through that. Just any color there would be really helpful as we've heard that data point from multiple companies here?David V. GoeckelerI guess I would say that customers that are different segments of the market that are through their inventory digestion are now more or less shipping to end demand being lean on inventory. There are instances of people doing strategic buys in that -- in some of those cases where they've got their inventory to where they want it, but now they're making their own -- they have their own view of the cycle. That's a very small number, I would say. And then the other one is just -- where they're at in their the data center customers especially are just in -- there's a variability of the level of inventory at each customer, and they're so big that it can impact the entire market. So -- and like I said, ones that have heavy inventory are basically working that down in an aggressive way. And so I think it's going to -- like I said, I think it will be lumpy for a couple of quarters until we get through that.OperatorOur next question comes from Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs.Toshiya HariDavid, 3 months ago, you mentioned that you were cutting production in your NAND business by 30%. I'm curious if the magnitude of the cuts today are kind of in that ZIP code, if anything has changed materially? And going forward, what would you need to see to start taking up your utilization rates in the Flash business?David V. GoeckelerYes. We're kind of at the point where we're -- I think it's -- I think probably the same ZIP code is probably a fair way to say depending on where you live. ZIP codes can be pretty big if you're in the country, I guess. But it's really about managing to where we see the demand and keeping our inventory relatively in check. We know it's going up somewhat, but we want to make sure it doesn't get away from us. So we'll use the fab in that. I mean, we're just -- we're going to have to see demand signals for our customers is just as simple as that. We have a very close relationship with a lot of them. We're in the -- obviously, in the market every single day. A lot of these consumer and channel markets are more transactional, where we can see the business across a wide swath. And then, of course, we're talking to the biggest customers biggest technology companies in the world. So we'll get a -- we have a pretty good idea of where their demand is, and we'll set the fab appropriately to make sure that we keep the right inventory position and we have the product when they're ready.Toshiya HariGot it. That's helpful. And then one follow-up for Wissam on the balance sheet side of things. I know you don't guide free cash flow on a quarterly basis or annual basis, but just curious how we should be thinking about inventory, whether it be dollars or days, going into the June quarter and working capital overall. Is that going to be a consumer of cash in the June quarter? Or do you think you can generate some cash from working capital?Wissam G. JabreSure, Toshiya. The -- with respect to inventory, we -- the current projection is, I would say, flattish in terms of dollar. But in terms of days, I anticipate we should see a downtick from here. Well, we continue to, as David said, manage it on a very, very regular basis very closely. And so that's probably the biggest in terms of the working capital. That's the number that would be moving the most. We're -- again, we don't guide the free cash flow, so I wouldn't want to make any more comments around working capital. But I think the answer on the inventory would be a good indicator to what working capital will look.OperatorOur next question comes from Harlan Sur from JPMorgan.Harlan SurThe market share numbers are out for last year, you guys drove a strong #2 position in client SSD, strong double-digit sort of percentage share position, right? But in enterprise, you guys drove sort of low single-digit enterprise SSD market share last year, and it sort of hovered in this 4% to 7% range for a while now? Like what is the team doing to try and drive its share in this fast-growing market to more of what I would call appropriate sort of double-digit percentage share profile?David V. GoeckelerYes. Thanks for the question, Harlan. Always good to hear from you. It's -- we've talked about this quite a bit over the last year. It's about qualifying the products at the big players, qualified in the channel. We just qualified this last quarter on BiCS5 enterprise SSD with some of the biggest customers. So the road map is moving forward as we expected. It's just a very dynamic market right now. So it's difficult to judge share. Obviously, our goal is what we've put out there is to drive that higher. And I have every confidence we'll do that as the market stabilizes and some of these big customers get back to their normal rates of purchasing.OperatorOur next question comes from [Sarine Pajari] from Raymond James.Unidentified AnalystI have a question on the cost side, Wissam. So it's a little tricky to figure out given all the, I guess, onetime charges. I'm just wondering, you previously talked about NAND cost declines in the mid-teens, I believe, just wondering if you're tracking to that. And then as we go to BiCS8, how should we think about the cost declines, especially -- I guess, historically, we've had 30% to 40% bit demand growth. And going forward, if that dynamic changes, if it's lower than 30%, do you think we can still kind of get to that mid-teens cost declines? Or do you need the 30% to get to that level?Wissam G. JabreSure. So thanks for the question. In terms of Q3, we have to think of it basically with and without underutilization. When you factor in the underutilization charges, we wouldn't be -- we wouldn't have reduced cost -- or cost income down by mid-teens. However, if we exclude that, then we're close to mid-teens in Q3. .Now to your question on BiCS8. I mean this is -- with the way our road map works and the timing of when BiCS8 starts ramping, it is pretty much designed in a way to allow us to continue that mid-teens reduction -- cost reduction over time. I wouldn't want to comment about the exact sort of percentage and so on in terms of the crossover because I think it's a little bit premature to talk about this. But conceptually, that's what we're aiming with ramping BiCS8 slightly earlier than previously anticipated.OperatorOur next question comes from Karl Ackerman from BNP Paribas.Karl AckermanYes. I was hoping you could discuss the trajectory of exabyte demand of your cloud customers in the next couple of quarters? And whether there's a divergence and a recovery across on-prem and public cloud. And I guess as you address that question, how do you assess whether you might be shipping below normalized replacement demand?David V. GoeckelerIt -- I think we see the enterprise and the cloud market, they're both soft right now. So we don't see a huge difference between the 2. Again, the difference is, Karl, that you got this idiosyncratic behavior at really big customers. So a customer that usually buys a significant amount of hard drives in a quarter, hundreds of millions of dollars goes to 0. You can pretty much assume they're buying under replacement demand. So that's kind of where we're at. We just -- again, other customers are going along more according to plan. So the inventory levels a bit distributed across big customers. So we look at this quite a bit to understand like where do we think the exabyte growth is and where are we setting the -- our long-term production capabilities and all of that. But right now, it's just a little difficult to draw long-term conclusions and some of -- a little bit behind some of your question, given just the way the market is -- the lumpiness of the market.OperatorThe next question comes from Vijay Rakesh from Mizuho.Vijay Raghavan RakeshJust a quick question. I don't know if you talked about Elliott strategies, and I think they had filed some data filings, but just wondering how that process is progressing. I don't know if you can talk to it.David V. GoeckelerIt's progressing, very active. Everybody in it is under NDA, so I can't say anything about it, and we look forward to talking about it when we reach a conclusion.OperatorOur last question comes from Ananda Baruah from Loop Capital.Ananda Prosad BaruahMaybe for Wissam. I might have missed it, but just wondering if there's any context you can provide about how you're thinking about the debt due in February of '24? How you're going to handle that, go back handling that (inaudible)?Wissam G. JabreYes, Ananda. The -- with respect to the $1.1 billion of convert due in February '24, the plan is to address it over the next couple of quarters.T. Peter AndrewOkay. Jason, is that the last one?OperatorYes, that was the last question.David V. GoeckelerAll right, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. We look forward to seeing you through the quarter. Take care.T. Peter AndrewThank you.OperatorThis concludes today's conference call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect.]"

The company had reported earnings of $1.65 in the prior-year quarter.The performance was affected by challenging macro environment and underutilization charges which weighed on the margins.Revenues of $2.803 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.4%. However, the top line decreased 36% year over year owing to weak performance across all segments. On a sequential basis, revenues declined 10%.Western Digital Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseWestern Digital Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseWestern Digital Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Western Digital Corporation QuoteIn the past year, shares of Western Digital have lost 40.4% of their value compared with the sub-industry’s decline of 14.7%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchQuarter in DetailBeginning first-quarter fiscal 2022, Western Digital started reporting revenues under three refined end markets — Cloud (includes products for public or private cloud), Client (includes products sold directly to OEMs or through distribution) and Consumer (includes retail and other end-user products).Revenues from the Cloud end market (43% of total revenues) fell 32% year over year to $1.205 billion owing to lower flash pricing, and lower shipments of both hard drive and flash products. On a sequential basis, cloud revenues were down 2%.Revenues from the Client end market (35% of total revenues) were down 44% year over year to $975 billion. The downtick was caused by lower flash pricing on a year-over-year basis, coupled with reduced client SSD and hard drive shipments for PC applications. Client revenues declined 10% sequentially.Revenues from the Consumer end market (22% of total revenues) were down 29% year over year to $623 million. Revenues decreased 22% on a sequential basis. Sequential performance was hurt by seasonal decline in demand for both retail hard drives and flash products.Considering revenues by product group, Flash revenues (46.6% of total revenues) declined 42% from the year-ago quarter’s figure to $1.307 billion. Sequentially, flash revenues fell 21%.HDD revenues (53.4% of total revenues) decreased 30% year over year to $1.496 billion.

Flash gross margin was a negative 5% against 36% reported in the prior-year quarter.Non-GAAP operating expenses moved down 19% from the year-ago quarter’s level to $602 million.Non-GAAP operating loss totaled $304 million against the non-GAAP operating income of $650 million in the prior-year quarter.Balance Sheet &amp; Cash FlowAs of Mar 31, cash and cash equivalents were $2.22 billion compared with $1.871 billion reported as of Dec 30, 2022.The long-term debt (including current portion) was $7.073 billion as of Mar 31.Western Digital used $381 million in cash from operations against $398 million of cash generated from operations in the previous-year quarter.Free cash outflow amounted to $527 million against the free cash flow $148 million reported in the prior-year quarter.Q4 GuidanceFor fourth-quarter fiscal 2023, the company expects non-GAAP revenues in the range of $2.4-$2.6 billion.

This compares to earnings of $1.65 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 11.61%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this maker of hard drives for businesses and personal computers would post a loss of $0.08 per share when it actually produced a loss of $0.42, delivering a surprise of -425%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Western Digital , which belongs to the Zacks Computer- Storage Devices industry, posted revenues of $2.8 billion for the quarter ended March 2023, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.39%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $4.38 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Western Digital shares have added about 6% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 7.7%.What's Next for Western Digital?While Western Digital has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Western Digital: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is -$1.31 on $2.9 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and -$3.02 on $12.5 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Computer- Storage Devices is currently in the top 48% of the 250 plus Zacks industries.

The results are expected to be released on May 31.This data storage company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.35 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -4.9%.

14,c417dc0a-1734-3b3b-98df-9c386360db8e,NUE,2023-05-09,Nucor Corporation (NUE) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nucor-corporation-nue-attracting-investor-130001278.html,1683550801,STORY,['NUE'],"[Nucor (NUE) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this steel company have returned -2.2%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +1.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Steel - Producers industry, which Nucor falls in, has lost 1.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Nucor is expected to post earnings of $5.28 per share, indicating a change of -45.4% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +37.8% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $16.57 points to a change of -42.5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -1.7%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.46 indicates a change of -24.8% from what Nucor is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -3.9%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Nucor.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for NUE _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Nucor, the consensus sales estimate of $8.84 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -25.1%. The $36.03 billion and $32.82 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -13.2% and -8.9%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryNucor reported revenues of $8.71 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -17%. EPS of $4.45 for the same period compares with $7.67 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.5 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.45%. The EPS surprise was +16.8%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Nucor is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Nucor. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In terms of specific trends during the March quarter, Akoustis had 2 greater than 10% customers, XBAW-related sales drove the top 5 customers and 7 out of the top 10 customers. Our top 10 customers made up 59% of revenue, our top 25 customers made up 75% of revenue. In terms of regional sales, 3 out of 5 and 5 out of our top 10 customers were Asia-based. Further, we added a 5G mobile customer into our top 5 customer ranking. And finally, our top 2 customers in Q3 increased their sequential revenue with Akoustis by 335% and 79%, respectively.Moving on. During our last call, we highlighted several macro challenges that led to broad weakness in our SAW filter business across multiple markets, including automotive, IoT, medical devices, particularly in China and Europe. During the March quarter, we experienced some recovery across each of these markets, although forward visibility in China remains challenging.Despite persistent economic challenges, we expect to continue top line growth in the June quarter, driven by XBAW unit growth, continued improvement in our SAW filter business and favorable seasonal trends in our wafer service business. We expect to ship additional filters to our first Tier 1 5G mobile customer, and we have entered the U.S. carrier market in WiFi as highlighted in a recent announcement. We expect further growth from our consumer and enterprise class WiFi customers, including HP Aruba. And finally, we continue to execute on our contract business with DARPA as we are involved in multiple projects that are redefining the capabilities of XBAW technology.Furthermore, we continue to expect incremental sequential revenue growth each quarter throughout the calendar year as we execute across multiple markets and our growing product portfolio, which includes Akoustis XBAW Solutions, SAW filter, crystal timing products and wafer services.For the June quarter, our current backlog supports sequential revenue growth in a range of 10% to 20%. We remain focused on driving revenue and unit growth across all our target end markets with a particular emphasis on 5G mobile and infrastructure, WiFi 6E and 7 AP, IoT and automotive applications. As indicated in January, we began shipping high-volume XBAW filter solutions to our first 5G mobile customer in the March quarter.I would now like to take a moment to discuss recent developments involving the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022. The CHIPS Act was signed into law on August 9, 2022, and is designed to boost U.S. competitiveness, innovation and national security. The law aims to infuse investments in domestic semiconductor manufacturing capacity as well as jump start R&amp;D and commercialization of leading-edge nanotechnologies and create new regional high-tech hubs. The domestic manufacturing program is being implemented by the Department of Commerce or DOC, R&amp;D investments in nanotechnology and the creation of regional high-tech hubs are being driven by the Department of Defense, or DoD. Akoustis' current activity related to chips includes proposal activity with both DoC and DoD related to programs for domestic semiconductor manufacturing, R&amp;D and commercialization of leading-edge nanotechnologies.As of today, we have one DoD proposal, which was submitted during the March quarter with Akoustis as the lead contractor focused on electronic warfare or EW, for defense applications. The proposed 5-year contract, if awarded has an initial program budget of over $150 million, our proposal incorporates multiple partners, including over 10 industrial and government labs as well as numerous university partners focused on the goal of developing and manufacturing semiconductors into advanced RF modules at our 57-acre campus located in upstate New York.One of the technologies we seek to integrate into our New York campus includes the breakthrough high-frequency XBAW research from our existing DARPA contract. It is worth noting that the program is a competitive process, and we expect the DoD to announce their award selections by mid-summer.Akoustis is active in expanding its domestic manufacturing footprint, including both semiconductors and advanced packaging at our New York campus under the DoC CHIPS For America program. The application is a multistage process, which is outlined clearly in the Notice of Funding Opportunity or NOFO, consistent with the published process, Akoustis submitted its statement of interest or SOI, in late March. We are currently in the middle of the pre-application process with full application submissions beginning by the end of this quarter.In parallel, we are working closely with the local, regional and state government of New York for financial support to include in our application, which is due later this quarter. We expect the chips application to include multiple semiconductor partners, which intend to manufacture semiconductor materials, wafers and/or packaging on our campus. As far as magnitude of our DoC application, we plan to propose a project contemplating spending up to approximately twice our current market cap to establish 200-millimeter silicon wafer manufacturing capability as well as a U.S. advanced packaging center. As per the NOFO, a chips award is expected to include a grant refundable investment tax credit, or ITC, and direct loans and loan guarantees. The mix of these components will determine the attractiveness of the DoC CHIPS for America Program for our company.We are aware of the targets in the NOFO and are currently in discovery with the DoC to optimize various components to suit a small-cap company like Akoustis. We believe the DoC wants this program to be successful for all sizes of companies, and they have been very attentive regarding our concerns and requests. We expect to have clarity by our next quarterly investor call. Beyond those 2 specific programs, we will continue to seek opportunities to leverage this CHIPS Act program.Next, I would now like to discuss several compelling updates in our primary target markets, beginning with 5G mobile. During the March quarter, we successfully ramped our first 5G mobile filter product with a Tier 1 RF component customer. This customer has designed a multiplexer using our XBAW technology, which is on a reference design with a Tier 1 chipset maker. Our customer is currently sampling its multiplexer with multiple Tier 1 and Tier 2 handset OEMs, and we currently expect multiple mobile handset design wins in the next 3 to 6 months.In addition, in the March quarter, we successfully delivered to one of our Tier 1 RF module maker customers, the second of 2 customer design XBAW filters. We delivered the first filter in the December quarter and the customer has begun characterization and testing of both XBAW filters for down selection. And finally, we delivered the second iteration of a first XBAW filter sample to our second Tier 1 5G mobile module customer for a module that is expected to ship in late calendar 2025.Looking ahead, our expected milestones for the June quarter in 5G mobile include the successful completion of an on-site quality audit of our New York fab by a Tier 1 mobile device OEM. Continued delivery of our high-volume XBAW shipments to our first Tier 1 customer to secure a second XBAW RF filter development order from our first 5G mobile customer for a product that is expected to ramp production in the second half of calendar 2024.And finally, to deliver 2 new WiFi 6E, 7 XBAW foundry filter products to our Tier 2 5G RF module customer for access points and mobile applications.Next, I would like to discuss our recent developments in the WiFi market. During the March quarter, we completed the development of our new 4 Series 5.6 gigahertz and 6.6 gigahertz WiFi 6E, 7, XBAW filter solutions that enable broader use of the UNII-1 through 4 bands involved in high-frequency Wi-Fi architectures. Furthermore, we ramped initial production volumes with a multibillion-dollar U.S.-based carrier in the cable market. The customer is using our WiFi 6E XBAW filter solutions to deliver last mile connectivity to both the home and business markets. This is 1 of 3 carrier-focused WiFi design wins we announced during the December 2022 quarter, and we expect the other 2 customers to begin shipping in the near term.We received our first WiFi 7 design win during the March quarter as we announced in our press release on May 3. This customer is a Tier 1 enterprise OEM and has ordered our recently announced 5.5 gigahertz and 6.5 gigahertz XBAW filters. And finally, in March, we began a relationship with a new Tier 2 RF module customer for the WiFi access point market. This customer is a growing Asia-based RF module maker that is rapidly becoming a dominant RF player in its region. We have received an order from this new customer for the development of new WiFi 7 XBAW filters for the access point market, which we expect to deliver in the second half of calendar 2023.Looking ahead, our anticipated milestones for our WiFi business in the June quarter include sampling next-generation XBAW filters to Tier 1 enterprise OEM for a new WiFi 7 platform, enabling full utilization of UNII 1 through 4 and UNII 5 through 8 bands. Secondly, we expect to receive 2 additional WiFi 6E 7 design wins. And finally, we plan to sample our new 5.6 gigahertz and 6.6 gigahertz WiFi 6E 7 XBAW filters to multiple customers during the quarter.I will now discuss our progress in our network infrastructure business. During the March quarter, we continued XBAW filter shipments to our 5G small cell infrastructure customer as well as the U.S. CBRS market. We continue to expect the small cell market to improve in the second half of calendar 2023 and into calendar 2024 as carriers throughout the U.S., Europe and Middle East and Africa begin to deploy sub-5 gigahertz networks due to the increased data demand.We expect carriers to deploy small cells in greater numbers in 5G networks to expand capacity and improve service. We continue to promote our 5G infrastructure solutions, and I'm pleased to announce today, have successfully secured reference design wins with a leading 5G transceiver OEM for multiple XBAW filters. This reference design is targeting Tier 2 small cell OEMs. During the March quarter, we expected to deliver initial samples of a new 5G band 41 network infrastructure filter.While we completed initial samples, we continue to work on the design to improve both power handling and small signal RF response and plan to ship samples thereafter. We are also expecting to receive a development order for a new 5G n77 filter from a Tier 1 European 5G network infrastructure OEM likely in the current June quarter.Therefore, our milestones for the June quarter are we expect to sample a new band 41 XBAW filter for the U.S. small cell market. We expect to receive an order for a new 5G n77 XBAW filter for the massive MIMO market.And finally, I would like to provide an update on our defense and other businesses. We made significant strides in our defense and other business segments in the March quarter with the introduction of our new XBAW filter solution that addresses the challenging coexistent requirements of the C-V2X spectrum for the automotive market. While we have been involved in the automotive market through our RFMI/SAW-filter catalog components, the introduction of our new XBAW solution for C-V2X should significantly expand our potential TAM in automotive.Our new filter targets the automotive, DSRC 802.11p, high-power systems, telematics and infotainment segments, C-V2X operates between 5.855 and 5.925 gigahertz and allows for device to device and device to network connections for multiple applications aiming at providing safe and effective communication in vehicles. Our new patented filter delivers low insertion loss pass-band performance and enables high-power handling capabilities that establish long-range connectivity for C-V2X applications. We began sampling our new C-V2X filter solution with Tier 1 and Tier 2 automotive industry leaders and expect to update the investment community as we receive feedback in the coming months.During the March quarter, we also finished qualification of 1 of 2 timing control resonator solutions for our first timing control customer. We were expecting to qualify both XBAW resonator products, but the customer has asked for a relatively large bandwidth shift from 1 of the 2 resonators. We expect this will be redesigned and qualified quickly.In our Defense contract business, we continue to progress on our existing multiyear, multimillion-dollar contract with DARPA to further enhance our XBAW PDK and scale our XBAW technology up to 18 gigahertz.We achieved a critical milestone during the March quarter and are making excellent progress towards scaling our technology to 18 gigahertz with an improved figure of merit. The milestone achieved was enabled by our patented single crystal piezoelectric nano materials, which are unique to Akoustis and the BAW filter industry.And finally, during the March quarter, we concluded the acquisition of GDSI which closed on January 1, 2023. The acquisition brings a new cash flow positive service business to Akoustis with 250-plus customers, significant technical expertise in back-end services and alignment with our strategy to leverage the CHIPS Act to create new jobs and reshore core packaging technology from Asia.We have begun integrating GDSI into our systems and corporate structure and look forward to both leveraging their significant knowledge of back-end workflow and provide the resources necessary to grow the business as advanced semiconductor packaging demand increase in the United States as the CHIPS Act drives reshoring of production back to America.For the June 2023 quarter, our expected milestones in our Defense and other business segment includes the completion and qualification of the second XBAW resonator for our timing control customer. Additionally, we plan to broaden the sampling of our new C-V2X filter solution for the automotive market. And finally, we expect to secure $1 million-plus new development order from a Tier 1 defense customer for the development of a switch filter module using our XBAW filter technology.And now I would like to hand the call over to Ken to go through our financial highlights.Kenneth E. BollerThank you, Jeff. For the third quarter ended March 31, 2023, the company reported revenue of $7.4 million, which is an increase of more than 25% over the prior quarter ended December 31, 2022, and represents an increase of 160% year-over-year. On a GAAP basis, operating loss was $17.3 million for the March quarter, mainly driven by revenue of $7.4 million, offset by labor costs of $11.3 million, depreciation and amortization of $3.1 million and other operational costs totaling $10.3 million. As a result, GAAP net loss per share was $0.23. On a non-GAAP basis, operating loss was $13.2 million and non-GAAP net loss per share was $0.20. Reconciliation of these amounts to the corresponding GAAP measures is available in the press release issued this morning available on the Investors section of our corporate website. CapEx spending for Q3 was $2.2 million, a decline from $3.2 million in the prior quarter as we placed into service the last of our ordered equipment and near completion of the company's New York fab expansion. Cash used in operating activities was $9.9 million, which represents the second quarter in a row of double-digit improvement as operating cash spending was down another 12% from $11.2 million in the prior quarter.The company exited the March quarter with $52.7 million of cash and cash equivalents versus $46.6 million at the end of the previous quarter, primarily resulting from net proceeds of $32 million from our secondary offering in January, offset by cash used to fund our recent GDSI acquisition of $13.9 million and operations and CapEx spending. In the current June quarter, we expect multiple new WiFi 6 and network infrastructure customers to ramp production, and therefore, we expect to see record revenue and continued operating cash flow improvement with revenue up between 10% and 20% sequentially from the March quarter. And based upon our growing backlog of design wins, we anticipate that robust top line growth will continue into our next fiscal year and beyond.I will now turn the call back over to Jeff for his closing comments.Jeffrey B. ShealyThank you, Ken. Before I wrap up the call, I would like to provide a brief update on pending litigation matters. With respect to the lawsuit Qorvo filed against Akoustis in Delaware back in 2021, alleging false advertising, unfair competition and patent infringement. A lot has happened since the lawsuit began in what's called a claim construction order, the court ruled on the interpretation of some key terms in one of the Qorvo patents as well as the Akoustis patent, which Qorvo claims Akoustis improperly marked on its product data sheet. The company believes the claim construction order was favorable to Akoustis and will ultimately support Akoustis' position of noninfringement and that its marking of product data sheets was correct. While Akoustis does not believe that Qorvo's assertion of its patents has any merit, it has developed and delivered to customers and Qorvo's lawyers, filter samples with designs, which we believe demonstrate that Akoustis' products past and present do not infringe the patent asserted by Qorvo. As an added precaution, Akoustis has begun implementing these design updates into new and existing product designs as an appropriate measure to mitigate the potential impact of any adverse ruling in the Qorvo lawsuit. You may be aware that in February 2023, Qorvo filed a second amended complaint, which introduced new allegations against the company, including misappropriation of trade secrets. With respect to these new allegations and the other nonpatent portions of the complaint, based upon the information made available to it, the company believes it has meritorious defenses and plans to defend itself vigorously.As disclosed today in our quarterly report on April 20, 2023, Akoustis filed its own patent infringement lawsuit against Qorvo in Federal Court in the Eastern District of Texas. Akoustis is represented by a highly regarded patent litigation firm McKool Smith. As with all litigation, the company needs to be mindful of any comments it makes regarding this lawsuit, particularly at this early stage. However, our investors should rest assured that the company took this step deliberately after careful due diligence and consideration of potential risks and benefits to the company.And now I would like to finish by stating that notwithstanding a persistent, challenging macro environment for the broader semiconductor industry, we are positioned to continue to deliver sequential top line revenue and unit growth for the foreseeable future. During the March quarter, we introduced new products, including our 5.6 and 6.6 gigahertz, Wi-Fi 6E and 7 filters as well as our new C-V2X filter, all of which are currently sampling. And for the first time, we began shipping into the U.S. cable carrier market as well as to the 5G mobile market.During the June quarter, we expect to experience further top line growth as we expand the number of customers in production across each of our major markets.In conclusion, we believe the market opportunity for our patented high-frequency XBAW filters is substantial. As of April 28, we have 89 issued patents and 124 patents pending as we continue to build a substantial IP moat around our technology. We continue to work diligently to achieve each of our stated objectives, and we will continue to provide updates on our execution against these objectives going forward.Finally, I would once again like to thank our employees for their hard work, passion and dedication, which accounts for multiple design wins across the Wi-Fi, 5G network infrastructure and defense markets, we've also experienced exceptional momentum in the 5G mobile market, driven by our industry-leading XBAW filters that operate above 3 gigahertz and our new and expanding wafer-level packaging capabilities.I also wish to thank our shareholders who continue to support the company. And with that, I would like to open the call for questions from the investment community.Operator, please go ahead with the first question.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from Anthony Stoss with Craig-Hallum Capital Group.Anthony Joseph StossSolid execution. Jeff, I wanted to follow up on the series of comments you made about 5G Mobile. It's nice to see that customer get out of the game here in the March quarter. Two parts. Do you expect that customer to be up sequentially in revs for the June quarter? Then maybe just kind of a broad picture, all your opportunities in mobile, what you expect kind of the ramp to look like? And then I wanted to throw in one for Dave. Prior conference calls, you guys have talked about being breakeven or profitable in the first half of calendar 2024. Do you still expect that to happen?Jeffrey B. ShealyI appreciate your kind comments. So let's jump into them. In terms of 5G mobile customer, yes, we do expect that customer to be up during the June quarter, sequentially. That's our current expectation. And we would say we have seen some slowing of the original ramp that we expected. But in terms of that customer will be up sequentially quarter-over-quarter is our full expectation and continued ramp in the second half as well. And in terms of our prior comments in terms of annual usage of this particular solution, we think that we still see healthy volumes for this particular product, both on a reference design as well as directly marketed to the Tier 1 market. So in terms of overall ramps and activity with customers, we have this first customer with the retro design ramp that we've previously communicated, also have seen significant activity with marketing directly to the Tier 1 market. And if you look -- we noted in the script that we have -- we fully expect in the June quarter to complete a successful audit from one of those Tier 1 mobile smartphone players. And beyond that, we've stated the next ramp we expect from a second customer would be in the 2025 time frame. So with that, I'll hand it over to Dave for just in terms of customer funnel activity that's driving us to profitability.David M. AicheleI think just a couple of other comments with regards to what Jeff said is that with this one, Tier 1 component supplier, we got the reference design that we continue to see the ramp and particularly picking up second half of this year. We identified another design activity that we've got ongoing that should be in the second half of -- or first half of next year, and that's going to an OEM. And then you can expect that there's several other designs right behind that as well. The antenna (inaudible) working with this Tier 1 component supplier to create these hybrid designs. It's a combination of their passive technology and our BAW technology. So it's a very healthy positive relationship with this customer. And as far as ramping for profitability and Ken can add some more color. We've got good design activity and visibility on programs with 5G mobile being probably the largest growth sector. And then the WiFi activity that we have ongoing, both with WiFi 6E and WiFi 7 continuing to feed the funnel there. We do have sunset programs that we've got to deal with as they go out of production and you get programs to replace. But WiFi is still very healthy and robust, and the infrastructure sector is going to continue add. I expect that there will be an uptick in next year as we look at releasing more products. We've been focusing a lot on WiFi. Now we're shifting some of the design resources to the infrastructure market as well.And then finally is just the other segments that we service with the GDSI and RFMi acquisitions. Everything is starting to see a rebound from RFMi. And then the GDSI is very healthy in that respect.So Ken?Kenneth E. BollerI will add to that. We -- in the past have said operating cash flow breakeven would occur by the June quarter. And I still have that modeled as such. I will add that our cash use in operating activities continues to improve with another 12% reduction in the spend of $9.9 million this quarter on top of a 25% reduction that happened in Q2. I will expect that to continue to improve with our operating cash flow burn rate going down each successive quarter and then breakeven, I still expect to occur in the next 12 months and approximately $15 million to $18 million of revenue per quarter depending on our mix.Anthony Joseph StossAnd if I could throw one more at Dave. Just on the auto opportunity. I know it takes notoriously a long time to break into the auto sector. What do you think the revenue ramp or timing of that might look like for you guys?David M. AicheleThat's a good question, Tony. The good news is that we've got visibility within the automotive market through the RFMi acquisition. They're already an approved supplier to several Tier 1 and also Tier 2 suppliers and subcomponent suppliers in the automotive market. And so we're going to continue to leverage that relationship that they have with these suppliers, but it typically takes about 2 years plus with new designs, new programs to really see substantial ramp. You'll get some volume in the next 1 to 2 years being in the hundreds of thousands to maybe low million, but really to get to the higher volume, it's going to be 2 years out. So we're working that channel right now to really focus on the C-V2X. But we also have traction with TCU telematic control units that are looking at 5G and WiFi and then also with the GPS sector, we're both promoting the SAW technology and the BAW technology. So yes, I expect that for the next 1 to 2 years, automotive will be still a smaller segment than the WiFi and the 5G mobile, but it will be one of our growth sectors that we see probably 2 years out.OperatorOur next question comes from Suji Desilva with ROTH MKM.Suji DesilvaCongrats on the progress here. So on some of the customers here, the -- in the WiFi market, the cable service providers, you said you had 3 programs, one starting. Are all 3 of those programs similar sizes? Or is any one of those particularly bigger?David M. AicheleSo the -- this is Dave. So the program that we have announced is in the PR and also a commented in the script today is the highest volume program, it's pretty substantial. It's on the gateway unit, and it's a 4x4 MIMO and then the other 2 programs; they're more of the extenders. So it's not as high volume. You're still seeing the architecture that's a massive [mind burning] multi-user MIMO. But they're also a smaller percentage. So in some respects, it could be 0.5 or less percentage of the bigger programs. But the traction that we're getting in the carrier market, and we're also starting to work on next-generation WiFi 7, where we're dealing directly with the carriers and then working those program design wins through to the ODM is working really well in the Akoustis' favor. And one of the things that we've been able to do is become a leader in developing a portfolio of different BAW products. So any of our BAW competitors that are approaching the WiFi market may be approaching with 2 or 4 filters. We have greater than 12 filters targeting the WiFi market. Supporting tri-band and upcoming quad-band and upcoming penta-band design. So the carrier market is one of our focus areas as well as the enterprise, which we have a strong position already.Suji DesilvaSounds good, Dave. And then my other question is on the manufacturing side, the New York fab. It sounds like you're at the back end of these equipment orders. When does that install complete? And then will you, at that point, have all the equipment needed to bring up the 500 million unit capacity you're planning?Jeffrey B. ShealyIt's Jeff. I appreciate your initial comments as well. So in terms of -- I would characterize that expansion. The tooling aspect of that is in the wind-down phase in terms of ordering, receiving as well as installation. There is -- there has been some straggler pieces of equipment that have come in to complete the redundancy. But in terms of the factory being tooled for the 500 million filters, we're essentially complete as we've characterized. And we'll manage that. We -- the company meets -- internally, we meet monthly between sales and operations and make sure that we're forecasting our capacity and making sure that we're ready from the manufacturing front. And clearly, we're monitoring cycle times as well as yields very carefully in the factory to make sure all of those pieces are together to optimize our manufacturing cost.OperatorOur next question comes from Robert Aguanno with Piper Sandler.Robert AguannoRobert Aguanno on for Harsh Kumar here. I want to discuss the potential timing of the potential award from the DoD. And maybe how will that award be split between Akoustis as well as your partners? And then I have a follow-up.Jeffrey B. ShealyRobert, I appreciate you being on the call today. In terms of the timing, if you take a look at some of the language we had in the script, what you'll see is that particular proposal was submitted in the March quarter. And so that -- and that was consistent with the timing of the announcement in terms of the request for proposals. In terms of when we expect that proposal to be approved and received feedback from the end customer. As I think we indicated in the script in the July time frame is when we would expect that. Once that goes through that selection process -- there's a follow-on administrative, once you're selected and make it through that gate, there's a follow-on proposal for really the end projects that have to be submitted. And so I think you're really looking at some -- an award a fully -- a contract award sometime around the end of the year would be our expectations. So it will take a little time to finish that, and we would be expecting to start that hub in probably Q1 of next year. In terms of -- as we also outlined, you asked about the split, we mentioned there's multiple partners, but we are the principal contractor -- and the -- we mentioned there's 10 industrial and government labs. There's multiple technology partners. But as the lead hub, if you will, of the program, there's a significant proportion of those proceeds go to the hub establishment and operation. I would also add that the way that program is structured, those multiple partners are actually transferring tech to our campus for manufacturing, which I think has the end effect of ultimately the manufacturing being done on our Canandaigua chip fab. So it's not just -- we're not just an administrator of a program. I think there's a good strategy behind it. There's -- we mentioned its focus in the electronic warfare, and we're bringing to bear the appropriate technologies to make that not only that program successful, but also fit our long-term strategic goal of integration of key solutions for, in this case, the Department of Defense.Robert AguannoAnd just more of a macro-oriented question. Last week, I think we saw a couple of the 5G names cite certain weaknesses in the macro market. Can you talk maybe how the current weakness in the broader market may impact your outlook going forward for that business?David M. AicheleRobert, this is Dave. With respect to the 5G mobile, a lot of the macroeconomic comments being made are really impacting the Tier 1 component suppliers that are focused on that market segment. It really hasn't impacted us too much in that we are relatively new to that market segment, particularly with the Tier 1, our component supplier that we've aligned with the reference design that we're engaged with is focusing on the China mobile market. So the -- I think Jeff mentioned earlier in the Q&amp;A that it hasn't ramped to earlier expectations due to the dynamics that are going on in the China mobile market as it works through the inventory levels and demand starts to pick back up, which we are seeing. We're keeping our finger on the pulse with the market and also with our Tier 1 provider or player. With respect to other segments, macro side, the WiFi market had a pretty good surge with respect to COVID on the number of systems shipped. There's been some slowdown. And also, we're seeing some transition from WiFi 6 designs that are being put on the shelf to focus on WiFi 7, so there's some dynamics that we're working through. But we've got a significant amount of number of engagements with the active customers and with the on-tech customers that we will work through this and continue to see sequential growth in this segment that will continue to pick up the next year.And then finally, just on the base station side, the small cell markets is still robust, but it's, as I think, historical prospect has been, it's not been at the level that is required or that you would expect. But we do see some demand in Asian markets and also in the Europe markets and picking up in the U.S. markets as well.OperatorWe are closing our question-and-answer session. Now I would like to turn the floor back over to Jeff Shealy for closing comments. Please go ahead.Jeffrey B. ShealyI want to take the opportunity to thank everyone for your time today and participation. We look forward to speaking to you during our next update call to discuss the June quarter's execution against the milestones we shared as well as our future expectations we communicate. Have a great day and thank you again.OperatorThis concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect your lines. Thank you for your participation, and have a great day.]"

Breast and lung cancer are the leading types of cancer diagnosed and are responsible for almost 4.5 million deaths worldwide.2 By 2040, the global burden for cancer is expected to grow to 27.5 million new cancer cases and 16.3 million cancer deaths.3 Under the agreement, Thermo Fisher will identify local labs that will be using the company's NGS technology and ensure they have the necessary infrastructure, trained staff, and quality control measures to meet industry standards for NGS testing services for breast and lung cancer. Pfizer will explore ways to enable affordable patient access for NGS testing for these types of cancer and work to raise healthcare provider awareness regarding the benefits of advanced testing. The two companies will continue to evaluate opportunities to expand geographically and to expand testing for other types of cancer.Story continues""Anyone facing a cancer diagnosis should have access to cutting-edge testing that can match them with an appropriate, optimized treatment plan and better inform their care. Today, we aim to bring rapid NGS testing to an increased number of decentralized labs, closer to where patients are treated,"" said Gianluca Pettiti, executive vice president at Thermo Fisher Scientific. ""We are moving one step closer to delivering precision insights to underserved patients so they can receive a more tailored path for their care no matter where they are in the world.""""The more we understand the complex science behind cancer, the better we can treat it. Our experience has taught us that cancer cannot always be treated with a broad brush and often requires an individualized approach based on precise disease characteristics,"" said Nick Lagunowich, Pfizer Global President of Emerging Markets. ""In many parts of the world, access to next-generation sequencing may be limited or unaffordable for cancer patients. This program aims to improve their treatment journey and help increase their chances for improved outcomes.""Single gene testing has historically been used to match patients with appropriate targeted therapies. However, this can be a time intensive process if sequential tests are needed and there may not be enough tissue to run every test – which may require additional biopsy procedures. As more targeted therapies are available that can be matched through a broader set of genomic markers, next-generation sequencing is quickly replacing sequential, single biomarker tests. By screening a single tumor tissue or blood sample for multiple biomarkers simultaneously, NGS can provide clinical teams with rapid and actionable genomic insights to help inform precision oncology treatment decisions for eligible patients.4A retrospective observational real-world data study looked at newly diagnosed stage IV non-small cell lung cancer patients, and found outcomes such as apparent survival and time to next treatment were significantly compromised if actionable mutations were identified after systemic treatment was initiated (e.g. chemotherapy and immunotherapy). However, when treatment was initiated based on molecular results, patients experienced better outcomes compared to patients who were treated prior to receiving molecular results, supporting the need for rapid molecular testing to inform better treatment decisions.5About Pfizer Inc.: Breakthroughs that Change Patients’ LivesAt Pfizer, we apply science and our global resources to bring therapies to people that extend and significantly improve their lives.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Scientific Instruments Stocks To Buy. Scientific instruments are tools used to measure, record, and indicate physical quantities, aiding in scientific research and new product development. These instruments are designed to accomplish theoretical research and can be used to measure, analyze, and verify the properties of materials and elements. Scientific instruments play a crucial role in developing new products and improving existing ones. As per Data Bridge Market Research, the scientific instruments market is predicted to increase from $41.13 billion in 2022 to $58.05 billion by 2030, experiencing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.4% between 2023 and 2030.According to the latest report by IMARC Group, the global market is being driven by the increasing emphasis on R&amp;D in developing new products and the growing collaboration between governments and manufacturers to improve the effectiveness of scientific instruments. The growth of testing and research facilities in biotechnology and pharmaceuticals, along with heavy investments in the healthcare sector by many countries, is also contributing to market growth. Additionally, the rising demand for generics and biosimilars, and pharmaceutical companies' focus on improving drug development processes and product quality, is driving the demand for high-quality scientific instruments. The market is further boosted by the growing need for better analysis equipment and the rapid advancements in neuroscience and applied microbiology. Allied Market Research has categorized the global scientific instruments market into different segments. The firm stated that the clinical analyzers segment is expected to generate the highest revenue during the forecast period from 2021 to 2030, driven by the increasing adoption of point of care testing devices and laboratory automation, and the rise in chronic conditions that require clinical analyzers for diagnosis. Moreover, the research segment is expected to experience the fastest compound annual growth rate due to the rising demand for scientific instruments in the research of chronic conditions such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and neurological diseases, and the development of advanced instruments for research purposes. Lastly, the hospitals &amp; diagnostic laboratories segment is the dominant end-user segment, driven by the escalating number of outpatients and inpatients in hospitals, and the adoption of newer methods and advanced instruments for research purposes in diagnostic laboratories. Story continuesTo benefit from the growth opportunities in the scientific instruments market, investors can pick up stocks like Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO), Agilent Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:A), and Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR). Our Methodology We scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 943 hedge funds and picked the top 10 companies that operate in the scientific instruments sector with the highest number of hedge fund investors. These are the best scientific instruments stocks to buy according to hedge funds.10 Best Scientific Instruments Stocks To BuyVereshchagin Dmitry/Shutterstock.comBest Scientific Instruments Stocks To Buy10. Mirion Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:MIR)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 28Mirion Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:MIR) offers a range of products and services related to the detection, measurement, analysis, and monitoring of radiation. The company is divided into two main segments – Medical and Industrial, each focusing on specific areas of expertise. Mirion Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:MIR) serves a wide range of customers including healthcare facilities, research laboratories, military organizations, government agencies, industrial companies, power and utility companies, reactor design firms, and nuclear power plants. On May 3, the company reported a Q1 GAAP EPS of -$0.22 and a revenue of $182.1 million, up 11.6% year-over-year and beating estimates by $2.90 million. On February 15, Citi analyst Andrew Kaplowitz raised the firm's price target on Mirion Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:MIR) to $11 from $10 and maintained a Buy rating on the shares following the ""solid"" Q4 results. Kaplowitz considers Mirion's initial 2023 guidance to be both cautious and promising, suggesting a continued growth trajectory for the company.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 28 hedge funds were long Mirion Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:MIR), compared to 26 funds in the prior quarter. Anand Parekh’s Alyeska Investment Group is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 7.7 million shares worth $51.2 million. Like Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO), Agilent Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:A), and Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR), Mirion Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:MIR) is one of the best scientific instruments stocks to invest in. Here is what Baron Growth Fund has to say about Mirion Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:MIR) in its Q4 2021 investor letter:“This quarter, the Fund initiated a position in Mirion Technologies, Inc., a leader in ionizing radiation detection and measurement technologies to the medical, laboratory, and nuclear power industries. The business consists of a portfolio of niche, mission-critical products that represent a small portion of a project’s costs but can cause extensive collateral damage if they fail. Products include dosimeters that monitor radiation levels of medical professionals, quality assurance equipment and software for nuclear medicine treatments, and instrumentation and equipment that is core to the construction, operation, and decommissioning of nuclear power plants.We think that Mirion has the potential to be a compelling industrial compounder. The company is already the largest player in over 80% of its end markets, and in aggregate is approximately 3.5 times larger than its nearest competitor. We estimate that Mirion’s end markets should grow at 5% to 6% annually, driven by favorable secular trends and a consistent replacement cycle. We expect Mirion to grow in line with or ahead of its end markets on an organic basis, as it leverages its scale advantage to take modest market share. Organic growth should be complemented by Mirion’s successful acquisition strategy, driving aggregate growth into the double digit range. In addition, we believe the company has an opportunity to expand markets by 500 bps-plus of margin over time through a favorable mix shift, higher utilization rates, and ongoing M&amp;A synergy realization.We believe that Mirion boasts a capable and accomplished senior management team. CEO Tom Logan has been with the company since 2005 and has led the strategy that has grown Mirion’s revenues from $123 million at inception to approximately $700 million currently. The new chairman of Mirion, Larry Kingsley, has a strong history of shareholder value creation as the former CEO of industrial technology leaders Pall Corporation and IDEX Corporation. We think his expertise will be well utilized as Mirion embarks on its next stage of growth.”9. Fortive Corporation (NYSE:FTV)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 33Fortive Corporation (NYSE:FTV) specializes in the design, development, manufacturing, marketing, and servicing of professional and engineered products, software, and services. Fortive Corporation (NYSE:FTV)’s Intelligent Operating Solutions segment focuses on providing advanced instrumentation such as electrical test and measurement tools. These offerings cater to a wide range of industries such as manufacturing, process industries, healthcare, utilities and power, communications, electronics, and others. It is one of the best scientific instruments stocks to invest in. On April 26, Fortive Corporation (NYSE:FTV) reported a Q1 non-GAAP EPS of $0.75 and a revenue of $1.46 billion, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.02 and $40 million, respectively. JPMorgan analyst Stephen Tusa raised the firm's price target on Fortive Corporation (NYSE:FTV) on April 27 to $78 from $77 and maintained an Overweight rating on the shares. The analyst informed investors that Fortive reported better-than-expected results for Q1, surpassing expectations in terms of organic growth and margins. As a result, the analyst has raised estimates to reflect the company's strong performance at the beginning of the year.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 33 hedge funds were bullish on Fortive Corporation (NYSE:FTV), compared to 29 funds in the prior quarter. Phill Gross and Robert Atchinson’s Adage Capital Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 4.48 million shares worth $288.3 million. Cooper Investors made the following comment about Fortive Corporation (NYSE:FTV) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Fortive Corporation (NYSE:FTV) completed several acquisitions and had probably its best year operationally since the 2016 spin-off from Danaher, reporting several quarters in a row of double-digit organic growth and margin expansion that beat market estimates. The business has now unlocked the potential we always saw in it, with software accounting for almost a quarter of revenues today, providing a nice element of recurring cash flow to support the more cyclical industrial parts of the group.”8. Teledyne Technologies Incorporated (NYSE:TDY)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 34Teledyne Technologies Incorporated (NYSE:TDY) delivers technological solutions that drive growth in industrial markets worldwide. The company's Instrumentation segment specializes in providing monitoring and control instruments used in marine, environmental, industrial, and other applications. Additionally, Teledyne Technologies Incorporated (NYSE:TDY) offers electronic test and measurement equipment, as well as power and communications connectivity devices for distributed instrumentation systems and sensor networks. It is one of the best scientific instruments stocks to watch. On April 26, Teledyne Technologies Incorporated (NYSE:TDY) reported a Q1 non-GAAP EPS of $4.53 and a revenue of $1.38 billion, topping Wall Street estimates by $0.10 and $10 million, respectively. Needham analyst James Ricchiuti maintained a Buy rating on Teledyne Technologies Incorporated (NYSE:TDY) but lowered the firm's price target on the shares to $470 on April 28. The analyst informed investors that Teledyne Technologies Incorporated (NYSE:TDY)’s Q1 results were considered solid, with consistent demand and margins. However, the company's earnings guidance fell short of consensus expectations. Nevertheless, Needham highlights Teledyne Technologies Incorporated (NYSE:TDY)’s diverse portfolio of businesses, its demonstrated track record of success even in uncertain economic times, and its strong financial position, all of which should provide support to the stock at its current levels.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 34 hedge funds were long Teledyne Technologies Incorporated (NYSE:TDY), compared to 38 funds in the prior quarter. Select Equity Group is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 2.26 million shares worth $906 million. Here is what Artisan Partners specifically said about Teledyne Technologies Incorporated (NYSE:TDY) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“We trimmed our position in Teledyne Technologies Incorporated (NYSE:TDY) during Q2 as shares approached our PMV estimate. Teledyne is a supplier of enabling technologies to sense, transmit and analyze information for a diverse group of end markets, including aerospace &amp; defense, factory automation, medical imaging, oil &amp; gas, pharmaceutical research and environmental monitoring. The company is delivering healthy organic growth despite headwinds from semiconductor shortages, led by particular strength in its dental and industrial imaging. Margins and cash flows have accelerated as management has successfully integrated its 2021 acquisition of FLIR Systems, a leader in thermal imaging systems. Meanwhile, Teledyne’s shares have recently benefited from an anticipated increase in demand from Western governments seeking to supply Ukraine with military equipment. The company’s aerospace and defense segment is not core to our thesis—Teledyne’s margins and top-line growth have benefited for over a decade from reducing exposure to this area and placing more emphasis on asset-light businesses—though in the current environment it will likely experience a period of elevated demand.”7. PerkinElmer, Inc. (NYSE:PKI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 34PerkinElmer, Inc. (NYSE:PKI) offers a wide range of products, services, and solutions to various markets including diagnostics, life sciences, and applied services. The company operates through two main segments – Discovery &amp; Analytical Solutions and Diagnostics. Via the Discovery &amp; Analytical Solutions segment, PerkinElmer, Inc. (NYSE:PKI) provides scientists with instruments, reagents, informatics, software, subscriptions, detection, and imaging technologies. These offerings aim to facilitate research breakthroughs in the life sciences research market, as well as provide contract research and laboratory services. It is one of the premier scientific instruments stocks to invest in. On March 9, Citi analyst Patrick Donnelly put ""positive catalyst watches"" on shares of PerkinElmer, Inc. (NYSE:PKI) following the Q4 reports. For PerkinElmer, Inc. (NYSE:PKI), the analyst expects potential upside from a China diagnostics recovery and a ""compelling valuation.""According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 34 hedge funds were bullish on PerkinElmer, Inc. (NYSE:PKI), compared to 30 funds in the last quarter. Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 1.28 million shares worth $179.5 million. Renaissance Large Cap Growth Strategy made the following comment about PerkinElmer, Inc. (NYSE:PKI) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Conversely, we sold our position in PerkinElmer, Inc. (NYSE:PKI) following a deterioration in fundamental factors. After a careful review, we believe the prudent decision is to step aside until the company completes the divestiture of its Applied, Food, and Enterprise Services business to private equity. While it allows PerkinElmer to become a pure-play Life Sciences &amp; Diagnostics business, the divestiture will also produce a company that may operate with under-utilized assets until the new management team can deploy capital to rebuild its revenue base following the loss of approximately 30% of revenues.”6. Roper Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:ROP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 41Roper Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:ROP) specializes in designing and developing software, as well as technology-enabled products and solutions. Furthermore, Roper Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:ROP) also provides scientific products and devices such as ultrasound accessories, dispensers, metering pumps, automated surgical scrub and linen dispensing equipment, water meters, optical and electromagnetic measurement systems, as well as medical devices. On April 27, the company reported a Q1 non-GAAP EPS of $3.90 and a revenue of $1.47 billion, outperforming Wall Street consensus by $0.04 and $20 million, respectively. On May 2, TD Cowen analyst Joseph Giordano increased the price target for Roper Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:ROP) to $525 from $500 while maintaining an Outperform rating on the company's shares. According to the analyst, Roper Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:ROP) delivered one of the strongest reports among similar companies during this season, and their diversified portfolio, focused on software in niche markets, is highly appealing as the market appears to be entering a period of cyclical weakness.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 41 hedge funds were bullish on Roper Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:ROP), compared to 44 funds in the earlier quarter. Henry Ellenbogen’s Durable Capital Partners is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 1.68 million shares worth $727.70 million. In addition to Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO), Agilent Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:A), and Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR), Roper Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:ROP) is one of the top plays in the scientific instruments market. Wasatch U.S. Select Strategy made the following comment about Roper Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:ROP) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Roper Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:ROP) was another large contributor. The stock was up after the company released strong third-quarter financial results, including revenue and earnings growth that exceeded consensus expectations. Roper develops software and other engineered products for a variety of niche markets and industries. The company owns 26 independent businesses, most of which enjoy strong barriers to entry and leadership positions in their respective markets. The management team has done an exceptional job, in our view, of improving the operating performance and free cash flow generation of the businesses in its portfolio, then deploying that cash into acquiring new businesses that fit a similar profile. Roper’s ability to put up strong results in what’s been a challenging operating environment for many businesses speaks to the durability of the business.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Scientific Instruments Stocks To Buy.  Suggested articles:20 Most Valuable Smartphone Companies in the World15 High Paying Jobs for Felons That Offer a Second Chance15 Part Time Jobs for 18 Year Olds With No Experience Required Disclosure: None. 10 Best Scientific Instruments Stocks To Buy is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

For more top stocks, head on over to Goldman Sachs' Top 5 Stock Picks for 2023. After a vicious drubbing in 2022 that led to growth and technology stocks sometimes bleeding as much as half of their value on the stock market, 2023 appears to be off to a good start. Companies such as Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) are up by a whopping 94% year to date, giving some hope that perhaps, for the technology industry, the worst might be over.This sentiment is also encouraged by statements from the Federal Reserve. The Fed's extremely hawkish actions last year aimed at bringing down inflation saw it increase U.S. benchmark interest rates by a massive 5 percentage points, bringing it up from the 0.25% rate that had been set during the onset of the coronavirus pandemic when the bank had cut rates by 2.5% in March 2020. At the same time, the Fed's latest meeting which saw it increase rates by 25 basis points (0.25%) came with optimistic commentary from both the monetary policy committee and chairman Jerome Powell.Investment bank The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS), on the other hand, is taking a look at the impact of the Fed rate hikes on the general economic health. The bank's outlook for 2023 is cautiously upbeat as well if we go by its Economic Outlook Report. Goldman believes that it is possible to reduce inflation without pushing the economy into a recession, and subsequently, it has diverged from the consensus view which is certain that a recession is on the horizon. Au contraire, the investment bank outlines that if the GDP growth is carefully managed - by keeping growth close to 1% for reducing labor demand to bringing down wages for diminishing purchasing power - then a recession, typically defined as consecutive quarters of reduced economic growth, can be avoided.Naturally, this rather interesting balance of macroeconomic indicators also merits a look at what Goldman Sachs is recommending on the investment front, and which recommendations are performing well so far this year. Some of the companies that are covered in the article are Expedia Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE), Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), and Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD).Story continuesGoldman Sachs' Top 15 Stock Picks for 2023Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyWe used a list of Goldman Sachs' top stock picks for 2023 that were revealed earlier this year, and picked out those with the highest upside to price target.Goldman Sachs' Top 15 Stock Picks for 202315.

22,ba8e6865-29f7-317e-a46f-ce7b52474c45,CF,2023-05-09,Wingstop and CF Industries have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wingstop-cf-industries-highlighted-zacks-121912011.html,1683548352,STORY,"['CF', 'WING', 'PLTR', 'ACN', 'BAH']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – May 8, 2023 – Zacks Equity Research shares Wingstop WING as the Bull of the Day and CF Industries CF as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Palantir Technologies Inc. PLTR, Accenture plc ACN and Booz Allen Hamilton BAH.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:Bull of the Day:Wingstop is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) that franchises and operates restaurants under the Wingstop brand name. Its restaurants offer cooked-to-order, hand-sauced, and tossed chicken wings.The stock has been on a mission this year, already up 50% in 2023. The move stemmed from improving margins on deflation of its main product bone-in chicken wings. On top of that, sales growth has been accelerating, which has helped the company beat earnings expectations four quarters in a row.Wingstop recently reported Q1 earnings, with the results impressing inventors enough to take the stock well beyond all-time highs.About the Company Wingstop was founded in 1994 and is headquartered in Addison, Texas. The company has 1,959 global locations in eight global markets, with 228 new additions in 2022.Wingstop has a market cap of just over $6 Billion and has a Forward PE of 103. This high valuation has scared some investors away and gives the stock a Zacks Style Score of ""F"" in Value. However, the stock has a Zacks Style Score of ""A"" in Momentum.Wingstop has seen 19 years of consecutive Same Store Sales (SSS) growth and continued to see robust SSS numbers in Q1.Q1 Earnings Beat: ""The Rise of the Chicken Wing""In early May, the company reported an earnings beat of 28%. Revenues came in at $108.7M v the $101M expected. The company saw adjusted EBITDA at $34.6M, up 60% year over year.Same Store Sales were up 20% y/y and Wingstop sees FY23 SSS at ""high single-digit growth"". The company affirmed 240 net new units globally and sees 37 new opening ins Q1, up 11% y/y.Story continuesCEO Michael Skipworth had the following comments on the quarter:""Our strong first quarter results reflect the continued momentum and strength of the Wingstop brand as we delivered 20.1% domestic same store sales growth, driven by transaction growth. With this underlying strength, we believe that our strategies we are executing against can deliver our 20th consecutive year of same store sales growth and another record year of unit growth for Wingstop""  The stock took flight moving from below the $200 level to $223.77. WING did come back down from those levels, but investors are clearly excited about the company's growth prospects. Despite the high valuation, the market thinks Wingstop can grow fast enough to justify its stock price.Much like Chipotle and the flying burrito stock move of 2019-20, WING has the potential to go much higher than many investors realize.Analyst Estimates The impressive quarter has forced analysts to take their numbers and price targets higher. Over the last 7 days, analysts' estimates have gone up in every time frame.For the current quarter, estimates have spiked from $0.45 to $0.49 over the last month, or 9%.For the current year, we see estimates trending higher as well. Analysts have taken their numbers from $1.91 to $2.00 or 5%.Multiple firms have taken their price targets higher since earnings:RBC reiterated with a Sector Perform but listed its target to $200 from $183.TD Cowen maintained an Outperform and raised its target to $235 from $210.Wedbush maintained its Outperform and lifted its price target to $240 from $200. Barclays reiterated its Overweight with a new price target of $240, up from $200. The TechnicalsThe stock is up about 50% on the year and many investors do not want to chase. So let us go over some buyable technical levels that bulls can look out for and enter on any pullbacks.$193 is the 21-day moving average. This is a great spot for aggressive investors to enter looking to play the momentum.$184 is the 50-day MA, a likely spot for the stock to find consolidation and a bounce.$153 is the 200-day MA and is unlikely to test anytime soon unless we have a large market sell-off. If that scenario plays out, this area would be a great spot to enter for long-term investors.For those looking to continue buying into all-time highs, look for a move to $255. This is the 161.8% Fibonacci extension found by drawing from 2021 highs to 2022 lows.Bottom Line While the valuation is scaring off some investors, Wingstop is hitting all-time highs and crushing earnings. Rather than focus on the valuation, investors should follow the price action as the market is trying to tell us something.As long as Wingstop continues the SSS growth and margins remain favorable, this stock will be hotter than Wingstop's very own Atomic sauce.Bear of the Day:CF Industries is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) that manufactures and sells hydrogen and nitrogen products for energy, fertilizer, emissions abatement, and other industrial activitiesThe stock did well in 2022 as grain and fertilizer prices took off. However, CF has slumped over the last six months as prices have fallen significantly.Inconsistent earnings have not helped and the stock is trading at 2023 lows after a recent earnings report. With analyst estimates falling further, investors could be in a rough spot in the back half of the year.About the Company CF Industries is headquartered in Deerfield, IL. The company was founded in 1946 and employs 2,700 people. Its principal products include anhydrous ammonia, granular urea, urea ammonium nitrate, and ammonium nitrate products. It primarily serves cooperatives, independent fertilizer distributors, traders, wholesalers, and industrial users.CF is valued at $13.5 billion and has a Forward PE of 8. The stock holds Zacks Style Scores of ""A"" in Value, but ""D"" in Momentum. The stock pays a dividend of 2.3%.Q1 Earnings The company reported Q1 earnings in early May, beating expectations by 8%. Revenues also came in above expected, but gross margins fell to 42.9% from 59.2% last year.Management commented that despite the downward pressure in the global nitrogen market compared to last year, industry fundamentals remain positive.The stock did spike on the headline number, but over the next few days, the stock made new monthly lows. This is not a good sign for investors and a reason for the drop is likely due to falling estimates.EstimatesWhile the recent earnings report has seen a mix of revisions to estimates, the trend so far this year has been lower. Looking at analyst estimates over the last 90 days, we see a significant drop across the board. For the current quarter, estimates have been taken down from $3.70 to $2.68, a drop of 27%. For the current year, they have fallen from $13.29 to $8.98, or 32%.Next year's numbers have seen a drop of 14%, but we have seen a small tick higher over the last 7 days.Investors looking to buy the dip might have to wait until next year until the fundamental situation improves.Technical TakeCF has been on a downward trend since December of 2022. Since then, the stock has dropped about 35%.The 50-day moving average has been resistance multiple times since the stock started trending lower. This level, which is at $75.50, needs to break or the bears will continue to be in control.Investors are likely tempted to buy the dip, but there could be room lower. While there is value in the name, long-term support looks to be in the $55-60 range. That is over 15% lower than current prices, so investors should be patient.SummaryThe fertilizer names are great to be in when agriculture prices are going higher. Unfortunately, the trend is going the wrong way and until estimates start improving investors should hold off.Additional content:What's in the Offing for Palantir's (PLTR) Q1 Earnings Report?Palantir Technologies Inc. is slated to report its first-quarter 2023 results on May 8, after the bell.The company's earnings surprise history has not been impressive.

This has lagged the Retail-Wholesale sector's gain of 1.63% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 1.18% in that time.Walmart will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release, which is expected to be May 18, 2023. In that report, analysts expect Walmart to post earnings of $1.30 per share. This would mark no growth from the year-ago period. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $148.52 billion, up 4.91% from the year-ago period.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $6.07 per share and revenue of $631.34 billion, which would represent changes of -3.5% and +3.28%, respectively, from the prior year.Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Walmart.

To skip our detailed analysis of online shopping and its development in recent years, you can go directly to see the Top 5 Online Shopping Websites in USA in 2023.Electronic commerce, or e-commerce, has been a major part of the global economy for several years now. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted just how much utility can be found in this sector by offering consumers across the globe the option of shopping for essential goods at a time when one couldn't even leave their home.The e-commerce market is one that has grown exponentially for years, and this growth is expected to continue well into the next decade. As we mentioned in one of our previous articles, the ecommerce market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 11.9% from 2022 to 2030, rising from its value in 2022 ($48 billion) to $117.7 billion. This growth is expected even after the pandemic has ended since consumer behavior has been shaped at this point to prefer seamless and frictionless shopping experiences that are hassle-free and time-saving.Growth in Online ShoppingAccording to a survey conducted by professionals at PwC in December, 43% of global consumers are planning to increase their online shopping in the following six months. The survey also showed the interest of many consumers in next-generation digital platforms such as the metaverse. About 26% of the respondents in this survey noted that they had participated in metaverse-related activities in the six months leading up to December, for instance.While e-commerce has been growing, in-store shopping managed to retain its position as the most popular mode of shopping, according to the survey. About 43% of the respondents picked in-store shopping as their mode of shopping in December. However, shopping online through mobile phones was the second-most popular option, with 34% of the respondents picking this mode. The third and fourth-most popular modes were also online, through personal computers or tablets (23% and 15%, respectively). This shows that online shopping is managing to retain its popularity even in a post-COVID world.Story continuesAs a result, major retailers such as Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), and Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) that also operate online shopping websites are continuing to rake in profits. Even though inflation is resulting in many consumers cutting down their spending, the vast majority of the global population is continuing to shop online, enabling the e-commerce sector to maintain its profitability. Hence, we have compiled a list below of the top US online shopping websites in 2023 to highlight the major players in this dynamic and ever-evolving sector.Top Online Shopping Websites in USA in 2023Photo by CardMapr.nl on UnsplashLet's now take a look at the top 20 online shopping websites in USA in 2023.Our MethodologyTo compile our list below, we selected American online shopping websites that are popular among online shoppers in the US and which generate the largest revenues in the country.

Siegel moved Peloton to a market perform rating, saying in a note that ""after all this time, the risk/reward has shifted, even seeing a likely upward skew at current levels."" He joined Yahoo Finance Live to further discuss, noting that the company has shifted away from its ""instagram-able, beautiful"" bikes and instead focusing on content. Recently Peloton guidance forecasted subscribers down in the next quarter, which doesn't deter Siegel. Instead, the ""saturation concerns"" paired with ""seasonality"" made it make sense to guide subscribers down. Ultimately, Siegel says it will be ""very important"" to figure out the company's ultimate market size.Siegel points to previously prestige brands like Victoria's Secret (VSCO), Michael Kors (CPRI) and Under Armour (UAA) who had to navigate a transition from being a prestige brand to one of ubiquity battling declining demand. But just because a brand is going back down ""does not mean they are dead,"" Siegel explains. Peloton (PTON) will soon have to navigate a similar trend. ""I don't think Peloton is a dead brand at all,"" Siegel says, but it ""certainly doesn't stand for what it used to stand for."" It's important for Peloton to look at this decline and ""bear hug"" brand loyalists, rather than push products on customers that don't want them.In his full interview, Simeon dives deeper into his Peloton upgrade with Brad Smith and Julie Hyman.Top Video Moments00:00:15 Peloton pivoting from machine to content00:00:44 PTON won't be guiding down forever00:02:13 Brands declining on ubiquity aren't ""dead""00:02:40 Where did Peloton go wrong?00:03:00 ""Bear hug"" brand loyalistsVideo TranscriptSIMEON SIEGEL: I think what made Peloton so special initially was the fact that it was this Instagrammable beautiful machine that people want to say they had a Peloton Bike, even more so in that they were using the Peloton content. And I think the company is pivoting that conversation to say it's the content that makes us special. The equipment-- which, by the way, has been losing money-- that's-- not gonna say necessarily evil, but that's the way that we get there.Story continuesIf you can get there without it, that's important as well, which is why, over the next month, they're talking about a big relaunch of the digital program. I don't know what that's gonna look like. I think, to be very clear, this upgrade is not suggesting all of a sudden we think the addressable market size is huge.I think the point here is you knew that this number-- the company guided subscribers down for the first time this quarter. They had to do that because seasonally, it's beautiful outside. So you take all the saturation concerns. You overlay that with seasonality. And it made sense for them to guide down.What I don't think is this is just the be-all, end-all. I don't think that forever we're gonna be guiding down. But I do think it is important to acknowledge they have stretched this market. They have pulled forward the market, rather.So figuring out what that ultimate addressable market size is is going to be very important. What I think, though-- and, Julie, you and I have talked about this forever a la Victoria's Secret and Under Armour-- sometimes you can sell less and charge more and make more money. What's fascinating is they guided subscribers down. The amount that the subscribers are paying is going up.JULIE HYMAN: Well, and sort of on a similar front, Simeon, the arc of this brand from, like, this coveted status symbol thing having this bike has just changed enormously. And as you look at the parallels between it and other retailers who have been able to manage that transition-- like a Michael Kors pops into my head, for example-- like, what can we learn from those other situations? They're not exact parallels, right? But they have some parallels, so, you know, about what Peloton can do to manage that transition correctly from, like, a prestige product to a mass product, right?SIMEON SIEGEL: No, I think you're putting it perfectly. I think the key word used there was a brand. I think we think about tech companies. They're not as much brands, whereas you think about whether it's Michael Kors or Under Armour. You think about brands that were once on a growth arc that then find themselves too ubiquitous, and now they're going back down.It does not mean they are dead. I mean, this was the conversation. Remember, we were kind of aghast when I upgraded L Brands back in the beginning of the pandemic, saying Victoria's Secret wasn't a dead brand. It had $5 billion of revenue.I don't think Peloton is a dead brand at all, but it certainly doesn't stand for what it used to stand for. It's certainly not garnering that Instagram appeal. And so what I think those brands have to internalize is where did they go wrong. What changed?And a lot of times, it's tied to ubiquity. With fitness, it's also tied to just-- I'm not gonna say humanity's laziness, because that's not nice. But it's just hard, right, to continue to inspire yourself to do it.What I think they should do-- and we've been saying this for a long time and [INAUDIBLE] been saying this for a long time. I think they need to bear-hug their brand loyalists. What Michael Kors did was they said, we're OK giving up volume if it gives us price and brand equity because inevitably, the best thing I could get is more dollars per handbag, in Michael Kors' case, Under Armour getting more dollars per sneaker, right? Victoria's Secret-- more dollars per intimate.If you overextend, and that forces you to promote in a bad way-- I'm not against promotions broadly. But if it forces you to force your product to someone, sometimes you can do better by selling less and charging more and making more money. And that Victoria's Secret-- I mean, listen, we saw L Brands. It was the top 10 stocks within the S&amp;P for two years running, even though revenues came down.So revenues coming down doesn't have to be a scary thing if it's under your control. And I think that's this conversation the company is focusing on free cash. I think that's where this opportunity now lies for them to say they are certainly not being valued as a growth company.]"

They provide advice, assistance, and access to a wide range of insurance products and services from different insurance providers, helping their clients find the coverage that best meets their needs and budget. Research and Markets anticipated that the worldwide insurance industry would expand at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.4% from $5,376.92 billion in 2021 to $5,938.41 billion in 2022. Moreover, the market is projected to reach $8,398.11 billion in 2026 with a compounded annual growth rate of 9.1%.In recent years, insurance companies have shown great adaptability and strength in overcoming various challenges, including the effects of the pandemic and the economic consequences of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Deloitte reported that although property and casualty insurance price increases were a contributing factor in the rise of premium revenue and the achievement of a consolidated surplus in the United States exceeding $1 trillion, inflation is also pushing up loss costs at a higher and faster rate in most markets, which is negatively impacting the profitability of underwriting. Meanwhile, the small business insurance market is experiencing significant changes, and the increasing shift to green energy and associated insurance offerings, as well as coverage for emerging intangible assets like cryptocurrency, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and virtual activities in the metaverse, indicate that there are ample opportunities for expansion in the insurance space. EY has stated that the effects of inflation will differ across the insurance industry. P&amp;C insurers in the US will be especially impacted by inflation-related rises in claims costs, such as for repairs, replacement parts, and labor. This is due to regulators in the US being resistant to approving rate increases. In the Asia-Pacific region, many insurance products have a short-tail nature, which enables insurers to adjust policy pricing quickly in response to inflation and partially make up for depleted reserves. Life insurance firms are tentatively hopeful since higher interest rates currently contribute to future profitability and appear to outweigh the effects of inflation. Story continuesThere are multiple growth and expansion opportunities in the insurance market.

(NYSE:XYL) Could Be Worth Watching,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-xylem-inc-nyse-xyl-114651281.html,1683632811,STORY,['XYL'],"[Let's talk about the popular Xylem Inc. (NYSE:XYL). The company's shares saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the NYSE. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let’s take a look at Xylem’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. See our latest analysis for Xylem What Is Xylem Worth?According to my valuation model, Xylem seems to be fairly priced at around 19.46% above my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Xylem today, you’d be paying a relatively reasonable price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $89.86, then there isn’t really any room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. Although, there may be an opportunity to buy in the future. This is because Xylem’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company’s shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.What does the future of Xylem look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Xylem's earnings over the next few years are expected to double, indicating a very optimistic future ahead. This should lead to stronger cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in XYL’s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on XYL, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.Keep in mind, when it comes to analysing a stock it's worth noting the risks involved.

With variables like rising interest rates, inflation, geopolitical tensions, and risk of economic slowdown there are so many factors that can shake out and unnerve investors. Nonetheless, market indexes have been very strong.The best way to stay grounded in markets like this is to utilize a proven process. The Zacks Rank is an extremely effective way to find stocks with a high likelihood of appreciating in price over the near-term, dramatically improving investors’ odds of success.Marriot International MAR, MGM Resorts International MGM, and United Airlines UAL are all Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks, indicating upward trending earnings revisions, and near-term bullish expectations.Upgrades across these three stocks may also indicate some interesting developments brewing. Each of these stocks were hit very hard following the Covid pandemic, and still hover around or below their pre-Covid highs. But with airlines, hotels and gaming companies expecting better earnings, we could be seeing the early stages of a full recovery and breakout in the tourism industry.This would run counter to the narrative of a slowing economy and may suggest a contrarian trade thesis. If so, each of these stocks could be starting a major bull run.Marriot InternationalWhile it has been a bumpy ride, Marriot International has been an extremely strong performing stock over the last 10 years. Compounding at an annual rate of 16% over that time, it has outperformed the broad market by a significant margin.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchEarnings estimates for Marriot International are extremely bullish. Analysts are in unanimous agreement in upgrading expectations, revising current quarter estimates 6% higher and FY23 estimates 7% higher over the last 60 days. Additionally, during the most recent quarterly report, MAR beat earnings expectations by 12%. In response to the beat, MAR stock rallied 5%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCurrent quarter sales are expected to be strong as well. Analysts are projecting 11.5% growth to $5.9 billion for the quarter, and 12% growth to $23.3 billion for FY23. These are very robust growth rates for such a mature company.MAR is trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 21x, which is below the industry average of 22x, and below its 10-year median of 24x. As a leading franchise in the industry, with recognizable brands across the spectrum of customers, MAR is well positioned for near and long-term stock appreciation. Earnings upgrades, and historically lows valuations make for a very bullish setup.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMGM Resorts InternationalMGM Resorts International is an internationally recognized hotel and casino brand that has performed well over the last decade. MGM stock has underperformed the broad market over that period; however, it was able to make an epic comeback from its Covid pandemic lows.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMGM has several very promising business developments in the pipeline that should contribute to the top and bottom line over the very long term. Online sports betting and iGaming are a secular economic mega trend that MGM should benefit massively from. With extensive experience in traditional brick and mortar gaming operations, the transition to digital should be seamless. Since its launch in 2018 this segment has done extremely well and is now operating in 24 markets boasting a growing market share.Another major development is the acquisition of Empire City Casino in New York. Growing a footprint in a market as significant as New York will provide a new long-term source of revenue for the gaming giant.Analysts have revised earnings estimates significantly higher for MGM. After dealing with several quarters of negative earnings last year, profits have now flipped back to positive territory. This positive earnings metric was only priced in over the last two months, so estimates are now much higher.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAfter overcoming the challenges posed by the lockdowns in the US and more recently China, MGM has proven competent management and strong staying power. MGM is currently trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 22x, which is above the market average of 19x, and well below its 10-year median of 33x. This historically low valuation along with the multiple bullish catalysts listed makes MGM a strong candidate for investors portfolios.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchUnited Airlines United Airlines stock has struggled over the past decade. The underperformance is marked by a painful drop in 2020, which the stock has yet to recover from. However, improving earnings expectations, and a resumption of international and domestic travel may be exactly what UAL needs to start trending higher again.  Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAnalysts have unanimously upgraded earnings expectations for UAL. Current quarter earnings estimates have been revised higher by 50% over the past two months, and all other timeframes are expecting improved results as well. Current quarter sales are expected to grow 15% YoY to $13.9 billion and FY23 sales are expected to climb 18% YoY to $53 billion.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchUAL is trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 5x, which is below the industry average of 10x, and below its 10-year median of 9x. This is a historically cheap valuation for the airline and offers an opportunity to own an industry leading stock, that has several bullish catalysts on the horizon.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineMarket and industry dynamics have shifted at breakneck speed over the past three years. Tourism and travel were some of the sectors that took the worst of the economic pain. But these industries are clearly seeing a turn for the better. Having survived one of the worst possible scenarios these stocks should be better positioned than ever. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

That doesn't mean buying stocks can't be made simple. Here are three critical variables to consider when making an investment.What to buy: Which stock or other financial product are you investing in?When to buy (or sell): What is your trade signal? Entry and exit.How much to buy: What percentage of your portfolio are you allocating? How much risk?What to Buy? Before investors decide what to buy, they need to define what their investment universe is. All stocks? ETFs? Large-cap Stocks? Bonds? Commodities? Currencies?Zacks makes it easy as we analyze most stocks and ETFs in the market and bring that information forward. The best way to utilize that information is through the Zacks Rank, where we publish the most compelling stocks based on analysts' earnings revisions, a proven methodology for predicting near-term returns.The Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) list is updated daily with compelling new stock picks. Today alone, nearly 30 new stocks were added.Most investors aren't going to buy every new stock on the list, so the next step is to narrow down the variables. A conservative investor may focus on stocks above a certain market capitalization, say $10 billion. Or maybe they have conviction on a sector, or macroeconomic theme.Let's say I am interested in gaming stocks. Most of the sector has recovered their pandemic losses but have yet to rally considerably from the pre-Covid levels. Gaming has been unloved and under owned, and I think they will soon rally again.MGM Resorts International is a fresh addition to the Zacks Rank #1 rank, currently boasting a #1 Rank (Strong Buy), indicating upward trending earnings revisions.Story continuesWhen to Buy?The next consideration for investors is when to buy. Getting upgraded to Zacks Rank #1 is certainly an effective buy signal. Zacks has proven over the years that upgraded stocks have strong near-term returns.But what is another way to signal a buy? Some traders look at the chart for technical patterns. After the formation and breakout of a chart pattern, investors will then decide to buy a stock. Others may use fundamentals like valuation or sales growth as a buy signal. If a stock trades below some historical valuation, or if sales accelerate to a certain pace, it signals a buy.Berkshire Hathaway for instance, is trading at an earnings multiple below the market average. This is a rare occurrence and is regularly followed by strong stock performance. Berkshire Hathaway also currently has a Zacks Rank #1. So, here we are aligning multiple buy signals.Chart patterns more specifically can help investors design trade setups with a more granular perspective and allow them to define the risk-reward on a chart.MGM Resorts International currently has a compelling technical chart pattern. MGM has been building a cup and handle breakout pattern over the last two years. The smaller consolidation labeled ""handle"" defines a tight consolidation for a trade setup.If the price can trade above the $46 level, that would initiate a buy signal. However, if price trades below $42, the pattern would be invalid. This simple methodology allows us to easily define when we want to be in the stock and when we don't.If MGM does break out, then investors need to define the stop out level and price target. There are several methods for doing this. For stops, some use a -10% trailing stop, while others use the breakout level, or the bottom of a range. For price target, investors can use a multiple of risk, say 2:1 risk reward.If it is a fundamental thesis, investors may stay invested until a business metric changes, like an earnings miss, or a slowdown in growth.I want to note that this is just an introduction to these ideas. Each of these factors can have whole books written on them.How Much to Buy? Risk management and position sizing is definitely the least covered topic of the three. However, it is without a doubt the most important. Picking stocks, and analyzing businesses and chart patterns is sexy, figuring out how much you might lose on a trade is not.I want to make this clear, the amount of stock you decide to buy, as a percentage of your total portfolio, is the most important decision regarding an investment.Like trading signals and stock picking, there are multiple ways to consider risk management. As a rule of thumb, when investing in a portfolio of stocks, individual stock positions should be between 1-10% of the total portfolio. More concentrated than 10% and you will be exposing yourself to considerable single stock risk.It is also important to consider that most stocks are correlated with the market broadly. Diversification is another form of risk management. There is a saying that ""50% of stock returns come from the market, 30% come from the sector, and just 20% come from the individual stock."" If an investor holds 10 small cap oil stocks their whole portfolio is going to get hammered if oil prices fall. But, if they hold positions across sectors some positions may get hurt by a move in oil prices, but others may benefit.OverviewInvestors first need to decide what stock they are buying and why. Compelling research, an improving economy, an overlooked sector, a contrarian thesis or any other idea will do. Then they need to have a method for defining a buy and sell signal. Where do they get in and out.Lastly, and most importantly, is risk management. How much money are they going to risk in the trade, and how big of a position does this call for, and what is the total portfolio risk.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY), which has not only revenues, but also profits. While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it. See our latest analysis for Occidental Petroleum Occidental Petroleum's Improving ProfitsIn business, profits are a key measure of success; and share prices tend to reflect earnings per share (EPS) performance. So a growing EPS generally brings attention to a company in the eyes of prospective investors. It's an outstanding feat for Occidental Petroleum to have grown EPS from US$2.12 to US$13.83 in just one year. While it's difficult to sustain growth at that level, it bodes well for the company's outlook for the future. This could point to the business hitting a point of inflection.One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. The good news is that Occidental Petroleum is growing revenues, and EBIT margins improved by 20.5 percentage points to 37%, over the last year. Both of which are great metrics to check off for potential growth.The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.earnings-and-revenue-historyThe trick, as an investor, is to find companies that are going to perform well in the future, not just in the past. While crystal balls don't exist, you can check our visualization of consensus analyst forecasts for Occidental Petroleum's future EPS 100% free.Story continuesAre Occidental Petroleum Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Owing to the size of Occidental Petroleum, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$120m. While that is a lot of skin in the game, we note this holding only totals to 0.2% of the business, which is a result of the company being so large. So despite their percentage holding being low, company management still have plenty of reasons to deliver the best outcomes for investors.Does Occidental Petroleum Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?Occidental Petroleum's earnings per share have been soaring, with growth rates sky high. That EPS growth certainly is attention grabbing, and the large insider ownership only serves to further stoke our interest. The hope is, of course, that the strong growth marks a fundamental improvement in the business economics. So based on this quick analysis, we do think it's worth considering Occidental Petroleum for a spot on your watchlist. We should say that we've discovered 2 warning signs for Occidental Petroleum (1 is potentially serious!) that you should be aware of before investing here.There's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares. But for those who consider these important metrics, we encourage you to check out companies that do have those features.

Aramco made a $30.73 billion profit in the fourth quarter of last year.“We continue to deliver high reliability and low cost of production financially,” Aramco President and CEO Amin H. Nasser said on a conference call with analysts. “We continue to generate strong earnings and cash flows further, demonstrating our ability to deliver through oil price cycles.""Benchmark Brent crude traded Tuesday around $76 a barrel, down from a high of $125 in the last year.Saudi Arabia’s vast oil resources, located close to the surface of its desert expanse, make it one of the world’s least expensive places to produce crude. For every $10 rise in the price of a barrel of oil, Saudi Arabia stands to make an additional $40 billion a year, according to the Institute of International Finance.In March, Aramco announced earning $161 billion last year, claiming the highest-ever recorded annual profit by a publicly listed company and drawing immediate criticism from activists amid concerns about climate change. However, as prices drop, so do Aramco's revenues.“Aramco is a very simple machine: It’s oil production times price, minus a little bit of cost,” said Robin Mills, the CEO of Qamar Energy, a Dubai-based consulting company. “Profit is down. That’s all oil-price driven.”While saying Aramco was “working to further reduce the carbon footprint of our operations,” Nasser remained bullish on the world's need for fossil fuels, citing future estimated demand from China and India.“We continue to believe that oil demand is likely to grow, and we believe that the world will continue to need oil and gas for the foreseeable future to support a sustainable and affordable energy transition,” Nasser said. “Our concern remains that the industry is not investing enough to meet expected future demand.”Story continuesNasser said Aramco also was looking at opportunities to produce liquid natural gas outside of the kingdom in “the U.S. and Australia and in other parts of the world.” The company also plans to spend up to $55 billion in capital projects as well to expand its production.Those earnings came off the back of energy prices rising after Russia launched its war on Ukraine in February 2022, with sanctions limiting the sale of Moscow’s oil and natural gas in Western markets.However, oil prices have sunk in recent weeks amid fears of a coming recession as central banks in the U.S. and elsewhere raise interest rates to try to tame inflation. That's even after OPEC+, a group of countries including the cartel and those outside it like Russia, announced surprise production cuts in April totaling up to 1.15 million barrels. Recent OPEC+ cuts have seen U.S. President Joe Biden warn of potential “consequences” for Riyadh, even though his national security adviser just visited the kingdom and met with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.“In our view, the recent weakness seen in the oil market was driven by concern over tightening of monetary policy by central banks and (the) effect on economies,” Nasser said. ""This was also worsened by the crisis (involving) regional banks in the U.S. and concern over its contagion effect. However, in our view, the markets overreacted to the situation, resulting in the sell-off by traders.”Aramco stock rose 3% in trading Tuesday to close at $8.96, giving the oil firm a $1.97 trillion valuation and putting it only behind Apple and Microsoft for the highest market capitalization in the world. Just a sliver of its worth, under 2%, is traded on the exchange. The Saudi government holds 90% of the company, with about 8% held by Saudi sovereign wealth funds.Separately Tuesday, Aramco announced it would begin issuing performance-based dividends to stockholders, on top of the dividends it already offers. Its base dividend in the fourth quarter of last year was $19.5 billion, ranking it as the highest in the world for a publicly traded firm.___Follow Jon Gambrell on Twitter at www.twitter.com/jongambrellAP.]"

Published together with the agency's TRUE Global Intelligence practice, the report features analysis drawn from an online survey of Asian investors. The report also includes an overview of the latest trends in Asia's asset management industry.The 2023 Asia report shows that Asian investors view inflation and stagflation as their biggest financial risk (50%) in 2023, triggering them to diversify their investments to build resilient portfolios. Despite equities funds (67%) and fixed income funds (56%) continuing to be the most frequently traded asset classes among this audience, the number of investors who said that they traded or invested in equities funds declined 10 percentage points from a year earlier. In addition, a number of investors said that they traded or invested in cryptocurrencies and other digital assets (39% in Asia excluding mainland China) and private equity funds (28%). Around half (47%) of investors in the region said they have used ChatGPT or other AI tools to provide them with guidance and advice. However, 54% of the investors who have used ChatGPT or other AI tools said that it was not helpful in investment decision making.""During this current period of high volatility across global capital markets, we've seen growing interest from investors for private equity, alternatives and even semi-liquid products. This presents growing opportunities for asset managers to double down on their efforts on product diversification and innovation to appeal to investors' interests,"" said Patrick Yu, Asia Pacific lead of FleishmanHillard's Financial and Professional Services sector.Story continuesSimilar to the results in last year's report, the 2023 report also shows that the performance (94%) and credibility (93%) of the asset management house continued to be the top two most important criteria for investors in Asia Pacific (APAC) in asset manager selection. The ESG commitment of asset managers (82%) continues to rank highly in criteria for asset management selection, as ESG plays a central and integral role for most investors in APAC when making investment decisions.In addition, respectively 90%, 89% and 89% of the Asian respondents said that transparency in communications with customers, sophistication in risk management, and transparent fee disclosure are amongst the most important qualities for asset managers respectively.""It's clear that an asset manager's credibility and performance continue to be major factors for investors in Asia when they decide on where to invest their capital,"" Yu said. ""Asset managers must continue to demonstrate their global investment expertise and capabilities, ESG commitment and enhanced transparency in customer communications to raise their profiles across Asian markets.""The survey also found that:Investors in Asia continue to show interest in emerging industries. In the next 12 months, investors are most interested in investing in the AI sector (50%), followed by the internet and technology sector (40%) and the biotechnology industry and healthcare sector (38%). ESG-related investment opportunities (34%) and cryptocurrencies (29%) are two other sectors to keep an eye on in 2023.Investors in South Korea (34%) and mainland China (29%) are more risk averse and tend to shift their investments into risk-off products, while investors in Hong Kong (31%) are more willing than other APAC markets to move some capital into higher risk financial instruments.Financial media outlets (53%) remain the key source of information for investors to learn about funds and investment products, but an increasing number of investors across the region use social media to receive investment related information – 43% in 2023 vs. 33% in 2022 – outperforming usage of the websites of fund houses (39%) and independent financial advisers (36%).With regard to ESG commitment and compliance, investors in the region say it's important for asset managers to ""walk the talk"" when proxy voting in listed companies (88%). A similar percentage (86%) place importance on transparency from asset managers in ESG data and protocols, as well as clarity in ESG goals and objectives (85%).FleishmanHillard's The Future of Asset Management in Asia 2023 report includes quantitative data and qualitative analysis on the asset management industry in Asia. FleishmanHillard TRUE Global Intelligence fielded an online survey of 1,000 investment professionals in mainland China, Hong Kong SAR, Singapore and South Korea between April 4 and April 11, 2023. All respondents self-identified as having traded or invested in at least one of the following: equities funds, fixed income funds, ETFs, alternatives, balanced funds, PE funds, digital assets or cryptos. A mainland China focused report, The Future of Asset Management in China 2023, is also available for asset managers interested specifically in this growing market.Following the success of the previous Asia and China reports, FleishmanHillard is pleased to announce that it will launch European and U.S. versions in the coming months to provide more perspectives on the asset management industry.About FleishmanHillard  FleishmanHillard specializes in public relations, reputation management, public affairs, brand marketing, digital strategy, social engagement and content strategy.

The stock outpaced the S&amp;P 500's daily gain of 0.05%. At the same time, the Dow lost 0.17%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 6.02%.Coming into today, shares of the customer-management software developer had gained 2.62% in the past month. In that same time, the Computer and Technology sector gained 1.52%, while the S&amp;P 500 gained 1.18%.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Salesforce.com as it approaches its next earnings report date. In that report, analysts expect Salesforce.com to post earnings of $1.61 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 64.29%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $8.17 billion, up 10.24% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $7.11 per share and revenue of $34.62 billion. These totals would mark changes of +35.69% and +10.43%, respectively, from last year.Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Salesforce.com. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.01% lower within the past month. Salesforce.com is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).Story continuesIn terms of valuation, Salesforce.com is currently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 27.79.

When it’s a bear market though, no one wants anything to do with these names. However, there are some quality businesses in this group that get dumped lower with the selloff. So I want to look at growth stocks to buy if the markets retest the 2022 low.It always pays to have a plan — particularly right now. While equity markets are trading much better, many would agree that we’re not necessarily out of the woods. With just seven stocks generating more than 85% of the year-to-date gains in the S&amp;P 500 and a rising-rate environment, it’s still possible for the indices to struggle. Put simply, we need to be prepared for all sorts of outcomes. It helped to be prepared when a handful of great stocks fell in October. It paid off to know where to buy some high-quality companies at what I call “fantasy” prices.In fact, a few of those names are included below.

Now the value has been realized by the market and the stock has exploded higher as a result. From its 52-week low to the recent high, shares are up 58%. Have you ever used or worked on a Salesforce platform? It’s incredibly sticky (and intentionally so). In good environments and bad, companies simply can’t part ways with Salesforce. It’s what helps the company deliver its current growth.In February, Salesforce delivered a top- and bottom-line beat and issued better-than-expected first-quarter and full-year outlooks. CEO Marc Benioff said during the conference call, “It’s one of the best performances of any enterprise software company our size, and it’s amazing that Salesforce is now over $30 billion in revenue.” He’s right and Wall Street knows he’s right. It’s why Salesforce has attracted five different active investors.Story continuesPalo Alto Networks (PANW)A businessman holding a coin with a tree that grows and a tree that grows on a pile of money representing growth stocksSource: MEE KO DONG / ShutterstockOne name too many investors leave off their watchlist? Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) and that’s even as shares were recently 50% above the low. Palo Alto Networks operates in the always-prevalent space of cybersecurity. Unfortunately for the rest of us, cybersecurity is a very real and ongoing threat. It doesn’t matter if we’re in an economic boom or a severe depression, there will be hackers and cyber-criminals looking for a payday.They will go after everyone from government agencies to big-box retailers and it’s no surprise that Palo Alto’s business continues to grow as a result. It’s one of the few GAAP-profitable cybersecurity firms that also boasts strong growth. Analysts expect 25% revenue growth this year and 21% growth in 2024. That’s alongside estimates calling for 60% earnings growth this year and 16% growth in 2024. It’s simply robust. This stock can go through big swoons and if the market comes under pressure, I suspect PANW stock will take a big hit too. For long-term investors, it’s an opportunity.Trade Desk (TTD)tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comI can’t say enough good things about Trade Desk (NASDAQ:TTD). Co-Founder and CEO Jeff Green has built a terrific company with strong growth and impressive profitability. Before and now after the Covid-19 pandemic, this firm has been profitable. For a growth stock, that’s rare (and impressive).The stock came under strong selling pressure last year, suffering a peak-to-trough decline of about 65%. It found strong support around $40, although there’s no guarantee it will see this level again. Analysts expect about 20% revenue growth this year and 24% growth next year. On the earnings front, estimates call for just 8% growth this year, but a big acceleration of up to 27% growth in 2024.While Meta (NASDAQ:META), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG), and other mega-cap tech giants are not able to operate in China, The Trade Desk is. I think this firm will be a monstrous winner and is one of the best growth stocks to buy for the long term. If we get a retest of the 2022 low for the S&amp;P 500, The Trade Desk should be on sale.On the date of publication, Bret Kenwell did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

49,80ed3961-eb64-35e8-8a50-33714ed7ec2f,SEE,2023-05-09,Recyclability Claims: What You Need To Know,ACCESSWIRE,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/recyclability-claims-know-124000855.html,1683549600,STORY,['SEE'],"[NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / May 8, 2023 / There are four paths a package can take after serving its useful purpose: landfill/litter, composting, energy recovery/incineration, or recycling. While a recyclability claim is commonly associated with what makes a package sustainable, recycling is just one part of a complex ecosystem that depends on a variety of factors including geography, consumer behavior, collection processes, sorting processes, equipment, and profitability.Packaging recyclability claims that are unsubstantiated or misleading create risk ranging from consumer complaints and negative social media chatter to class action lawsuits and fines from governmental organizations. They can also lead to a weakening of the recycling infrastructure, a circumstance the global circular economy simply can't afford.Getting recyclability claims right is easier than you think - but it pays to follow the rules. Here are some things you need to know:Criteria for 100% RecyclableTo be considered 100% recyclable, SEE® (formerly Sealed Air) believes packaging material or solutions must meet this criteria:1. Can be collected at curbside or drop-off by at least 60% of the populationWhether it's picked up at the curbside or taken by the consumer to a drop-off location, collection is the first step to recycling. Recycling systems vary greatly in terms of what they will take based on everything from the sorting equipment available at the material recovery facility (MRF) they work with, how much labor they are able to employ to pick up bins or sort by hand, and even the market price for bales of collected material to off-set the cost of sorting.Most municipal recycling programs publish the types of materials they accept either as part of customer agreements, printed guides, or on their websites. Based on a variety of factors, these rules can change from time to time - restricted items may still leave the curb, but unknowingly to the consumer, it will end up in the landfill.Story continuesAll this is to say, that regardless of the material type, it becomes the responsibility of the consumer to check the rules that govern the program in which they participate, as well as to follow guidelines provided by standardized labels such as How2Recycle in the U.S., On-Pack Recycling Labels in the U.K, or the Australasian Recycling Labels in Australia and New Zealand.While similar to some degree, labels and rules vary around the world and aren't always easy to understand at a glance. That's a lot for consumers to keep up with - and it's one of the biggest reasons we encounter aspirational recycling - when consumers knowingly put something in the bin they may be unsure about and simply hope it gets recycled.2. Can be sorted by the material recovery facility to which it is sentNow that most municipal recycling programs offer mixed-stream recycling where paper, glass, metals, and plastics are collected in one bin, MRFs take on the critical role of sorting before items can move on to the actual recycling process.Because the volume of waste can be high and the time to sort is so short, most modern MRFs automate the sorting process as much as possible with high-speed conveyors and screens, optical sorters, and robotics.While that's great news for packaging made of paper, metal, or glass, the ""need for speed"" presents a particular challenge for plastic. Plastics that often look and weigh the same, may be constructed completed differently, so how they react during different stages of the sorting process will also vary.To keep things simple and to protect the integrity of their recycling streams, most MRFs limit the types of plastic they accept, and only through improvement of the recycling infrastructure is that likely to change.3. Can be recycled into a commercially viable productRecycling is the process through which materials are returned to some type of useful, marketable material. While there can be many ways to accomplish this task, two are of the most relevance to packaging: mechanical recycling and advanced recycling.Mechanical recycling refers to operations that use processes such as grinding, washing, separating, drying, granulating, and compounding as the means to create recycled materials. For plastics, while mechanical recycling preserves the molecular structure, in some cases the recycled material does not possess the same functional properties as the original.This results in downcycling, or the need to use the recycled material in a different or lower-value application. Examples of downcycling include PET water bottles that are recycled into pellets used to make carpeting or synthetic fleece fibers; used printer or photocopy paper being recycled into corrugated cardboard; or glass containers that are recycled into fiberglass insulation or used as additives in concrete or ceramic tiles.Where plastics are concerned, the highest volume of mechanically recycled packaging materials are standard formats such as PET bottles for water and soft drinks, and HDPE jugs for milk and juice. Beyond those applications, there is no standard for what type of resin can be used, so it becomes more challenging for recyclers to identify and separate plastics to keep recycling streams pure.Maintaining the quality and integrity of recycling streams is critical to marketability and therefore profitability. Without market demand, reasonable margins, or affordable pricing for recycled materials and the applications that use them, the entire recycling system will fail.Complexity of the Plastic Recycling EcosystemWith a start as early as the 1960s, municipal recycling programs as we know them today didn't really gain scale until the 1990s. During that same period, plastic packaging changed dramatically as well, moving from the easier-to-identify-and-recycle rigid plastics like PET(E) and HDPE to include a broad range of performance plastics such as flexible LDPE films, PVC, PP, or PS.In 1988, about the time municipal recycling programs began to gain scale, the Plastics Industry Association (formerly Society of the Plastics Industry) developed resin identification codes (RIC) to ""provide a consistent national system to facilitate recycling of post-consumer plastics.""When first introduced, RIC symbols featured the universally recognized recycling symbol known as the ""chasing arrows"" to contain the resin type identification number. And, while those chasing arrows were intended only to facilitate the sorting process prior to recycling, the general public misinterpreted the symbols and began associating them directly with recyclability.Currently, ASTM International maintains upkeep of the RIC graphic standards. While they officially replaced the chasing arrows with a solid triangle in 2013, following these standards remains voluntary, and use of the chasing arrows remains prevalent. For packaging in particular, keeping up with changing voluntary standards can be challenging - as the replacement of a die or injection mold is often determined to be cost prohibitive for such a small change.Because RICs were never developed with brand owners or consumers in mind, claiming recyclability based on RIC alone is not enough. In today's environment, regardless of the material type, it becomes the responsibility of the consumer to check the rules that govern the program in which they participate.That's why SEE® recommends use of standardized labels such as How2Recycle in the U.S., On-Pack Recycling Labels in the U.K, or the Australasian Recycling Labels in Australia and New Zealand.And it's also why SEE® takes the position that when it comes to recycling plastic packaging, the proper instruction to consumers always starts with ""check locally.""Innovation and InfrastructureFor more than 20 years until 2018, China accepted nearly half of the world's recyclable waste, including 95% of the plastics collected in the E.U and 70% from the U.S. But when quality problems and contamination of their recycled materials caused a significant decline in market value, China instituted National Sword, a policy that banned the import of most plastics and other materials headed for their recycling processors.Prior to 2018, as the use and development of flexible plastic packaging skyrocketed, governments worried little about the need to build their own infrastructure to recycle it. At the same time, most consumers had no idea that the materials they put out at the curb eventually went overseas.The good news is countries and municipalities that may have once relied on exporting recyclables to China are now investing in and enhancing their own infrastructure. For example:Research conducted by the Materials Recovery for the Future project in 2020 showed that state-of-the-art optical sorting and peripheral systems are significantly improving the capture rate and quality of recycled flexible plastic packaging.Advanced recycling, also called chemical recycling, uses pyrolysis to create plastic with performance properties equal to virgin plastics that can be used for the same application from which they came - such as fresh food packaging.Industry associations are conducting initiatives focused on improving the process of recycling PE films, recycling post-industrial food packaging, or using recycled plastic content in products like asphalt.While these technologies are still in developmental stages, they are part of how SEE® and its related industries are working together to create more and better recycling solutions.Why SEE® Calls It Recycle-ReadySEE® defines recyclability as the likelihood that a material will be collected, recycled, and then made into a new, commercially viable product. Given the current state of the recycling ecosystem around the world that's not as easy or straightforward as it should be.The company understands that political climate, NGOs, or exchanges on social media often put pressure on an industry for change but SEE® won't take short cuts that could put the progress it's made at risk.The term recyclable has criteria associated with it that SEE® observes to ensure the purity, quality, and market value of its recycling streams. And, while the company will continue to develop and introduce new products with recyclability in mind, it acknowledges the infrastructure may not be ready to accommodate these innovations just yet - so it sends them to market as recycle-ready.As soon as these materials meet all criteria to be labeled 100% recyclable, SEE® will update the claim.Originally published on SealedAir.com.Sealed Air, Monday, May 8, 2023, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Sealed Air on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Sealed AirWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/sealed-airEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Sealed AirView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/753429/Recyclability-Claims-What-You-Need-To-Know]"

As a reminder, PG&amp;E will never send a single notification to a customer within one hour of a service interruption, and we will never ask customers to make payments with a pre-paid debit card, gift card, any form of cryptocurrency, or third-party digital payment mobile applications.""If you ever receive a call threatening utility disconnection if you do not make immediate payment, hang up the phone and either log into your account on PGE.com or call our customer service number to confirm your account details. Remember, PG&amp;E will never ask for your financial information over the phone or via email, nor will we request payment via pre-paid debit cards or other payment services like Zelle. End the call, end the scam,"" said Matt Foley, lead customer scam investigator for PG&amp;E.Based on data collected so far in 2023, scammers are stepping up their efforts to defraud customers. In fact, there have been over 19,000 scam attempts reported by customers to PG&amp;E, and customers have lost nearly $342,000 in the first four months of 2023 alone. During 2022, PG&amp;E received nearly 23,000 reports from customers who were targeted by scammers impersonating the company, and customers lost approximately $946,000 in fraudulent payments.Scammers can be convincing and often target those who are most vulnerable, including senior citizens and low-income communities. They also aim their scams at small business owners during busy customer service hours. Another recent emerging scam trend involves scammers targeting real estate agents via their listings, and threatening to shut off power if immediate payment is not made. However, with the right information, customers can learn to detect and report these predatory scams.Story continuesSigns of a potential scamThreat to disconnect: Scammers may aggressively demand immediate payment for an alleged past due bill.Request for immediate payment: Scammers may instruct the customer to purchase a prepaid card, then call them back supposedly to make a bill payment.Request for prepaid card: When the customer calls back, the caller asks the customer for the prepaid card's number, which grants the scammer instant access to the card's funds.Refund or rebate offers: Scammers may say that your utility company overbilled you and owes you a refund, or that you are entitled to a rebate, and ask you for your personal financial information.Scammers Impersonating Trusted Phone Numbers: Scammers are now able to create authentic-looking 800 numbers which appear on your phone display. The numbers don't lead back to PG&amp;E if called back, however, so if you have doubts, hang up and call PG&amp;E at 1-833-500-SCAM. If customers ever feel that they are in physical danger, they should call 911.How customers can protect themselvesCustomers should never purchase a prepaid card to avoid service disconnection or shutoff. PG&amp;E does not specify how customers should make a bill payment and offers a variety of ways to pay a bill, including accepting payments online, by phone, automatic bank draft, mail or in person.If a scammer threatens immediate disconnection or shutoff of service without prior notification, customers should hang up the phone, delete the email, or shut the door. Customers with delinquent accounts receive an advance disconnection notification, typically by mail and included with their regular monthly bill.Signing up for an online account at pge.com is another safeguard. Not only can customers log in to check their balance and payment history, they can also sign up for recurring payments, paperless billing and helpful alerts.Customers who suspect that they have been victims of fraud, or who feel threatened during contact with one of these scammers, should contact local law enforcement. The Federal Trade Commission's website is also a good source of information about how to protect personal information.For more information about scams, visit pge.com/scams or https://consumer.ftc.gov/scams.About PG&amp;EPacific Gas and Electric Company, a subsidiary of PG&amp;E Corporation (NYSE:PCG), is a combined natural gas and electric utility serving more than 16 million people across 70,000 square miles in Northern and Central California.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the data center industry, you can go directly to the 5 Best Data Center Stocks to Buy Now.Data Center companies worldwide posted record revenues in 2022, which reached $321.47 billion, according to a Statista analysis. The analysis anticipates the market to add more than $20 billion to the valuation by the end of this year. The 2022 performance is impressive, considering the global data center revenue was sub-$200 billion just two years ago.According to a research by Allied Market Research, the data center market was worth $187.35 billion in 2020 and was expected to clock $517.17 billion by 2030. Interestingly, Statista's analysis reaches a valuation close to Allied Market Research's, positing that the global data centers market will generate approximately $410.40 billion in revenue by 2027. However, the former's CAGR is significantly smaller, at 4.66%, compared to Allied Market Research's 10.50%. The CAGR mismatch notwithstanding, there appears to be strong agreement that the data centers market has immense potential to break past the half trillion USD mark before the decade's end.The CAGRs that several analyses are quoting at which the data center services market will grow in a particular forecast period are incredible. For example, Allied Market Research quotes 10.50% between 2021 and 2030, while Mordor Intelligence's figure is 13.69% between 2021 and 2026. In this light, a question arises: How will the market achieve an astronomical growth rate? In other words, what factors will drive the growth incredible growth?For Mordor Intelligence, the growing demand for cloud services will carry much weight. The claim is perhaps in response to a Markets and Markets report, which established that the cloud computing market will expand at a 17% CAGR between 2022 and 2027, reaching $1,240.90 billion. Since data centers provide the critical infrastructure that keeps the cloud computing market running, any expansion that cloud computing posts naturally reaches data center services companies.Story continuesBesides cloud computing, increasing demand for e-commerce services will also spur growth in the data center services market. According to Statista, the revenue generated by e-commerce companies worldwide could reach $4.11 trillion at the end of this year. The organization makes a bolder claim that the market should be worth $6.35 trillion by 2027, thanks to an 11.51% CAGR. With the expansion of the e-commerce space comes the possibility of the data center services market's growth potential blowing up. This is because e-commerce customers want more personalized data and better recommendations for what products to buy, which is made possible by services undergirded by data centers.As the growth potential of the data center services market expands, the companies involved in this space have more room to grow revenues. Consequently, with stronger financials comes an increased likelihood for the stocks to climb higher. The corporations whose businesses undergird the data center services market include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

Logistics real estate, meanwhile, has some of the most attractive market dynamics of all real estate subsectors, and Prologis is a clear leader within the group.

But the chain, which operates 2,800 stores under such banners as Kay Jewelers, Zales and Peoples, reported in March fourth-quarter earnings results that beat analysts' expectations, and it offered a solid annual profit forecast. It's also focusing on higher-income consumers as the economy weakens.In April, the Bermuda-based company said its goal is to reach as much as $10 billion in annual sales within the next five years, up from $7.8 billion in the latest year ended Jan. 28 That growth should be fueled by a continued rebound in U.S. engagements and demand for pricier jewelry. Shares of Signet are up 2% so far this year.Signet's Group President and Chief Consumer Officer Jamie Singleton recently spoke with The Associated Press about how the pandemic shaped buying habits; moves to diverse its ranks and its supply chain network. Signet rocked the diamond industry in March 2022 when it said it will no longer buy diamonds from Russia after the country invaded Ukraine. Singleton also discussed one of the hottest fashion trends — men embracing jewelry. Her responses have been edited for clarity and length.Q. What's your customers' approach to buying jewelry for their loved ones?A. Our proprietary research is showing that considered purchases — sentimental purchases— over $1,000 are outperforming all of the other categories that we have. Our customers are still wanting bigger diamonds, better quality, higher carat gold. Coming out of the pandemic... people have a tighter circle of meaningful friends and loved ones in their life, and they’re still showing grand gestures of love and appreciation and sentimentality in their life. It's not limited to men gifting to women. There's a range of women gifting beautiful jewelry to men in their lives.Story continuesQ. How has Signet increased diversity among executives and in the boardroom?A. We need a team of women and people of color. We need a team of young parents who need flexibility. I think the work we have done there is among the work we are most proud of. Forty-two percent of our board of directors are women. Two of the 12 are Black. And 42% of those holding the title of VP and above are women. We need to relate to one another's lives.Q. What happened when Russia invaded Ukraine?A. We really consider ourselves to be customers advocates, and we have an incredibly strong supply chain. When the war started, we were the first to make sure that we were not bringing diamonds that were mined in Russia into our products. We worked closely with our vendors to be able to control prices and be able to bring great value to our customers.Q. How do you vet your suppliers?A. We're founding members of the Responsible Joint Council, founded in 2005. And we are active member of the World Diamond Council. We put a lot of police work in our supply chain. Last year was the first year of our 10 year journey towards achieving our corporate sustainability goals with a focus on environmental, social and governance. (These are) 44 goals aligned with the U.N.Q. Last year was the year of the wedding. What about this year?A. The year of the anniversary. A lot of people celebrate their first anniversary this year. But we are beginning to see some of the normalization. And as people set priorities, jewelry is remaining a high priority on people’s lists.Q. Are you preparing for a recession?A. We do prepare for all kinds of scenarios. We have people at the high end and people at the more moderate end. And last year, what we experienced with our more value-based shoppers is that the impact of a recession felt very, very real to them. We really worked hard to value engineer products and give them more for their money. We also worked on giving them easier options to finance.Q. What's one big trend in jewelry right now?A.. We're in a real fashion cycle in men. The younger generation of men have their ears pierced, and they’re wearing stacks and layered jewelry. These are men with a point of view on fashion and in the way that they want to look. Men's fashion is trending hard, and I don't see it stopping or slowing down.Q. What's selling well ahead of Mother's Day?A. Across all banners, we continue to see demand for both mined and lab-created diamonds across engagement and fashion jewelry. Fancy shapes over 1 carat including marquise and emerald are hot trends in engagement rings, and fashion is all about bold, classic looks in solitaire earrings, and line bracelets and necks. Customers are also really focusing on the classics and their jewelry box essentials.Q. Are Signet employees back at the office?A. We are hybrid. We have a workforce that is in and out of the office to some degree by job function. And then we have some days where we all, as a company, come into the office and have time together in the office as a team and will continue to do that. But we do believe that there’s value in face-to-face interactions.______ Follow Anne D’Innocenzio: http://twitter.com/ADInnocenzio]"

Overall, Pizza Hut’s same-store sales rose 7%.Story continuesView more earnings on YUMTaco Bell reported same-store sales growth of 8% for the quarter, while being the brand that saw the largest increase in openings as it continued to expand its international footprint.McDonald’s Key FiguresFirst quarter earnings and revenue exceeded Wall Street Estimates, with U.S. traffic rising for the third consecutive quarter. Net sales expanded 4% as they amounted to $5.9 billion with all three divisions reporting same-store sales growth of 12.6%.For the quarter ended on March 31st, McDonald’s made a net income of $1.8 billion, or $2.45 per share, up from $1.1 billion, or $1.48 per share it made during 2022’s comparable quarter. Adjusting for charges and other items, such as the $180 million charge related to terminating leases and employee severance as part of a corporate reorganization, McDonald’s EPS adds up to $2.63. Although executives are confident of the fast-food giant’s ability to navigate any challenges that lie ahead, they are conservative in their expectations regarding the macroeconomic environment.Chipotle Proves Its Pricing PowerWhat’s even more impressive with Chipotle is that its traffic rose above expectations despite the Mexican food chain making one of the biggest price increases. With 10% higher menu prices compared to last year’s comparable quarter, Chipotle’s pricing power is more than proven. Both top and bottom lines exceeded estimates as first-quarter net income amounted to $291.6 million, or $10.50 per share, rising from $158.3 million, or $5.59 per share earned during 2022’s comparable quarter on the back of revenue expanding 17.2%, to $2.37 billion, from $2 billion generated during 2022’s comparable quarter. CEO Brian Niccol revealed that higher-income consumers are returning to restaurants more frequently, as well as lower-income ones compared to six months ago but the traffic of the later is still lower compared to 2022’s comparable quarter. Overall, traffic rose about 4%, succeeding to reverse last quarter’s decline. 41 new locations were opened during the three-month period.Affordable Food Cravings Are Stronger Than Recessionary FearsValue menus helped attract diners who would otherwise be pulling back on their restaurant spending. Yum! Brands, McDonalds and Chipotle not only flourished but also succeeded in resisting the industry trend of slipping traffic as their reports showed that especially US consumers are willing to indulge in affordable dining despite higher menu prices.DISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

This rating change essentially reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company's changing earnings picture. The Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years is tracked by the system.Since a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near-term stock price movements, the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors. They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.Therefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for Monster Beverage basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price.Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock PricesThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock.Fundamentally speaking, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Monster Beverage imply an improvement in the company's underlying business. Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher.Story continuesHarnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate RevisionsAs empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.Earnings Estimate Revisions for Monster BeverageThis energy drink maker is expected to earn $1.50 per share for the fiscal year ending December 2023, which represents a year-over-year change of 33.9%.Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Monster Beverage. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 0.1%.Bottom LineUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here &gt;&gt;&gt;The upgrade of Monster Beverage to a Zacks Rank #2 positions it in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

73,b540dfd7-34d3-3265-821e-2899b2dcd600,MNST,2023-05-09,Monster Beverage (MNST) is a Great Momentum Stock: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/monster-beverage-mnst-great-momentum-160004631.html,1683561604,STORY,['MNST'],"[Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock's recent trend, which can be in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" And for investors following this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.Below, we take a look at Monster Beverage (MNST), a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of B. We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions, two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score.It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Monster Beverage currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;Set to Beat the Market?Let's discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for MNST that show why this energy drink maker shows promise as a solid momentum pick.Looking at a stock's short-term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum, since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area.Story continuesFor MNST, shares are up 5.52% over the past week while the Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry is flat over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 13.6% compares favorably with the industry's 1.53% performance as well.Considering longer term price metrics, like performance over the last three months or year, can be advantageous as well. Shares of Monster Beverage have increased 16.17% over the past quarter, and have gained 37.79% in the last year. In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 has only moved 0.39% and 1.3%, respectively.Investors should also pay attention to MNST's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. MNST is currently averaging 3,909,463 shares for the last 20 days.Earnings OutlookThe Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things, including estimate revisions and a stock's price movement. Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank, and a nice path here can be promising. We have recently been noticing this with MNST.Over the past two months, 4 earnings estimates moved higher compared to 1 lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost MNST's consensus estimate, increasing from $1.49 to $1.50 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 4 estimates have moved upwards while there have been 1 downward revision in the same time period.Bottom LineGiven these factors, it shouldn't be surprising that MNST is a #2 (Buy) stock and boasts a Momentum Score of B. If you're looking for a fresh pick that's set to soar in the near-term, make sure to keep Monster Beverage on your short list.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

There was a new note out from JPMorgan Chase. Now, the banking giant turning bullish on American Airlines, upgrading the airline to overweight from neutral while raising its price target to 29 bucks from $26 a share. Now saying in this note, quote, ""it's now the larger airlines that control the high ground.""And Akiko, when we take a look at American specifically and what JPMorgan liked about American, they mentioned the revenue guides, the margin improvement, the fact that the company posted a $10 million profit last quarter. Revenue was up 37%. A lot of that strength, Akiko, coming from the demand to travel internationally as we do see more and more COVID restrictions lifted worldwide. People are back out. They want to travel international. And we're seeing that reflected not only in American's plans, but from a number of its competitors as well.- Yeah. I mean, when you think about where JPMorgan is coming in overweight, they were already overweight the other carriers. So American Airlines just joining the pack here. But really is about the domestic versus international. Obviously, the discount carriers don't have that. So we are seeing that dynamics shift in a big way.You talk about the debt picture for American Airlines. Significant improvement on that front. 60% on their way to completing its goal of cutting debt by $15 billion by the end of 2025. JPMorgan saying in this note that, yes, that's a good thing. It doesn't mean that things are fixed. But they are on track here at a quicker rate in terms of addressing that debt.- Yeah. Certainly. And we can see, obviously, JP Morgan, they're not alone in the optimistic view that they have for a number of the larger carriers here in the US. But, Akiko, also on this note, JP Morgan didn't really have the same rosy picture, or outlook, I should say, for some of those discount airlines, particularly you're looking at Southwest. They downgraded that stock to neutral from overweight. Also reduced their price target to 39 bucks a share from 64. Southwest shares hovering near the flatline. Less than an hour here to go before the bell. Off just about 2/10 of a percent. They also downgraded Frontier as well, just saying that the path forward here is a little bit less clear for some of those discount airlines.Story continues- Yeah. I mean, Southwest, of course, coming off of a bumpy-- no pun intended really here, but a bumpy ride for that airline when we're talking about delays and challenges with travelers. So that's already, in some ways, we've already seen that weigh on the stock. But when you think about how things are shaping up for the summer, Seana, we keep hearing that there is really this demand, that consumers are still willing to shell out money for that big summer travel. It's going to be interesting to me to watch.I mean, we're obviously seeing where the note is saying that they think international demand is continuing to stay strong. I mean, those tickets, I don't know if you've been searching, but they are not cheap. I'd be curious to see how much, to what extent that demand continues, especially in the face of inflation.- Yeah, Akiko. I'm so happy you brought that up because it has certainly been astonishing. We're talking about the fact that Americans are facing higher prices in nearly every aspect on their lives. They're pulling back in many situations on their discretionary spending. When you take a look at airfares, they're up, what, about 30% still on a year over year basis. Those international flights are very, very expensive. So I would not be shocked if some people are forced to, unfortunately, maybe change their travel plans over the coming months, given the fact that inflation remains so sticky.]"

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Scientific Instruments Stocks To Buy. Scientific instruments are tools used to measure, record, and indicate physical quantities, aiding in scientific research and new product development. These instruments are designed to accomplish theoretical research and can be used to measure, analyze, and verify the properties of materials and elements. Scientific instruments play a crucial role in developing new products and improving existing ones. As per Data Bridge Market Research, the scientific instruments market is predicted to increase from $41.13 billion in 2022 to $58.05 billion by 2030, experiencing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.4% between 2023 and 2030.According to the latest report by IMARC Group, the global market is being driven by the increasing emphasis on R&amp;D in developing new products and the growing collaboration between governments and manufacturers to improve the effectiveness of scientific instruments. The growth of testing and research facilities in biotechnology and pharmaceuticals, along with heavy investments in the healthcare sector by many countries, is also contributing to market growth. Additionally, the rising demand for generics and biosimilars, and pharmaceutical companies' focus on improving drug development processes and product quality, is driving the demand for high-quality scientific instruments. The market is further boosted by the growing need for better analysis equipment and the rapid advancements in neuroscience and applied microbiology. Allied Market Research has categorized the global scientific instruments market into different segments. The firm stated that the clinical analyzers segment is expected to generate the highest revenue during the forecast period from 2021 to 2030, driven by the increasing adoption of point of care testing devices and laboratory automation, and the rise in chronic conditions that require clinical analyzers for diagnosis. Moreover, the research segment is expected to experience the fastest compound annual growth rate due to the rising demand for scientific instruments in the research of chronic conditions such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and neurological diseases, and the development of advanced instruments for research purposes. Lastly, the hospitals &amp; diagnostic laboratories segment is the dominant end-user segment, driven by the escalating number of outpatients and inpatients in hospitals, and the adoption of newer methods and advanced instruments for research purposes in diagnostic laboratories. Story continuesTo benefit from the growth opportunities in the scientific instruments market, investors can pick up stocks like Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO), Agilent Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:A), and Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR). Our Methodology We scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 943 hedge funds and picked the top 10 companies that operate in the scientific instruments sector with the highest number of hedge fund investors. These are the best scientific instruments stocks to buy according to hedge funds.10 Best Scientific Instruments Stocks To BuyVereshchagin Dmitry/Shutterstock.comBest Scientific Instruments Stocks To Buy10. Mirion Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:MIR)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 28Mirion Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:MIR) offers a range of products and services related to the detection, measurement, analysis, and monitoring of radiation. The company is divided into two main segments – Medical and Industrial, each focusing on specific areas of expertise. Mirion Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:MIR) serves a wide range of customers including healthcare facilities, research laboratories, military organizations, government agencies, industrial companies, power and utility companies, reactor design firms, and nuclear power plants. On May 3, the company reported a Q1 GAAP EPS of -$0.22 and a revenue of $182.1 million, up 11.6% year-over-year and beating estimates by $2.90 million. On February 15, Citi analyst Andrew Kaplowitz raised the firm's price target on Mirion Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:MIR) to $11 from $10 and maintained a Buy rating on the shares following the ""solid"" Q4 results. Kaplowitz considers Mirion's initial 2023 guidance to be both cautious and promising, suggesting a continued growth trajectory for the company.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 28 hedge funds were long Mirion Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:MIR), compared to 26 funds in the prior quarter. Anand Parekh’s Alyeska Investment Group is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 7.7 million shares worth $51.2 million. Like Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO), Agilent Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:A), and Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR), Mirion Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:MIR) is one of the best scientific instruments stocks to invest in. Here is what Baron Growth Fund has to say about Mirion Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:MIR) in its Q4 2021 investor letter:“This quarter, the Fund initiated a position in Mirion Technologies, Inc., a leader in ionizing radiation detection and measurement technologies to the medical, laboratory, and nuclear power industries. The business consists of a portfolio of niche, mission-critical products that represent a small portion of a project’s costs but can cause extensive collateral damage if they fail. Products include dosimeters that monitor radiation levels of medical professionals, quality assurance equipment and software for nuclear medicine treatments, and instrumentation and equipment that is core to the construction, operation, and decommissioning of nuclear power plants.We think that Mirion has the potential to be a compelling industrial compounder. The company is already the largest player in over 80% of its end markets, and in aggregate is approximately 3.5 times larger than its nearest competitor. We estimate that Mirion’s end markets should grow at 5% to 6% annually, driven by favorable secular trends and a consistent replacement cycle. We expect Mirion to grow in line with or ahead of its end markets on an organic basis, as it leverages its scale advantage to take modest market share. Organic growth should be complemented by Mirion’s successful acquisition strategy, driving aggregate growth into the double digit range. In addition, we believe the company has an opportunity to expand markets by 500 bps-plus of margin over time through a favorable mix shift, higher utilization rates, and ongoing M&amp;A synergy realization.We believe that Mirion boasts a capable and accomplished senior management team. CEO Tom Logan has been with the company since 2005 and has led the strategy that has grown Mirion’s revenues from $123 million at inception to approximately $700 million currently. The new chairman of Mirion, Larry Kingsley, has a strong history of shareholder value creation as the former CEO of industrial technology leaders Pall Corporation and IDEX Corporation. We think his expertise will be well utilized as Mirion embarks on its next stage of growth.”9. Fortive Corporation (NYSE:FTV)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 33Fortive Corporation (NYSE:FTV) specializes in the design, development, manufacturing, marketing, and servicing of professional and engineered products, software, and services. Fortive Corporation (NYSE:FTV)’s Intelligent Operating Solutions segment focuses on providing advanced instrumentation such as electrical test and measurement tools. These offerings cater to a wide range of industries such as manufacturing, process industries, healthcare, utilities and power, communications, electronics, and others. It is one of the best scientific instruments stocks to invest in. On April 26, Fortive Corporation (NYSE:FTV) reported a Q1 non-GAAP EPS of $0.75 and a revenue of $1.46 billion, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.02 and $40 million, respectively. JPMorgan analyst Stephen Tusa raised the firm's price target on Fortive Corporation (NYSE:FTV) on April 27 to $78 from $77 and maintained an Overweight rating on the shares. The analyst informed investors that Fortive reported better-than-expected results for Q1, surpassing expectations in terms of organic growth and margins. As a result, the analyst has raised estimates to reflect the company's strong performance at the beginning of the year.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 33 hedge funds were bullish on Fortive Corporation (NYSE:FTV), compared to 29 funds in the prior quarter. Phill Gross and Robert Atchinson’s Adage Capital Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 4.48 million shares worth $288.3 million. Cooper Investors made the following comment about Fortive Corporation (NYSE:FTV) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Fortive Corporation (NYSE:FTV) completed several acquisitions and had probably its best year operationally since the 2016 spin-off from Danaher, reporting several quarters in a row of double-digit organic growth and margin expansion that beat market estimates. The business has now unlocked the potential we always saw in it, with software accounting for almost a quarter of revenues today, providing a nice element of recurring cash flow to support the more cyclical industrial parts of the group.”8. Teledyne Technologies Incorporated (NYSE:TDY)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 34Teledyne Technologies Incorporated (NYSE:TDY) delivers technological solutions that drive growth in industrial markets worldwide. The company's Instrumentation segment specializes in providing monitoring and control instruments used in marine, environmental, industrial, and other applications. Additionally, Teledyne Technologies Incorporated (NYSE:TDY) offers electronic test and measurement equipment, as well as power and communications connectivity devices for distributed instrumentation systems and sensor networks. It is one of the best scientific instruments stocks to watch. On April 26, Teledyne Technologies Incorporated (NYSE:TDY) reported a Q1 non-GAAP EPS of $4.53 and a revenue of $1.38 billion, topping Wall Street estimates by $0.10 and $10 million, respectively. Needham analyst James Ricchiuti maintained a Buy rating on Teledyne Technologies Incorporated (NYSE:TDY) but lowered the firm's price target on the shares to $470 on April 28. The analyst informed investors that Teledyne Technologies Incorporated (NYSE:TDY)’s Q1 results were considered solid, with consistent demand and margins. However, the company's earnings guidance fell short of consensus expectations. Nevertheless, Needham highlights Teledyne Technologies Incorporated (NYSE:TDY)’s diverse portfolio of businesses, its demonstrated track record of success even in uncertain economic times, and its strong financial position, all of which should provide support to the stock at its current levels.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 34 hedge funds were long Teledyne Technologies Incorporated (NYSE:TDY), compared to 38 funds in the prior quarter. Select Equity Group is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 2.26 million shares worth $906 million. Here is what Artisan Partners specifically said about Teledyne Technologies Incorporated (NYSE:TDY) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“We trimmed our position in Teledyne Technologies Incorporated (NYSE:TDY) during Q2 as shares approached our PMV estimate. Teledyne is a supplier of enabling technologies to sense, transmit and analyze information for a diverse group of end markets, including aerospace &amp; defense, factory automation, medical imaging, oil &amp; gas, pharmaceutical research and environmental monitoring. The company is delivering healthy organic growth despite headwinds from semiconductor shortages, led by particular strength in its dental and industrial imaging. Margins and cash flows have accelerated as management has successfully integrated its 2021 acquisition of FLIR Systems, a leader in thermal imaging systems. Meanwhile, Teledyne’s shares have recently benefited from an anticipated increase in demand from Western governments seeking to supply Ukraine with military equipment. The company’s aerospace and defense segment is not core to our thesis—Teledyne’s margins and top-line growth have benefited for over a decade from reducing exposure to this area and placing more emphasis on asset-light businesses—though in the current environment it will likely experience a period of elevated demand.”7. PerkinElmer, Inc. (NYSE:PKI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 34PerkinElmer, Inc. (NYSE:PKI) offers a wide range of products, services, and solutions to various markets including diagnostics, life sciences, and applied services. The company operates through two main segments – Discovery &amp; Analytical Solutions and Diagnostics. Via the Discovery &amp; Analytical Solutions segment, PerkinElmer, Inc. (NYSE:PKI) provides scientists with instruments, reagents, informatics, software, subscriptions, detection, and imaging technologies. These offerings aim to facilitate research breakthroughs in the life sciences research market, as well as provide contract research and laboratory services. It is one of the premier scientific instruments stocks to invest in. On March 9, Citi analyst Patrick Donnelly put ""positive catalyst watches"" on shares of PerkinElmer, Inc. (NYSE:PKI) following the Q4 reports. For PerkinElmer, Inc. (NYSE:PKI), the analyst expects potential upside from a China diagnostics recovery and a ""compelling valuation.""According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 34 hedge funds were bullish on PerkinElmer, Inc. (NYSE:PKI), compared to 30 funds in the last quarter. Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 1.28 million shares worth $179.5 million. Renaissance Large Cap Growth Strategy made the following comment about PerkinElmer, Inc. (NYSE:PKI) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Conversely, we sold our position in PerkinElmer, Inc. (NYSE:PKI) following a deterioration in fundamental factors. After a careful review, we believe the prudent decision is to step aside until the company completes the divestiture of its Applied, Food, and Enterprise Services business to private equity. While it allows PerkinElmer to become a pure-play Life Sciences &amp; Diagnostics business, the divestiture will also produce a company that may operate with under-utilized assets until the new management team can deploy capital to rebuild its revenue base following the loss of approximately 30% of revenues.”6. Roper Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:ROP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 41Roper Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:ROP) specializes in designing and developing software, as well as technology-enabled products and solutions. Furthermore, Roper Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:ROP) also provides scientific products and devices such as ultrasound accessories, dispensers, metering pumps, automated surgical scrub and linen dispensing equipment, water meters, optical and electromagnetic measurement systems, as well as medical devices. On April 27, the company reported a Q1 non-GAAP EPS of $3.90 and a revenue of $1.47 billion, outperforming Wall Street consensus by $0.04 and $20 million, respectively. On May 2, TD Cowen analyst Joseph Giordano increased the price target for Roper Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:ROP) to $525 from $500 while maintaining an Outperform rating on the company's shares. According to the analyst, Roper Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:ROP) delivered one of the strongest reports among similar companies during this season, and their diversified portfolio, focused on software in niche markets, is highly appealing as the market appears to be entering a period of cyclical weakness.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 41 hedge funds were bullish on Roper Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:ROP), compared to 44 funds in the earlier quarter. Henry Ellenbogen’s Durable Capital Partners is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 1.68 million shares worth $727.70 million. In addition to Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO), Agilent Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:A), and Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR), Roper Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:ROP) is one of the top plays in the scientific instruments market. Wasatch U.S. Select Strategy made the following comment about Roper Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:ROP) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Roper Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:ROP) was another large contributor. The stock was up after the company released strong third-quarter financial results, including revenue and earnings growth that exceeded consensus expectations. Roper develops software and other engineered products for a variety of niche markets and industries. The company owns 26 independent businesses, most of which enjoy strong barriers to entry and leadership positions in their respective markets. The management team has done an exceptional job, in our view, of improving the operating performance and free cash flow generation of the businesses in its portfolio, then deploying that cash into acquiring new businesses that fit a similar profile. Roper’s ability to put up strong results in what’s been a challenging operating environment for many businesses speaks to the durability of the business.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Scientific Instruments Stocks To Buy.  Suggested articles:20 Most Valuable Smartphone Companies in the World15 High Paying Jobs for Felons That Offer a Second Chance15 Part Time Jobs for 18 Year Olds With No Experience Required Disclosure: None. 10 Best Scientific Instruments Stocks To Buy is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

80,4aedb0f2-3fd1-3f96-b162-ff195e3af11f,WU,2023-05-09,Affirm (AFRM) to Post Q3 Earnings: What You Should Expect,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/affirm-afrm-post-q3-earnings-153903042.html,1683560343,STORY,"['AFRM', 'MA', 'V', 'WU']","[Affirm Holdings, Inc. AFRM is set to report its third-quarter fiscal 2023 results on May 9, after the closing bell.Important EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter fiscal 2023 loss per share of 91 cents suggests a 379% plunge from the prior-year loss of 19 cents. The estimate remained stable over the past week. The consensus estimate for third-quarter fiscal 2023 revenues of $366.9 million indicates a 3.4% increase from the year-ago reported figure.Affirm beat on earnings in one of the trailing four quarters and missed thrice, the average negative surprise being 0.1%. This is depicted in the graph below.Affirm Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseAffirm Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseAffirm Holdings, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Affirm Holdings, Inc. QuoteBefore we get into what to expect for the to-be-reported quarter in detail, it’s worth taking a look at AFRM’s previous-quarter performance first.Q2 Earnings RewindIn the last reported quarter, this leading payment network’s adjusted loss per share of $1.10 missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8.9%, primarily due to increased operating costs. This was partially offset by growing transactions and a significant increase in servicing income.Now, let’s see how things have shaped up prior to the third-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings announcement.Q3 Factors to NoteResilient consumer spending in the March quarter despite inflationary pressures is expected to have benefited the payment solution provider. Travel and entertainment-related spending is expected to have risen in the quarter under review. This, in turn, is likely to have augmented the strength of active merchants and consumers.The sales figures from the virtual card networks are anticipated to have risen. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for virtual card network revenues is pegged at $25.8 million, indicating an 11.3% year-over-year rise.The consensus mark for interest income in the fiscal third quarter is pegged at $166.1 million, indicating a 23.4% jump from the previous fiscal-year quarter’s $134.6 million. These are expected to have positioned the company for year-over-year growth in the fiscal third-quarter top line.Story continuesThe positives are likely to have been partially offset by lower servicing income, merchant network revenues and higher operating costs. The consensus mark for servicing income indicates a 2.3% year-over-year fall. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for gain on sales of loans suggests a 10.1% year-over-year decline.Moreover, the consensus estimate for merchant network revenues is pegged at $111.4 million, indicating a decrease of 8% from a year ago. Reductions in the concentration of certain APR loans are expected to have affected the metric.Also, operating costs are likely to have increased in the quarter under review, affecting the bottom line. Higher processing and servicing costs, as a result of increased volumes, are anticipated to have boosted the operating costs, reducing profits and making an earnings beat uncertain.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Affirm this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Earnings ESP: The company currently has an Earnings ESP of -23.08%. This is because the Most Accurate Estimate currently stands at a loss of $1.12 per share, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 91 cents.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Affirm currently carries a Zacks Rank #2.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.How Other Stocks PerformedHere are some companies from the Business Services space that have already reported earnings for the March quarter. These include Mastercard Incorporated MA, Visa Inc. V and The Western Union Company WU.Mastercard reported first-quarter 2023 adjusted earnings of $2.80 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.3%. The quarterly results were driven by improved cross-border travel, coupled with an expanding payment network and value-added services and solutions. However, the upside was partly offset by the company’s escalating operating expense level.Visa reported second-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings of $2.09 per share, which outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.97. The quarterly results were aided by higher payments, and cross-border volumes and processed transactions. Steady cross-border travel growth and lower-than-expected client incentives aided the results, partially offset by higher costs.Western Union reported first-quarter 2023 earnings per share of 43 cents, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 30.3%. WU’s earnings were supported by the strength witnessed in the Middle East business, Evolve 2025’s momentum, lower consumer acquisition costs and transaction growth. However, adverse currency impact, discontinuation of operations across Russia and Belarus and promotional pricing activities partially offset the positives.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Organic sales growth as a percentage of net sales was 17.6%.Income from continuing operations for the quarter increased $105 million, or 52.8%, to $304 million from $199 million in the comparable quarter a year ago. The increase in income from continuing operations primarily reflects the increase in net sales described above and favorable sales mix. The increase was partially offset by higher income tax expense and higher interest expense.Adjusted net income for the quarter increased 50.2% to $341 million, or $5.98 per share, from $227 million, or $3.86 per share, in the comparable quarter a year ago.EBITDA for the quarter increased 28.7% to $757 million from $588 million for the comparable quarter a year ago. EBITDA As Defined for the quarter increased 29.1% to $817 million compared with $633 million in the comparable quarter a year ago. EBITDA As Defined as a percentage of net sales for the quarter was 51.3% compared with 47.7% in the comparable quarter a year ago.Story continues""I am very pleased with the operating results for the second quarter and to see this continued strong performance as we hit the halfway point in our fiscal year,"" stated Kevin Stein, TransDigm Group's President and Chief Executive Officer. ""Total revenue for the quarter ran ahead of our expectations. Revenues sequentially improved in all three of our major market channels - commercial OEM, commercial aftermarket and defense; and bookings outpaced revenues for each of these market channels. Our EBITDA As Defined margin improved to 51.3% for the quarter, up approximately 360 basis points from the comparable prior year period. This progression in our EBITDA As Defined margin is a result of strict focus on our operating strategy and dedicated efforts across our team, along with continued recovery in our commercial aftermarket revenues.Additionally, we are excited to have recently closed the acquisition of Calspan Corporation. Calspan Corporation has established positions across a diverse range of aftermarket-focused aerospace and defense development and testing services. This business fits well with our long-standing strategy, and its unique service offerings exhibit the earnings stability and growth potential that we have come to expect of our components-centered businesses.""Financing ActivitiesAs set out below, during the quarter, TransDigm completed two refinancings, the net effect of which was to extend its 2025 debt maturities out into 2028.During the quarter, TransDigm successfully completed a refinancing and repaid in full the approximately $5,559 million in the aggregate of Tranche E term loans maturing March 30, 2025, and Tranche F term loans maturing December 9, 2025. The Tranche E and Tranche F term loans were replaced with approximately $4,559 million of Tranche I term loans maturing August 24, 2028, along with the net proceeds from a private offering of $1,000 million of 6.75% Senior Secured Notes due August 15, 2028. The applicable interest rate for the Tranche I term loans is Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (""SOFR"") plus 3.25%.Also during the quarter, TransDigm successfully completed a private offering of $1,100 million of 6.75% Senior Secured Notes due August 15, 2028. These notes were an additional issuance of the previously issued $1,000 million 6.75% Senior Secured Notes described above. TransDigm used the net proceeds from the offering, plus cash on hand, to redeem all of its $1,100 million of outstanding 8.00% Senior Secured Notes due 2025 (""2025 Secured Notes""). On March 9, 2023, TransDigm announced the cash tender offer for all of its outstanding 2025 Secured Notes.Subsequent to the quarter, on April 10, 2023, TransDigm completed the redemption of the $1,100 million of outstanding 2025 Secured Notes.Acquisition of Calspan CorporationSubsequent to the quarter, on May 8, 2023, TransDigm completed the acquisition of Calspan Corporation (""Calspan"") for approximately $725 million in cash, including certain tax benefits. Calspan is a leading independent provider of highly engineered testing and technology development services and systems primarily for the aerospace &amp; defense industry. Calspan's state of the art transonic wind tunnel in Buffalo, New York is used across a range of important aftermarket-focused development activities for both the commercial and defense aerospace end markets.Year-to-Date ResultsNet sales for the twenty-six week period ended April 1, 2023 increased 18.6%, or $468 million, to $2,989 million from $2,521 million in the comparable period a year ago. Organic sales growth as a percentage of net sales for the twenty-six week period ended April 1, 2023 was 16.5%.Income from continuing operations for the twenty-six week period ended April 1, 2023 increased $171 million, or 47.2%, to $533 million from $362 million in the comparable period a year ago. The increase in income from continuing operations primarily reflects the increase in net sales described above and favorable sales mix. The increase was partially offset by a higher effective tax rate and higher interest expense.GAAP earnings per share were reduced in fiscal 2023 and 2022 by $0.67 per share and $0.78 per share, respectively, as a result of dividend equivalent payments made during each year. As a reminder, GAAP earnings per share are reduced when TransDigm makes dividend equivalent payments pursuant to the Company's stock option plans. These dividend equivalent payments are made during the Company's first fiscal quarter each year and also upon payment of any special dividends.Adjusted net income for the twenty-six week period ended April 1, 2023 increased 48.6% to $602 million, or $10.55 per share, from $405 million, or $6.85 per share, in the comparable period a year ago.EBITDA for the twenty-six week period ended April 1, 2023 increased 26.8% to $1,407 million from $1,110 million for the comparable period a year ago. EBITDA As Defined for the period increased 26.5% to $1,516 compared with $1,198 in the comparable period a year ago. EBITDA As Defined as a percentage of net sales for the period was 50.7% compared with 47.5% in the comparable period a year ago.Please see the attached tables for a reconciliation of income from continuing operations to EBITDA, EBITDA As Defined, and adjusted net income; a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to EBITDA and EBITDA As Defined, and a reconciliation of earnings per share to adjusted earnings per share for the periods discussed in this press release.Fiscal 2023 OutlookMr. Stein stated, ""We are raising our full year guidance primarily to reflect our strong second quarter results, the recent acquisition of Calspan, and our current expectations for the remainder of the fiscal year. We are pleased to once again raise our guidance for fiscal 2023 and to see the continuation of favorable trends in the commercial aerospace market recovery, including the growth of flight activity in China.""TransDigm now expects fiscal 2023 financial guidance to be as follows:Net sales are anticipated to be in the range of $6,410 million to $6,500 million compared with $5,429 million in fiscal 2022 (an increase of $300 million at the mid-point);Net income from continuing operations is anticipated to be in the range of $1,141 million to $1,191 million compared with $866 million in fiscal 2022 (an increase of $46 million at the mid-point);Earnings per share from continuing operations is expected to be in the range of $19.30 to $20.18 per share based upon weighted average shares outstanding of 57.1 million shares compared with $13.38 per share in fiscal 2022 (an increase of $0.80 at the mid-point);EBITDA As Defined is anticipated to be in the range of $3,230 million to $3,290 million compared with $2,646 million in fiscal 2022 (an increase of $150 million at the midpoint and corresponding to an EBITDA As Defined margin guide of approximately 50.5% for fiscal 2023);Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $23.31 to $24.19 per share compared with $17.14 per share in fiscal 2022 (an increase of $1.58 at the mid-point); andFiscal 2023 outlook is based on the following market growth assumptions:Please see the attached Table 6 for a reconciliation of EBITDA, EBITDA As Defined to net income and reported earnings per share to adjusted earnings per share guidance mid-point estimated for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2023.

Major product offerings, substantially all of which are ultimately provided to end-users in the aerospace industry, include mechanical/electro-mechanical actuators and controls, ignition systems and engine technology, specialized pumps and valves, power conditioning devices, specialized AC/DC electric motors and generators, batteries and chargers, engineered latching and locking devices, engineered rods, engineered connectors and elastomer sealing solutions, databus and power controls, cockpit security components and systems, specialized and advanced cockpit displays, engineered audio, radio and antenna systems, specialized lavatory components, seat belts and safety restraints, engineered and customized interior surfaces and related components, advanced sensor products, switches and relay panels, thermal protection and insulation, lighting and control technology, parachutes, high performance hoists, winches and lifting devices, and cargo loading, handling and delivery systems.Non-GAAP Supplemental InformationEBITDA, EBITDA As Defined, EBITDA As Defined Margin, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share are non-GAAP financial measures presented in this press release as supplemental disclosures to net income and reported results. TransDigm Group defines EBITDA as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and defines EBITDA As Defined as EBITDA plus certain non-operating items recorded as corporate expenses, including non-cash compensation charges incurred in connection with TransDigm Group's stock incentive or deferred compensation plans, foreign currency gains and losses, acquisition-integration costs, acquisition and divestiture transaction-related expenses, and refinancing costs.  Acquisition and divestiture-related costs represent accounting adjustments to inventory associated with acquisitions of businesses and product lines that were charged to cost of sales when the inventory was sold; costs incurred to integrate acquired businesses and product lines into the Company's operations, facility relocation costs and other acquisition-related costs; transaction-related costs for both acquisitions and divestitures comprising deal fees; legal, financial and tax diligence expenses and valuation costs that are required to be expensed as incurred and other acquisition accounting adjustments. TransDigm Group defines adjusted net income as net income plus purchase accounting backlog amortization expense, effects from the sale on businesses, non-cash compensation charges incurred in connection with TransDigm Group's stock incentive or deferred compensation plans, foreign currency gains and losses, acquisition-integration costs, acquisition and divestiture transaction-related expenses, and refinancing costs. EBITDA As Defined Margin represents EBITDA As Defined as a percentage of net sales. TransDigm Group defines adjusted diluted earnings per share as adjusted net income divided by the total outstanding shares for basic and diluted earnings per share. For more information regarding the computation of EBITDA, EBITDA As Defined and adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share, please see the attached financial tables.TransDigm Group presents these non-GAAP financial measures because it believes that they are useful indicators of its operating performance. TransDigm Group believes that EBITDA is useful to investors because it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties to measure operating performance among companies with different capital structures, effective tax rates and tax attributes, capitalized asset values and employee compensation structures, all of which can vary substantially from company to company. In addition, analysts, rating agencies and others use EBITDA to evaluate a company's ability to incur and service debt. EBITDA As Defined is used to measure TransDigm Inc.'s compliance with the financial covenant contained in its credit facility. TransDigm Group's management also uses EBITDA As Defined to review and assess its operating performance, to prepare its annual budget and financial projections and to review and evaluate its management team in connection with employee incentive programs. Moreover, TransDigm Group's management uses EBITDA As Defined to evaluate acquisitions and as a liquidity measure. In addition, TransDigm Group's management uses adjusted net income as a measure of comparable operating performance between time periods and among companies as it is reflective of changes in pricing decisions, cost controls and other factors that affect operating performance.None of EBITDA, EBITDA As Defined, EBITDA As Defined Margin, adjusted net income or adjusted earnings per share is a measurement of financial performance under U.S. GAAP and such financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income, earnings per share, cash flows from operating activities or other measures of performance determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, TransDigm Group's calculation of these non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to the calculation of similarly titled measures reported by other companies.Although we use EBITDA and EBITDA As Defined as measures to assess the performance of our business and for the other purposes set forth above, the use of these non-GAAP financial measures as analytical tools has limitations, and you should not consider any of them in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results of operations as reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations are:neither EBITDA nor EBITDA As Defined reflects the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements, necessary to service interest payments on our indebtedness;although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and neither EBITDA nor EBITDA As Defined reflects any cash requirements for such replacements;the omission of the substantial amortization expense associated with our intangible assets further limits the usefulness of EBITDA and EBITDA As Defined;neither EBITDA nor EBITDA As Defined includes the payment of taxes, which is a necessary element of our operations; andEBITDA As Defined excludes the cash expense we have incurred to integrate acquired businesses into our operations, which is a necessary element of certain of our acquisitions.Forward-Looking StatementsStatements in this press release that are not historical facts, including statements under the heading ""Fiscal 2023 Outlook,"" are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Not only can it impact your investment portfolio, but it can also help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.Another factor that can influence investors is FOMO, or the fear of missing out, especially with tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.What if you'd invested in TransDigm Group (TDG) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to TDG for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?TransDigm Group's Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at TransDigm Group's main business drivers.Incepted in 1993, TransDigm Group is a leading global designer, producer and supplier of highly engineered aerospace components that are used in commercial and military aircraft. The company, through its well-diversified business, offers a broad range of products to its customers. TransDigm currently has four reportable segments:The Airframe segment produces systems and components like engineered latching and locking devices, security components and systems, aircraft audio systems, specialized lavatory components, seat belts and safety restraints, engineered interior surfaces and related components, military personnel parachutes and cargo delivery systems. These are used in non-power airframe applications utilizing airframe and cabin structure technologies. It contributed 44.1% to the company's total sales in fiscal 2022.The Power &amp; Control segment develops products like mechanical/electro-mechanical actuators and controls, ignition systems and engine technology, specialized pumps and valves, power conditioning devices, specialized AC/DC electric motors and generators, and lifting devices and cargo loading and handling systems. These are used in controlling power of the aircraft utilizing electronic, fluid, power and mechanical motion control technologies. It contributed 52.9% to the company's total sales in fiscal 2022.Story continuesThe Non-aviation segment's products include seat belts and safety restraints for ground transportation applications, mechanical/electro-mechanical actuators and controls for space applications, and refueling systems for heavy equipment used in mining, construction and other industries. It contributed 3% to the company's total sales in fiscal 2022.Esterline Technologies became a reportable segment of TransDigm, post its acquisition in March 2019. Notably, Esterline includes a collection of approximately 20 reporting units that primarily develop, produce and market products for the aerospace and defense industry. Each Esterline reporting unit is included in one of TransDigm's segments.Bottom LineAnyone can invest, but building a successful investment portfolio requires research, patience, and a little bit of risk. So, if you had invested in TransDigm Group ten years ago, you're likely feeling pretty good about your investment today.A $1000 investment made in May 2013 would be worth $5,131.71, or a gain of 413.17%, as of May 8, 2023, according to our calculations. This return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 gained 156.21% and the price of gold went up 31.59% over the same time frame.Going forward, analysts are expecting more upside for TDG.TransDigm Group ended first-quarter fiscal 2023 on a solid note, with both earnings and revenues surpassing estimates. The company has been enjoying significant growth opportunities in the defense space, driven by the U.S. administration’s expansionary budgetary policy. TransDigm also boasts a solid solvency position, at least in the near term. In the past year, the company’s shares have outperformed the industry. However, rising fuel prices, affecting the airline industry, may continue to hurt its prospects. A comparative analysis of TransDigm’s12-month trailing P/E ratio reflects a gloomy picture. Moreover, the company expects that consistent supply chain issues, particularly in electronic components and casting, might reduce the production rate for its commercial OEM products in the short term.The stock is up 5.92% over the past four weeks, and no earnings estimate has gone lower in the past two months, compared to 3 higher, for fiscal 2023. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

(NYSE:HCA), one of the nation’s leading healthcare providers, today announced more than $300 million in investments to support the education and training of nurses. This includes more than $200 million towards the expansion of Galen College of Nursing and approximately $136 million towards the opening of new HCA Healthcare Centers for Clinical Advancement.""We believe supporting nurses in their practice through available and effective clinical education helps drive the delivery of high-quality patient care,"" said Sam Hazen, chief executive officer of HCA Healthcare. ""We are proud of the resources and education opportunities we offer our nurses and are committed to helping train the next generation.""Since 2019, HCA Healthcare has invested approximately $46 million to open twelve new Centers for Clinical Advancement, bringing its current footprint to fifteen locations nationwide. The company recently committed an additional $90 million to open twenty additional centers over the next three years. HCA Healthcare’s Centers for Clinical Advancement are designed to bridge the gap between the classroom and bedside through practice-based instruction. The centers use leading technology and specialized manikins to simulate real-life scenarios nurses may experience at the bedside.The Centers for Clinical Advancement operate independently from nursing schools and are dedicated to helping practicing nurses advance their skills and careers. New nursing graduates use the centers to complete their Nurse Residency program and choose specializations, while veteran nurses can use the centers to earn advanced certifications. As a part of the Nurse Residency program, new graduates complete classroom instruction and perform hands-on skills training utilizing high-fidelity immersive simulation within the centers. Technology within the centers also allows students to learn from clinical experts across the nation, if needed, and to record their simulations to play back scenarios and debrief with colleagues and trained facilitators to further advance their learning.Story continuesOn April 18, HCA Healthcare celebrated the openings of its fourteenth and fifteenth Center for Clinical Advancement in Ogden and Draper, Utah.

These are part of the company’s larger $10 million commitment to support Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs) and help build a diverse healthcare pipeline.The HCA Healthcare Foundation, through its Healthier Tomorrow Fund, recently announced $250,000 in grants to community colleges and universities to provide high school students early access to careers in healthcare. As part of these grants, Miami Dade College received $50,000 towards its Care Cadre Nurse Exploration Experience and Pensacola State College received $50,000 to help fund the Nurse Explorer Boot Camp.

It asserted that the bank had systematically discriminated against women in pay, performance evaluations, and promotion. The bank has denied those allegations. But going to trial, which was scheduled for next month following 13 years of litigation, would have meant a full public airing of the women’s claims, and exposed Goldman Sachs executives to potentially uncomfortable questions.Read moreA look back at BTS as it became the world's top-selling actYour anxiety brings 4 distinct superpowersAmericans may have seen the last of big rent hikes“Goldman Sachs is proud of its long record of promoting and advancing women and remains committed to ensuring a diverse and inclusive workplace for all our people,” said Jacqueline Arthur, head of human capital management at Goldman Sachs, in a May 8 press release.Who will benefit from Goldman’s gender payout?The payment will cover legal fees, and then be divided between a cohort of women working in certain positions at the bank over the last 21 years. It covers most women who worked as associates or vice presidents in the investment banking, investment management, or securities divisions of Goldman Sachs in New York between July 2002 and March 2023, or elsewhere in the US from September 2004. (Check here if you are covered.)The women named in the case—Cristina Chen-Oster, Shanna Orlich, Allison Gamba, and Mary De Luis—said that they were seeking to highlight systemic discrimination against women across the US banking sector. “It’s our duty and our right to shine a light,” Chen-Oster told Bloomberg back in 2018, at which point she had already been personally fighting Goldman for 13 years.Story continues“My goal in this case has always been to support strong women on Wall Street,” said co-plaintiff Allison Gamba in yesterday’s press release. “I am proud that the result we achieved here will advance gender equity.”More details would have emerged had the case come to trial. As it is, the bank can avoid explicitly commenting on whether the three main allegations it brought were true, namely:The case had also sought to include the claim that Goldman had a “boys’ club” culture that adversely affected women, Bloomberg reported, but the court ruled the claim to be unsuitable for a class action because it would require the individual investigation of particular incidents.As part of the settlement, the bank has agreed to bring in independent experts to review its pay, promotion, and evaluation practices, for the next three years.In the UK, where it is mandatory for companies with over 250 employees to disclose their gender pay gap, Goldman Sachs reported women in some divisions were paid about half as much as men. The disparity is in part due to female employees working in less senior roles, the bank said.More from QuartzThe world’s biggest banknote printer said the demand for cash hit a two-decade lowEvery fifth car sold worldwide this year will be electricSign up for Quartz's Newsletter.

For more top stocks, head on over to Goldman Sachs' Top 5 Stock Picks for 2023. After a vicious drubbing in 2022 that led to growth and technology stocks sometimes bleeding as much as half of their value on the stock market, 2023 appears to be off to a good start. Companies such as Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) are up by a whopping 94% year to date, giving some hope that perhaps, for the technology industry, the worst might be over.This sentiment is also encouraged by statements from the Federal Reserve. The Fed's extremely hawkish actions last year aimed at bringing down inflation saw it increase U.S. benchmark interest rates by a massive 5 percentage points, bringing it up from the 0.25% rate that had been set during the onset of the coronavirus pandemic when the bank had cut rates by 2.5% in March 2020. At the same time, the Fed's latest meeting which saw it increase rates by 25 basis points (0.25%) came with optimistic commentary from both the monetary policy committee and chairman Jerome Powell.Investment bank The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS), on the other hand, is taking a look at the impact of the Fed rate hikes on the general economic health. The bank's outlook for 2023 is cautiously upbeat as well if we go by its Economic Outlook Report. Goldman believes that it is possible to reduce inflation without pushing the economy into a recession, and subsequently, it has diverged from the consensus view which is certain that a recession is on the horizon. Au contraire, the investment bank outlines that if the GDP growth is carefully managed - by keeping growth close to 1% for reducing labor demand to bringing down wages for diminishing purchasing power - then a recession, typically defined as consecutive quarters of reduced economic growth, can be avoided.Naturally, this rather interesting balance of macroeconomic indicators also merits a look at what Goldman Sachs is recommending on the investment front, and which recommendations are performing well so far this year. Some of the companies that are covered in the article are Expedia Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE), Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), and Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD).Story continuesGoldman Sachs' Top 15 Stock Picks for 2023Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyWe used a list of Goldman Sachs' top stock picks for 2023 that were revealed earlier this year, and picked out those with the highest upside to price target.Goldman Sachs' Top 15 Stock Picks for 202315.

One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Aptiv The MethodWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$930.4mUS$1.45bUS$1.87bUS$2.61bUS$3.16bUS$3.58bUS$3.92bUS$4.21bUS$4.46bUS$4.67bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x10Analyst x10Analyst x6Analyst x3Analyst x3Est @ 12.97%Est @ 9.71%Est @ 7.43%Est @ 5.83%Est @ 4.72% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 12% US$830US$1.2kUS$1.3kUS$1.7kUS$1.8kUS$1.8kUS$1.8kUS$1.7kUS$1.6kUS$1.5k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$15bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 12%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$4.7b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (12%– 2.1%) = US$48bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$48b÷ ( 1 + 12%)10= US$15bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$31b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$93.4, the company appears about fair value at a 17% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Aptiv as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 12%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.386. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for AptivStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.WeaknessNo major weaknesses identified for APTV.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.Current share price is below our estimate of fair value.ThreatRevenue is forecast to grow slower than 20% per year.Next Steps:Although the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation.

Constant currency net sales(1) increased 13.0% and organic(2) net sales grew 6.4% compared to the prior year quarter.Consumer Self-Care Americas (""CSCA"") and Consumer Self-Care International (""CSCI"") segments delivered strong net sales growth of 7.6% and 14.7%, respectively, compared to the prior year quarter. CSCI achieved record net sales in the quarter, highlighted by constant currency net sales growth of 23.6% compared to the prior year quarter. First quarter GAAP (""reported"") gross margin was 35.0%, a 360 basis points improvement compared to the prior year quarter. Non-GAAP (""adjusted"") gross margin was 37.5%, a 400 basis points improvement compared to the prior year quarter.First quarter reported earnings per share (""EPS"") was a loss of $(0.01), compared to a loss of $(0.01) in the prior year quarter. Adjusted diluted EPS was $0.45, an increase of 35.6%, compared to $0.33 in the prior year quarter, an increase of 47.2% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted EPS was unfavorably impacted by $0.10 from two voluntary recalls in the CSCA business and $0.05 due to HRA Pharma (""HRA"") distributor transition sales returns as part of the integration plan to capture synergies.Materially reduced Company uncertainty: 1) completely resolved the $843 million IRS Notice of Proposed Adjustment (""NOPA"") previously issued, with no payment required, and the case is now closed, and 2) settled the IRS interest rate NOPA previously issued and the matter is now closed.Reaffirms fiscal 2023 organic net sales and total net sales growth outlook range of 3.0%-6.0% and 7.0%-11.0%, respectively, versus the prior year, and adjusted diluted EPS range outlook of $2.50-$2.70.(1)See attached Appendix for details.

Cash conversion ratio defined as cash from operating activities as a percentage of adjusted net income.Perrigo Company plc (NYSE: PRGO) (""Perrigo"" or the ""Company""), a leading provider of Consumer Self-Care Products, today announced financial results from continuing operations for the first quarter ended April 1, 2023. All comparisons are against the prior year fiscal first quarter, unless otherwise noted.Story continuesPresident and CEO, Murray S. Kessler commented, ""Perrigo's first quarter results were tremendous. The Company once again delivered double-digit top line growth, and 36% adjusted EPS growth. Importantly, adjusted gross margin expanded by 400 basis points driven nearly equally by the Perrigo base business and benefits from recent acquisitions. Consumer demand was strong across our global portfolio, and, except in categories where we are capacity constrained, Perrigo gained market share globally.""Kessler continued, ""During the quarter we also made meaningful progress against our strategic initiatives. In our Supply Chain Reinvention Program, we have completed pilot programs of the enhanced Perrigo work system, which is already delivering increased productivity. This work system is now being rolled out across our global manufacturing footprint. Additionally, integrations of HRA, the Gateway facility and the Good Start® brands are on track, and HRA synergies are slightly ahead of initial expectations. And finally, we further reduced uncertainty as the IRS has completely resolved its $843 million tax assessment with the Company, without any payment required, and also closed the matter related to the interest rate NOPA previously issued.""Kessler concluded, ""With the Company's strategy taking hold and tax uncertainty virtually eliminated, our go forward focus must be on the exceptional execution of our supply chain reinvention initiative, the integration of our recent acquisitions and the reduction of leverage back down to under three times. We do that well and the Company will create meaningful value for its stakeholders for years to come. That's why after 18 years as a public company CEO, I have decided this is the right time for me to hand the reins of Perrigo to the next generation leader who can relentlessly and passionately drive execution of our Optimization and Acceleration strategy. I truly believe that Perrigo is set up for a bright future and will create tremendous value for investors.""Refer to Tables I through VI at the end of this press release for a reconciliation of non-GAAP adjustments to the current year and prior year periods and additional non-GAAP information.

Reported net sales growth was driven by 1) $57 million in strategic pricing actions, 2) constant currency net sales from the acquisition of HRA of $56 million, including an unfavorable impact of $12 million due to HRA distributor transition sales returns as part of the integration plan to capture synergies, 3)  the acquisition of the Gateway infant formula facility and U.S. &amp; Canadian Good Start® infant formula brand (""Gateway"") of $36 million, which was unfavorably impacted by $9 million due to a voluntary recall, and 4) favorable volume/mix across both Consumer Self-Care segments. Both segments also benefitted from eCommerce growth and new product sales.Reported net sales growth was partially offset by 1) the impact from unfavorable currency translation inclusive of acquisitions of $33 million, 2) $31 million in lower net sales volumes in the legacy CSCA Nutrition business due to a major national brand infant formula recall in the prior year, 3) $19 million related to the March 2022 divestitures of the Latin American businesses and ScarAway® brand asset, and 4) a $9 million impact from a voluntary OTC product recall in the CSCA business.Reported gross margin was 35.0%, a 360 basis points increase versus the prior year quarter. Adjusted gross margin expanded 400 basis points to 37.5% as benefits from higher margin acquisitions, strategic pricing actions and favorable volume/mix more than offset unfavorable impacts from inflation, the infant formula and OTC product voluntary recalls and an unfavorable impact from currency translation.First quarter reported operating income was $49 million compared to $22 million in the prior year period. Adjusted operating income grew $33 million, or 37.8%, to $120 million. Constant currency adjusted operating income increased 46.4% driven by strategic pricing actions, favorable volume/mix and the additions of HRA and Gateway. These increases were partially offset by 1) higher operating expenses, driven primarily by the addition of HRA and Gateway, 2) an unfavorable impact from cost of goods inflation, 3) a $17 million impact from the infant formula and OTC voluntary product recalls, 4) $9 million due to HRA distributor transition sales returns, and 5) divested businesses.Reported net loss was $1 million, or ($0.01) per diluted share, compared to reported net loss of $1 million, or ($0.01) per diluted share, in the prior year period. Excluding certain charges as outlined in Table I, first quarter 2023 adjusted net income was $61 million, or $0.45 per diluted share, compared to $45 million, or $0.33 per diluted share, in the prior year.

This growth was partially offset by 1) lower net sales in the legacy Nutrition business due to a major national brand infant formula recall in the prior year, 2) the March 2022 divestitures of the Latin American businesses and ScarAway® brand asset, and 3) an unfavorable 1.3 percentage points impact from an OTC product voluntary recall. Primary category drivers are provided below.Upper RespiratoryNet sales of $154 million increased 1.0% due primarily to the launch of Nasonex®24HR and higher net sales of allergy products. This growth was partially offset by 1) the divested Latin American businesses, impacting growth by an unfavorable 1.8 percentage points, 2) a voluntary OTC product recall, and 3) prolonged and elevated incidence of cough/cold and flu over the past year, which led to lower inventory levels and the inability to meet current consumer demand for liquid cough/cold products.NutritionNet sales of $140 million increased 10.0% due primarily to the Gateway acquisition, despite an unfavorable impact due to a voluntary recall, and strong growth in the contract infant formula business. This growth was partially offset by lower net sales in the legacy Nutrition business due to a major national brand infant formula recall in the prior year.Digestive HealthNet sales of $124 million increased 4.7% due primarily to increased manufacturing capacity and demand for Polyethylene Glycol 3350, solid growth in the antacids business and new products, including Omeprazole Cool Mint, Omeprazole Mini Capsules and Polyethylene Glycol 3350 Orange. Growth in this category was partially offset by an unfavorable 1.8 percentage points from the divested Latin American businesses.Pain &amp; Sleep-AidsNet sales of $104 million increased 0.6% due primarily to strong demand for children's analgesics products resulting from a relatively stronger cough/cold and flu season, partially offset by an unfavorable 5.2 percentage points from the divested Latin American businesses.Oral CareNet sales of $84 million increased 19.9% due primarily to the normalization of supply chain disruptions that impacted net sales in the prior year and strong consumer demand for oral care products, including both store brand offerings and brands such as Plackers®, Firefly® and REACH®.Healthy LifestyleNet sales of $73 million increased 8.6% due primarily to increased distribution of store brand smoking cessation products.Skin CareNet sales of $52 million increased 27.9% due primarily to the addition of HRA brands, including Mederma® and Compeed®, and higher net sales of minoxidil-based products stemming from increased manufacturing capacity. This growth was partially offset by an unfavorable impact of 6.1 percentage points from the divested Latin American businesses and ScarAway® brand asset.Women's HealthNet sales of $12 million increased 45.1% due primarily to the addition of HRA brands, including ella®. Vitamins, Minerals, and Supplements (""VMS"") and OtherNet sales of $20 million decreased 7.5% due primarily to the unfavorable impact of 29.0  percentage points from the divested Latin American businesses.Reported gross margin was 27.6%, a 330 basis points increase versus the prior year quarter.

Adjusted operating income increased $12 million, or 13.6%, to $99 million due primarily to strategic pricing actions, favorable volume/mix, new products and the additions of HRA and Gateway. This growth was partially offset by 1) higher operating expenses, driven primarily by the addition of Gateway, 2) an unfavorable impact from cost of goods inflation, 3) a $17 million impact from the infant formula and OTC voluntary product recalls, and 4) divested businesses.Consumer Self-Care International SegmentFirst Quarter 2023 Net Sales Change Compared to Prior YearReported Net Sales Growth Foreign Exchange AdjustmentConstant Currency Net SalesNet Acquisitions &amp; Divestitures AdjustmentOrganic Net Sales GrowthCSCI14.7 %8.9 %23.6 %(12.6) %11.0 %CSCI reported net sales increased 14.7%, constant currency net sales increased 23.6% and organic net sales increased 11.0%.

This growth was partially offset by an unfavorable impact from currency translation of 8.9 percentage points. Primary category drivers are provided below.Skin CareNet sales of $83 million increased 12.9%, or an increase of 26.1% excluding the impact of currency, driven primarily by the addition of HRA brands, including Compeed®. This growth was partially offset by the reclassification of anti-parasite offerings from the Skin Care category to the Healthy Lifestyle category.Upper RespiratoryNet sales of $85 million increased 27.5%, or 35.9% excluding the impact of currency, due primarily to strong demand for cough/cold products, including Bronchostop and Coldrex, stemming from a relatively stronger cough/cold and flu season. Net sales of the U.K. allergy brand Beconase were also higher compared to the prior year period.Healthy LifestyleNet sales of $66 million increased 12.7%, or 17.3% excluding the impact of currency, due primarily to the reclassification of anti-parasite offerings from the Skin Care category to the Healthy Lifestyle category and higher net sales of anti-parasite offerings that continue to outpace strong category growth, partially offset by lower category consumption in weight management, impacting XLS Medical.VMSNet sales of $48 million decreased 3.4%, or an increase of 1.4% excluding the impact of currency, due primarily to improved sales of Davitamon in Benelux stemming from higher promotions in addition to higher net sales of Abtei in Germany.Pain &amp; Sleep-Aids Net sales of $50 million decreased 7.6%, or an increase of 0.2% excluding the impact of currency, due primarily to higher demand for Solpadeine, an analgesics product, which was partially offset by lower sales of Nytol due to timing of shipments to customers.Women's HealthNet sales of $29 million increased 112.4%, or 125.5% excluding the impact of currency, due primarily to the addition of HRA brands, including ellaOne® and NorLevo®.Oral Care Net sales of $29 million increased 0.7%, or 6.9% excluding the impact of currency, due primarily to new products and market share gains.Digestive Health and OtherNet sales of $28 million increased 44.5%, or 64.9% excluding the impact of currency, due primarily to the addition of the HRA Rare Diseases portfolio in the Other category.Reported gross margin was 48.6%, a 330 basis point increase compared to the prior year quarter. Adjusted gross margin expanded 470 basis points versus the prior year quarter to 54.6% due primarily to the higher margin HRA acquisition, strategic pricing actions and higher margin new products.Reported operating income was $21 million for the quarter compared to $16 million in the prior year. Adjusted operating income increased $18 million, or 33.1%, to $70 million. Constant currency adjusted operating income grew 47.2%, due primarily to strategic pricing actions, favorable volume/mix including new products, and the addition of HRA. This growth was partially offset by higher operating expenses, primarily driven by the inclusion of HRA, higher selling and employee expenses, and HRA distributor transition sales returns.Resolution of IRS NOPAsAthena NOPAOn April 24, 2023, Perrigo received a letter from the U.S. Department of Treasury, Internal Revenue Service (""IRS""), regarding the competent authority request filed by Athena Neurosciences LLC (""Athena"").  This request was made with respect to adjustments initiated by the IRS affecting Athena and Athena's Irish Parent Elan Corporation plc for the Athena's tax years ending December 31, 2011, through December 31, 2013. The letter advised that as a result of the Advance Pricing and Mutual Agreement program's review of this case, the U.S. Competent Authority has agreed to fully withdraw the adjustments in full and considers the case closed.  Accordingly, no payment is required by Perrigo with respect to the IRS NOPA previously issued to Athena in the amount of $843.0 million for these tax years. For further details, please review the Company's 8-K filed on April 25, 2023 and the Company's first quarter 2023 10-Q filing, which is expected to be filed later today.Interest Rate NOPAThe interest rate NOPA stemmed from Perrigo U.S.'s deductible interest expense on certain intercompany debts owed by it to Perrigo Company plc. The debts were incurred in connection with the Elan merger transaction in 2013. On May 7, 2020, the IRS issued a NOPA capping the interest rate on the debts for U.S. federal tax purposes on the stated ground that the loans were not negotiated on an arms-length basis. An IRS Appeals conference was held during March 7 through March 9, 2023. On May 5, 2023, we finalized an agreement with IRS Appeals providing for settlement of the NOPA. For further details, please review the Company's first quarter 2023 10-Q filing, which is expected to be filed later today.Fiscal 2023 OutlookThe Company reaffirms its fiscal year 2023 guidance:Reported net sales growth of 7.0% to 11.0% compared to the prior year,Organic net sales growth of 3.0% to 6.0% compared to the previous year,Non-GAAP (""adjusted"") diluted EPS range of between $2.50 to $2.70,Adjusted tax expense rate of approximately 21.5%,Interest expense of approximately $180 million, andCash conversion (operating cash flow as a percentage of adjusted net income) of approximately 100%.The Company cannot reconcile its expected adjusted diluted earnings per share to diluted earnings per share under ""Fiscal 2023 Outlook"" without unreasonable effort because certain items that impact net income and other reconciling metrics are out of the Company's control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted at this time.About PerrigoPerrigo Company plc (NYSE: PRGO) is a leading provider of Consumer Self-Care Products and over-the-counter (OTC) health and wellness solutions that enhance individual well-being by empowering consumers to proactively prevent or treat conditions that can be self-managed.

These statements relate to future events or the Company's future financial performance and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements of the Company or its industry to be materially different from those expressed or implied by any forward-looking statements. In some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by terminology such as ""may,"" ""will,"" ""could,"" ""would,"" ""should,"" ""expect,"" ""forecast,"" ""plan,"" ""anticipate,"" ""intend,"" ""believe,"" ""estimate,"" ""predict,"" ""potential"" or the negative of those terms or other comparable terminology. The Company has based these forward-looking statements on its current expectations, assumptions, estimates and projections. While the Company believes these expectations, assumptions, estimates and projections are reasonable, such forward-looking statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the Company's control, including: supply chain impacts on the Company's business, including those caused or exacerbated by armed conflict, trade and other economic sanctions and/or disease; general economic, credit, and market conditions; the impact of the war in Ukraine and any escalation thereof, including the effects of economic and political sanctions imposed by the United States, United Kingdom, European Union, and other countries related thereto; the outbreak or escalation of conflict in other regions where we do business; future impairment charges, if we determine that the carrying amount of specific assets may not be recoverable from the expected future cash flows of such assets; customer acceptance of new products; competition from other industry participants, some of whom have greater marketing resources or larger market shares in certain product categories than the Company does; pricing pressures from customers and consumers; resolution of uncertain tax positions and any litigation relating thereto, ongoing or future government investigations and regulatory initiatives; uncertainty regarding the timing of, and the Company's ability to obtain and maintain, certain regulatory approvals, including the sale of daily over-the-counter oral contraceptives; potential costs and reputational impact of product recalls or sales halts; potential adverse changes to U.S. and foreign tax, healthcare and other government policy; the effect of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and its variants; the timing, amount and cost of any share repurchases (or the absence thereof); fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates; the Company's ability to achieve the benefits expected from the sale of its Rx business and the risk that potential costs or liabilities incurred or retained in connection with that transaction may exceed the Company's estimates or adversely affect the Company's business or operations; the Company's ability to achieve the benefits expected from the acquisitions of Héra SAS (""HRA Pharma"") and Nestlé's Gateway infant formula plant along with the U.S. and Canadian rights to the GoodStart® infant formula brand and other related formula brands (""Gateway"") and/or the risks that the Company's synergy estimates are inaccurate or that the Company faces higher than anticipated integration or other costs in connection with the acquisitions; risks associated with the integration of HRA Pharma and Gateway, including the risk that growth rates are adversely affected by any delay in the integration of sales and distribution networks; the consummation and success of other announced and unannounced acquisitions or dispositions, and the Company's ability to realize the desired benefits thereof; and the Company's ability to execute and achieve the desired benefits of announced cost-reduction efforts and other strategic initiatives and investments, including the Company's ability to achieve the expected benefits from its Supply Chain Reinvention Program.  Adverse results with respect to pending litigation could have a material adverse impact on the Company's operating results, cash flows and liquidity, and could ultimately require the use of corporate assets to pay damages, reducing assets that would otherwise be available for other corporate purposes. There can be no assurance that the FDA will approve the sale of daily oral contraceptives without a prescription in the United States. These and other important factors, including those discussed under ""Risk Factors"" in the Company's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, as well as the Company's subsequent filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, may cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements in this press release are made only as of the date hereof, and unless otherwise required by applicable securities laws, the Company disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.Non-GAAP MeasuresThis press release contains certain non-GAAP measures. A ""non-GAAP financial measure"" is defined as a numerical measure of a company's financial performance that excludes or includes amounts different from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) in the statements of operations, balance sheets or statements of cash flows of the Company. Pursuant to the requirements of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the Company has provided reconciliations to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures for the following non-GAAP financial measures referred to in this press release:net sales growth on an organic basis, which excludes acquisitions, divested businesses, and the impact of currency,adjusted gross profit,adjusted net income,adjusted operating income,adjusted diluted earnings per share,constant currency net sales growth, adjusted operating income and adjusted diluted earnings per share,adjusted gross margin, andadjusted operating margin.These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as supplements to the GAAP reported measures, should not be considered replacements for, or superior to the GAAP measures and may not be comparable to similarly named measures used by other companies.The Company provides non-GAAP financial measures as additional information that it believes is useful to investors and analysts in evaluating the performance of the Company's ongoing operating trends, facilitating comparability between periods and, where applicable, with companies in similar industries and assessing the Company's prospects for future performance. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude items, such as impairment charges, restructuring charges, and acquisition and integration-related charges, that by their nature affect comparability of operational performance or that we believe obscure underlying business operational trends. The intangible asset amortization excluded from these non-GAAP financial measure represents the entire amount recorded within the Company's GAAP financial statements and is excluded because the amortization, unlike the related revenue, is not affected by operations of any particular period unless an intangible asset becomes impaired or the estimated useful life of an intangible asset is revised. The revenue generated by the associated intangible assets has not been excluded from the related non-GAAP financial measure. The non-GAAP measures the Company provides are consistent with how management analyzes and assesses the operating performance of the Company, and disclosing them provides investor insight into management's view of the business. Management uses these adjusted financial measures for planning and forecasting in future periods, and evaluating segment and overall operating performance. In addition, management uses certain of the profit measures as factors in determining compensation.Non-GAAP measures related to profit measurements, which include adjusted gross profit, adjusted net income, adjusted diluted EPS, constant currency adjusted diluted EPS, constant currency adjusted operating income, adjusted gross margin and adjusted operating margin are useful to investors as they provide them with supplemental information to enhance their understanding of the Company's underlying business performance and trends, and enhance the ability of investors and analysts to compare the Company's period-to-period financial results. Management believes that adjusted gross margin and adjusted operating margin are useful to investors, in addition to the reasons discussed above, by allowing them to more easily compare and analyze trends in the Company's peer business group and assisting them in comparing the Company's overall performance to that of its competitors. The Company also discloses net sales growth excluding the impact of currency on an organic basis. The Company believes these supplemental financial measures provide investors with consistency in financial reporting, enabling meaningful comparisons of past and present underlying operating results, and also facilitate analysis of the Company's operating performance and acquisition and divestiture trends.A copy of this press release, including the reconciliations, is available on the Company's website at www.perrigo.com.PERRIGO COMPANY PLCCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS(in millions, except per share amounts)(unaudited)Three Months EndedApril 1,2023April 2,2022Net sales$             1,181.7$             1,074.5Cost of sales767.9736.7Gross profit413.8337.8Operating expensesDistribution28.624.4Research and development31.129.3Selling167.9135.6Administration135.0122.3Restructuring3.43.6Other operating (income) expense, net(0.7)0.9Total operating expenses365.3316.1Operating income48.521.7Interest expense, net43.735.8Other expense (income), net0.5(1.1)Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes4.3(13.0)Income tax expense (benefit)5.4(11.7)Income (loss) from continuing operations(1.1)(1.3)Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax(1.9)(1.1)Net income (loss)$                   (3.0)$                   (2.4)Earnings (loss) per shareBasicContinuing operations$                (0.01)$                (0.01)Discontinued operations(0.01)(0.01)Basic earnings (loss) per share$                (0.02)$                (0.02)DilutedContinuing operations$                (0.01)$                (0.01)Discontinued operations(0.01)(0.01)Diluted earnings (loss) per share$                (0.02)$                (0.02)Weighted-average shares outstandingBasic134.9134.0Diluted134.9134.0 PERRIGO COMPANY PLCCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS(in millions, except per share amounts)(unaudited)April 1,2023December 31,2022AssetsCash and cash equivalents$               553.0$                600.7Accounts receivable, net of allowance for credit losses of $7.1 and $6.8, respectively738.7697.1Inventories1,183.01,150.3Prepaid expenses and other current assets266.0271.8Total current assets2,740.72,719.9Property, plant and equipment, net919.3926.3Operating lease assets211.7217.1Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets3,650.43,549.0Definite-lived intangible assets, net3,083.93,230.2Deferred income taxes6.17.1Other non-current assets342.8367.7Total non-current assets8,214.28,297.4Total assets$          10,954.9$          11,017.3Liabilities and Shareholders' EquityAccounts payable$               505.2$                537.3Payroll and related taxes106.5136.4Accrued customer programs146.7139.1Other accrued liabilities272.0250.2Accrued income taxes17.614.4Current indebtedness38.836.2Total current liabilities1,086.81,113.6Long-term debt, less current portion4,062.84,070.4Deferred income taxes333.8368.2Other non-current liabilities637.6623.0Total non-current liabilities5,034.25,061.6Total liabilities6,121.06,175.2Contingencies -

Mr. Kessler will be working with the Board of Directors to secure his successor and to ensure a smooth transition.Perrigo Company. (PRNewsfoto/Perrigo Company plc)Murray S. Kessler said, ""After 18 years as a public company CEO, I have decided that this is the right time for me to retire. I joined Perrigo almost 5 years ago to lead the transformation of the Company from a healthcare to a consumer self-care company. Leading that transformation has been one of the most exciting assignments of my career. From fourteen M&amp;A transactions to reconfiguring the Company's portfolio, the near complete elimination of a $4 billion tax and legal overhang, to the strategic path put in place to create value for the future, I am proud of what my team, with the Board's support, has accomplished. The fact that this all happened in the face of an incredibly difficult macro-economic environment makes the transformation that much sweeter.""Kessler continued, ""All of the pieces are now in place. Perrigo is growing its top line, its margins and its bottom line. It has a strong plan in place to reduce leverage, it has amazingly talented employees and it has a clear plan to deliver strong growth going forward. This is exactly the right time to hand over the reins of Perrigo to the next leader who can relentlessly drive the execution of our strategic plan for years to come. I truly believe that Perrigo is set up for a bright future and to create tremendous value for investors.""Chairman of the Board, Orlando D. Ashford, said ""On behalf of the Board and the nearly 10,000 Perrigo employees around the world, I would like to thank Murray for his vision and dedication during his tenure as CEO. As a steadfast and strategic leader, Murray orchestrated the transformation of the Company into the diversified consumer self-care organization it is today. In addition, Murray has driven the Company's inorganic growth strategy, including transformative acquisitions and divestitures as well as dramatically reducing uncertainty for the company. The Board is sincerely grateful to Murray for his dedication to Perrigo and wishes him the best in his retirement.""Story continuesAshford continued, ""As part of our governance process, the Board has regularly been engaged in CEO succession planning. We are working with a global executive search firm and are confident that we will identify a world-class CEO who will execute on our Optimize and Accelerate strategic plan and further drive our long-term success.""About PerrigoPerrigo Company plc (NYSE: PRGO) is a leading provider of Consumer Self-Care Products and over-the-counter (OTC) health and wellness solutions that enhance individual well-being by empowering consumers to proactively prevent or treat conditions that can be self-managed.

Yet, the business environment continues to be challenging. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Over the past year, Abbott has been outperforming the industry it belongs to. The stock has lost 0.8% compared with the industry’s 28.1% fall.Abbott exited the first quarter of 2023 with better-than-expected earnings and revenues. Organic sales growth excluding COVID testing increased 10%, led by double-digit growth in Medical Devices, Established Pharmaceuticals and Nutrition. Within EPD, sales increased 11% in the quarter led by strong performance in Brazil, China, and Southeast Asia and across several therapeutic areas, including cardiometabolic, gastroenterology, CNS and pain management. EPD successfully continued its double-digit sales growth momentum in the last two years.Within Nutrition, sales increased more than 10%. In the United States, pediatric nutrition growth of more than 35% was driven by favorable year-ago comparable (lower sales in the first quarter of 2022 were due to a voluntary recall of certain infant formula products). Abbott continued to make good progress, increasing manufacturing production and recovering market share in this business. Internationally, total nutrition sales grew in mid-single digits overall. Sales in global adult nutrition also grew mid-single digits, driven by the strong performance of the company’s market-leading Ensure brand.Within Diagnostics, excluding COVID testing, organic sales growth was led by mid-to-high single-digit growth in Core Lab, Rapid and Point of Care Diagnostics. Despite dull sales in China, Core Lab Diagnostics sales showed year-over-year improvement, led by strong performance in the United States and Europe.Within Medical Devices, sales grew 12.5% globally on an organic basis, including mid-teens growth in the United States and double-digit growth internationally. In Diabetes Care, sales of FreeStyle Libre grew more than 25% on an organic basis in the quarter, including approximately 50% growth in the United States and mid-teens growth internationally.Abbott currently forecasts total organic sales growth, excluding the impact of COVID testing-related sales to be in the high-single digits for 2023.Story continuesAbbott Laboratories PriceAbbott Laboratories PriceAbbott Laboratories price | Abbott Laboratories QuoteAbbott’s first-quarter worldwide sales were down 18.1% year over year on a reported basis. Total sales were negatively impacted by COVID-19 testing-related sales decline. In Diagnostics, as forecast, sales growth was negatively impacted by a significant decrease in COVID testing sales compared with the first quarter of 2022. Worldwide COVID-19 testing sales were $730 million in the first quarter compared with $3.3 billion in the year-ago period. Further, in Core Lab Diagnostics, growth was partially offset by soft market conditions in China.Challenging macroeconomic environment, adverse currency translation and stubborn inflationary situation severely impacted the company’s profitability in the first quarter. The ongoing inflation situation across the globe is adversely impacting input costs for Abbott.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Zimmer Biomet ZBH, Hologic, Inc. HOLX and Insulet PODD.Zimmer Biomet, carrying a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present, has an earnings yield of 5.35% compared to the industry’s -2.55%.

So far, the feared “earnings apocalypse” has failed to materialize, helping keep sentiment somewhat in check.And soon, we’ll hear from the media and entertainment titan Walt Disney Company DIS. Disney has assets that span movies, television shows, and theme parks.It raises a valid question: how does the company shape up heading into its earnings release? We can use streaming results from Netflix NFLX as a small read-through. Let’s take a closer look.Netflix Streaming titan Netflix posted mixed top and bottom line results, exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by 2% but delivering revenue just marginally under expectations. Below is a chart illustrating the company’s revenue on a quarterly basis.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn addition, Netflix reported Net Subscriber Additions of roughly 1.8 million, representing a massive improvement from the year-ago quarter when the streaming titan lost 200k subscribers.Following the release, the market didn’t react well, as we can see illustrated by the green arrow circled in the chart below.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchDisneyAnalysts haven’t been bullish for Disney’s quarter to be reported, with the $0.88 per share earnings estimate being revised 10% lower since February. The quarterly earnings estimate implies an 18% pullback within earnings year-over-year.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn addition, our quarterly revenue estimate presently sits a $21.7 billion, implying a 13% climb from the year-ago quarter. Since February, the revenue estimate is down a marginal 0.7%, as we can see in the chart below.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchInvestors will closely monitor Disney+ results, similar to what we saw in NFLX's release. For the quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Disney+ subscribers stands at 166 million, implying growth of 20% year-over-year.Story continuesDisney has consistently surprised positively on this metric, chaining together five consecutive quarters of exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchRegarding valuation, Disney’s 2.1X forward price-to-sales ratio sits below the five-year median and highs of 3.4X in 2022, with the company carrying a Style Score of “C” for Value.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineWhile this week may not be as hectic as others regarding earnings releases, we still have several notable quarterly reports scheduled to come, including one from the Walt Disney Company DIS.Analysts haven’t been bullish regarding Disney’s earnings outlook, with the current quarterly EPS Estimate seeing negative revisions since February. On the flip side, the company’s revenue picture remains relatively stable, down marginally over the last few months.Heading into the release, Disney is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) with an Earnings ESP Score of -5.8%.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

MUSA announced first-quarter 2023 earnings per share of $4.80, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.06. The outperformance could be attributed to higher volumes and retail fuel contribution.However, MUSA’s bottom line was significantly below the year-earlier quarter’s adjusted profit of $6.08 per share, dragged down by a fall in the retail gasoline price.Meanwhile, Murphy USA’s operating revenues of $5.1 billion edged down 0.8% year over year but breezed past the consensus mark by $118 million, primarily due to improved merchandise sales.Merchandise sales, at $966.2 million, rose 8.3% year over year and outperformed the consensus mark of $887 million. However, revenues from petroleum product sales came in at $4 billion, falling 3.4% short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate and declining 3.7% from the first quarter of 2022.Murphy USA Inc.

Quote Key TakeawaysMUSA’s total fuel contribution fell 10.8% year over year to $329.9 million due to margin contraction. On a bearish note, total fuel contribution (including retail fuel margin plus product supply and wholesale results) came in at 28.9 cents per gallon, which dropped 15% from the first quarter of 2022.Retail fuel contribution increased 4.4% year over year to $264.7 million even as margins, at 23.2 cents per gallon, remained essentially unchanged from the corresponding period of 2022. Retail gallons rose 4.9% from the year-ago period to 1,141.8 million in the quarter under review but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 1,147 million. Volumes on an SSS basis (or fuel gallons per store) improved 2.2% from the first quarter of 2022 to 227.8 thousand. Meanwhile, the average retail gasoline price during the quarter came in at $3.15 per gallon, down from $3.43 per gallon a year ago.Contribution from Merchandise increased 6.5% to $187.1 million on higher sales, which more than offset the fall in unit margins, from 19.7% a year ago to 19.4% in the first quarter of 2023. On an SSS basis, total merchandise contribution was up 5% year over year, primarily on the back of 5.6% higher non-tobacco margins. Meanwhile, merchandise sales increased 6% on an SSS basis due to an increase in tobacco as well as non-tobacco sales.The Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company’s monthly fuel gallons were up 2.4% from the prior-year period, while merchandise sales increased 6% on an average per store month basis.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Story continuesBalance SheetAs of Dec 31, Murphy USA — which opened eight new retail locations in the quarter to take its store count to 1,720 — had cash and cash equivalents of $102.1 million and long-term debt (including lease obligations) of $1.8 billion, with a debt-to-capitalization of 71.4%.During the quarter, MUSA bought back shares worth $13.7 million.Some Key Refining EarningsWhile we have discussed MUSA’s fourth-quarter results in detail, let’s see how some other refining companies have fared this earnings season.Phillips 66 PSX reported adjusted earnings per share of $4.21, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.58. Moreover, the bottom line improved significantly from a profit of $1.32 per share in the year-ago quarter.PSX’s worldwide margins almost doubled to $20.72 per barrel from the year-ago quarter’s $10.83. The same in the Central Corridor and Atlantic Basin/Europe increased to $26.86 and $16.13 per barrel from the year-ago levels of $7.89 and $11.71, respectively. In the Gulf Coast, the metric registered an improvement to $21.28 per barrel from $8.59 in the prior-year quarter. However, the West Coast witnessed a decline in margins from $17.74 per barrel in the year-ago quarter to $16.53 in the March-end quarter of 2023.Another refining giant, Valero Energy VLO, also reported strong first-quarter earnings. The bottom line of $8.27 per share came in well above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.24. The outperformance reflects increased refinery throughput volumes and a higher refining margin. In particular, adjusted operating income in the Refining unit amounted to $4.1 billion, surging from $1.5 billion in the year-ago quarter.At the end of the first quarter, VLO had cash and cash equivalents of $5.5 billion, while the company’s total debt and finance lease obligations amounted to $11.4 billion. Valero’s first-quarter capital investment was $524 million.

Treatment with Prolia was also associated with greater reductions in fracture risk over time. The data were presented during an oral presentation at the World Congress on Osteoporosis, Osteoarthritis and Musculoskeletal Diseases (WCO-IOF-ESCEO), in Barcelona, May 4-7, 2023.To view the Multimedia News Release, please visit: https://www.multivu.com/players/English/9094351-new-data-amgen-prolia-denosumab/""Amgen has long been committed to reducing the impact of osteoporosis, an underdiagnosed and undertreated disease that increases the risk for bone loss and fracture for millions of post-menopausal women,"" said Jyothis George, vice president and global medical therapeutic area head, General Medicine, at Amgen. ""May is Osteoporosis Awareness and Prevention Month, making this a great time to share these new data about Prolia and the important role it can play in reducing the risk of potentially life-altering fractures in these women at high risk for fracture.""The retrospective, observational study assessed U.S. Medicare beneficiary data on 478,651 postmenopausal women aged 66 or older with no history of prior osteoporosis treatment who initiated Prolia (n=89,115) or oral alendronate (n=389,536) treatment between Jan. 1, 2012 and Dec. 31, 2018. The study's results showed that Prolia reduced the relative risk of fracture across various fracture types. At the end of follow-up, the overall relative risks were:Story continuesA 36% reduced risk of hip fractures (RR=0.64; 95% CI: 0.39-0.90)A 43% reduced risk of nonvertebral fractures, including fractures to the hip, humerus, pelvis, radus/ulna and other femur (RR=0.57; 95% CI: 0.42-0.71)A 30% reduced risk of hospitalized vertebral fractures, (RR=0.70; 95% CI: 0.40-1.01) which was not statistically significantA 39% reduced risk of major osteoporotic; nonvertebral and hospitalized vertebral fractures (Relative Risk [RR]=0.61; 95% CI: 0.48-0.74)A 50% reduced risk of non-hip, nonvertebral fractures (RR=0.50; 95% CI: 0.35-0.64)In addition, longer duration of treatment with Prolia was associated with a greater reduction in major osteoporotic (MOP) fracture risk. Prolia reduced risk of MOP fracture by: 9% at year 1 (RR=0.91; 95% CI: 0.85-0.97); 12% at year 2 (RR=0.88; 95% CI: 0.83-0.93); 18% at year 3 (RR=0.82; 95% CI: 0.77-0.87); and 31% at year 5 (RR=0.69; 95% CI: 0.62-0.76); and 39% overall (RR=0.61; 95% CI: 0.48-0.74). Patients were evaluated from treatment initiation to first instance of a fracture outcome, treatment discontinuation or switch, disenrollment from Medicare, or death.""Although comparative trials between Prolia and bisphosphonates showed superior bone mineral density increases with Prolia at key skeletal sites, direct comparative studies with fracture as an endpoint are lacking. These findings from nearly half a million patients provide evidence that Prolia is associated with greater fracture risk reduction than with alendronate,"" said Jeff Curtis, MD, MS, MPH, professor of medicine in the Division of Clinical Immunology and Rheumatology at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. ""This comparative effectiveness research employs rigorous methodology that provides important insights that are relevant to the care of women living with osteoporosis.""Prolia is the first approved therapy that specifically targets RANK Ligand, an essential regulator of bone-removing cells (osteoclasts). Prolia is approved and marketed in over 80 countries worldwide. These findings provide important insights into the effectiveness of Prolia versus oral alendronate on osteoporotic fracture outcomes in post-menopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture using real-world data.About Osteoporosis-Related FracturesWorldwide, one in three women, over the age of 50, will suffer a fragility fracture due to osteoporosis and with an aging population these numbers will rise.1 Yet despite this, there is a large gap in the management and treatment of osteoporosis, especially in the post-fracture setting, with an estimated four out of five patients remaining undiagnosed and untreated after a fracture.2 Without proper care or access to effective intervention options, they remain at risk of painful and disabling fractures in the future.About Prolia® (denosumab)Prolia is the first approved therapy that specifically targets RANK Ligand, an essential regulator of bone-removing cells (osteoclasts). Prolia is approved and marketed in over 80 countries worldwide.Prolia® U.S. IndicationsProlia® is indicated for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture, defined as a history of osteoporotic fracture, or multiple risk factors for fracture; or patients who have failed or are intolerant to other available osteoporosis therapy. In postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, Prolia® reduces the incidence of vertebral, nonvertebral, and hip fractures.Prolia® is indicated for treatment to increase bone mass in men with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture, defined as a history of osteoporotic fracture, or multiple risk factors for fracture; or patients who have failed or are intolerant to other available osteoporosis therapy.Prolia® is indicated for the treatment of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis in men and women at high risk of fracture who are either initiating or continuing systemic glucocorticoids in a daily dosage equivalent to 7.5 mg or greater of prednisone and expected to remain on glucocorticoids for at least 6 months. High risk of fracture is defined as a history of osteoporotic fracture, multiple risk factors for fracture, or patients who have failed or are intolerant to other available osteoporosis therapy.Prolia® is indicated as a treatment to increase bone mass in men at high risk for fracture receiving androgen deprivation therapy for nonmetastatic prostate cancer. In these patients Prolia® also reduced the incidence of vertebral fractures.Prolia® is indicated as a treatment to increase bone mass in women at high risk for fracture receiving adjuvant aromatase inhibitor therapy for breast cancer.Important Safety InformationContraindicationsProlia® is contraindicated in patients with hypocalcemia. Pre–existing hypocalcemia must be corrected prior to initiating Prolia®. Prolia® is contraindicated in women who are pregnant and may cause fetal harm. In women of reproductive potential, pregnancy testing should be performed prior to initiating treatment with Prolia®. Prolia® is contraindicated in patients with a history of systemic hypersensitivity to any component of the product. Reactions have included anaphylaxis, facial swelling and urticaria.Same Active IngredientProlia® contains the same active ingredient (denosumab) found in XGEVA®. Patients receiving Prolia® should not receive XGEVA®.HypersensitivityClinically significant hypersensitivity including anaphylaxis has been reported with Prolia®. Symptoms have included hypotension, dyspnea, throat tightness, facial and upper airway edema, pruritus, and urticaria. If an anaphylactic or other clinically significant allergic reaction occurs, initiate appropriate therapy and discontinue further use of Prolia®.HypocalcemiaHypocalcemia may worsen with the use of Prolia®, especially in patients with severe renal impairment. In patients predisposed to hypocalcemia and disturbances of mineral metabolism, including treatment with other calcium-lowering drugs, clinical monitoring of calcium and mineral levels is highly recommended within 14 days of Prolia® injection. Concomitant use of calcimimetic drugs may worsen hypocalcemia risk and serum calcium should be closely monitored.  Adequately supplement all patients with calcium and vitamin D.Osteonecrosis of the Jaw (ONJ)ONJ, which can occur spontaneously, is generally associated with tooth extraction and/or local infection with delayed healing, and has been reported in patients receiving Prolia®. An oral exam should be performed by the prescriber prior to initiation of Prolia®. A dental examination with appropriate preventive dentistry is recommended prior to treatment in patients with risk factors for ONJ such as invasive dental procedures, diagnosis of cancer, concomitant therapies (e.g., chemotherapy, corticosteroids, angiogenesis inhibitors), poor oral hygiene, and co-morbid disorders. Good oral hygiene practices should be maintained during treatment with Prolia®. The risk of ONJ may increase with duration of exposure to Prolia®.For patients requiring invasive dental procedures, clinical judgment should guide the management plan of each patient. Patients who are suspected of having or who develop ONJ should receive care by a dentist or an oral surgeon. Extensive dental surgery to treat ONJ may exacerbate the condition. Discontinuation of Prolia® should be considered based on individual benefit-risk assessment.Atypical Femoral FracturesAtypical low-energy, or low trauma fractures of the shaft have been reported in patients receiving Prolia®. Causality has not been established as these fractures also occur in osteoporotic patients who have not been treated with antiresorptive agents.During Prolia® treatment, patients should be advised to report new or unusual thigh, hip, or groin pain. Any patient who presents with thigh or groin pain should be evaluated to rule out an incomplete femur fracture. Interruption of Prolia® therapy should be considered, pending a risk/benefit assessment, on an individual basis.Multiple Vertebral Fractures (MVF) Following Discontinuation of Prolia® TreatmentFollowing discontinuation of Prolia® treatment, fracture risk increases, including the risk of multiple vertebral fractures. New vertebral fractures occurred as early as 7 months (on average 19 months) after the last dose of Prolia®. Prior vertebral fracture was a predictor of multiple vertebral fractures after Prolia® discontinuation. Evaluate an individual's benefit/risk before initiating treatment with Prolia®. If Prolia® treatment is discontinued, patients should be transitioned to an alternative antiresorptive therapy.Serious InfectionsIn a clinical trial (N= 7808) in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis, serious infections leading to hospitalization were reported more frequently in the Prolia® group than in the placebo group. Serious skin infections, as well as infections of the abdomen, urinary tract and ear were more frequent in patients treated with Prolia®.Endocarditis was also reported more frequently in Prolia®-treated patients. The incidence of opportunistic infections and the overall incidence of infections were similar between the treatment groups. Advise patients to seek prompt medical attention if they develop signs or symptoms of severe infection, including cellulitis.Patients on concomitant immunosuppressant agents or with impaired immune systems may be at increased risk for serious infections. In patients who develop serious infections while on Prolia®, prescribers should assess the need for continued Prolia® therapy.Dermatologic Adverse ReactionsIn the same clinical trial in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis, epidermal and dermal adverse events such as dermatitis, eczema and rashes occurred at a significantly higher rate with Prolia® compared to placebo. Most of these events were not specific to the injection site. Consider discontinuing Prolia® if severe symptoms develop.Musculoskeletal PainSevere and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain has been reported in patients taking Prolia®.

All statements, other than statements of historical fact, are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements, including any statements on the outcome, benefits and synergies of collaborations, or potential collaborations, with any other company (including BeiGene, Ltd., Kyowa-Kirin Co., Ltd., or any collaboration to manufacture therapeutic antibodies against COVID-19), the performance of Otezla® (apremilast) (including anticipated Otezla sales growth and the timing of non-GAAP EPS accretion), the Five Prime Therapeutics, Inc. acquisition, the Teneobio, Inc. acquisition, the ChemoCentryx, Inc. acquisition, or the proposed acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics plc, as well as estimates of revenues, operating margins, capital expenditures, cash, other financial metrics, expected legal, arbitration, political, regulatory or clinical results or practices, customer and prescriber patterns or practices, reimbursement activities and outcomes, effects of pandemics or other widespread health problems such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on our business, and other such estimates and results. Forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below and more fully described in the Securities and Exchange Commission reports filed by Amgen, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequent periodic reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. Unless otherwise noted, Amgen is providing this information as of the date of this news release and does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this document as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those we project. Discovery or identification of new product candidates or development of new indications for existing products cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate or development of a new indication for an existing product will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, preclinical results do not guarantee safe and effective performance of product candidates in humans. The complexity of the human body cannot be perfectly, or sometimes, even adequately modeled by computer or cell culture systems or animal models. The length of time that it takes for us to complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for product marketing has in the past varied and we expect similar variability in the future. Even when clinical trials are successful, regulatory authorities may question the sufficiency for approval of the trial endpoints we have selected. We develop product candidates internally and through licensing collaborations, partnerships and joint ventures. Product candidates that are derived from relationships may be subject to disputes between the parties or may prove to be not as effective or as safe as we may have believed at the time of entering into such relationship. Also, we or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with our products, including our devices, after they are on the market.Our results may be affected by our ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products including biosimilars, difficulties or delays in manufacturing our products and global economic conditions. In addition, sales of our products are affected by pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny and reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment. Furthermore, our research, testing, pricing, marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities. Our business may be impacted by government investigations, litigation and product liability claims. In addition, our business may be impacted by the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. If we fail to meet the compliance obligations in the corporate integrity agreement between us and the U.S. government, we could become subject to significant sanctions. Further, while we routinely obtain patents for our products and technology, the protection offered by our patents and patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by our competitors, or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. We perform a substantial amount of our commercial manufacturing activities at a few key facilities, including in Puerto Rico, and also depend on third parties for a portion of our manufacturing activities, and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of our current products and product candidate development. An outbreak of disease or similar public health threat, such as COVID-19, and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of such disease, could have a significant adverse effect on the supply of materials for our manufacturing activities, the distribution of our products, the commercialization of our product candidates, and our clinical trial operations, and any such events may have a material adverse effect on our product development, product sales, business and results of operations. We rely on collaborations with third parties for the development of some of our product candidates and for the commercialization and sales of some of our commercial products. In addition, we compete with other companies with respect to many of our marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products. Further, some raw materials, medical devices and component parts for our products are supplied by sole third-party suppliers. Certain of our distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage in their dealings with us. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of our products that implicate an entire class of products could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on our business and results of operations. Our efforts to collaborate with or acquire other companies, products or technology, and to integrate the operations of companies or to support the products or technology we have acquired, may not be successful. A breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems and our data. Our stock price is volatile and may be affected by a number of events. Our business and operations may be negatively affected by the failure, or perceived failure, of achieving our environmental, social and governance objectives. The effects of global climate change and related natural disasters could negatively affect our business and operations. Global economic conditions may magnify certain risks that affect our business. Our business performance could affect or limit the ability of our Board of Directors to declare a dividend or our ability to pay a dividend or repurchase our common stock. We may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us, or at all.The scientific information discussed in this news release related to our product candidates is preliminary and investigative. Such product candidates are not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and no conclusions can or should be drawn regarding the safety or effectiveness of the product candidates. Further, any scientific information discussed in this news release relating to new indications for our products is preliminary and investigative and is not part of the labeling approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the products.

Frankly, it’s getting a little bit toasty on Wall Street, which is why stability may come at a premium.Naturally, the failure of First Republic – the third such collapse of a banking enterprise this year – generated plenty of jitters. Despite JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon’s encouraging words that the FRC takeover averted a crisis, circumstances still appear bleak. Add on various geopolitical events that may influence the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy and you have brewing skepticism.That’s not to say that the so-called blue-chip stocks 2023 provide all the answers. However, these industry stalwarts enjoy business predictability. Therefore, you’re more likely to win with these enterprises, even if the magnitude of victory may be limited. Remember, sometimes you just need to live for another day. Therefore, check out these blue-chip growth stocks.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsLMTLockheed Martin$451.93AMGNAmgen$231.89SNYSanofi$54.73VZVerizon$37.35SHELShell$59.34QCOMQualcomm$106.58TSMTaiwan Semiconductor$83.49Lockheed Martin (LMT)a bull next to a stack of blue gambling chips to represent blue-chip stocks, blue-chip stocks to buySource: ShutterstockThough Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) easily ranks among the best blue-chip stocks to buy, this narrative has always been controversial. And in the past year-and-a-half period, this narrative has become explosively cynical. For our purposes today, I’m not even going to touch the subject that’s on everyone’s mind. Instead, I think it’s useful for investors to consider the company’s relevance in the space economy.Fundamentally, Lockheed focuses on developing next-generation technologies, which include designing, building, and testing lunar and deep-space exploration capabilities. As Morgan Stanley analysts stated, the broader space economy could become a $1 trillion ecosystem by 2040.Story continuesFinancially, Lockheed compels because of its steady three-year revenue growth rate of 5.8%. As well, the enterprise benefits from consistent profitability. Notably, its trailing-year net margin comes in at 8.6%, above 72.63% of sector players. Finally, analyst peg LMT as a consensus hold. However, their average price target is $495.08, implying over 9% upside potential.Amgen (AMGN)A close-up shot of a blue casino chip on red carpet.Source: ShutterstockAn American multinational biopharmaceutical firm, Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) is one of the best in the business. At the time of writing, AMGN carries a market cap of $122.53 billion. Since the beginning of this year, AMGN gave up over 12% of its equity value. And in the trailing one-year period, it slipped about 3%. Nevertheless, this may be one of the discounted blue-chip stocks to buy.Right now, the market prices AMGN at a forward multiple of 13.18. As a discount to projected earnings, Amgen ranks better than 62% of companies in the drug manufacturing industry. Also, AMGN trades at 16.39 times free cash flow. In contrast, the sector median stat comes out to a loftier 23.3 times.To be fair, Amgen doesn’t have the greatest strengths in the balance sheet, particularly with its ultra-low equity-to-asset ratio of 0.06. However, it enjoys a robust trailing-year net margin of 30.23%. Lastly, covering analysts peg AMGN as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target lands at $259.46, implying over 13% upside potential.Sanofi (SNY)blue chip definition highlightedSource: ShutterstockA French multinational pharmaceutical and healthcare giant, Sanofi (NASDAQ:SNY) covers seven major therapeutic areas: cardiovascular, central nervous system, diabetes, internal medicine, oncology, thrombosis, and vaccines. At the time of writing, Sanofi carries a market cap of $141 billion. Since the Jan. opener, SNY gained nearly 11% of its equity value. With a solid performance, SNY ranks among the best blue-chip stocks to buy.Even better, SNY also makes a case for blue-chip value stocks. Currently, the market prices SNY at a forward multiple of 11.84. As a discount to projected earnings, Sanofi ranks better than 68.22% of companies listed in the drug manufacturing industry. Also, SNY trades at 14.89 times FCF. As stated earlier, the sector median stat is 23.3. Fundamentally, Sanofi offers a tad more encouragement because of its relatively stable balance sheet. Also, it enjoys a net margin of 18.44%, outpacing 87.68% of its peers.To close out, analysts peg SNY as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target comes out to $62, implying over 14% upside potential.Verizon (VZ)a pile of blue chips on top of a newspaperSource: ShutterstockA telecommunications conglomerate, Verizon (NYSE:VZ) seemingly benefits from its massive footprint and compelling initiatives, such as the 5G rollout. However, circumstances haven’t been the most auspicious for the telecom giant recently. Since the Jan. opener, VZ stock slipped more than 5%. Over the past 365 days, VZ gave up more than 21% of its market value.To be completely upfront, investment resource Gurufocus warns its readers that VZ could be a possible value trap. Further, its recent tepid financial results suggest rising competition and a tough economic backdrop. On paper, though, VZ trades at a forward multiple of 8.08. As a discount to projected earnings, Verizon ranks better than 85.44% of telecom competitors.Operationally, Verizon prints a three-year revenue growth rate of 13.5%, above 72.19% of sector rivals. Also, its net margin is an impressive 15.85%. Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg VZ as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $44.50, implying over 17% upside potential. Thus, it makes for a decent candidate for blue-chip growth stocks.Shell (SHEL)Source: ShutterstockA British multinational oil and gas company, Shell (NYSE:SHEL) represents one of the biggest oil firms in the world. On paper, SHEL makes a ready case for the best blue-chip stocks to buy. Unfortunately, economic headwinds – particularly recessionary fears – have stymied the enterprise. Still, geopolitical dynamics may send hydrocarbon energy prices higher, making SHEL worth consideration.Additionally, SHEL makes a solid case for blue-chip value stocks. Right now, the market prices SHEL at a trailing multiple of 5.12. As a discount to earnings, Shell ranks better than 66.27% of companies listed in the oil and gas industry. Also, SHEL trades at 0.54 times trailing sales. In contrast, the sector median stat is 0.91 times. On the bottom line, Shell carries a net margin of 11.04%, above nearly 64% of its rivals. Also, its return on equity (ROE) is 23.39%, indicating a high-quality enterprise.Looking to the Street, analysts peg SHEL as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target comes in at $71.61, implying over 22% upside potential.Qualcomm (QCOM)10 Small-Cap Stocks to Buy Before They Grow UpSource: ShutterstockA multinational technology firm, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) creates semiconductors, software, and services related to wireless technology. Notably, it owns critical patents in mobile communications technologies such as 5G. At the time of writing, Qualcomm carries a market cap of $125.81 billion. Since the start of the year, QCOM gained over 5% of its equity value.One of the more undervalued best blue-chip stocks to buy, the market prices QCOM at a forward multiple of 12.22. As a discount to projected earnings, Qualcomm ranks better than 78.36% of companies listed in the semiconductor space. Also, QCOM trades at 15.89 times FCF. In contrast, the sector median is 23.62 times. Operationally, Qualcomm prints a three-year revenue growth rate of 25%, ranked above 78.55% of sector rivals. It also makes shares a compelling idea among blue-chip growth stocks.Lastly, analysts peg QCOM as a consensus moderate buy. Overall, their average price target hits $140, implying slightly over 24% growth potential.Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM)Source: ShutterstockA multinational semiconductor located in its namesake country, Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) may give some investors jitters due to the underlying sensitive geopolitical tension. Still, for those willing to take a chance, TSM ranks among the best blue-chip stocks to buy. Fundamentally, Taiwan Semiconductor is the world’s most valuable chip-manufacturing enterprise. Since the Jan. opener, TSM gained nearly 12% of its equity value.An enticing opportunity, the market prices TSM at a forward multiple of 16.13. As a discount to projected earnings, Taiwan Semiconductor ranks better than 64.18% of the field. Also, TSM trades at 8.06 times the operating cash flow. In contrast, the sector median stat is much loftier 15.47 times. Conspicuously, the company features a three-year revenue growth rate of 28.4%, outflanking 82.47% of its peers. Therefore, it’s a strong case for blue-chip growth stocks. Also, the semiconductor specialist prints an FCF growth rate of 53% during the same period.On a final note, analysts peg TSM as a unanimous strong buy. Their average price target lands at $118.67, implying over 43% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

However, because of these reasons, the price of gold may fluctuate. Accordingly, the price of various gold miners will also likely see significant volatility from here.That said, buying gold miners rather than physical metal offers various advantages for investors. In fact, gold mining companies have the potential to generate higher returns than a direct investment in physical gold by increasing their production and minimizing expenses. Better, these factors can aid in boosting the profits of gold companies, resulting in higher stock prices due to the rise in earnings, which can outpace the growth rate of the cost of gold itself. With numerous companies dedicated to gold mining, investors have many choices when investing in gold. Below are some of the most promising gold stocks to consider buying in 2023.AEMAgnico Eagle Mines$60.40GOLDBarrick Gold$20.43NEMNewmont Corporation$49.41InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsGold Miners: Agnico Eagle Mines (AEM)A pile of shining gold bars. Gold stocksSource: ShutterstockDespite a challenging cost and workforce environment, Agnico Eagle Mines (NYSE:AEM) emerged as a leading gold producer in the past year, thanks to its exceptional cost control measures and record margins. In addition, the company continued to make progress in expanding its mineral resources and consolidating its position in the most profitable mining jurisdictions.In addition, Toronto-based Agnico Eagle Mines is a gold producer in Mexico, Finland, and Canada, with exploration and development activities in the United States. Although the company has a greater risk level than other gold equities, its equity valuation has decreased by approximately 2% from the beginning of Jan. Also, data from Bloomberg revealed that the average rating of Agnico Eagle Mines shares is a “moderate buy,” with an average target price valuation of US$70.50. Moving forward, it will be intriguing to observe how Agnico Eagle Mines handles its finances and stock performance amidst prolonged market volatility, fierce competition, and a commitment to satisfying shareholder interests through innovative value creation in core business areas under the guidance of effective leadership.Story continuesBarrick Gold (GOLD)A photo of a gold nugget on a table, being picked up by tweezers, with more gold behind it.Source: aerogondo2 / Shutterstock.comOver the past five years, Barrick Gold (NYSE:GOLD) has emerged as one of the most profitable businesses in its sector, with EBITDA margins of nearly 50%. Despite a challenging 2022, its profitability metrics remained relatively consistent with its historical averages.Barrick Gold’s asset base is another advantage, with the company holding 76 million ounces in gold reserves as of the end of 2022. The company’s robust financial flexibility also provides clear cash flow visibility for the foreseeable future. The company’s copper mining division is another significant opportunity, accounting for 18% of its revenues. This figure could rise significantly in the coming years as several long-term projects are being developed.In addition, the partnership between Barrick and Newmont in the Nevada Gold Mines joint venture is viewed as a game-changer that could result in substantial gains for both organizations. With an impressive gross profit margin of 39%, Barrick has already established a solid market presence.Newmont Corporation (NEM)An image of a rising bar graph on top of gold bars, representing gold stocksSource: Alexander Limbach / ShutterstockNewmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM), with a market capitalization of over $41 billion, is currently the largest gold company by market value. Given the current upward trend in gold prices, Newmont’s stock is worth watching.Since Nov., the value of gold has steadily been rising, reaching a value of over $2,000 per oz after several turning points. Recent banking failures have further bolstered the perception of gold as a safe store of value, leading to increased attention on Newmont Corporation as a gold mining stock. To invest in gold without buying the physical metal, high-quality gold mining stocks are a great option. Newmont Corporation is appealing, with a forward price-earnings ratio of 21.1 and a competitive dividend yield of 3.36%.Newmont Corporation boasts a solid balance sheet with an investment-grade rating and a healthy liquidity cushion of $6.7 billion. Given this, many investors anticipate the company to pursue growth through organic and acquisition strategies. Newmont has guided 6 million ounces of annual gold production through 2032, offering a clear line of sight to create value for its shareholders.On the date of publication, Chris MacDonald has a position in Agnico Eagle.

117,2bd79ffc-1563-3f89-9ac7-d2df734c6d65,M,2023-05-09,7 Consumer Stocks With Huge Return Potential for Long-Term Investors,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-consumer-stocks-huge-return-093033135.html,1683192633,STORY,"['BBY', 'CMG', 'DENN', 'LOCO', 'M']","[Recently released macroeconomic data shows that consumer spending is strong and is likely to continue to be powerful. First, consumer spending surged 3.7% year over year in the first quarter. Although warmer weather may have fueled the increase, I believe that the strong labor market also played a very important role. And the jobless claims data showed that the labor market remains strong, as the historically low 230,000 weekly jobless claims shows that worries about layoffs are overdone.With the vast majority of Americans who want jobs still able to get one, the growth of consumer spending looks poised to remain elevated going forward. For investors who want to take advantage of this situation, here are seven of the best consumer stocks to buy with high growth potential.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsBest Buy (BBY)A photo of a Best Buy store front.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comThere are multiple signs that consumer spending is bottoming. Specifically, Intel’s (NASDAQ:INTC) second-quarter guidance was widely seen as indicating that spending on PCs has bottomed. Of course, that’s excellent news for the only major retail chain focused on consumer electronics, Best Buy (NYSE:BBY).Further  supporting my theory that a rebound is likely near for the consumer electronics sector, Best Buy’s CEO said on the company’s fiscal Q4 earnings call that “We will [likely] start to see the benefit of the natural upgrade and replacement cycles for the tech bought … when the pandemic [began] possibly later this year, depending on the macro environment.” With the macro environment much stronger than expected, that upgrade cycle appears to be starting now.Another factor that could help Best Buy going forward is the tremendous interest in artificial intelligence. That interest could boost the number of computing devices sold by the retailer.With BBY trading at a low forward price-to-earnings ratio of 12x and analysts likely underestimating the company’s outlook this year and next, the stock could very well rocket much higher by the end of 2024.Story continuesChipotle (CMG)a pedestrian walks past a ChipotleSource: Northfoto / Shutterstock.comChipotle (NYSE:CMG) reported extraordinarily strong first-quarter results, indicating that the restaurant chain is resonating with American consumers and suggesting that it is one of the consumer stocks with high growth potential. As a result, I believe that the company’s shares could surge much higher in the short term, medium term and long term.The company’s comparable restaurant sales climbed 11% versus the same period a year earlier, while its operating margin soared a huge 6.1 percentage points and its earnings per share jumped an incredible 87%. Obviously, CMG is doing many things right.Investment bank BTIG responded to the results by hiking its price target on CMG stock to $2,175 from $1,825. The bank believes that the increases of the company’s “restaurant margins” are “still in the early innings.”After turning around Taco Bell, Chipotle CEO Brian Niccol has clearly turned around CMG, and I believe that Chipotle’s turnaround is far from over.Rivian (RIVN)rivn stock sign outside the company's HQ in Silicon ValleySource: Michael Vi / ShutterstockOne of the most well-respected automobile stock analysts, Morgan Stanley’s Adam Jonas, trimmed his price target on Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) to $24 from $26, but his target is still almost double the current price of RIVN stock.Although Jonas believes that the electric vehicle maker faces significant challenges, he thinks that the company’s EVs are “differentiated,” while the company operates in a “niche” part of the EV sector. Jonas also believes that the company can cut its costs in order to boost its profitability.I would add that the company’s per-vehicle costs will likely greatly decline as it expands its manufacturing capacity, while its contract with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) gives it a continuous, large source of demand for its EVs.Also noteworthy is that some buyers of the company’s EVs that cost less than $80,000 qualify for a $3,750 federal tax credit.Macy’s (M)Macy's (M) logo on storefront in city with white sky behindSource: Joe Tabacca / Shutterstock.comMacy’s (NYSE:M) stock has a tiny valuation and a high dividend yield. Specifically, the shares have a forward price-to-earnings ratio of just 4.85x and a dividend yield of 4.3%.As inflation eases, more middle-class and upper-middle-class shoppers should return to Macy’s from discount chains, while its labor costs are likely to drop sharply. Moreover, the retailer is already quite profitable, as in March it reported earnings per share of $1.88 for its fiscal Q4.On April 3, JPMorgan upgraded Macy’s to “overweight” from “neutral.” The firm believes that the retailer can increase its EBITDA by around 10% annually, driven partly by “technology investments” and opening stores outside of malls. JPMorgan also is positive on the retailer’s balance sheet and placed a $29 price target on M stock.Also noteworthy is that TD Cowen raised its price target on the shares to $29 from $27 on March 3. The bank says that Macy’s was able to effectively reduce its inventory and should benefit from its strength in “gifting occasion-wear beauty and luxury,” The Fly reported. The bank maintained an “outperform” rating on the shares.Brunswick Corporation (BC)Bayliner Boats on display at 14th CNR Eurasia Boat Show in CNR Expo CenterSource: ShutterstockBrunswick’s (NYSE:BC) net cash used for operating activities fell to $15.8 million during its seasonally weak first quarter from $141 million during the same period a year earlier, while its top line climbed 3% year over year to $1.74 billion.The boat maker’s profits should be boosted by easing inflation going forward. Moreover, many wealthy homeowners who have locked in low interest rates for their mortgages, spent money on remodeling their homes during the pandemic and have benefited from income increases, have a significant amount of disposable income to spend.While many of those individuals likely spent a great deal of money on travel in the wake of the pandemic, their hunger for travel is likely almost satiated. Going forward, many of them will probably spend their excess funds on other recreational activities, including boats.BC stock has a very low forward price-to-earnings ratio of 7.8x and a significant dividend yield of 1.9%.Investor’s Business Daily gives BC stock a high overall grade of 90 out of 99. Its earnings per share grade is 91, while its Relative Strength score is 88, indicating that the shares have performed well over the last 12 months.El Pollo Loco (LOCO)El Pollo Loco restaurant exterior and signSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comEl Pollo Loco (NASDAQ:LOCO) reported strong fourth-quarter results on March 9 as its revenue climbed 6.3% year over year to $115.9 million, while its net income came in at $6.5 million, up from $6.2 million during the same period a year earlier.Like many other names on this list, the reduction in inflation in general and wage growth in particular should help LOCO going forward. Moreover, the very strong results from Chipotle, which, like LOCO, serves healthy Latin American food, bodes well for LOCO and LOCO stock.Also positively, the company has shown that it can effectively use TikTok to market itself among younger consumers, as its promotion of its Overstuffed Quesadillas special garnered nearly 10 million views, LOCO reported in March.The company’s price-to-earnings ratio is a low 8.7x, and its trailing price-to-sales ratio is a tiny 0.7x.Denny’s Corporation (DENN)outside of a denny's restaurantSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comDenny’s Corporation (NASDAQ:DENN) has a few important positive catalysts. It can benefit from increased fears about the economy, which can lead some consumers to trade down to Denny’s from more expensive restaurants.Another trend that could boost Denny’s is the migration of many people from Northeastern states to the Sunbelt. Many Americans from Northeastern states love diners. As an American who moved from New Jersey to Texas five years ago and has traveled extensively in other southern states, I can attest to the fact that there are not many diners in the south. Denny’s, however, is quite ubiquitous in the region, and it’s a pretty good substitute for diners.Finally, Denny’s can cash in on the trend toward healthy eating, as I’ve noticed that the restaurant has many healthy breakfast options and even offers Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) burgers.Analysts, on average, expect the company to generate earnings per share of 71 cents next year. That means that DENN stock is currently trading at an appetizing forward price-to-earnings ratio of 15.6x.As of the date of publication, Larry Ramer owned shares of RIVN and his wife owned shares of LOCO.

118,062db40f-b574-38c1-bdc0-a227bbf21a91,NOV,2023-05-09,Estimating The Fair Value Of NOV Inc. (NYSE:NOV),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/estimating-fair-value-nov-inc-100040316.html,1683626440,STORY,['NOV'],"[Key InsightsNOV's estimated fair value is US$18.11 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to EquityCurrent share price of US$15.72 suggests NOV is potentially trading close to its fair value Analyst price target for NOV is US$24.54, which is 35% above our fair value estimateHow far off is NOV Inc. (NYSE:NOV) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for NOV Step By Step Through The CalculationWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$203.2mUS$517.3mUS$624.0mUS$703.1mUS$770.0mUS$826.1mUS$873.5mUS$914.1mUS$949.6mUS$981.4mGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x6Analyst x7Analyst x1Est @ 12.68%Est @ 9.51%Est @ 7.29%Est @ 5.74%Est @ 4.65%Est @ 3.89%Est @ 3.35% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 12% US$182US$413US$446US$449US$439US$421US$398US$373US$346US$320(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$3.8bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 12%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$981m× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (12%– 2.1%) = US$10bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$10b÷ ( 1 + 12%)10= US$3.3bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$7.1b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$15.7, the company appears about fair value at a 13% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at NOV as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 12%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.643. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for NOVStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Energy Services market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.Current share price is below our estimate of fair value.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Paying a dividend but company has no free cash flows.Annual revenue is forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. For NOV, we've put together three further items you should further examine:Risks: To that end, you should be aware of the   1 warning sign  we've spotted with NOV .Management:Have insiders been ramping up their shares to take advantage of the market's sentiment for NOV's future outlook?

119,d47ce12e-005f-35cb-ae4b-b615f5cda619,WYNN,2023-05-09,Buy These Stocks on Improved Business Environments Ahead of Earnings,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buy-stocks-improved-business-environments-205808173.html,1683579488,STORY,"['HRB', 'WYNN']","[Along with recovering from the effects of high inflation, many businesses were also continuing their post-pandemic recovery.Naturally, as tougher operating conditions subside, quite a few companies will start to stand out.Here are two top-rated Zacks stocks that investors may want to consider as their business environment continues to strengthen ahead of earnings.H&amp;R Block (HRB) Sporting a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) H&amp;R Block (HRB) stock looks attractive before its fiscal third-quarter earnings report on Tuesday, May 9.While H&amp;R Block is not immune to inflationary concerns, the end of prolonged tax extensions and delays following the pandemic has stabilized the company’s top and bottom lines. Notably, H&amp;R Block’s Consumer Services-Miscellaneous Industry is in the top 30% of over 250 Zacks industries.To that point, H&amp;R Block is expected to post solid EPS growth as a leader in tax preparation services with operations in the United States, Australia, and Canada.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAs shown above, third-quarter earnings are projected to jump 10% year over year at $4.51 per share. Sales for the quarter are expected to be up 2% at $2.11 billion. Overall, earnings are forecasted to rise 10% this year and climb another 10% in FY24 at $4.26 per share.Total sales are expected to be up 2% in FY23 and rise another 3% in FY24 to $3.65 billion. More impressive, FY24 would represent 38% growth from pre-pandemic sales of $2.64 billion in 2019.What makes H&amp;R Block's steady growth more attractive is the company’s price-to-earnings valuation. Trading at $32 a share, HRB stock trades at just 8.4X forward earnings. This is nicely beneath the industry average of 11.4X and the S&amp;P 500’s 19X. Plus, HRB trades 57% below its decade-long high of 19.7X and offers a 36% discount to the median of 13.1X.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWynn Resorts (WYNN)Another stock that looks intriguing as its business environment strengthens is Wynn Resorts (WYNN). Sporting a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) Wynn is set to release its first-quarter results on May 9 with its Gaming Industry in the top 29% of all Zacks industries.Story continuesHeadquartered in Las Vegas, 70% of Wynn’s revenue actually comes from its casino resorts in China with three establishments in Macau. Wynn’s revenue is beginning to rebound as the Chinese economy continues to stabilize and accelerate following the reopening of the country’s borders and the end of its Zero-Covid policy last December.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWynn’s first-quarter sales are expected to leap 31% from the prior-year quarter to $1.25 billion. On the bottom line, earnings are projected at -$0.18 per share, a vast improvement from EPS of -$1.21 in Q1 2022.Furthermore, annual earnings are forecasted to soar to $1.05 per share in FY23 compared to an adjusted loss of -$4.47 a share in 2022. Better still, FY24 EPS is anticipated to skyrocket another 313% at $4.34 per share.What is most intriguing about Wynn’s stock at the moment is the trend in earnings estimate revisions. As we can see from the nearby chart Wynn’s FY24 EPS estimates of $4.34 per share are almost where they were a year ago, before inflationary concerns crippled the outlook for most companies.Plus, total sales are now projected to climb 45% this year and jump another 17% in FY24 to $6.43 billion. More importantly, fiscal 2024 sales would only be 3% below pre-pandemic levels with 2019 sales at $6.61 billion and China's reopening offers much more room for growth.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTakeaway Stronger business environments have made H&amp;R Block and Wynn Resorts stock more attractive ahead of their quarterly results. This also makes it quite possible that both companies will offer positive guidance during their quarterly reports which could lead to more near-term upside in their stocks.On top of that, the strengthening of their broader economic environments is starting to make H&amp;R Block and Wynn Resorts look like very viable investments for 2023 and beyond.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

120,b04b78c8-de6e-3aa4-847f-964773966e46,WYNN,2023-05-09,Top 15 Live Entertainment Companies in the World,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-15-live-entertainment-companies-203728693.html,1683578248,STORY,"['LYV', 'WMG', 'SEAS', 'SIX', 'VIVHY', 'CNK', 'WYNN', 'FUN']","[In this article, we take a look at the top 15 live entertainment companies in the world. For more on this, go to Top 5 Live Entertainment Companies in the World.Live Entertainment is a multi-billion dollar global industry roughly generating a total of $182.19B annually. From casinos to concert promoters to event organizers and theater productions, there is a diversity of small and big companies competing and succeeding within the industry. The year 2021 was challenging for the global Live Entertainment industry. During the year, the COVID-19 outbreak brought the world to an abrupt halt, and every avenue of Live Entertainment remained shut.Activities resumed soon after the lockdowns were lifted, and the appetite for live events rapidly grew among consumers. Resultantly, the industry recovered at a fast pace, and the year 2022 saw a significant increase in revenue, with a total of $74.89 Billion.Industry Trends and Key PlayersThe industry trends within the Live Entertainment industries keep changing, and many factors come to play when we talk about this. Vito Iaia, the Co-founder of Impact Museum who also spent eight years with Ticketmaster and Live Nation, said that the Pandemic changed the dynamic of the Live Entertainment industry completely.Trends within each industry that make up the live entertainment industry are influenced mainly by technological advancements and consumer demands. The only industry that operates in a different manner when it comes to trends is the theme park industry, which is controlled primarily by standard-setting organizations like the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions (IAAPA) or Themed Entertainment Association (TEA). Before the Pandemic struck, in 2018, the total revenue generated by the Live Entertainment industry was 56.38 Billion USD. Now, analysts estimate the market to be five times bigger due to the growth of the Live Entertainment industry and the increase in demand for immersive experiences within the industry. Consumers now look forward to experimental content.Story continuesWith the advancements in the AI sector, the industry continues to grow even further. According to a Statista report, the Live Entertainment Industry saw the lowest year in revenue in 2020 but has risen at a fast pace ever since. One thing to note is that, throughout the years, the theme park and the music industry have taken the lead. They are then followed by the gaming and sports industry. After that comes comedy, followed by theatre. The key players in this industry are the companies that fall under the Theme Parks and Music and Concerts category, i.e., The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS), Live Nation Entertainment (NYSE: LYV), and the Oriental Land Company (NYSE: OLCLY).Outlook: 10 Years From NowBefore COVID-19, the Live Entertainment Industry was massive, but not as much as today. In 2017, the total revenue generated was $72.33 billion. It rose gradually until 2019 but saw a sharp decline in 2020 when the pandemic hit, with total revenue of $16.48 billion for the year. After the pandemic, in 2021, there was a drastic increase in revenue, and the figure rose to $29.18 billion. According to forecasts, in 2023, the revenue will be $88.45 billion, and the industry will see another 6% increase by 2024. The Theme Park industry contributes the most to the Live Entertainment industry. It had a revenue of $82.4 billion in 2022 and is expected that this industry will grow at a CAGR of 5.2% by 2030. The noteworthy point here is that the theme park industry makes up only one portion of the Live Entertainment industry. So, the industry will grow a lot more than that. By 2025, the industry growth is projected to slow down a little. Although the numbers will not grow as rapidly as they are growing today, it is still expected that the Live Entertainment industry will reach a $2.93 trillion figure by 2026.If we look more towards consumer trends, research conducted by Virgin Media O2 concluded that nine out of ten people prefer live entertainment over other pastime activities. 64% of people even claimed that they would prioritize it in their monthly spending, wherever they can. Given this consumer mindset and the industry outlook, live entertainment will only grow more in the next ten years.Top 15 Live Entertainment Companies in the WorldKobby Dagan / Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyFor our list, we've ranked the top companies in ascending order based on their market cap in May 2023.

In the previous quarter, the company reported a negative earnings surprise of 5.1%.How Are Estimates Placed?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first-quarter bottom line is pegged at a loss of 18 cents per share, indicating an improvement of 85.1% from a loss of $1.21 reported in the year-ago quarter.For revenues, the consensus mark is pegged at nearly $1,254 million. The metric suggests an improvement of 31.6% from the year-ago quarter’s figure.Wynn Resorts, Limited Price and EPS Surprise Wynn Resorts, Limited Price and EPS SurpriseWynn Resorts, Limited price-eps-surprise | Wynn Resorts, Limited Quote Let's look at how things have shaped up in the quarter.Factors to NoteWynn Resorts’ first-quarter performance is likely to have benefited from sports-betting expansion, non-gaming revenue-boosting strategies and marketing initiatives. This and the increased visitation (in the Las Vegas market), improved bookings (backed by strength in ADR’s) and strong recovery in Macau region (owing to the easing of restrictions) are likely to have aided the company’s performance in the to-be-reported quarter. We expect revenues from Las Vegas operations to rise 50.2% year over year (to $662.7 million) in the first quarter.During the previous quarter, the company reported an uptick in visitation and demand in the Macau region. The company stated that gross gaming revenue (or GGR) market share in January was consistent with 2019 levels. Given a rise in migration of former junket customers into direct and the premium mass component of business, the momentum is likely to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter.Strong contributions from Encore Boston Harbor might have aided the company’s first-quarter top line. During the previous quarter, the company launched a retail sports betting at Encore Boston Harbor and generated approximately $0.5 million per day in handle in the first six days. It also reported a 30% rise in Wynn Rewards members sign-up. The emphasis on development projects (including incremental parking, food and beverage and entertainment amenities) and strategic marketing campaigns are likely to have paved a path for new customer acquisition in the to-be-reported quarter. We expect revenues from Encore Boston Harbor to rise 10.5% year over year (to $210.7 million) in the first quarter.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for Wynn Resorts this time around.

The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Wynn Resorts is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for WYNN in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 1 cent per share for WYNN, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 18 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for WYNN, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +105.69% heading into earnings season.Wynn Resorts, Limited Price and EPS SurpriseWynn Resorts, Limited Price and EPS SurpriseWynn Resorts, Limited price-eps-surprise | Wynn Resorts, Limited QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market.

They complement Platts European price offerings for standard HRC and the pre-existing suite of daily low-carbon and zero-carbon primary aluminum and low-carbon aluminum billet assessments. The Platts European HRC Carbon-Accounted Steel Premium (CASP) assessment reflects:any differential achieved for spot sales of HRC on an ex-works basis, with total accounted carbon emissions of 2.1 metric tons (mt) of CO2, or less, for every metric ton of steel produced.trade in HRC with carbon emissions certified by internationally accepted, independent organizations. Market participants are expected to supply proof of such certification upon request.The Platts Northwest Europe HRC Carbon-Accounted Steel Price assessment represents:an all-in price for carbon-accounted HRC in that region. The price assessment is the sum of the Platts European HRC Steel Carbon-Accounted Emissions Premium added to the existing Platts HRC ex-works Ruhr price assessment.A normalization to European Norm EN 10025-2:2004/ Grade S235J quality specifications, and reflect ex-works Ruhr shipments of at least 100 mt, within 4-10 weeks, in Euros/mt on delivery.Christopher Davis, Global Lead for Carbon-Accounted Metals, S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights, said: ""The carbon-accounted metals space is one that's evolving rapidly, but is also lacking transparency and relevant price references similar to those Platts provides for standard metals. These new assessments will help shed light on value and pricing trends, while bringing clarity to an opaque market.""Story continuesThe new price references include emissions from direct, indirect and associated upstream and downstream activities such as mining and processing of steelmaking raw materials, hot metal production, steel rolling and associated transportation and logistics and reflect carbon emissions-related surcharges or upcharges implemented by market participants. Trade in steel products using offsets to reduce overall emissions profiles, such as credits sourced from voluntary carbon markets, will not be considered for inclusion in these assessments.While energy transition is increasingly a key part of global metals and mining companies' corporate strategies, a vacuum of standards has hampered market participants in their efforts to define, quantify and understand the market value of carbon-accounted steel.Anna Crowley, Global Head of Metals Pricing, S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights, said: ""Through Platts' carbon-accounted steel price assessments, market participants will get daily snapshots of this important emerging market. Such illumination should aid across the value chain, from producers seeking acknowledgement of the advances made in reducing carbon at the steelmaking stage, to end-users demanding material certified by suppliers that it meets certain decarbonization criteria, and beyond.""The new price assessments are also an augmentation that will allow the industry and marketplace to leverage expertise and price assessing capabilities across commodities and voluntary carbon sectors, allowing deeper and broader insights with which to navigate the global energy transition.

KingThanks, Sean, and thank you to everyone for joining us this morning. Last quarter, we said that we expected Q2 to be tougher than Q1, and this quarter was definitely a tough one. As you will have seen in our release earlier this morning, results were weaker than expected and top line performance was mixed, particularly when compared to our strong performance last year.At the same time, we outperformed our large branded-food peers in volume and dollar sales and continue to gain pound and dollar share in our retail core business lines.As I also said last quarter, I can't remember a time when our business faced the highly unusual situation that we're currently seeing, where all 3 of our core protein categories, Beef, Pork and Chicken are experiencing market challenges at the same time. This unusual confluence of issues continued in Q2 and directly impacted our results. I know that you watch the protein markets closely, and like us, know that there are many factors at play here that are macro in nature.For example, Beef is cycling out of historically strong margins that were seen throughout most of fiscal 2021 and '22. Cutout values across protein complex are much lower than a year ago. Inflation has also remained elevated and persistent, which has dramatically impacted our cost.The current macro backdrop is clearly tough. We have a strong growth strategy and are bullish on our long-term outlook. We continue to implement our strategy, focus on the things that we can control and build upon the strong foundation we have in place.Late last month, we announced important initiatives to simplify our structure and rightsize our team. These are a logical next step in our ongoing efforts to drive operational and functional excellence as we strive to be best-in-class in our industry. Last quarter, we talked about executional issues that we needed to improve and operational performance did get better. We set a high bar to execute with excellence and are making progress.Despite our overall results, there were strong positive highlights in the quarter that serve as proof points that our strategy is working. As you know, our branded foods business is the key growth pillar for the future, and in Q2, the business performed well. These results were driven by the strength of our share position, especially for our core brands, including Jimmy Dean, Tyson and Hillshire Farm, which helped deliver strong margins compared to the same 13-week period last year.We continue to grow both pound and dollar share and to outperform our large food peers in volume based on Nielsen data. It's clear we are winning with consumers. We also continue to win with our customers. We're proud to have been moved up into the top 10 for the first time ever in the most recent Kantar power rankings. In fact, Tyson finished in the top 10 in 6 of the 9 categories they measure. As we continue to focus on meeting customer needs and planning the future together with them.While strong performance continued in our branded foods business, I know that our results in Chicken are top of mind for many of you. So I want to spend a few minutes walking through our Chicken business in detail. I want to point you to 3 important things on the macro environment. First, marketing conditions remain very challenging. Commodity prices for most fresh chicken cuts are much lower than last year, with boneless breast meat, tenders and wings down more than 50%. While we're not fully exposed to commodity markets, we are not immune to their dynamics. Some might expect these dynamics to impact our results immediately. But in fact, they work through on a lag. As chicken commodity prices declined in Q1, the impact continued into our Q2, while price increases we saw during the quarter are expected to affect Q3. Second, input costs were higher compared to last year as our feed, ingredient cost increased $145 million. We also realized an unfavorable year-over-year derivative impact of approximately $135 million due to volatility in commodity grain prices. Third, while high-path avian influenza has not had a significant impact on our live operations, key export markets remain closed. While we can't control markets, we are focused on the things we can control. We made a series of strategic decisions to better position us for the future. For example, we converted 2 of our plants from bone-in to boneless, specifically to add new business and to continue growing with an important customer. We further rationalized assets, SKUs and inventory. In fact, we reduced our finished inventory pounds by nearly 20% during the quarter. We also made the difficult choice earlier this quarter to close 2 of our less productive chicken plants. These strategic actions are expected to generate significant efficiencies going forward, although some of them generate incremental cost in our current results.Despite challenging market conditions, we continue to execute our strategy and have significant opportunities in front of us. We increased our internal production, gaining 130 basis points of harvest share compared to last year. This led to pound share gains of 250 basis points in value-added retail and 60 basis points in food service. As you can see, we are well positioned to keep growing. We continue to invest in automation and digital capabilities with opportunities to improve our yield. We now have 50 debone lines that are fully automated. We have room to optimize our cost structure and a portion of the actions we took last month are focused on this.Importantly, we are working more closely than ever with our customers to create value jointly. We're building long-term supply partnerships that have clear benefits for both sides. We improved order fill rates by more than 20%. This was no accident, and I'm proud of our team for accomplishing this. We're winning in the marketplace by winning with our customers.Now I've given you specific details on the business, I want to step back and remind you of our overall strategy. Our approach to building and growing Chicken is based on 3 key elements: first, we strive to be the best-in-class operator by executing with excellence. This includes filling our plants to continue increasing our capacity utilization. Second, we plan to grow our value-added business focusing on fully cooked in retail and food service channels and by innovating and differentiating our offerings. And third, we expect to win with consumers behind the #1 brand in Chicken and win with our customers by being their go-to supplier.I want to underscore that we are focused on improving our results in Chicken. We can do that by implementing our strategy leading to continued growth and improved margins and I'm confident that we have the right leadership team in place to get us there.Now turning to the continued strong performance of our retail branded business. With our iconic retail brands, Tyson, Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farm and Ball Park, Tyson core business lines continue to outpace total food and beverage and our peers in both sales dollars and volume growth, up 13% and 7%, respectively, compared to a year ago per Nielsen.Our brands continue to perform well as Tyson core business lines grew pound share by 2.4 points relative to prior year quarter. We continue to show market share leadership in most of the retail categories in which we compete, delivering both dollar and pound share growth in the aggregate by more than 2 points and also across all dayparts.As proven by our growth compared to last year, we know that consumers will spend on categories and brands they know and trust. The trajectory of our Tyson core business lines volume share growth shows the momentum we have gained with consumers. We remain focused on maintaining our improved fill rates and on-shelf availability while investing in merchandising and advertising to support our brands, which, along with our strong business fundamentals, resulted in pound share growth increasing sequentially over the past 4 quarters. Tyson, Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farm and Ball Park, all hold favorite brand status with consumers by a large margin over our nearest competitor. It is evident that we're delivering the brands and products that consumers desire. As I mentioned earlier, our move into the Kantar top 10 demonstrates that we continue to gain the confidence of our customers. Winning with customers and consumers is a key priority, and it's clear we're having success with both.Now let me tell you why I'm so optimistic about our future. Tyson is an iconic company with a broad portfolio of products and powerful brands that has been a recognized leader in protein for nearly 90 years. We've been through market cycles before. I've been through them before myself and we've always come out stronger on the other side. We have the right strategy, seasoned leadership and team members in place to do it once again. Our vision is to deliver sustainable top line growth and margin improvement. Our strategy to drive growth is built on the foundation of 3 key pillars: first, we will drive growth in our core protein platform where we harvest and process fresh meat across a diverse portfolio. We expect global demand for protein to continue to grow in the years ahead, driven by population growth and per capita income expansion. Tyson is well positioned with the capacity in place to meet demand.Second, we will drive growth through our branded food portfolio. We have over 30 prepared food and snacking brands, including some of the strongest brands in all of food, namely Tyson, Jimmy Dean and Hillshire Farm. Branded food is our best opportunity to drive faster growth, higher margins and stronger results.Third, we will expand internationally where it makes sense. Most of the growth in protein consumption is expected to take place outside the U.S. We can capture this significant opportunity by scaling our existing business, expanding our customer base and exploring new markets. These pillars are enabled by our relentless focus on customers and consumers, operational excellence and digital capabilities to drive margin improvement.We win with customers and consumers by building growth partnerships, delivering top-tier customer service and fill rates and product innovation. We expect to realize our operational excellence goals as we modernize our operations, driving efficiencies, saving on costs and increasing throughput. And we continue to build our digital capabilities, operating at scale with digitally enabled standard operating procedures and utilizing data, automation and AI tech for decision-making.With the combination of our growth strategies and focus on margin improvement, we can deliver the food that consumers love and create long-term value for our customers, for our team members and for our shareholders. We've put a strong proven leadership team in place here at Tyson. I've never been more confident in the talent that we have, and I know that we have the right people to capture the opportunities in front of us. Now I'll turn things over to John to discuss our financial results for the quarter in more detail.John R. TysonThank you, Donnie. First, for a quick touch on our total company financial performance and then a review of the individual segments. Total company revenue was up slightly compared to last year's previous record Q2 performance as the benefit from significant volume growth in Chicken were offset by the reduction in price per pound in Beef and in Pork. For the total company and individually in Chicken and Prepared Foods, we continue to deliver record high sales performance now for a fifth consecutive quarter. We remain focused on driving growth in these businesses to enhance our margin profile over time.Now turning to profitability. More than 90% of the decline in adjusted operating income was driven by lower earnings in Beef and Chicken. Higher input costs per pound in all segments except Pork increased our cost of goods sold. The majority was driven by inflationary impacts on raw material and labor costs. The remainder of the increase was due to a few things: inventory value adjustments, unfavorable derivative impacts and a shift producing more value-added mix and this was partially offset by savings from our productivity program, reduced outside meat purchases in Chicken and decreased supply chain costs. Our pricing decreased led by lower cutout values in Beef and Pork. This was partially offset by volume growth in Chicken.Now let me go to the individual segment results, starting with Beef. Sales in our Beef segment decreased 8.3% compared to a record high sales in the second quarter of last year. Price was down 5.4% due to reduced domestic demand and softer export markets. and volume was down 2.9% due to fewer head processed. Live cattle costs increased approximately $305 million on a like-for-like volume in the quarter as the reduction in the beef cattle herd continues to tighten supply and increase competition for cattle.The margin compression resulting from reduced sales and increased cattle costs led to a segment operating income of $8 million and an operating margin of 0.2%, down from the historically high second quarter margin of 12.7% last year.Looking next at the Pork segment. The volume gain of 1.1%, driven by improved hog availability was more than offset by the 10.3% decline in average sales price due to the soft global demand environment, leading to a decrease in overall sales of 9.2% versus the second quarter last year. The Pork segment posted an operating loss of $31 million for the quarter which was driven by the industry headwinds compressing pork packing margins and inflationary pressures on operating costs.Moving on to the Chicken segment results. The sales increase in Chicken of 8.4% over the prior year quarter was driven by a 6.4% uptick in volume due to increased internal production. Benefits of prior period pricing actions drove 2% growth in sales despite a challenging commodity market. At a loss of $166 million, second quarter operating income was impacted adversely by market conditions and near-term impacts of strategic decisions we made that Donnie discussed earlier. Other headwinds experienced in the quarter included continuing export impacts from HPAI as well as higher feed ingredient cost of $145 million and an unfavorable year-over-year derivative impact of approximately $135 million, including a $35 million loss in this current quarter and $100 million gain in Q2 of last year.The industry operational headwinds do not change our approach, though. We expect to perform as the industry best-in-class operator while growing our internal production with our customer demand, enabling us to improve our fixed cost leverage, grow volume and gain market share. In addition to the continuous improvement of our operations, growing the market share of our portfolio of value-added products is imperative to maximizing our profitability and our long-term strategy.Now lastly, to Prepared Foods, where our retail brands like Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farm and State Fair continue to deliver industry-leading performance, outpacing all peers in both revenue and volume growth in the quarter. Total sales revenue grew 1.2%, primarily driven by pricing gains. The slight volume decline of 0.4% was driven by softness in food service volumes as the trajectory of this channel's recovery remains uneven. This was almost all offset though by the strong performance of our retail brands, driven by their category-leading position, improved supply and our MAP investments.Compared to the prior year period, segment operating income decreased modestly due to increased raw material costs and brand building investments. This was partially offset by productivity gains and price increases. While down slightly against the historically strong comp, we are pleased with the operating margin performance of 10.4% in this challenging macro environment. We continue to be excited for the future in Prepared Foods as the segment is critical to valuing up Beef, Pork and Chicken commodity meat products and delivering strong earnings at a time when the commodity protein segment's profitability is under pressure.We will continue to unlock value by increasing plant utilization, implementing productivity initiatives, and we will grow through innovation of new offerings, expansion of our existing product portfolio and the recovery of our food service business. Now to our financial position and capital priorities, we're building financial strength, investing in our business and returning cash to shareholders remain the priorities of our capital allocation strategy.First, let me spend a minute talking about our financial policy and long-term capital allocation and provide a bit more color around our approach to CapEx deployment. Our financial policy remains unchanged. We are committed to building financial strength, maintaining our investment-grade credit rating and targeting net leverage of at or below 2x net debt to EBITDA for the long term. Our capital allocation prioritizes investing in our business through CapEx as well as strategic and disciplined M&amp;A while also returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.As owner operators, our approach to CapEx is simple and effective, we support our maintenance CapEx needs and then we focus on growth and profit optimization, investing in opportunities that generate the greatest returns while maintaining a strong balance sheet. We don't expect our total CapEx this year to exceed $2.3 billion, which is down from our prior guidance of at or around $2.5 billion.Now moving on from CapEx, during Q2, we returned $167 million to shareholders through dividends and $19 million in share repurchases. We have increased our dividend for 11 consecutive years and remain committed to supporting our dividend. We ended the quarter with $2.2 billion of liquidity and net leverage of 2.4x.Last week, we entered into a new term loan agreement for $1.75 billion to further enhance our liquidity. These funds will be used to pay off our existing commercial paper that's outstanding and some upcoming bond maturities and also to fund our investments in the business, including the pending acquisition of Williams Sausage, which will support our strategic focus on branded retail growth.We remain committed to maintaining a disciplined yet opportunistic capital allocation strategy, ensuring that we deploy resources to maximize long-term shareholder value.Now let's review our updated outlook for fiscal 2023. Based on performance year-to-date and a moderating outlook for revenue growth, we are lowering our total company sales guidance to $53 billion to $54 billion or flat to 1% growth for the year. In our Beef segment, based on the deterioration in current market dynamics, we now expect margins to be between a loss of 1% and a gain of 1% for the fiscal year. Also, due to challenging market dynamics this time in our Pork segment, we are lowering margin guidance for the year to be between a loss of 2% and breakeven.In Chicken, we now expect full year margins to be between a loss of 1% and a gain of 1%, based on our results so far in April, we anticipate Q3 margins to be roughly breakeven as we gain momentum and exit the fourth quarter at or above the high end of the full year range.In the second quarter, Prepared Foods continued its strong performance, resulting in a first half margin above the guided range for the fiscal year. So we are maintaining that at 8% to 10%, driven by historical seasonality and continued brand support. And in our International business, we remain committed to expanding globally in the fastest-growing protein consumption markets in the world. Driven by continued year-over-year volume and revenue growth from new facilities ramping up, we are confident of our improved profitability in fiscal 2023, with stronger quarterly performance in the back half of the year compared to Q2.As I mentioned earlier, we're reducing our expectations for CapEx to approximately $2.3 billion. And our net interest expense and tax rate are now expected to be around $340 million and 22%, respectively.In summary, the first half was challenging and many of the headwinds experienced are likely to persist for the remainder of the fiscal year. Although the current operating environment has proven to be difficult, we view this as an opportunity to grow and improve our business operations, and we are optimistic on our long-term value driver prospects. We have great leadership and operational teams, growing demand for our products, robust portfolio diversity and the differentiated asset footprint needed to win in the marketplace as we continue to grow our business and provide desirable returns for our shareholders. So now, let me turn the call back over to Sean for Q&amp;A instructions. Thanks, Sean.Question and Answer SessionSean CornettThanks, John. Now we will move on to your questions. Please recall our cautions on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures apply to both our prepared remarks and the following Q&amp;A. Operator, please provide the Q&amp;A instruction.Operator(Operator Instructions) Our first question today comes from Ben Bienvenu from Stephens Inc.Benjamin Shelton BienvenuSo my first question is a 2-part question on the Chicken segment. So first part of the question, in the quarter, results, obviously, were weak and considerably weaker than we saw, I think, in the broader market. Could you talk to a few of the things that might have contributed to company-specific weakness in the segment.And then as you look going forward, you talked about -- John Randal, margins being flat in 3Q, breakeven and then ramping into 4Q what all is incorporated into that assumption? Is it what we've seen already in terms of improvement in quality fundamentals? Do you need to take further actions around closing underperforming facilities or reducing inventory? And maybe just help us understand what's embedded in that expectation going forward.Donnie D. KingOkay. Ben, this is Donnie. I'll start off and then for the Chicken portion of this, I'll flip it over to Wes and let him add some detail to this. But I would say this quarter was not a surprise to us. We knew Q2 was going to be challenging and it was. I've talked about the fact that I've never seen this highly unusual situation where Beef, Pork and Chicken were all experiencing challenges at the same time. Many of these are macro in nature. But in Chicken specifically -- in Chicken, we have seen operational improvements and market recovery. While slower than expected, it will recover and of all of our businesses that are challenged right now, Chicken will recover first.In the quarter, we had -- of our $166 million loss, $90 million of that came from 3 main areas. There was about 1/3 of it in mark-to-market, inventory adjustment, SKU rationalization accounted for about 1/3 of it and start-up costs associated with the mix change and improvement from bone-in to boneless plus a few asset impairments. So I would then go on to say Chicken remains a top priority for me. We have the #1 brand in Chicken. Our model doesn't give us the highs and lows of the commodity markets. That doesn't mean that we're not impacted by that and variable pricing model that we have in place, there are lags that go with that.About 2 years ago, I laid out for you the plan that we had with our Chicken business, and we're following it. We're growing our volume and improving our mix. We sow what we harvested and we reduced inventory by 20%. And I would tell you that we are relentless on operational execution. We continue to invest in automation and digital capabilities and we will and do compete with the very best in the industry. We're winning in every area in which we play. We have market leadership in every category. Customers and consumers are key priorities for us, and it's clear we're having success with them. We've just recently announced that we moved up into the top 10 of Kantar for the first time ever on the most recent power rankings. We expect to win with consumers behind the #1 brand in Chicken and win with our customers by being their go-to supplier.And I have confidence in the team that we have in our Chicken business. We have the right strategy and are doing the right things for growth. We continue to implement this strategy and focus on the things that we can control, and we'll build on this strong place -- a strong foundation that we have in place. Now with that, let me stop Ben, and let me flip this to Wes Morris, who leads that Chicken business and that team and let him add some additional color.Wes MorrisBen, thanks for the question. No question, Q2 was tough for us and for the industry as a whole. The combination of grains and markets -- some of the key parts being down as much as 50% and then the ongoing export opportunities. Simply said, versus a year ago, grain up 11%, price up 2% and then $135 million change in derivatives. We did something nobody else though, in the industry has done, growing net sales, 8.4%, volume, 6.4% and improving our capacity, 4%.Based on published data, we competed actually better than an average company in the industry, and we kept investing at the same time. Donnie referenced the $90 million, I'd ask you to think at 2/3 of that as investments in our business going forward. The SKU rationalization and inventory adjustments, along with the packaging and ingredients makes us both more efficient and more consumer-centric at the same time.So let me talk about 4 key areas that my team is focused on and give you some insight into what we got done in the quarter. The 4 key areas of people, service, growth and performance. Our plants were staffed for the entire quarter. Our teams delivered the volume we needed to win with customers and consumers. And we sold everything we processed plus another 100 million pounds. So demand for our products were good in Q2. Our service levels increased 20 points year-over-year, we're back to historical levels of service. We executed very well at the holidays of Super Bowl and March Madness, gaining share in both food service and retail. We continue to invest in Danville, fully-cooked location, which will come on this fall.We're now filling over 99% of what we call our [core 8] retail products. And so winning with consumers and customers at the same time. Donnie referenced the 2 plants we converted in the quarter from bone-in to boneless. And then we announced the closure of 2 facilities, which will improve our efficiency while increasing our volume. And we've seen operational improvements every week in the last quarter and in April. So we're well positioned to win with customers, consumers and drive out cost at the same time going forward.John R. TysonAnd Ben, I want to just pick up on a couple of specific parts of your question there. I think, first off, you're asking, are there further actions that we're contemplating and just to address that directly, we're always looking at the footprint, but everything that we're doing is focused on growing our business today. And I would note that with the 2 announcements we made earlier in the quarter, we're still growing the business. You mentioned inventory too, part of working through, kind of some of the changing market conditions does mean continuing to pull down inventory. And so that will influence the outlook. But you noted correctly from the earlier remarks on kind of moving to breakeven and improving through the back half of the year is what we expect to see in poultry.Benjamin Shelton BienvenuOkay. That's helpful color. Maybe shifting gears a little bit to the Prepared Foods segment. That's been a bright spot certainly for the first half of the fiscal year. The guidance for the balance of the year implies some margin moderation. I know you guys are focused on picking up some food service business that you lost and I think carries some lower margins. Is that key to what's embedded in the operating margin guidance for the balance of the year? And what are the potential sources of upside or downside to that expectation?Stewart F. GlendinningGot it. Let me pick up on that. We're pleased with the overall performance in the first half of the year. And I can see that we're making progress with both of our brands and our operations to improve margins. You're seeing that in the results. You're also -- by the way, you're seeing it in absolute dollars because I think if you looked at the first half this year versus last year, we're up about 10%. So all of that is good news.If -- when you're looking forward, the shape of our year on a quarterly basis will look similar to last year in the sense that we expect a stronger first half than the second half and this is because of 2 things. First, because of normal seasonality in the business; and second, because we expect to have some higher brand investments behind our retail brands in the back half. That's important. Those brands are doing well. They have strong engagement with customers. And I want to make sure that we have continued investment to reinforce that. There is more work to do in food service. And in that space, the customer decision and contract cycles are longer. So it takes a little bit to win back that business. But we have a strong platform. We have good products, and I'm confident we're going to start to see the benefits of that improvement in the future.OperatorOur next question comes from Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs.Adam L. SamuelsonMaybe my first question, just in Beef and taking kind of the revised outlook and it would seem to imply the business is operating kind of breakeven or a loss for the next couple of quarters. And I just want to make sure I'm thinking about that properly in the context of kind of industry packer margins, which, while certainly off their highs, are not negative. And just how do we then think about the implications of that into fiscal '24 and '25 candidly. And is cattle availability is just going to get worse progressively over the next couple of years, given kind of what we know about the cattle herd right now?Donnie D. KingOkay, Adam. Let me -- I'll start off and then I will pass it to Brady for some greater detail around that. But as expected in Beef that there was tightness in cattle [spot], we saw increased live cost and a softer export market. Probably the thing that is most interesting there, and unfortunately, I'm not going to be able to give you the answer to this, but it's around cow and heifer retention and we do have better, faster growing conditions. If you look at Central Texas up to Nebraska, there still needs to be some more moisture. We saw cow harvest towards the end of the quarter began to decline. Some indication of the closure of the liquidation cycle. If you look at heifer feed numbers, we're not in a rebuild phase, just yet. More attention -- more retention is needed on the heifers before we're ready to signal that the rebuild has begun. So with that, Brady, you add some additional color, if you would.Brady StewartThanks, Donnie, and thanks, Adam, for the question. I think there's a few specific call outs relative to standard industry gross margin calculations that we need to take into account during this specific time frame here in '23. And number one is while we still see export demand being relatively strong from a quarter-over-quarter perspective and versus prior periods, the opportunity for us to arbitrage our exports opportunities versus domestic with some cutout runs that have occurred in specific products has actually diminished our opportunity to capture some of those results from a Tyson perspective.Number two is we've seen some pullback on drought credit values and again, versus the previous cattle cycle, we saw drought values are strong. However, from a quarter-over-quarter perspective, again, we saw some pullback as well that certainly impacts some of the calculations relative to gross margin. And number three, from a brand versus choice perspective, we've seen a pullback in USDA data indicates that the spread between branded and choice actually decreased $4.3 hundredweight quarter-over-quarter from a sequential standpoint. So those are certainly some of the factors that are in our mind as we continue to look at the remainder of '23.As we move into 2024 and beyond, in addition to the comments that Donnie made relative to the cycle that we're in, there's reasons for both challenges from an industry perspective relative to gross margin. There's also a reason for us to be optimistic. And number one, we'll absolutely be relentless in terms of operational excellence. And really, it's about Tyson and our team, controlling what we can control. The markets will do their job over time, but we have a world-class Beef business, and the expectation is we'll continue to perform at a very high level as we move through the cycle.Number two is we have the opportunity to get closer to our customers and our consumers. We have capacity within our case-ready and value-added business, we've been working diligently to fill that capacity and feel very good and comfortable in terms of the future of that business to get closer to the consumer as well.So while there are challenges ahead relative to the markets, I feel we're in a very good position to weather those challenges as we move forward.Adam L. SamuelsonOkay. I appreciate that color. And maybe a follow-up for John Randal. You guys don't give a specific EPS or EBITDA guidance, but if I kind of roll through the revised sales outlook and kind of middle of the range on the different operating units, it would seem to imply that by the end of the fiscal year, net debt to EBITDA could be at or above 4x. Just want to get your perspective on -- given kind of your own earnings outlook kind of, if that's actually correct and kind of your comfort level of operating at that place for a period of time, particularly if Beef isn't kind of quickly reversing?John R. TysonYes. Thank you for that question. And let me talk about the outlook and get a little more clarity on that, when we talk about leverage. I'm glad you asked this question. So if you look at the return on sales guidance that we've given kind of on a segment-by-segment basis, it could take a few different shapes. So a point I want to make sure that our listeners take away today is that when we look at a total operating income number for the second half of the year, we expect that to be in aggregate similar to or maybe slightly down compared to the first half of the year. So depending on the different movements within the various core proteins, that's kind of the net of it. We want to make sure lands from an outlook perspective.And as you suggested, that does have implications for what our total leverage ratio as we move into the back half of the year. And what I can say is we're focused in the long run on that 2x number, and I think just pointing to what we've done in the last couple of years, we were diligent in paying off $3 billion worth of debt. We've invested in the business from a growth standpoint, we've got new operations coming online and retail branded chicken, bacon and a lot of growth outside the U.S., aligned with our strategy. So I think while the timing on some of the capital expenditures, for example, kind of puts a pressure on the operating cash flows. I think we're comfortable with where we are and feel good about the outlook.I think that we know there's volatility in our business. Ratings agencies keep up with that. I mean, I can't speak for them this morning, but we're in constant communication, providing them outlooks about the business. So overall, we feel good, but yes, the leverage ratio will pick up for a little while.OperatorOur next question comes from Andrew Strelzik from BMO.Andrew StrelzikI guess I wanted to start on the Chicken side. And I'm curious, kind of philosophically how you're thinking about growth and which is clearly the focus on growing the volumes versus balancing that with kind of the medium-term margin outlook. Have you changed at all your expectations on the back half Chicken volumes that you would expect to realize and just kind of philosophically how you think about that?Wes MorrisAndrew, this is Wes. Thanks for the question. First and foremost, we got to stay focused on our business and our customer expectations. And so we will, in fact, improve our capacity utilization over time. I think it's important to understand that our supply plan is actually our demand plan that we start with the demand plan and work backwards and as we see more demand for our products, we improve our capacity utilization. So hopefully, that answers your question.John R. TysonYes. If I can add to that, though, I think you asked specifically about how do we balance the profitability versus the growth. And what I want to point out is that we've pulled down the total sales outlook for the business, but we're still projecting to grow from a volume standpoint. So I think the Chicken call compared to a quarter ago is still up, but slightly less than what we had initially projected just because of the demand that was referenced.Andrew StrelzikGot it. Okay. That's helpful. And if I could ask one also on productivity, obviously, have achieved the targets well ahead of your original expectations. How are you thinking about the productivity opportunity from here? I know there's a continuous improvement in mindset, but any way to frame kind of how you think about magnitudes of opportunity around productivity.Donnie D. KingWell, thanks for that question. It's still -- as we've said, I mean, we are continually focused on being the absolute best from an operations perspective. We want to be the best company, the best brand, the best protein wherever we choose to play. And what we're doing very simply is executing those things through productivity, through efficiency to deliver that. Some of that requires adding volume, for example, in Chicken. Some of that requires improved yield and labor utilization. It includes -- it also -- looking at the assets that you have and trying to make sure that we modernize those and invest in those and get the right footprint not only today but going forward. We'll do all those things and continue doing all those things. But the whole efficiency-productivity piece is top of mind for everyone in this organization today.OperatorOur next question comes from Alexia Howard from Bernstein.Alexia Jane Burland HowardSticking with Chicken, can I ask about the price -- the market pricing dynamics? I know obviously, last quarter, there was a challenge because there was an excess of chicken -- of fresh chicken flooding the market over the holiday period. I get the point that, that sort of bled into this quarter as well. Is there any visibility into how that might -- whether that might firm up in the second half of the fiscal year? Or where are we in that cycle? And then I have a follow-up.Wes MorrisYes. Sure. This is Wes. I'll answer that. We didn't see a lot of movement in January and February, and we started seeing a little more strength in March, which for us will flow through the next quarter. We have seen some pullet numbers that would indicate a little stronger markets in the back half of the year.Alexia Jane Burland HowardGreat. And then on to the Prepared Foods, with the Kantar PoweRanking study, I'm just wondering what it was that's changed in your retailer relationships because that is a big move. I mean, to get into the top 10, there's a lot of larger, more established, CPG-type companies that are not in the top 10. I'm just wondering what you think has changed over the last couple of years to have got you there.Donnie D. KingThank you, Alexia. Well, first, I would tell you it was on purpose. We talked about very simply -- and the mantra around here is winning with our team members, creating a differentiated place to work, getting happy team members, having fully staffed operations was important and then winning with customers and consumers. We've invested a lot and continue to support customers and consumers with our brands, with innovation, with all those things. We want to be the best or be their go-to supplier in every part of our business.And then finally, and this is kind of where the rubber meets the road, but winning with executional excellence throughout this organization. And it is -- that is the result -- what you're seeing in this survey is a result of the work that this team has done.OperatorOur next question comes from Ken Goldman from JPMorgan.Kenneth B. GoldmanI do appreciate, Donnie, your comments about the macro. Certainly, there's a lot of challenges that everyone is facing. I'm just -- I wanted to ask, it looks to me like, at least for this one quarter sort of the performance gap, as measured by margin did widen a little bit between the industry and Tyson in both Beef packing and in Chicken. I'm just looking at some of your bigger competitors in Chicken, and I'm just looking at sort of HedgersEdge and our own model for Beef margins. So I know those aren't perfect comparisons.But I'm just trying to get a sense of, a, is that how you guys see it as well? Or are my assumptions there wrong? And b, how quickly, if they are right, can we kind of reverse that and you can kind of get back to growing in line or having the margin in line with those kind of major segments.Donnie D. KingSo Ken, I'll start off and then I will flip that to give a little more color from Wes around Chicken and Brady on Beef. But I did talk about the macro a lot. And I got to tell you, it pains me to talk about that because that we've never been able to control macro-economic issues or market conditions. But what I can tell you is we are controlling what we can. And we have a full-court press on being the best that we can be in operational excellence and winning with customers and consumers.But the other thing I would tell you, Ken, is that here at Tyson and as you know, I've been through a number of these cycles before, this company has been -- in its 90-year history, has been through a number of them before. But what we have done in the past, and we're doing this time is we're accelerating in the bottom of this cycle, and we always come out better and stronger. And I see no reason to believe that we won't do that this time as well.And let me flip it to Wes to add some Chicken color.Wes MorrisYes, Ken. I think take into consideration the timing of how our pricing flows through is different than others. We have a further lag. Number two, the $135 million year-over-year derivative change and then the $60 million of the $90 million Donnie talked about in efficiency investment, I believe we competed better than the average in the industry.Kenneth B. GoldmanAll right. If I could ask another quick question. The Williams Sausage acquisition, I think we got a price today in the 10-Q of $200 million to $250 million. Could you give us a little bit of detail on what the expected revenues are, the last 12-month revenues? And sort of why now is the right time to do a deal, given some of the challenges you have in the balance sheet?John R. TysonYes. This is John. Let me say a couple of things on that. First off, let me just make a shot out and thanks to the Williams family who we've got this transaction with, and we're grateful to them for entrusting 60-plus years of a family business to be part of the Tyson family.As it relates to the kind of contours of the transaction, let me answer the question why now. We're always being diligent and thoughtful about the M&amp;A opportunities that we're pursuing. And I think this was a transaction that we got across the finish line based on the characteristics of the branded portfolio and the return profile. So when we close that in the coming months, we're excited to bring that into the Tyson Prepared Foods business.Stewart F. GlendinningYes. Ken, let me just add a little bit here, this is Stewart. Look, this is a company with some great brands and some really great facilities and 2 things are going to come out of this. First, there are capabilities we're going to have because right now, most of our stock harvest goes through a single facility, this is going to provide some redundancy that makes sense for our business, particularly because Jimmy Dean is so important to the portfolio.And then second, when you look at the brands that are going to be complementary to our brands, along with a [DSG] network that, frankly, we haven't had in our portfolio before, I think we're setting up for a very interesting deal here that is going to be a good addition to Tyson.OperatorAnd our next question comes from Peter Galbo from Bank of America.Peter Thomas GalboMaybe we can just start going back off of Ken's question, particularly around Beef. First, I think there's probably been some noise out there in the market that just shifts are being cut across kind of the entire Beef network and some of that maybe is due to the lower kind of harvest levels. But if you can kind of comment there.And then secondly, Brady, I'd just be curious for your perspective, with cattle prices basically at all-time highs, in speaking to cow-calf operators, like what are the unit economics looking for them like in real time? How does that kind of change their decision-making process around retention or not? Because again, looking at the spreadsheet math, you'd think the price would be enough of an incentive, but obviously, a lot of their cost structure has probably changed as well. So I would appreciate any color there.Brady StewartWell, thanks for the question, Peter. First of all, let me address both the question that Ken posed and you posed as well around Beef. And I think there's a few important aspects of Q2 that we need to focus on. So first is relative to timing. Tyson has quarterly pricing that we use for several of our large customers. And so in very specific primal areas where we've seen some inflation from a cutout perspective in those primals quarter-over-quarter, we have a timing lag relative to those specific customers and agreements.Second is we did see some hedging losses in the quarter that impacted performance. Third would be our volume. And so as you mentioned, we did see a decrease relative to volume. And so when we saw that volume -- we lost some volume leverage relative to our cost structure and our assets. We're working diligently from an efficiency perspective and seen some good improvements in that area as well to help offset that as we move forward.As I mentioned earlier, export demand has been softened. The strength of the U.S. dollar and FX has had an impact on some export demand and specifically the substitution products that we see from a domestic portfolio, we're not seeing those large gains as we did in previous quarters. That relative to drop value all go into play in terms of what our actual results are versus some of the index modeling that occurs as well.And relative to the cow-calf operator and how they look at the business, obviously, a lot has changed since the last cycle. Interest rates are up right now. There is some incentives for the cow-calf operator to go ahead and market the heifer into feed yards as opposed to retain just relative to the strength we're seeing from feeder market as well. So we're still seeing some drought conditions from Central Texas up through Central Nebraska, that's creating some challenges, but the good news is for the cow-calf operators that are working outside of that space, we've seen some remedy relative to drought conditions and moisture here within the last several months that provides some optimism as well.Peter Thomas GalboGreat. That's very helpful. And Donnie, I just wanted to go back to one of your comments, I think you did mention, I think, around Chicken that you took some asset impairments in the quarter. I'm not sure that I saw those in the Q. But just maybe thinking on a longer-term basis, look, Chicken has been a business where you've been quite acquisitive. I think the margin profile, self admittedly, has probably been a little bit weaker than you would have thought. Just as we kind of sit here today and go through the balance of the year, like how do we think about further impairment risk in that business particularly as the margin improvement even coming out of this year isn't expected to be kind of at your long-term average.Donnie D. KingThanks for that question. I'll touch on this at a high level. But in terms of your question, for the past few years, we've taken bold and aggressive steps to advance productivity and efficiency. We're constantly evaluating how we can be more efficient, push down decision-making and remove duplication of [flows]. Those are all top of mind today. But we have also have done a number of things looking at our footprint, looking for what it would take to make our less efficient assets -- and this would be across the portfolio. How do we either make them efficient, how do we automate them, how do we redesign them or, in some cases, you could look at how would you sell it or how would you close it? And we look at all those different options.But I want to remind you that our strategy is all about growth. Growth in our base or core protein businesses, growth in our branded portfolio and growth internationally where it makes sense. So making sure that you understand clearly that we are in a growth mode and at the same time, trying to rightsize our footprint in our production machines to deliver those products that customers and consumers love.OperatorAnd our next question comes from Ben Theurer from Barclays.Benjamin M. TheurerJust wanted to come back to Chicken in actually some of the like historic context and ask about your performance particularly as it relates to hatch rates and hatchability because it was interesting in the past, it seems like the performance itself was impacted by the very specific issues you were facing. We saw the industry relatively soft, I would say, in the last couple of weeks, but it feels like that your performance, at least from a volume perspective, has done better. So any comment you can share as to your own initiatives and improving that supply and then ultimately less need to buy outside. How do you feel about this? How was it in the last quarter? And how do you feel about it going forward? That would be my first question. I have a quick follow-up as well.Donnie D. KingOkay. I will start off and then I'll flip it for Wes for even greater level of detail. But I would remind you that a couple of years ago, I outlined a road map for us to, what I would call, restore our Chicken business to its rightful position. Those are my exact -- almost my exact words. And we're still on that road map. We've had bumps along the way, in live production, in the life cycle of the animals that we had some issues with some of the breeding stock, particularly the males are not -- has been well chronicled, everywhere.We had issues with hatch and we're very competitive as it relates to that today. We've made lots of improvement. We've -- we were buying, if you recall, a significant amount of product on the outside and paying a premium in the height of the market. And we began to reduce our dependence on outside meat and wanted to utilize the assets that we have in place and get the fixed cost leverage by producing those live animals and then converting those into those products that our customers and consumers love. And we've done all those things, and we're still on this journey.And I would tell you that we got the right people in place to complete that mission, not that you ever implied, but to continue down the road, a great leadership, a great team in place now to do that. And I'm excited. I'm optimistic about the future of our Chicken business and where it's going and even in this quarter, losing $166 million. I'm still excited about the future of the #1 brand in Chicken and the opportunity that we still have before us. Wes?Wes MorrisYes. Thanks for the question, Ben. The whole industry is not seeing the kind of hatch rates we saw 4 or 5 years ago. Ours, in particular, is down a few points from Q1, but not near the volatility that we're seeing in the industry as a whole. And so we have a more stable, predictable supply chain to include our hatch rate that makes it easier to manage going forward. As for outside buy, we'll continue to buy and grow as we have fluctuations in our demand, but much more imbalanced than in years passed.Benjamin M. TheurerPerfect. And then just a second question just around capital allocation. Obviously, you've reduced the CapEx a little bit, but at the same time, because of the loan, you got a little higher interest. You did some share repurchases throughout the quarter. How should we think about for the balance of the year also in light of what Adam pointed out as leverage could go somewhere north of 4x. How should we think about share purchases, dividends, further CapEx and ultimately, M&amp;A, which is also something that kind of popped up during the quarter. So just to understand the priorities here.John R. TysonYes. Sure thing, and thanks for the question. Let me just talk about the priorities and then talk about where we are in the year and what the outlook is. So first and foremost, we're always looking to invest in our business. And I think it's important to recognize that the CapEx deployment wave that we're in right now is typically higher than our historical average. Over the long run, something more like $1.5 billion is what we would target on an annual CapEx number. So I think that as we go into the coming years, we'll trend in that direction.And then we look at strategic M&amp;A where we can. We've been pretty, I think, thoughtful in that approach. We're really pleased about the Williams deal and see that as a valuable part of investing in our business. And then on the returning cash to shareholders, we remain committed to the dividend and share repurchases, I think, we'll continue to be conservative and look at something that's in line with historical norms. Obviously, there are a lot of different variables that go into that on a quarterly or annual basis as we make those choices.But yes, I think just where we are with the profitability outlook in the business, kind of the CapEx cycle and the borrowing, we're conscious of and aware that our leverage ratio will tick up. But again, we're kind of making choices and decisions around investments for the long term of this business. So we're comfortable, although we don't like the tick up. We're comfortable with these cycles where leverage ratios may be a little bit elevated compared to our longer-term target.OperatorAnd our next question comes from Michael Lavery from Piper Sandler.Michael Scott LaveryI just wanted to come back to the idea of growth versus profitability and just how to think about balancing that, not just for one segment, but broadly, and I guess just with so many of the headwinds you're pointing to broad in the macro environment and without really much change ahead in terms of -- it sounded like it's going to get better very soon, does that impact how you think about maybe different priorities to improve profitability? Or just to make sure the margins come through better as much as you have some things you can control? Or what's the right way to think about some of that in terms of just -- any investment trade-offs or ways to maybe improve the execution a little bit?Donnie D. KingYes. Thanks for that question. And first thing I would tell you is that just to acknowledge the macro environment and what it's been and the fact that the magnitude and the duration of the challenges, they do continue. However, if you think about this company, in particular, we've had a 90-year history of successfully managing macroeconomic cycles, and we've always come out stronger. We have never been able to control those cycles and what we can do is control what we can control. And there's a lot of opportunity there for us to be better. And we are obviously focused on that and across all businesses and functions.In terms of growth at any cost, that's not what we're talking about here. The growth that we have is in service to our customers and those consumers. And I think as Wes had mentioned this earlier, that we always start with the demand plan, and we work back to a supply plan and so we wouldn't be growing Chicken, Beef or Pork or Prepared Foods for that matter, if we didn't have a demand plan that says that we have a consumer wanting this.And then the second part of that is we obviously had no intention of just growing for growth's sake, and -- but we always balance growth with profitability, and I wouldn't expect this time to be any different than that. But we see this as -- this cycle as something we've seen before, and we've always accelerated out of these types of cycles, and we -- in a growth pattern, accelerating out of the curve, if you will and that's what we're doing this time as well.John R. TysonAnd I think if I can add on to what Donnie is saying, just to emphasize growth and the focus on high-quality growth. We've just completed a fifth consecutive quarter of record sales growth. The same is true for the Chicken segment and the Prepared Foods segment. And we're growing in the parts of those businesses that we see as attractive from a margin standpoint.And of course, in poultry, as we've talked about, part of that has to do a little bit with just you getting the capacity utilization footprint back, right? And then it's also worth pointing out that we got a business outside of the U.S. that is trending towards tripling in about 5 years. And so I think as we think about the long term, that becomes a profit engine for us, and we're excited about the investments we've made there as well.OperatorAnd ladies and gentlemen, with that, we'll be ending today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Donnie King for any closing remarks.Donnie D. KingThank you. And as you've heard today, this is a challenging moment, but my optimism about the future has not changed. Our customers and consumers are behind us. We're winning with both. This is not an accident, but is a result of the hard work our team members do every day. And I thank them for it. As we continue to build a world-class organization positioned to take advantage of the opportunities in front of us, we remain confident that our strategy will deliver long-term growth and shareholder value. Thanks for your interest in Tyson Foods, and we look forward to speaking soon.OperatorLadies and gentlemen, the conference has now concluded. We thank you for attending today's presentation.

Producer prices, weekly jobless claims and consumer sentiment data are all lined up for the week.The data this week should help investors gauge whether the Federal Reserve's aggressive tightening cycle - including its most recent 25 basis point hike last week - is helping tamp down inflation as well as whether fears of stagflation are founded.Story continues""The bigger picture is inflation will remain higher for longer and that we are heading into a recession,"" Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities.""Whether that's hard or soft remains to be seen, but until there's something to disprove that bigger picture thesis, the overall market is going to remain somewhat range bound.""A rally in regional banks' shares proved short-lived, with PacWest Bancorp paring gains to 3.65% after a surge of as much as about 30% earlier in the session after the lender sharply cut its quarterly dividend to boost capital.Shares of regional banks tumbled for much of last week on worries tied to the collapse of First Republic Bank.""We've had some stabilization in the stocks of middle market banks today because people are realizing prices were moving counter to where the fundamentals actually were,"" said Carol Schleif, chief investment officer for BMO Family Office.Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc's Class B shares rose 0.70% after posting a $35.5 billion first-quarter profit, boosted by gains from stocks such as Apple.Shares of Zscaler Inc rose 20.63% after the cloud security company raised its annual forecast.Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.14-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.07-to-1 ratio favored decliners.The S&amp;P 500 posted 12 new 52-week highs and 7 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 66 new highs and 96 new lows.(Reporting by Shreyashi Sanyal and Shristi Achar in Bengaluru; Editing by Nivedita Bhattacharjee, Maju Samuel and Deepa Babington)]"

We have Tyson, Six Flags, and Zscaler. Let's kick it off with Tyson here.Shares are plunging today, hitting the lowest level that we've seen since the start of the pandemic. We're looking at losses of just over 17%. Now the move lower coming after the meat producer cut its guidance for the year, higher cost, declining consumer demand.Two big reasons for this here-- chicken, pork, and beef divisions all facing challenges. Clearly a tough time here for Tyson. It was Tyson's first quarterly loss since 2009.The headwinds could likely persist here for some time. We've got some commentary on the earnings call here. CFO John Tyson telling analysts that this is going to be the case, at least for the remainder of the year. Over the past year, we're looking at losses of just over 44% at Kiko here. So the fact that business might not be improving anytime soon clearly worrisome here for the company.- Yeah, no question about that. It really is all about protein for Tyson. And chicken just is not doing well right now when you think about commodity prices there.A few things here, you point to the rising cost here, the cost of feed rising from a year ago. They've also highlighted concerns around the avian flu too, saying key export markets remain closed. So some really, really tough headwinds there for the company.We should say they've said, look, there's-- well, the protein market is challenged. They've got other areas they can focus on. These all strong performance in their branded food business but no way to really slice it here. When you think about Tyson, it is all about chicken and meat. And that just simply isn't doing well right now.- Exactly, Kiko, and it's interesting to see that sort of being projected out for the entire year. And I think that was kind of the key point to highlight here. Also stagnant demand for pork, I don't know about you guys, maybe we'll get some deals on pork, personally a fan of pork. I know that's surprising.[INTERPOSING VOICES]- Those prices have been coming down, though, it said, to some extent. So maybe-- it's cheaper than chicken. But the other thing too I think, to point out, there when we think about earnings as a whole-- and JJ Kinahan was pointing this out this morning --when you think about Tyson's earnings is we haven't had a lot of retail earnings yet either. And as the story shifts in earnings season here, what we see for overall outlook moving forward in these different style companies that are reporting now, we're moving away from tech earnings now and getting back into what the consumer has to say. So we've seen these earnings beat but maybe that story will change as we look at the different companies over the next couple of weeks.]"

The COVID-19 crisis accelerated the adoption of digital and contactless solutions, providing an opportunity for MA's business to expedite its shift to the digital mode.Mastercard is well-poised to gain from steady cash-generating abilities. A strong capital position allows it to pursue acquisitions and prudently deploy capital.However, steep operating expenses might stress margins. High rebates and incentives may weigh on the company's net revenues. Its dividend yield is still lower than the industry average. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.(You can read the full research report on Mastercard here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Coca-Cola have gained +1.4% over the year-to-date period against the Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry’s gain of +10.3%.

T-Mobile plans to reach 300 million people within 2023. It intends to bring more competition to home broadband, especially in underserved rural markets.However, T-Mobile operates in a fiercely competitive and almost saturated U.S. telecom market, which lowers its growth potential to some extent.

AFRM is set to report its third-quarter fiscal 2023 results on May 9, after the closing bell.Important EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter fiscal 2023 loss per share of 91 cents suggests a 379% plunge from the prior-year loss of 19 cents. The estimate remained stable over the past week. The consensus estimate for third-quarter fiscal 2023 revenues of $366.9 million indicates a 3.4% increase from the year-ago reported figure.Affirm beat on earnings in one of the trailing four quarters and missed thrice, the average negative surprise being 0.1%. This is depicted in the graph below.Affirm Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseAffirm Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseAffirm Holdings, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Affirm Holdings, Inc. QuoteBefore we get into what to expect for the to-be-reported quarter in detail, it’s worth taking a look at AFRM’s previous-quarter performance first.Q2 Earnings RewindIn the last reported quarter, this leading payment network’s adjusted loss per share of $1.10 missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8.9%, primarily due to increased operating costs. This was partially offset by growing transactions and a significant increase in servicing income.Now, let’s see how things have shaped up prior to the third-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings announcement.Q3 Factors to NoteResilient consumer spending in the March quarter despite inflationary pressures is expected to have benefited the payment solution provider. Travel and entertainment-related spending is expected to have risen in the quarter under review. This, in turn, is likely to have augmented the strength of active merchants and consumers.The sales figures from the virtual card networks are anticipated to have risen. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for virtual card network revenues is pegged at $25.8 million, indicating an 11.3% year-over-year rise.The consensus mark for interest income in the fiscal third quarter is pegged at $166.1 million, indicating a 23.4% jump from the previous fiscal-year quarter’s $134.6 million. These are expected to have positioned the company for year-over-year growth in the fiscal third-quarter top line.Story continuesThe positives are likely to have been partially offset by lower servicing income, merchant network revenues and higher operating costs. The consensus mark for servicing income indicates a 2.3% year-over-year fall. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for gain on sales of loans suggests a 10.1% year-over-year decline.Moreover, the consensus estimate for merchant network revenues is pegged at $111.4 million, indicating a decrease of 8% from a year ago. Reductions in the concentration of certain APR loans are expected to have affected the metric.Also, operating costs are likely to have increased in the quarter under review, affecting the bottom line. Higher processing and servicing costs, as a result of increased volumes, are anticipated to have boosted the operating costs, reducing profits and making an earnings beat uncertain.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Affirm this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Earnings ESP: The company currently has an Earnings ESP of -23.08%. This is because the Most Accurate Estimate currently stands at a loss of $1.12 per share, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 91 cents.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Affirm currently carries a Zacks Rank #2.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.How Other Stocks PerformedHere are some companies from the Business Services space that have already reported earnings for the March quarter. These include Mastercard Incorporated MA, Visa Inc. V and The Western Union Company WU.Mastercard reported first-quarter 2023 adjusted earnings of $2.80 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.3%. The quarterly results were driven by improved cross-border travel, coupled with an expanding payment network and value-added services and solutions. However, the upside was partly offset by the company’s escalating operating expense level.Visa reported second-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings of $2.09 per share, which outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.97. The quarterly results were aided by higher payments, and cross-border volumes and processed transactions. Steady cross-border travel growth and lower-than-expected client incentives aided the results, partially offset by higher costs.Western Union reported first-quarter 2023 earnings per share of 43 cents, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 30.3%. WU’s earnings were supported by the strength witnessed in the Middle East business, Evolve 2025’s momentum, lower consumer acquisition costs and transaction growth. However, adverse currency impact, discontinuation of operations across Russia and Belarus and promotional pricing activities partially offset the positives.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

144,48f5a5bc-a7ea-37be-bc0e-0e9ee4e5037e,MA,2023-05-09,Brokers Suggest Investing in MasterCard (MA): Read This Before Placing a Bet,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/brokers-suggest-investing-mastercard-ma-133001558.html,1683552601,STORY,['MA'],"[When deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock, investors often rely on analyst recommendations. Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about MasterCard (MA) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.MasterCard currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.21, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 24 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.21 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 24 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 20 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 83.3% and 12.5% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for MABroker Rating Breakdown Chart for MACheck price target &amp; stock forecast for MasterCard here&gt;&gt;&gt;The ABR suggests buying MasterCard, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.Zacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABRAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Is MA Worth Investing In?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for MasterCard, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 1% over the past month to $12.26.Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for MasterCard. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for MasterCard may serve as a useful guide for investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

146,564fa82c-0a1e-3865-bf57-5dd2a11e5062,QCOM,2023-05-09,World Intellectual Property Day 2023: Women and Other Underrepresented Innovators Are the Backbone of a Diverse Patent Universe,ACCESSWIRE,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/world-intellectual-property-day-2023-141000193.html,1683555000,STORY,['QCOM'],"[NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / May 8, 2023 / Qualcomm:OnQ BlogEvery year on April 26, World Intellectual Property Day reminds us of the importance of inventing - and the diverse community of creators who drive breakthrough innovations. It's certainly a day to celebrate, as nothing conveys optimism like the act of creating something new. But innovation cannot occur in a vacuum. To flourish, it requires two things: a continually replenished pool of innovators and a robust legal system to protect their inventions. Here at Qualcomm, we know that the protection of intellectual property (IP) through a strong patent system lies at the heart of our success. At the same time, we are striving to grow and diversify the universe of patent holders to include historically underrepresented groups - including women.By protecting and rewarding innovation, IP laws shape our lives for the better. Patent licensing plays a key role in spurring innovation, giving inventors of all backgrounds the incentive they need to create, finance their research, and make their ideas commercially viable. At Qualcomm, our philosophy is to continually innovate and create a foundation upon which others can build and succeed. Licensing our IP is an integral part of this approach. It democratizes innovation, taking cutting-edge inventions and making them accessible to a broad range of players across industries.That said, it's equally imperative that the population of inventors continually grows. Recognition of this is implicit in the theme of World IP Day 2023, ""Women and IP: Accelerating innovation and creativity."" Everyone should have the opportunity to invent and patent their ideas. Not only do more diverse inventor communities result in more varied problem-solving but breaking down barriers creates more - and better - innovation. It results in more jobs, boosts the global economy, closes wage and wealth gaps, and yields new ways to improve society.Story continuesA recent global report from the World Intellectual Property Organization showed that women are still gravely underrepresented in IP ownership around the world; they often face significant challenges in accessing the knowledge, skills, resources, and support they need to thrive. That is why we are proud to work with Invent Together in initiatives such as The Inventor's Patent Academy. This is a free online learning platform designed to guide inventors through the benefits of patenting and the process of obtaining a patent - particularly for historically underrepresented groups in the patent-heavy sciences and engineering fields. In addition to women, these groups include people of color, LGBTQIA+, people from lower-income communities, and people with disabilities.True innovation depends on diversity. World-class research and development (R&amp;D) teams who have a broad wealth of backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives play a critical role in ensuring that our - and everyone's - products live up to their potential. We encourage and celebrate innovation across all backgrounds, from school-aged children who participate in our Thinkabit Lab programs across the country, to our engineers who receive special recognition for patenting their inventions, to participants in our Female Founders Summit start-up competition.For centuries, the American patent system has served as a model for strong IP rights. According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, intellectual property in the U.S. supports more than 45 million jobs and contributes over $6.6 trillion to the nation's economy. IP-intensive industries have become the backbone of our economy. It is critically important to protect the fundamentals of the system that makes this all possible. And it will go a long way towards preserving our status as the world's preeminent innovation economy.Qualcomm is first and foremost an innovation company. In order to continue funding our R&amp;D, we patent our inventions and license them to companies in several industries who incorporate those inventions into their products, including mobile, automotive, and the Internet of Things (IoT). Today, we hold over 140,000 patents and pending applications, and our patent portfolio is the most widely and extensively licensed in the wireless industry, with over 300 companies licensed.But we cannot do it alone. World IP Day gives us the opportunity to reflect on how patent protections have driven economic growth and job creation in the U.S. and around the world. Countries with strong IP systems have higher levels of foreign investment, more innovation, increased R&amp;D activity, higher percentages of workers employed in good-paying jobs, and greater potential to produce and export complex, knowledge-intensive products. If we keep IP protections strong and ensure that the pool of inventors continues to grow and diversify, we best position society to reap the global benefits of innovation.Qualcomm, Monday, May 8, 2023, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Qualcomm on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: QualcommWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/qualcommEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: QualcommView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/753458/World-Intellectual-Property-Day-2023-Women-and-Other-Underrepresented-Innovators-Are-the-Backbone-of-a-Diverse-Patent-Universe]"

While the holidays are typically more expensive for travel, you might be able to save some money by avoiding purchasing flights on the wrong day of the week.I’m a Self-Made Millionaire: Here Are 5 Stocks I’m Never SellingLearn: How To Invest In GoldThere are some long-standing myths in the travel industry about the best day to search for flight deals, but less know that there are days where flights may be more expensive.We’ve reviewed data from Google Flights and a study from Expedia to find out if there really are worse days to buy tickets than others. Here’s what we’ve found.Best Day To Buy Airline Tickets: SundayExpedia analyzed millions of flights and airfare data and found that booking a flight on a Sunday could save you up to 15% on your total airfare. The data showed that booking on a Sunday versus a Friday yielded 5% cheaper airfare on domestic flights, and 15% savings on international flights.And while waiting to book could yield you some savings, you might be better off searching your route on Google Flights, Kayak, Hopper, or another travel service, and setting an alert to track prices for those dates. This ensures that you receive a message if the price rises or drops, and if it drops, you can quickly book it to lock in a low fare.In addition, there are no guarantees that you will get a lower price when booking on Sunday versus any other day of the week. Airline ticket prices are far more fluid and can even change by the hour. Your best bet is to start searching early to find better deals, no matter the day of the week.I’m a Millionaire: Why I’m Not Passing Generational Wealth to My KidsDon’t Buy Tickets on FridayWhile cheaper flights can be found by booking at the end of the weekend, shopping for flights on a Friday could end up costing you more. You might pay 5% – 15% more, depending on the flight.Friday is notorious for last-minute travel bookings for an upcoming weekend. And business travelers are getting their flights booked for the next week as well. This increase in demand may be the reason for the increase in airfare prices.Story continuesIf you happen to be booking airfare on a Friday, try to avoid booking unless your flights are at least days away, as Expedia’s study shows that airfare is lower for flights booked at least a month out.More Ways To Save on Airline TicketsWhile booking flights on Sunday can be an easy way to save a few bucks, there are some other ways to save big money on your next airfare purchase:Fly on Wednesday. According to the Expedia study, scheduling your departing flight on a Wednesday versus a Sunday or Monday can save you up to 15% on domestic travel, and up to 10% on international flights.Book at least one month out (domestic flights). If you are booking a flight within the U.S., book at least one month out to save on airfare. According to the study, the “sweet spot” for booking domestic flights is from 28 – 35 days out. And booking between 3.5 months and 6 months in advance will actually cost you more.Book at least six months out (international flights). International flights require booking much further in advance, and those who book about six months out can save around 10% versus those who book within two months of departure.Travel during “off-peak” dates. Booking a summer vacation to Disney or winter getaway to Hawaii is guaranteed to cost you more. If you can travel during “off-peak” season to your destination, you could save hundreds of dollars on airfare. Some airlines even have set dates for “off-peak” travel to certain destinations.Be flexible with your dates. If you can be flexible with your travel dates, you might be able to save a LOT on airline tickets. A simple look at Google Flights lets you view an airfare calendar, and you can quickly see that departing a few days earlier, or arriving a few days later can save big money. If you are flexible, you will have the best chance for cheaper airline tickets.Use a travel alert. Apps like Google Flights, Expedia, Hopper, and Kayak allow you to set travel alerts for your travel dates and destinations, letting you track the airfare prices for your trip. This can alert you when a screaming deal pops up, letting you quickly book a cheaper flight.Use points and miles. If you want to avoid most of the cost of airfare altogether, consider using airline miles or credit card points to book flights. Many credit cards offer generous sign-up bonuses that can net you tens of thousands of airline miles or points, which can be used to book flights. This can save you hundreds (or even thousands) of dollars, but you do need to know how the points work to get the best value.Bottom LineBooking on Friday will cost you more, and booking on Sunday can save you up to 15% on your airline tickets. But there are tons of ways to save even more on airline tickets instead of just waiting until Sunday to book your flights.While statistically, prices are lower when you avoid booking flights on Friday, it doesn’t guarantee it will work for you. Your best bet for cheap flights is to avoid booking last-minute, set travel alerts, and fly mid-week for the best deals.More From GOBankingRatesWhat a Comfortable Retirement Will Cost You in Each State19 Dangerous Scam Phone Numbers and Area Codes To Avoid3 Ways to Recession Proof Your Retirement48 Easy Things You Can Do To Live Better and Save MoneyThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Don’t Buy Airline Tickets on Fridays – Here’s Why]"

Frankly, it’s getting a little bit toasty on Wall Street, which is why stability may come at a premium.Naturally, the failure of First Republic – the third such collapse of a banking enterprise this year – generated plenty of jitters. Despite JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon’s encouraging words that the FRC takeover averted a crisis, circumstances still appear bleak. Add on various geopolitical events that may influence the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy and you have brewing skepticism.That’s not to say that the so-called blue-chip stocks 2023 provide all the answers. However, these industry stalwarts enjoy business predictability. Therefore, you’re more likely to win with these enterprises, even if the magnitude of victory may be limited. Remember, sometimes you just need to live for another day. Therefore, check out these blue-chip growth stocks.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsLMTLockheed Martin$451.93AMGNAmgen$231.89SNYSanofi$54.73VZVerizon$37.35SHELShell$59.34QCOMQualcomm$106.58TSMTaiwan Semiconductor$83.49Lockheed Martin (LMT)a bull next to a stack of blue gambling chips to represent blue-chip stocks, blue-chip stocks to buySource: ShutterstockThough Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) easily ranks among the best blue-chip stocks to buy, this narrative has always been controversial. And in the past year-and-a-half period, this narrative has become explosively cynical. For our purposes today, I’m not even going to touch the subject that’s on everyone’s mind. Instead, I think it’s useful for investors to consider the company’s relevance in the space economy.Fundamentally, Lockheed focuses on developing next-generation technologies, which include designing, building, and testing lunar and deep-space exploration capabilities. As Morgan Stanley analysts stated, the broader space economy could become a $1 trillion ecosystem by 2040.Story continuesFinancially, Lockheed compels because of its steady three-year revenue growth rate of 5.8%. As well, the enterprise benefits from consistent profitability. Notably, its trailing-year net margin comes in at 8.6%, above 72.63% of sector players. Finally, analyst peg LMT as a consensus hold. However, their average price target is $495.08, implying over 9% upside potential.Amgen (AMGN)A close-up shot of a blue casino chip on red carpet.Source: ShutterstockAn American multinational biopharmaceutical firm, Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) is one of the best in the business. At the time of writing, AMGN carries a market cap of $122.53 billion. Since the beginning of this year, AMGN gave up over 12% of its equity value. And in the trailing one-year period, it slipped about 3%. Nevertheless, this may be one of the discounted blue-chip stocks to buy.Right now, the market prices AMGN at a forward multiple of 13.18. As a discount to projected earnings, Amgen ranks better than 62% of companies in the drug manufacturing industry. Also, AMGN trades at 16.39 times free cash flow. In contrast, the sector median stat comes out to a loftier 23.3 times.To be fair, Amgen doesn’t have the greatest strengths in the balance sheet, particularly with its ultra-low equity-to-asset ratio of 0.06. However, it enjoys a robust trailing-year net margin of 30.23%. Lastly, covering analysts peg AMGN as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target lands at $259.46, implying over 13% upside potential.Sanofi (SNY)blue chip definition highlightedSource: ShutterstockA French multinational pharmaceutical and healthcare giant, Sanofi (NASDAQ:SNY) covers seven major therapeutic areas: cardiovascular, central nervous system, diabetes, internal medicine, oncology, thrombosis, and vaccines. At the time of writing, Sanofi carries a market cap of $141 billion. Since the Jan. opener, SNY gained nearly 11% of its equity value. With a solid performance, SNY ranks among the best blue-chip stocks to buy.Even better, SNY also makes a case for blue-chip value stocks. Currently, the market prices SNY at a forward multiple of 11.84. As a discount to projected earnings, Sanofi ranks better than 68.22% of companies listed in the drug manufacturing industry. Also, SNY trades at 14.89 times FCF. As stated earlier, the sector median stat is 23.3. Fundamentally, Sanofi offers a tad more encouragement because of its relatively stable balance sheet. Also, it enjoys a net margin of 18.44%, outpacing 87.68% of its peers.To close out, analysts peg SNY as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target comes out to $62, implying over 14% upside potential.Verizon (VZ)a pile of blue chips on top of a newspaperSource: ShutterstockA telecommunications conglomerate, Verizon (NYSE:VZ) seemingly benefits from its massive footprint and compelling initiatives, such as the 5G rollout. However, circumstances haven’t been the most auspicious for the telecom giant recently. Since the Jan. opener, VZ stock slipped more than 5%. Over the past 365 days, VZ gave up more than 21% of its market value.To be completely upfront, investment resource Gurufocus warns its readers that VZ could be a possible value trap. Further, its recent tepid financial results suggest rising competition and a tough economic backdrop. On paper, though, VZ trades at a forward multiple of 8.08. As a discount to projected earnings, Verizon ranks better than 85.44% of telecom competitors.Operationally, Verizon prints a three-year revenue growth rate of 13.5%, above 72.19% of sector rivals. Also, its net margin is an impressive 15.85%. Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg VZ as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $44.50, implying over 17% upside potential. Thus, it makes for a decent candidate for blue-chip growth stocks.Shell (SHEL)Source: ShutterstockA British multinational oil and gas company, Shell (NYSE:SHEL) represents one of the biggest oil firms in the world. On paper, SHEL makes a ready case for the best blue-chip stocks to buy. Unfortunately, economic headwinds – particularly recessionary fears – have stymied the enterprise. Still, geopolitical dynamics may send hydrocarbon energy prices higher, making SHEL worth consideration.Additionally, SHEL makes a solid case for blue-chip value stocks. Right now, the market prices SHEL at a trailing multiple of 5.12. As a discount to earnings, Shell ranks better than 66.27% of companies listed in the oil and gas industry. Also, SHEL trades at 0.54 times trailing sales. In contrast, the sector median stat is 0.91 times. On the bottom line, Shell carries a net margin of 11.04%, above nearly 64% of its rivals. Also, its return on equity (ROE) is 23.39%, indicating a high-quality enterprise.Looking to the Street, analysts peg SHEL as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target comes in at $71.61, implying over 22% upside potential.Qualcomm (QCOM)10 Small-Cap Stocks to Buy Before They Grow UpSource: ShutterstockA multinational technology firm, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) creates semiconductors, software, and services related to wireless technology. Notably, it owns critical patents in mobile communications technologies such as 5G. At the time of writing, Qualcomm carries a market cap of $125.81 billion. Since the start of the year, QCOM gained over 5% of its equity value.One of the more undervalued best blue-chip stocks to buy, the market prices QCOM at a forward multiple of 12.22. As a discount to projected earnings, Qualcomm ranks better than 78.36% of companies listed in the semiconductor space. Also, QCOM trades at 15.89 times FCF. In contrast, the sector median is 23.62 times. Operationally, Qualcomm prints a three-year revenue growth rate of 25%, ranked above 78.55% of sector rivals. It also makes shares a compelling idea among blue-chip growth stocks.Lastly, analysts peg QCOM as a consensus moderate buy. Overall, their average price target hits $140, implying slightly over 24% growth potential.Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM)Source: ShutterstockA multinational semiconductor located in its namesake country, Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) may give some investors jitters due to the underlying sensitive geopolitical tension. Still, for those willing to take a chance, TSM ranks among the best blue-chip stocks to buy. Fundamentally, Taiwan Semiconductor is the world’s most valuable chip-manufacturing enterprise. Since the Jan. opener, TSM gained nearly 12% of its equity value.An enticing opportunity, the market prices TSM at a forward multiple of 16.13. As a discount to projected earnings, Taiwan Semiconductor ranks better than 64.18% of the field. Also, TSM trades at 8.06 times the operating cash flow. In contrast, the sector median stat is much loftier 15.47 times. Conspicuously, the company features a three-year revenue growth rate of 28.4%, outflanking 82.47% of its peers. Therefore, it’s a strong case for blue-chip growth stocks. Also, the semiconductor specialist prints an FCF growth rate of 53% during the same period.On a final note, analysts peg TSM as a unanimous strong buy.

152,40513e89-4d94-38d9-9d97-321c0c28f3bd,PHM,2023-05-09,5 Dividend Growth Stocks to Buy for Safe Returns,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-dividend-growth-stocks-buy-121512672.html,1683548112,STORY,"['GWW', 'BYD', 'NOVN.SW', 'PHM', 'NVS']","[Wall Street is caught in feeble trading triggered by an uncertain Fed policy, growing geopolitical tensions and recession fears. This has compelled investors to look for safe and defensive bets, thus raising the appeal for dividend investing. In fact, applying some smart-beta strategies to the dividend investing world could fetch higher returns.This is because the strategy helps to capture market inefficiencies in a transparent way by adding extra metrics like volatility, revenues, earnings, momentum and other fundamental factors to the market cap or rules-based indices. And nothing seems better than picking the dividend growth strategy.We have selected five dividend growth stocks — PulteGroup Inc. PHM, Novartis NVS, Boyd Gaming Corporation BYD, Cummins CMI, and W.W. Grainger Inc. GWW — that could be solid choices for your portfolio.Why Dividend Growth Strategy?Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market, and thus act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility. At the same time, these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.Additionally, these stocks have superior fundamentals that make dividend growth a quality and promising investment for the long term. These include a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics. Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that a dividend increase is likely in the future.Moreover, a history of dividend growth year over year leads to a healthy portfolio with a greater scope of capital appreciation as opposed to simple dividend paying stocks or those with high yields. Although these stocks do not necessarily have the highest yields, they have outperformed for a longer period than the broader stock market or any other dividend-paying stock.As a result, picking dividend growth stocks appear as winning strategies when some other parameters are also included.5-Year Historical Dividend Growth greater than zero: This selects stocks with a solid dividend growth history.5-Year Historical Sales Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a strong record of growing revenues.5-Year Historical EPS Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a solid earnings growth history.Next 3-5 Year EPS Growth Rate greater than zero: This represents the rate at which a company’s earnings are expected to grow. Improving earnings should help companies sustain dividend payments.Price/Cash Flow less than M-Industry: A ratio less than M-industry indicates that the stock is undervalued in that industry and that an investor needs to pay less for better cash flow generated by the company.52-Week Price Change greater than S&amp;P 500 (Market Weight): This ensures that the stock appreciated more than the S&amp;P 500 over the past year.Top Zacks Rank: Stocks having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and 2 (Buy) generally outperform their peers in all types of market environment.Growth Score of B or better: Our research shows that stocks with a Growth Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.Just these few criteria narrowed down the universe from over 7,700 stocks to just 20.Here are five of the 20 stocks that fit the bill:Atlanta-based PulteGroup is engaged in homebuilding and financial services businesses, primarily in the United States. The company saw a solid earnings estimate revision of $1.34 over the past 30 days for this year and delivered an average earnings surprise of 15.6% over the past four quarters.PulteGroup carries a Zacks Rank #1 and has a Growth Score of B. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Switzerland-based Novartis has one of the strongest and broadest portfolios of oncology drugs and generics, which has enabled it to maintain its dominant position as a top pharma company over the years. The company saw a solid earnings estimate revision of nine cents over the past 30 days for this year, with estimated growth of 9.2%.At present, NVS has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and a Growth Score of B.Las Vegas-based Boyd Gaming is a multi-jurisdictional gaming company.

Baxter had a market value of $19 billion and total debt of $16.6 billion, as of Dec. 31.Baxter estimates the transaction will reduce the company's earnings by about $0.10 per share in the fourth quarter.The medical device maker's biopharma solutions unit supports drugmakers in the formulation, development and commercialization of drugs typically given by infusion or injection, such as vaccines.Through the deal, Advent International and Warburg Pincus will gain access to Baxter BioPharma solutions' manufacturing facilities and about 1,700 employees in Bloomington, Indiana and Halle, Germany.Private-equity firms have increasingly been investing in the drug development sector, which was deemed as risky, by coming up with deals that compensate them for the uncertainty involved.Through the deal with Baxter, which is expected to close in the second half of 2023, the private-equity firms hope to strengthen their presence in the contract drug manufacturing space.(Reporting by Khushi Mandowara and Bhanvi Satija in Bengaluru; Editing by Krishna Chandra Eluri)]"

The company witnessed strength across all geographies with China remained a solid contributor with very high single-digit growth in the quarter. The raised revenues 2023 outlook buoys optimism.

In that report, analysts expect Medtronic to post earnings of $1.56 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 2.63%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $8.25 billion, up 1.98% from the prior-year quarter.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Medtronic should also be noted by investors.

From diagnostic systems like MRIs and CAT scans to high-tech glucose monitoring systems to devices that destroy tumors, medicine makes use of many such technologies. Companies that develop technologies for the healthcare sector are referred to as healthtech companies. In this column, I will provide information about three of the best healthtech stocks available, focusing on companies that have developed non-drug technologies to combat or diagnose diseases.Another major trend in medicine is digital health. According to the FDA, “digital health technologies use computing platforms, connectivity, software, and sensors for health care and related uses.”The three names that I will discuss are also digital health stocks.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsMedtronic (MDT)Medtronic (MDT) sign outside office building representing healthcare stocksSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comMedtronic (NYSE:MDT) is one of the world’s top medical device makers.In the last 18 months, the company has launched a number of new, very promising products. On May 1, the FDA approved two of MDT’s “leadless pacemakers,” called Micra AV2 and Micra VR2. According to the company, the devices are “the world’s smallest pacemakers, provide longer battery life and easier programming than prior Micra pacemakers, while still delivering the many benefits of leadless pacing such as reduced complications compared to traditional pacemakers.” Given these devices’ many important, competitive advantages, they should boost MDT’s financial results going forward.Moreover, as I noted in a previous column, the company has launched “a robot that helps perform surgeries” using artificial intelligence. Speaking to an analyst on March 10, MDT CFO Karen Parkhill said that Hugo is “going to be a strong contributor to our revenue growth for many years to come. ”Also likely to boost Medtronic are a few moves by Washington on the diabetes front. First, the FDA last month eliminated restrictions that it had imposed on MDT’s insulin pumps. Secondly, the agency approved the company’s new insulin pump.Story continuesFinally, Medtronic, which markets continuous glucose-monitoring systems, should be boosted by a recent decision by Medicare to cover the cost of such systems for some diabetes patients who don’t receive daily insulin injections.Dexcom (DXCM)Dexcom (DXCM) logo on an app store page on a mobile phoneSource: FOOTAGE VECTOR PHOTO / Shutterstock.comDexcom’s (NASDAQ:DXCM) main business is marketing continuous glucose monitors, including its Dexcom G7, which “delivers real-time glucose numbers to [patients’] smartphone[s].” As a result, Dexcom should benefit from Medicare’s recent decision “to cover the cost of such systems for some diabetes patients who don’t receive daily insulin injections.”Indeed, the company cited the new coverage rules, along with its strong first-quarter results, as the reasons for its decision to raise its 2023 sales guidance on April 27. Specifically, DXCM increased its full-year top-line outlook to $3.4 billion to $3.52 billion from $3.35 billion to $3.49 billion. Given how widespread diabetes is and the importance of Medicare coverage for selling devices, I think that the guidance will probably end up being conservative.In Q1, Dexcom’s top line climbed 18% year over year to $741.5 million, while its operating income, excluding some items, increased 2.6 percentage points YOY.UBS responded to the Q1 results by increasing its price target on the shares to $150 from $142 while keeping a “buy” rating on the name. The bank expects the company to deliver “beat and raise” quarterly results “throughout the year.”GE HealthCare Technologies (GEHC)GE Healthcare (GEHC) sign. GE Healthcare is an American company founded in 2014 and spun off from GE in 2023.Source: testing / Shutterstock.comGE Healthcare (NASDAQ:GEHC) spun off from General Electric (NYSE:GE) in January. GE Healthcare is “a leading manufacturer and distributor of diagnostic imaging agents and radiopharmaceuticals.” Among its top products are CT machines, MRIs, ultrasounds and mammograms. The company also sells many digital tools that help manage its leading products.On April 25, GEHC reported that its top line had climbed an impressive 12% year over year, excluding acquisitions and divestments, while its adjusted earnings before interest and taxes climbed to $664 million from $599 million. Moreover, the company reported that it expects its earnings per share, excluding some items, to climb 7% to 11% this year to $3.60-$3.75.Before GEHC reported its results, investment bank Piper Sandler on April 20 started coverage of the name with a $95 price target and an “overweight” rating. The bank noted that the company had a large backlog of $14 billion, and thinks that it will be able to introduce significant new products after it raised its investment in R&amp;D.On the technology front, the company recently launched a system “designed to deliver high-performance ultrasound guidance” for multiple types of surgeries. And GEHC received an award from research firm MedTech Breakthrough for a “Best New Ultrasound Technology Solution.” Both pieces of news bode well for GEHC’s outlook as they suggest that the company is indeed on the cutting edge of medtech and an excellent healthtech stock to buy.As of the date of publication, Larry Ramer owned shares of GE.

I've had to eat some humble pie on that,"" O'Leary told Reuters, adding he was still pleased with the final price, which neither side disclosed.Industry sources said Ryanair may have paid more than it initially bargained for after holding out for a better deal, but one noted O'Leary took pains to avoid bashing Boeing, which had been anxious for the deal not to be painted as over-generous.Story continuesBoeing shares rose more than 1% in midday trade. Ryanair closed up at 3.6%.""I have been told to say there was a competitive discount ... although I didn't think (it) was particularly competitive,"" O'Leary joked to reporters, adding the order had risen by about 100 planes to help bring the two sides together.Boeing Chief Executive Dave Calhoun countered that no premium was high enough for the jet as the two companies patched up their differences in a relaxed press conference.Despite concessions on price, O'Leary said the new jets would allow Ryanair to almost double its annual traffic to 300 million passengers by March 2034 from the 168 million flown to end-March this year.Some of that will come at the expense of rival carriers.O'LEARY ACCEPTS MODERATELY HIGHER PRICESRyanair exclusively uses Boeing 737s for its mainline fleet and is one of Boeing's largest customers with more than 600 planes in its fleet or on order, according to its website.On Monday, Reuters first reported that Ryanair was close to a major Boeing deal. Earlier on Tuesday, sources said the final deal could involve up to 200-300 jets including options.Ryanair has long expressed interest in the 230-seat MAX 10, which faces runaway sales of the competing Airbus A321neo used by Ryanair rivals such as Wizz Air and has yet to be certified. But O'Leary had pledged not to overpay for the 30 extra seats.Ryanair said the deal was worth $40 billion at list prices, though experts noted that this included options, which are not booked as orders, and typical discounts for firm orders run at more than 50%.""We've had to accept a modestly higher price,"" O'Leary said. However, if Ryanair maintains its 94% or near-full load on flights aboard the larger MAX 10 jets, the extra 30 seats will ""pay for the aircraft in their entirety,"" he said on Tuesday.Industry sources said any price bump could at least partially be offset by compensation for delays, making it hard to measure who conceded most.O'Leary has also often blasted Boeing over industrial problems. On Tuesday, however, he praised the catch-up effort and said he expects almost all 51 previously ordered jets earmarked for April to arrive by the end of July.Newly ordered MAX 10s will be delivered from 2027 to 2033.While Boeing's relief at winning the order was tangible, analysts said Ryanair had lost some advantage in negotiations and early slots as carriers including United Airlines placed significant orders for the MAX 10.O'Leary dismissed this but acknowledged Ryanair would have had to wait until 2028-29 if negotiations had drawn out longer.One person familiar with the deal said Ryanair could not afford to wait much longer as Indian airlines scoop up hundreds of narrow-body jets, threatening to squeeze Ryanair out of the market for in-demand large models for the rest of the decade.""Ryanair operates a 737 fleet and is pretty locked in,"" with Airbus sold out for years and China years away from being able to supply the West, Agency Partners analyst Nick Cunningham said.

Ryanair declined to comment.On Monday, Reuters first reported that Europe's largest budget carrier Ryanair, looking for up to 200 more Boeing 737s to secure the next phase of its growth, was close to a major deal for a three-digit number of jets as early as Tuesday.Such a deal would mark a long-awaited truce between Boeing and Ryanair, whose outspoken Chief Executive Michael O'Leary last year broke off talks and issued a barrage of criticism over pricing and delays in the arrival of previously ordered jets.""There is only one airline in the world willing and able to buy Boeing planes and they can't seem to find us,"" O'Leary told reporters last March whle exploring second-hand jets instead.Boeing, which usually never comments on customer negotiations, said at the time it valued Ryanair's business but vowed to remain ""disciplined"" on prices.Ryanair exclusively uses Boeing 737s for its mainline fleet and is one of Boeing's largest customers with more than 600 planes in its fleet or on order, according to its website.Analysts said that once the dust settles from the recent rhetoric, all eyes would be on indications of whether Ryanair has managed to pay less per seat than earlier orders.The 737 MAX sells for up to $131 million at list prices but typical discounts run at more than 50% and details of final pricing are confidential.Industry sources say Ryanair has in the past been able to negotiate a special clause guaranteeing the lowest prices in its region - one of a tiny handful of airlines able to benefit from such treatment alongside Southwest Airlines.Story continuesBut the bond between Ryanair and Boeing loosened following the pandemic as low-cost carriers expanded markets.Despite O'Leary's tough stance, however, industry sources have said Ryanair has lost some advantage in the negotiations as other carriers including United Airlines stepped up with significant orders for the MAX 10.""Ryanair operates a 737 fleet and is pretty locked in,"" with Airbus sold out for years and China years away from being to supply the West, Agency Partners analyst Nick Cunningham said.The deal could nonetheless deliver a boost to the largest version of Boeing's 737 MAX, a series whose deliveries have been depressed by a two-year safety crisis and post-COVID disruption.O'Leary has expressed interest in the 230-seat MAX 10 variant, which has yet to be certified. But he has pledged not to overpay for the 30 extra seats, telling Reuters in March he was also looking at more orders of the 200-seat 737 MAX 8200.

Pictured is an Emirates 747-400, operated by TNT Airways, landing in Malta on Dec. 4, 2014. (Photo: Shutterstock/InsectWorld)The air cargo division of Emirates has temporarily augmented its fleet with two older Boeing 747 jumbo jet freighters to meet expected demand while it waits for manufacturers to fill orders for new aircraft, the Dubai-based airline said Monday.The 747-400s are being wet leased — a rental bundled with crews that fly the aircraft — and are currently being deployed to Chicago three times weekly and to Hong Kong nine times weekly. Emirates did not identify who is providing the transportation service on its behalf, but a source with direct knowledge of the company’s operations said Michigan-based Kalitta Air is operating the 747s to Chicago O’Hare International Airport and Aerotranscargo is the contractor for Hong Kong.Aerotranscargo, headquartered in Sharjah, United Arab Emirates, has six 747-400s in its fleet, according to Flightradar24. The company is incorporated in Moldova as Aerotranscargo FZE, which holds its air operating certificate. The flight tracking site shows Aerotranscargo aircraft shuttling back-and-forth between Dubai and Hong Kong in recent days.Kalitta Air operates 25 Boeing 747-400 freighters, as well as four 777s. A factory-built 747-400 has a maximum payload of 249,000 pounds. Flightradar24 also shows one of its jets operating between Chicago-Brussels, Belgium, and Dubai.Emirates SkyCargo last utilized outsourced 747 freighters more than five years ago. Those planes were operated by TNT Airways, now part of ASL Airlines Belgium.The airline plans to double its cargo capacity over the next decade and add more than 20 destinations to its freighter network despite the slump in airfreight, which has seen volumes decline more than 5% from a year ago and freight rates tumble 40%. But several long-range forecasts project the air cargo market to grow at a compound annual rate of about 4%, with the express segment powered by e-commerce growing at closer to 5% per year.Emirates, the fourth-largest air cargo carrier by volume, operates 11 Boeing 777 cargo jets and has 15 new and used aircraft in the pipeline. In November, it committed to buy five 777 freighters from Boeing, with deliveries expected in 2024 and 2025. The airline last summer also announced plans to repurpose 10 777-300 passenger jets by sending them to an airframe maintenance facility for conversion into dedicated freighters. The retrofits are expected to roll out over the next five years, but the exact timing is uncertain because Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) is still working to finish the licensing process.Story continues“While the current market volatility may cause others to hesitate, Emirates SkyCargo is pushing full steam ahead with our plans. The medium to long term projections for global air cargo show an upward trajectory of between 3% to 5%. Combine that with Dubai’s strategy to double its foreign trade where multi-modal logistics will play a big role, and the economic activity happening in markets around the Gulf, West Asia, and Africa, and the opportunity for Emirates SkyCargo is clear,” said Nabil Sultan, divisional senior vice president of Emirates SkyCargo.The fleet expansion will still not be sufficient to meet growth projections, he added. Etihad Engineering, part of the Etihad Aviation Group and also based in the United Arab Emirates, has an agreement with IAI to convert 777-300ER passenger planes into cargo aircraft and will handle the Emirates job. Sultan suggested Emirates is considering additional passenger-to-freighter conversions to support its strategic plans.Emirates SkyCargo also manages all the cargo carried on the airline’s massive widebody passenger network, which will also provide more cargo capacity as the airline begins to receive A350 long-haul jetliners from Airbus in the second half of 2024 followed by the arrival of Boeing’s next-generation 777-9. Emirates has 115 777-9s and 50 A350s on order.Emirates currently flies 252 large passenger aircraft, including about 90 A380 super jumbo jets, and plans to increase the fleet to more than 300 total aircraft within a decade.“The new aircraft mean we can expand our freighter network and amplify the connectivity with the main Emirates network,” Sultan explained. “The new fleet mix also gives us more flexibility to serve our different customers even better.”Emirates operates two modern air cargo terminals at its hub in Dubai.Click here for more FreightWaves and American Shipper articles by Eric Kulisch.Twitter: @ericreports / LinkedIn: Eric Kulisch / ekulisch@freightwaves.comRELATED STORIES:Emirates to buy 777 freighters in deal with BoeingEmirates invests in converted and new freightersIsraeli firm to convert Boeing 777s for cargo in South KoreaThe post Emirates taps Kalitta Air to fly rented 747 freighters appeared first on FreightWaves.]"

GriffinThanks, Mitch, and welcome, everyone. The Skyworks team executed well in a challenging market environment, delivering second quarter revenue above consensus estimates with solid profitability and strong cash flow generation. Looking at Q2 in more detail. We delivered revenue of $1.153 million. We drove gross margin of 50% and operating margin of 33.5%. We posted earnings per share of $2.02, and we generated $412 million of operating cash flow.In addition to the financial results, we expanded our design win pipeline, reflecting our success in diversifying our customer base and product portfolio. Across mobile and IoT, we delivered Sky5 platforms for Samsung's newly released smartphones. We launched WiFi 6E and WiFi 7 gateways for CommScope and ASUS. And we secured 5G content with a mobile computing leader. Across infrastructure and industrial, we enable small cell deployments with a Japanese telecommunications company. We provide enhanced Power over Ethernet functionality to Cisco for their enterprise networks. We ship programmable timing solutions to the top U.S. satellite provider and leverage our expanding industrial product suite with the leader in smart meter technology.In automotive, we continue to post year-over-year revenue growth while capturing EV onboard charging content with a top European supplier and wrapping digital radio products with a leading Korean OEM. These engagements highlight the increasingly diverse and expansive nature of our business, supporting the broadest array of customers and applications in our history.Several key market trends underscore the growth potential of advanced connectivity in the rapidly evolving EV industry. For example, WiFi continues to expand globally as the world's most affordable method of connecting the unconnected. Cisco forecasts the number of hotspots worldwide to reach 600 million this year.And as a market leader, Skyworks is uniquely positioned to benefit as deployments expand and the shift to WiFi 7 drives increasing complexity. In addition, the average U.S. household today has more than 10 wirelessly connected devices. Each of these devices requires fast connections, low latency and efficient battery life, all enabled by our integrated solutions.Further, the market for electric vehicles is expected to expand fourfold by 2027, leveraging our power isolation platforms which are becoming a leading choice for global EV manufacturers. Skyworks' success in enabling these major technology transitions is underpinned by increasing demand for our leading-edge system solutions differentiated by performance, integration, and most importantly, customer value.Moving forward, Skyworks is strategically equipped to capitalize on the rapidly changing connectivity landscape with an expanding set of customer relationships built over more than 2 decades, global scale and world-class manufacturing capabilities, a seasoned and talented workforce with a proven record of execution across multiple semiconductor cycles and an efficient cash flow engine that funds innovation while providing consistent cash returns.With that, I will turn the call over to Kris for a discussion of last quarter's performance and our outlook for Q3.Kris SennesaelThanks, Liam. Skyworks revenue for the second fiscal quarter of 2023 was $1.153 billion, exceeding consensus estimates. Mobile was approximately 60% of total revenue with year-over-year revenue growth at our largest customer reflecting broad content gains across their product portfolio. This revenue growth was offset by weakness in demand from the Android ecosystem as it continues to destock inventory.Broad markets reached 40% of total revenue for the first time with a strong contribution from the automotive, infrastructure and industrial markets. Gross profit was $577 million, resulting in a gross margin of 50%. Operating expenses of $190 million declined on a sequential and year-over-year basis given our focus on managing discretionary expense.We generated $386 million of operating income, translating into an operating margin of 33.5%. We incurred $13 million of other expense and our effective tax rate was 13.4%, driving net income of $323 million and diluted earnings per share of $2.02, in line with the guidance that we provided during the last earnings call.Now turning to cash flow. Skyworks' business model continues to deliver very strong cash generation. Second fiscal quarter cash flow from operations was $412 million and capital expenditures were $45 million, resulting in a free cash flow of $366 million and cash flow margin of 32%.Through the first half of the fiscal year, we've generated record free cash flow of $1.1 billion and 43% free cash flow margin. Given our consistent level of profitability and lower CapEx spending, we expect free cash flow margin to remain well above our target of 30% for the fiscal year.Also, during fiscal Q2, we paid $99 million in dividends, repurchased $9 million of Skyworks stock and repaid $200 million of our variable rate term loan. In addition, we increased our cash and investment balance to almost $1.1 billion to provide sufficient liquidity to repay $500 million of bonds that will reach maturity during fiscal Q3. Now let's move on to our outlook for Q3 of fiscal 2023. Taking into account the ongoing challenging macroeconomic environment and a slower-than-expected recovery and inventory destocking, especially in the Android ecosystem, we anticipate revenue for our third fiscal quarter between $1.050 billion and $1.090 billion. Gross margin is projected to be in the range of 47% to 48%, reflecting the cyclical impact of lower factory utilization while we are reducing our internal inventory levels.We expect operating expenses of approximately $183 million to $187 million, down sequentially and year-over-year as we are optimizing operating efficiencies. We will continue to make the necessary investments in technology and product development to further enhance our leadership position in mobile and drive diversification and growth in our broad markets business.Below the line, we anticipate roughly $13 million in other expense and an effective tax rate of 13.5% to 14%. We expect our diluted share count to be approximately 160 million shares. Accordingly, at the midpoint of the revenue range of $1.070 billion, we intend to deliver diluted earnings per share of $1.67.And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Liam.Liam K. GriffinThanks, Kris. Skyworks has delivered solid results through the first half of our fiscal year, demonstrating strong profitability and record free cash flow generation. With deep customer engagements underpinned by decades of technology investments in scale, Skyworks is well equipped to lead and continue to outperform.Moving forward, the Skyworks team remains focused on driving operational efficiency while leveraging leading-edge technologies to capture opportunities across a dynamic market for connectivity.That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, let's open the lines for questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO.Ambrish SrivastavaKris and Liam, you guys have spoiled us. I have to go back, I don't know, 8, 10 years to see a 4 handle on gross margin, and you have navigated through many quarters of sequential decline. I'm going back 10-plus 15, 20, and you've still been able to hold margins. So my first question is, what's going on the margin front. Is it pricing? Is it something structurally different this time versus going back to last 8, 10 years?Kris SennesaelYes. Ambrish, I will take that question of you. And so first of all, Q2, we delivered 50% gross margin, which was within our guidance range. But we started already seeing some of the underutilization charges hitting our income statement in the second quarter. For Q3 -- fiscal Q3, we guided 47% to 48% as we are experiencing 400 to 500 basis points of underutilization charges, which are partially offset by ongoing cost reductions and operational efficiencies that we are driving. And the reason for the underutilization charges is a slower-than-expected recovery in the Android smartphone markets as they continue to work down inventory, their internal inventory, in a somewhat soft demand environment.Initially, we were anticipating a stronger second half of the fiscal year and calendar year. But we do see some signs of recovery, although I would say, later and slower than initially anticipated. As a result of that, we are adjusting our factory utilizations across all our factories. That's resulting in those 400 to 500 basis point of underutilization charges. And I would like to note that, unfortunately, those underutilization charges are having a negative impact on the gross margin, but they do not have a negative impact on our cash flow. And we will continue to generate strong cash flow.And maybe last, we have been operating our business at a slightly elevated level of inventory in anticipation of a stronger recovery in the back half. Now that the recovery is going to be slower than expected, we are also going to adjust our internal inventory levels and rightsize that. Again, that doesn't help our gross margin, but it will further bolster our strong cash generation.Ambrish SrivastavaAnd my -- just my follow-up is on the gross margin side. (inaudible) inventory, you're sitting at 185 days. And target level is 85, if I remember correctly. 2 years ago or 3 years ago, you had given that to us. So if it has to come back to that level, then that headwind could sustain for more than a quarter, it could be a couple of quarters before inventory. At least 2, 3 quarters before it normalizes. Am I thinking about it the right way?Kris SennesaelYes. You think about it the right way. Well, first of all, inventory came slightly down already in Q2, but days were up on lower revenue. And so days will always be elevated in our 2 slowest seasonal quarters and will improve in our stronger seasonal quarters. But we will bring down inventory in absolute dollars as well as in days of inventory on a normalized level. And that, of course, will -- as a result of that, the gross margin will be on or about the same level for multiple quarters.And then eventually will -- as the business starts improving, margins will get back. And I get back to your first question, right? So this is not a pricing issue or this is not a major cost issue. It is just a temporary underutilization issue.OperatorYour next question comes from Blayne Curtis with Barclays.Blayne Peter CurtisI had 2. Maybe I want to ask, you highlighted the weakness in Android. I think some other customers have seen some inventory correction at their largest customers. So I was curious what the percentage was in March and if you also have to work through some inventory at that customer.Kris SennesaelSo the largest customer in March was approximately 64% of total revenue. And in terms of inventory, they manage their supply chain very well.Blayne Peter CurtisOkay. And then a perspective on the guide on broad markets, just kind of curious, it was down a little bit in March. Kind of how do you see that trending in June?Liam K. GriffinYes, Blayne, I mean we definitely continue to diversify the broad markets portfolio. It continues to be very strategic for us. We're capturing new design wins every month. Automotive has been strong. We've got a little bit more action going in WiFi 7 and also in some of the infrastructure markets. So that business is looking really strong. And also the contribution from the I&amp;A portfolio continues to track well.So still a lot of bright spots there in the other side of the business. Obviously, Kris mentioned some of the unique headwinds in mobile, but there are also some really dynamic activities going on in the broad market space.OperatorYour next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America.Vivek AryaI wanted to go back to where Skyworks is seeing the inventory issues because, Liam and Kris, I remember you guys were very early, right, and prudent to recognize the weakness in the China market last year. So I thought you had already taken care of the Android issue and any new issues would come with your largest customer. So I just wanted to reconfirm that the weakness you are seeing right now is still Android and not at your largest customer?Kris SennesaelSo Vivek, that is correct. The weakness is at Android. And you are correct, we have proactively managed that as good as we can in terms of our component inventory in the channel. What we cannot control is the inventory level at the customer, at the phone level, and that's where the main culprit is. And we see our customers continue to destock in a soft demand environment.Vivek AryaAll right. And for my follow-up, the fact that you are reducing factory utilization ahead of what is typically your strongest seasonal quarter, should we also be toning down our expectations of the mid-teens-plus kind of sequential growth that you usually have in September given all these macro factors?Kris SennesaelSo we only guide 1 quarter at a time here. But sitting here today, we do expect some good sequential growth in September and December. As you know, our largest customer ramps up their new product launches. And as in the past, we will have some really good content in those phones that will ramp up in the back half of the calendar year.OperatorYour next question comes from Karl Ackerman with BNP Paribas.Karl AckermanI guess, Kris, I wanted to just follow up on some of the inventory discussions earlier. Obviously, June tends to be the seasonally weakest period of the year for you. But do you think you're actually shipping in line with sell-through at this point ahead of this seasonal ramp that you normally see in the second half of the year?Kris SennesaelSo not in the Android ecosystem, we are still shipping below consumption because they still are burning through excess inventory at the phone level.Karl AckermanGot it. Got it. Okay. And then, I guess, just going back to the margin discussion, when would you anticipate underutilization charges to abate? And I guess, as you address that question, are there any risks to inventory obsolescence? If you could just discuss that as well, that would be very helpful.Kris SennesaelRight. So this is -- as I said before, this is a multiple quarter event because it just takes time to -- for those underutilization charges to actually hit the income statement, right? It goes through inventory turns until it hits your income statement. But we are seeing this soft demand environment in Android. It's improving but slightly slower than expected. We are reducing inventory at the same time. And so this is a multi-quarter event. In terms of excess and obsolete, we don't see any major risk. We've managed pretty well through that.Liam K. GriffinYes. And just to jump in here, this is Liam. Obviously, this is kind of a macro cycle that we're going through. I mean every company has their own nuances here. But I would remind you, the cash returns are very, very solid. We paid our bills on CapEx. Free cash flow margins are going to be sustainable, 30%-plus. So there's a lot of positives around that.And we'll get through the cycle. We're very, very much focused on execution, and it has been a little tough from some of our customers and so working with them and getting the inputs that drive our business. But we continue to drive design win penetration in new markets, whether they're in broad or even some of our mobile players and IoT players. So there's a lot of positives there.And yes, we're enduring a tough cycle, and I think we're doing the right things here to ensure a better future as we go forward. But the business is still quite solid. Cash returns are robust. We've got customer engagements that continue to ramp, and we're very confident on the outlook.OperatorNext question comes from Gary Mobley with Wells Fargo.Gary Wade MobleyWant to ask about your largest customer. In the first half of the fiscal year, you've managed to grow your business for them narrowly. So my question to you is based on the content gains that you may see in the next-generation platform from them and all other things considered, do you think you can grow your revenue with them for the full year or more importantly, second half this year versus last year?Liam K. GriffinYes. Yes. I mean we can't give you the specifics, but we absolutely aspire to drive a better position in the second half on continuing to cement new programs that we'll get into '23 and '24.Gary Wade MobleyOkay. And on OpEx management, you're doing a good job with, I guess, tamping things down and if not decreasing your OpEx in this tough time. Is that -- does that involve any, I guess, proactive measures on head count or [might it] in the future?Kris SennesaelYes. So we have been doing that. And you know at Skyworks we have been doing that consistently in the past. We add head count when needed in support of our technology and product road maps. And when things are getting tougher, we adjust. And we've made some downward adjustments in that area as well, of course, making sure that we can continue to support our major customers, our major programs. And it's really focusing on driving operational efficiencies and trying to trim down some discretionary spending. That's what we focus on.OperatorYour next question comes from Edward Snyder with Charter Equity Research.Edward Francis SnyderI'm a little confused, Liam. Maybe you could clear it up. Do you expect that [model to model] to see content up or down or flat in the second half of this year?Liam K. GriffinEd, can you give -- I missed the first part, Ed. Can you give...Edward Francis SnyderSorry, I'm just -- I'm not looking for revenue guidance at all because I just got all tangled up with macro and units and all that. I'm just looking at content in terms of new model releases year-over-year in the second half. Do you expect your content to be up? Or should we expect it to be flat or down?Liam K. GriffinYes. I mean we expect it to be up. That's our game plan. There's a lot of new technologies that emerge in the leaders, and we're hanging around the hoop on every one of them. So we've got our teams working with the best customers and fielding the best opportunity. So we'll have to see how that plays out in the second half, but that's definitely where we're headed.Edward Francis SnyderSo in a fantasy world, the flat units year-over-year, no change at all? You would naturally expect to be higher in revenue to largest customer in the second half of the year?Liam K. GriffinThat would be our plan, yes.Edward Francis SnyderPerfect. Okay. And then on the Android, I know it's still kind of a mess. But there are some architectural changes going on at some of the flagship phones, even the low-end phones that are involved. I don't want to say integration, but more higher density modules that will show up probably in the next year or so.I know Skyworks has kind of avoided some of that competition in the past just because there was ASPs associated with it. But given that it kind of separates you from a lot of the domestic suppliers in China, is it like -- is it reasonable to assume that Skyworks would participate more aggressively in the Android food chain, say, in 5G smartphone with their entry or flagship in the next 2 years?Liam K. GriffinYes. Ed, I would say yes to that because now as those models in Asia -- and Android become more complex, that's right up our alley, right? I mean so we -- our aperture is more to the mid- to the high end, and we want to lift those customers and help them create a better engine and a better solution.So we're there. And there's a lot of upside for us in that characteristic because we just -- we've been a little bit more high-end play. But as the complexity gets more and more embedded, that creates more and more opportunities for us. It's really -- it's hard to hit the hard pitch, right? We know how to do that, but we also got to take care of the other business as well.So we feel good about it. We definitely have the know-how to make it work, and I think it will be part of the recovery here as we get through the middle of the year.OperatorYour next question comes from Harsh Kumar with Piper Sandler.Harsh V. KumarI was curious, Liam, if you could give us a sense of how much excess inventory of complete handsets is in the Chinese end market. In other words, I guess what I'm trying to understand is, I know you're undershipping, but curious how long or how many quarters it might take for selling [3 quarter] sellout.Kris SennesaelRight. Harsh, we don't have a specific number on the number of excess inventory on the handset level. But it is a couple of quarters, right? And initially, we anticipated it to be a couple of quarters, but now it might be a couple of quarters more. And that's what we -- that's the feedback we are getting from the customers. That's the feedback that -- and remarks that we see by our peers and competitors.Harsh V. KumarThat's fair, guys. And then for my follow-up, if I can ask you, if you could help us out with broadband. Do you think that broadband might be up in the June quarter on a sequential basis or a year-over-year basis? Any color would be great.Kris SennesaelRight. So our broad markets business will be slightly down on a sequential basis into the June quarter. Again, it's -- as Liam already talked about that, right, we see certain areas of strength in automotive, some of our industrial markets. But there is some inventory overhang in some of the more consumer enterprise-oriented markets, again, very similar to what has been mentioned by peers and competitors that play in this field.OperatorYour next question comes from Ruben Roy with Stifel.Ruben RoyHarsh asked the essence of my question, Liam. But I guess specifically on auto, was it up in the March quarter? And do you expect auto to continue to remain strong as you sort of characterized? And the reason I'm asking that is, obviously, there were some long lead times and that type of thing in auto components. I'm wondering how lead times look. Are they coming in and what the inventory assessment is in that market specifically as you think about the rest of the year?Liam K. GriffinYes. Sure. Great question. As you know, we actually hadn't done much in automotive 2, 3 years ago, and we're now really making great progress. So the good news there, there's a tremendous amount of new territory that we can cover in automotive. We've already won a number of platforms and programs with key OEMs, EV players, et cetera. The partnership with our I&amp;A business has been a real catalyst there as well for us.So it's a fast-growing part of our portfolio. It has tremendous upside. We have low share relative to the pie. And that's going to make for pretty dynamic opportunities as we go forward. And it's definitely a grower for us this year. Despite all this inventory stuff we talked about, the auto market will definitely grow.Ruben RoyThat's helpful, Liam. And then just a quick follow-up on Ed's question earlier. Sort of thinking through design activity for next year, maybe in Android, how would you characterize that? It seems like there are a lot of in services moving to single module right now. Do you -- would you characterize design activity as strong right now ahead of sort of those ramps? Or do you think that's still something on the (inaudible) that you guys will be participating in bake-offs in later this year? What's the timing on that, I guess, is the question.Liam K. GriffinYes. Well, I mean, as you know, we've been focusing more high end, mid-tier, et cetera. But obviously, now the good news is that our customers want better performance. So we had been a little bit more cautious in engaging in some of the lower-end markets, but some of those products now and the appetite for connectivity is raised, which makes it much more profitable and more in the kind of down the alley for Skyworks. So you're going to see more opportunities for us emerge in the Android cycle.Samsung is doing a lot better. Google is a player now for us. We're doing a lot there, and obviously, the players in China. China has been a little tough, but I think that, that will come back and that will be another catalyst for us.So we know how to make all that stuff and the stuff is not new at all. We know exactly how to handle it. Automotive, again, is a new market that we're doing very well on. And I think we get through some of these macro headwinds, we'll be able to really kind of shine a light on some of these strategic design wins that we have.OperatorYour next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.Harlan SurOn broad markets, I think 90 days ago, you guys had anticipated driving full year growth in this segment. But as you just mentioned, you've got dynamics in the consumer IoT market. I think even data center enterprise telco markets have continued to soften a bit here. So does the team still believe that they can drive full year growth in broad markets?Kris SennesaelYes. I think -- Harlan, I think that's going to be a challenge, right? So we -- what we said is that we were expecting some modest year-over-year growth on a calendar year basis. But given some of the macroeconomic challenges that we have seen with high inflation and increased interest rates and the impact it has on consumer and enterprise spending, I think this is going to be challenging.Having said that, I mean now I'm looking beyond calendar year '23 into fiscal '24, we do expect our broad markets business to grow in fiscal '24 over fiscal '23.Harlan SurPerfect. And then the team has done a great job proliferating your filter technology. I think last year, I think the team drove about 45% BAW filter attached to your mobile revenues, right? Given the design win pipeline for this year on new model launches in the second half, where do you see that attach rate moving to?Liam K. GriffinYes. That attach rate continues to move higher and higher, and there's multiple nodes in bulk acoustic wave. So it's not one that fits all. There's a lot of innovation. There's a tremendous amount of R&amp;D. And one of the other things that we talked about a little bit is our capital intensity. That's a plus for us as well. We've already gone through a pretty significant cycle in raising the capability and technology nodes with BAW. We have a lot of capacity right now that we're ready to roll on.And it's a strategic technology. Not many companies know how to do it. And it can go beyond the smartphone as well. So the applications certainly today are in handsets, but there's a broader set of opportunities where BAW filter is a meaningful part of the strategy and a meaningful part of the performance. So you'll be able to see that more as we go through this year and following years.OperatorYour next question comes from Kevin Cassidy with Rosenblatt Securities.Kevin Edward CassidyAnd just to understand too, as you cut back on utilization, what's the shape of being able to bring that back up again? I guess if it -- your lead times start to stretch out and that's when you build your utilization back up again? Just kind of what's the strategy as business starts to come back?Kris SennesaelYes. So a lot of it will depend on how strong the business will bounce back. And once we start seeing -- and we already see it, right, some of recovery in the Android market. Once that gets stronger in combination then, of course with -- continue to grow our broad markets business, as we just indicated, and doing well with our largest customer, we will start ramping up the factory utilizations. But as I said earlier, it's a couple of quarters and then that will bounce back.Kevin Edward CassidyOkay. But to bring utilization back up, it's just a matter of rehiring people? Like it doesn't mean new equipment, you've just turned the equipment off?Liam K. GriffinNo. The equipment is there. I mean we basically -- we know how to handle that. The capital, the scale, all that's ready to go. This is just more of a demand issue, but we know how to handle it. And there's going to be a tremendous amount of activity that will go through those cycles and go through those factories leveraging that capital, which is in great position and has a tremendous opportunity over the next several years to populate not only smartphones, as we said, but other bulk acoustic wave type of engine.OperatorYour last question comes from Matt Ramsay with TD Cowen.Matthew D. RamsayI guess for my first question, some of your peer companies that also have some pretty high revenue exposure to your largest customer talked about a dynamic of maybe them buying a bit more early in this calendar year, pulling in some of their own inventory purchases and leaving a bit of air pocket before things ramp in the back half. Are you guys -- is some of the stuff reflected in the guidance that type of dynamic? Or am I -- or is it more lean toward Android as you've mentioned in some of your prepared comments?Liam K. GriffinYes. It's more towards the Android side at that point the way we go here. And so I think that's maybe what you're saying. But -- and there, again, I mean, we know how to manage through it.Matthew D. RamsayGot it. I guess, Kris, I wanted to ask a longer-term thing as my follow-up, and it's on free cash flow. You mentioned that some of the utilization charge, things that are going to happen in the short term with the factories are not cash flow hits. But given the dynamics in the business, could you talk a little bit about how -- are there any specific floors of free cash flow that you're managing to in terms of a free cash flow percentage? And just how do you think you plan to manage the business over the next 2, 3 years on a cash flow basis? I think that would be helpful.Kris SennesaelYes. No, that's a great question. And so our target model is a free cash flow margin of 30%. And last couple of years, we have been operating the business in the mid- to high 20s. And the reason why we were not at 30% is, as Liam just explained, we have made major investments in our technology, in our manufacturing assets, building out very high-class manufacturing capabilities.And -- but looking forward over the next couple of years, instead of running CapEx at 10% or 12% to revenue, we believe that in the next couple of years, we can run the business at mid-single digits as a percent of revenue for CapEx.In addition to that, of course, we will continue to grow the business and run the business at high profit levels. And when you combine that with good working capital management, we believe we will be able to sustainably run this business at 30%, 30-plus percent free cash flow margin.And again, just in the first 6 months of the year here, we've already generated more cash than we did last year, right, with $1.1 billion of free cash flow at 43% free cash flow margin. But again, sustainably well above 30% for the remainder of -- or the total of the fiscal year.OperatorThere are no further questions at this time. Please proceed.Liam K. GriffinThanks for participating in today's call. We look forward to talking to you at upcoming investor conferences during the quarter. Thank you.OperatorLadies and gentlemen, this concludes your conference call for today. We thank you for participating and ask that you please disconnect your lines.]"

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Mastercard Incorporated (MA), The Coca-Cola Company (KO) and T-Mobile US, Inc. (TMUS).

The COVID-19 crisis accelerated the adoption of digital and contactless solutions, providing an opportunity for MA's business to expedite its shift to the digital mode.Mastercard is well-poised to gain from steady cash-generating abilities. A strong capital position allows it to pursue acquisitions and prudently deploy capital.However, steep operating expenses might stress margins. High rebates and incentives may weigh on the company's net revenues. Its dividend yield is still lower than the industry average. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.(You can read the full research report on Mastercard here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Coca-Cola have gained +1.4% over the year-to-date period against the Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry’s gain of +10.3%.

T-Mobile plans to reach 300 million people within 2023. It intends to bring more competition to home broadband, especially in underserved rural markets.However, T-Mobile operates in a fiercely competitive and almost saturated U.S. telecom market, which lowers its growth potential to some extent.

183,cbb2850d-7010-3933-ac27-0e9e104cc5f7,NOC,2023-05-09,Top Supersonic Travel Companies in the World,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-supersonic-travel-companies-world-142604496.html,1683555964,STORY,"['GE', 'SPCE', 'BA', 'NOC']","[In this piece, we will take a look at the top supersonic travel companies in the world. For more supersonic companies, head on over to Top 5 Supersonic Travel Companies in the World. Think for a second if you were living in 1923 instead of in 2023. It's been five years since the first world war ended and long distance passenger travel is still done either through buses or ships. While human flight is possible, it's not without caveats and limitations. Now, transport yourself to 2023, and imagine seeing a ghastly elongated cylindrical metal object emitting fire from its bottom and landing on a ship in the ocean.If you'd carried out our small thought experiment, you'll realize that in just a hundred years, humanity has come a long, long way. While folks in 1923 could only travel in air in pairs, these days jumbo jets manufactured by The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) and Airbus SE (OTCMKTS:EADSF) are capable of transporting hundreds of people all over the world at more than five times the speed of the Airco DH.4 - one of the world's first passenger planes.But what if you wanted to go faster? Well, for that, you'll have to transport yourself back to the past once again. But not too far back; only just two decades, to the era of the Concorde. The Concorde was the world's second supersonic commercial aircraft and the most widely flown plane as well. The aircraft could travel twice as fast as the speed of sound, but several considerations such as an inability to conduct flights over land due to supersonic booms and high operating costs ended up shelving the project. To understand just how expensive it was to fly the Concorde, consider the fact that it could travel 14 passenger miles per gallon of fuel, compared to the 91 passenger miles per gallon of the Boeing 747. The supersonic aircraft was also a fuel guzzler, as for every passenger transported a hundred kilometers, it would use 16.6 liters of fuel, which is significantly higher when considering the 3.3 liters for the Boeing.Story continuesYet, the Concorde's retirement doesn't mean that dreams of supersonic flight are over. While the world's largest aircraft manufacturers Airbus and Boeing do not have any plans for making commercial supersonic jets, others do have such plans, and some of these involve rockets as well. At the same time, even though the supersonic travel industry is quite limited right now, and no point to point travel on Earth options exist, there is some value to the sector. For instance, a research report from The Business Research Company points out that the supersonic jet market was worth $22.9 billion last year and will grow to $23.5 billion by the end of this year. From then until 2027, the sector will post a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4% and be worth $27.53 billion by the end of the forecast period. The research firm believes that growth in global air passenger traffic will drive the industry forward, along with newer technologies that aim to reduce emissions and the high sounds produced by these airplanes.However, while point to point supersonic flights still haven't 'taken off' since the Concorde's retirement, that does not mean civilians are not traveling supersonically. In fact, the rapid growth in the astronautics sector has led to private astronauts flying both to the boundary between Earth and Space, called the Karman line, the International Space Station (ISS), and around the Earth. In fact, it's private astronauts, and not crew from space agencies such as NASA, who have flown the highest orbit around the Earth as well. This particular mission was the Inspiration4 flight which took off from NASA's Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in 2021. The mission was flown by the billionaire Jared Isaacman as part of his efforts to raise funds for a children's cancer hospital, and it saw Isaacman and his crew of four fly to an orbit of 585 kilometers - the highest orbit since a Hubble space telescope mission in 1999. However, the mission's apogee - its furthest point in orbit - was a whopping 1,368 kilometers away from Earth and the highest in human history for missions in orbit. Of course, astronauts part of NASA's Apollo program that took humans to the Moon have flown further, but their mission was beyond the Earth's orbit.Just as was the case with the Concorde, supersonic travel of today is also limited to the rich simply due to the high costs of flying expensive rockets. Apart from Mr. Isaacman, other billionaires have also traveled to space although, of course, he is the one to have flown the farthest. The other two flew missions for their own companies. The first of these was British billionaire Sir Richard Branson who flew to the boundary of space on his space company Virgin Galactic Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:SPCE)'s SpaceShipTwo spaceplane in July 2021. Sir Branson was followed by the retail billionaire Jeff Bezos, who also flew to the Karman line in his space company Blue Origin's New Shepard rocket. Both these vehicles travel faster than the speed of sound during their missions, but their destinations are not on Earth.With these details in mind, let's take a look at some top supersonic travel companies, out of which the top picks are Virgin Galactic Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:SPCE), Space Exploration Technologies Corporation (SpaceX), and Blue Origin LLC.Top Supersonic Travel Companies in the WorldPhoto by Hermeus on UnsplashOur Methodology To compile our list of the top supersonic travel companies, we first made a list of all firms that have supersonic aircraft designs, manufacture engines for these aircraft, and provide the services. For the ranking, the periphery firms, such as the engine companies, are listed first. These are followed by companies with design projects. Finally, firms that have actual supersonic products are ranked the highest.Top Supersonic Travel Companies in the World10. General Electric Company (NYSE:GE)General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) is an American firm headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts. It is the sole supplier of the jet engine for Lockheed Martin and NASA's X-59 supersonic aircraft, which aims to demonstrate quiet supersonic flight for future passenger planes. A central piece of the aircraft is its engine since it must function with a specially designed nozzle that reduces noise without compromising performance for a high power aircraft.By the end of last year's fourth quarter, 59 of the 943 hedge funds part of Insider Monkey's database had bought a stake in General Electric Company (NYSE:GE). The firm's largest investor is Richard S. Pzena's Pzena Investment Management which owns 13.2 million shares that are worth $1 billion.Virgin Galactic Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:SPCE), General Electric Company (NYSE:GE), Space Exploration Technologies Corporation (SpaceX), and Blue Origin LLC are some top supersonic travel companies in the world.9. Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC)Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) is an American firm based in Falls Church, Virginia. It has partnered up with the supersonic airplane designer Boom Supersonic to develop a quick response supersonic military transport plane for the United States military.As of December 2022, 49 of the 943 hedge funds part of Insider Monkey's database had held a stake in Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC). The firm's largest hedge fund in our database is Rajiv Jain's GQG Partners with a $428 million stake that comes via 784,927 shares.8. EON Aerospace, Inc.EON Aerospace, Inc. is an aerospace firm set up by a South African billionaire. Its plane is called the NXT-01 which aims to have a top speed of Mach 1.9. However, few details are available about the jet.7. Exosonic, IncExosonic, Inc is a U.S. firm that is one of the younger companies in the supersonic travel industry. The firm was set up in 2019 and it operates out of Los Angeles, California. The firm is developing a low boom supersonic passenger aircraft, which aims to be suitable for flights over populated areas. This lends it a large market opportunity since supersonic flights in the U.S. are banned due to noise generated by the sonic booms. Exosonic, Inc aims to achieve Mach 1.8 with its aircraft, with 5,000 nautical miles range, and a passenger capacity of 70 people. The jet is intended to have two different variants, one for the private jet industry and the other for commercial airlines.The business jet model will have two private suites and video teleconferencing capabilities. It will also have lay flat seats that will enable passengers to sleep during their flight. The firm promises to complete the journey from London to Hong Kong in just six hours compared to the standard travel time of eleven hours.6. Spike Aerospace, Inc.Spike Aerospace, Inc. is an American aerospace firm with offices in Florida and Massachusetts. Like Exosonic, Spike is also developing a quiet supersonic jet, but it has limited its design to business jets only. Spike's jet, called S-512, is slower than than Exosonic's, with a speed of 1.6 Mach. The jet aims to have a maximum capacity of 18 people, but it's a rare plane that aims to provide passengers with a panoramic view of their surroundings so that they can fully understand where they are and how fast they are traveling.Spike Aerospace, Inc. joins Virgin Galactic Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:SPCE), Space Exploration Technologies Corporation (SpaceX), and Blue Origin LLC in our list of the world's top supersonic travel companies. Click to continue reading and see Top 5 Supersonic Travel Companies in the World. Suggested Articles:15 Biggest Airplanes in the World in 202312 Best Aerospace Stocks To Buy15 Biggest Private Jet Companies in the WorldDisclosure: None.

The stock outpaced the S&amp;P 500's daily gain of 0.05%. Elsewhere, the Dow lost 0.17%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 6.02%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the athletic apparel maker had gained 5.3% over the past month. This has outpaced the Consumer Discretionary sector's gain of 1.01% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 1.18% in that time.Nike will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release. On that day, Nike is projected to report earnings of $0.66 per share, which would represent a year-over-year decline of 26.67%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $12.56 billion, up 2.66% from the year-ago period.NKE's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $3.24 per share and revenue of $50.95 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of -13.6% and +9.08%, respectively.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Nike. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.15% higher within the past month. Nike is holding a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) right now.Valuation is also important, so investors should note that Nike has a Forward P/E ratio of 39.06 right now. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 13.24, so we one might conclude that Nike is trading at a premium comparatively.Story continuesWe can also see that NKE currently has a PEG ratio of 3.69. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. The Shoes and Retail Apparel was holding an average PEG ratio of 2.47 at yesterday's closing price.The Shoes and Retail Apparel industry is part of the Consumer Discretionary sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 106, which puts it in the top 43% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank includes is listed in order from best to worst in terms of the average Zacks Rank of the individual companies within each of these sectors.

(NKE) is a Trending Stock",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-nike-inc-130001880.html,1683550801,STORY,['NKE'],"[Nike (NKE) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this athletic apparel maker have returned +5.3% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +1.2% change. The Zacks Shoes and Retail Apparel industry, to which Nike belongs, has gained 4.8% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Nike is expected to post earnings of $0.66 per share, indicating a change of -26.7% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.5% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $3.24 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -13.6%. This estimate has changed +0.2% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4 indicates a change of +23.5% from what Nike is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Nike is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for NKE _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Nike, the consensus sales estimate of $12.56 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +2.7%. The $50.95 billion and $54.51 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +9.1% and +7%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryNike reported revenues of $12.39 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +14%. EPS of $0.79 for the same period compares with $0.87 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $11.41 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +8.55%. The EPS surprise was +51.92%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Nike is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Nike. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Through the 2023 Wells Fargo Builds program, the grant funding will enable local Habitat for Humanity affiliates to build and repair more than 360 homes nationwide, including accessibility modifications to meet the needs of low-income older adults and people with disabilities.The grant was announced in Des Moines, Iowa as part of a citywide repair event with Greater Des Moines Habitat for Humanity where roughly 130 Wells Fargo and community volunteers completed critical home repairs and updates to help up to a dozen local homeowners. In Iowa and across the U.S., roughly 20% of the population will be 65 or older by 2030. Yet more than 19 million older adults are living in homes that are in disrepair or ill-equipped to meet changing mobility needs around the home, according to Habitat for Humanity International.As part of the week-long Wells Fargo Builds project, volunteers installed home modifications such as grab bars and wheelchair ramps for homeowners like Robert, a 66-year-old who needed to make his house more accessible for himself and two adult children who use wheelchairs. Jessi, a social worker with two young kids at home, now has an updated front porch with sturdy new steps and railings. These modifications will help prevent falls during Iowa's harsh winters and enable the homeowner to maintain the condition of her home, which is often a family's greatest asset.""As a company, we're committed to bringing homeownership to more families so they can pass that legacy on and grow generational wealth,"" said Mary Mack, CEO of Consumer and Small Business Banking for Wells Fargo and Habitat for Humanity International board member.

Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. See our latest analysis for Wells Fargo The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Wells FargoThe insider, Kleber Santos, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$1.6m worth of shares at a price of US$46.27 each. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. The good news is that this large sale was at well above current price of US$37.94. So it may not shed much light on insider confidence at current levels.Over the last year we saw more insider selling of Wells Fargo shares, than buying. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below.

(Hint: insiders have been buying them).Wells Fargo Insiders Are Selling The StockThe last three months saw significant insider selling at Wells Fargo. In total, insider Kleber Santos sold US$1.6m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Story continuesInsider OwnershipI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Wells Fargo insiders own about US$101m worth of shares (which is 0.07% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.What Might The Insider Transactions At Wells Fargo Tell Us?An insider hasn't bought Wells Fargo stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. Zooming out, the longer term picture doesn't give us much comfort. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing.

I would like to hand the call over to Dr. Victoria Meissner, Vice President of Strategy and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.Victoria MeissnerGood morning and afternoon. My name is Victoria Meissner, and I'm the new Head of Investor Relations at BioNTech. I'm a medical doctor by training and have recently joined BioNTech from Healthcare Investment Banking at Jefferies. I look forward to working with you on the corporate side. Thank you for joining us today for BioNTech's First Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. As a brief reminder, the slides that accompany this call and the first quarter 2023 press release that was issued this morning can be found in the Investors section of our website.

Today, I'm joined by the following members of BioNTech's management team: our CEO and Co-Founder, Ugur Sahin; Özlem Türeci, our Chief Medical Officer and Co-Founder; Jens Holstein, our Chief Financial Officer; and Ryan Richardson, our Chief Strategy Officer. I would like to turn the call over to Ugur Sahin.Story continuesUgur SahinThank you, Victoria. Good morning, and good afternoon, and warm welcome to all the call participants. We appreciate your continued support. Today, I will summarize our first quarter 2023 highlights and priorities before I pass the call over to my team to provide further details.Let me reiterate our strategic goals for 2023 and highlight our first quarter and recent achievements. First, to expand and sustain our leadership in COVID-19 with Pfizer by advancing our next-generation vaccine candidate, developing combination vaccines and advancing key Comirnaty features. This quarter, we maintained our strong COVID-19 vaccine market position, supported by key label expansions in regions around the world. This month, we published preclinical data in the [Journal] Cell on our next-generation Pfizer's (inaudible) vaccine component in combination with Comirnaty.Our second goal is to accelerate our oncology pipeline and initiate multiple potentially registrational trials. Our new collaborations with DualityBio and OncoC4 complement our pipeline with multiple mid- to late-stage clinical programs that will help us to achieve this goal in the near term. Our third and final strategic goal is to initiate and accelerate clinical programs with high unmet medical need in infectious diseases. In the first quarter, we initiated new clinical vaccine programs namely for shingles and tuberculosis. The first quarter was a strong start to 2023. We plan to continue execution against these strategic goals to continue our development into a fully integrated global multiproduct biotechnology company addressing divesting medical needs worldwide. Cancer remains one of the key unmet medical needs. Our long-term oncology strategy is to expand the treatment options available for cancer patients and become a multiproduct company in the next year. In order to best serve the needs of tumor patients, we aim to address the full continuum of cancer treatment, bring novel therapies to market for patients with adjuvant and late-stage cancer and combining our platforms and programs to translate our science into survival. Key elements in our oncology pipeline are mRNA cancer vaccines, cell therapies, next-generation checkpoint immune modulators and antibody drug conjugate. We believe that these 5 classes has the potential to drive improved outcomes for solid tumor patients across multiple lines of treatment and tumor types.Our most advanced oncology assets are currently in development for a range of solid tumors at all stage of treatment. We believe that this asset has first-in-class or best-in-class potential and may enable us to drive meaningful change in the treatment of many cancers. How are we planning to achieve this? Our technology-agnostic innovation engine leverages modular technology platforms, both developed internally and accessed via collaboration partnerships, to produce novel product candidates. In the first quarter, we announced 2 new collaborations to give us access to assets and platforms that we believe may be important in how solid tumors are treated in the future. One of those, which I'm particularly excited about is the new collaboration with Duality Biologics, the company focused on the discovery and development of next-generation antibody drug conjugates. In the last few years, advancements in ADC technology has resulted in a potent use for the treatment of solid tumors. We believe that ADCs have the potential to replace highly toxic chemotherapy regimens as the cytotoxic backbone to cancer treatment. ADCs consists of 3 main components: Antibody, Linker and Payload, each of these components has an impact on ADC's pharmacological and clinical properties. ADC is a precision medicine, allowing for targeted graft delivery, particularly to tumor cells with high specificity and potent induced cell death with the benefit of reduced off-target events. When the monoclonal antibody binds to the target antigen specifically expressed on the tumor cell, the ADC is internalized, allowing for the release of the cytotoxin, which leads to cell death. Slide 11. Under the terms of the exclusive worldwide licensing collaboration agreement with DualityBio, excluding Mainland China, Hong Kong region and Macau region, we will gain access to 2 programs: DB-1303 targeting HER2 and DB-1311 driven by Duality Biotech platform and novel, cleavable, linker and payload technologies, this third-generation ADCs have demonstrated pharmacokinetic properties that may contribute to an increased third-party window compared to other ADC platforms. ADCs offer a bold combination potential, especially with various IO agents. A Phase I/II clinical trial for DB-1303 is ongoing, which we plan to expand into further tumor indications, and we aim to rapidly advance clinical development of this program. Slide 12. I want to end where I started, our vision. With our new collaboration, we now have 27 programs. We plan to start multiple potentially registrational trials in the coming years. Within the next years, we aim to become a multiproduct global biotechnology leader, aiming to contribute and address the world's most pressing health challenges with pioneering disruptive technologies delivered at scale. With that, I would like to thank you all for your confidence in our success and your continued support. I will now turn the call over to Özlem.Ozlem TureciThank you, Ugur. I'm delighted to speak with everyone today and provide our pipeline update. Starting on Slide 14. Not only since BioNTech's founding, we have firmly believed in the potential for mRNA cancer vaccines to have a place in the future of cancer treatment. We have built our personalized and off the shelf platforms and initiated a broad clinical program to evaluate the full utility of our approaches. Today, we have a broad cancer vaccine's development program with 4 ongoing randomized Phase II clinical trials in both the adjuvant and metastatic disease settings. The iNeST program includes 4 clinical studies, the Phase II clinical trial with autogene cevumeran, BNT122 monotherapy in adjuvant CRC started in 2020 and is recruiting patients with CTDNA positive the resected Stage 2 high-risk and Stage 3 colorectal cancer. Data from an investigator initiated Phase I clinical trials evaluating BNT122, autogene cevumeran, and onetime dosing of atezolizumab in adjuvant pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma were presented at ASCO last year. A Phase II clinical trial in this patient population is planned to start in 2023. A randomized Phase II clinical trial evaluating our agent in combination with pembrolizumab in first-line melanoma patients has finished enrollment. Analysis of PFS as primary endpoint will be triggered event-based. Data from a Phase I clinical trial with BNT122 autogene cevumeran, a single agent and in combination with atezolizumab in patients with locally advanced disease and metastatic disease across multiple tumor types, was presented previously. We are preparing a manuscript summarizing the Phase I data for publication. In our FixVac program that is comprised of 4 different indication-specific product candidates, we have ongoing clinical studies. We have a first-in-human Phase I/II clinical trial, evaluating BNT112 monotherapy and in combination with cemiplimab in 2 cohorts of patients, namely with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and with high-risk localized prostate cancer, who are eligible for treatment with androgen-deprivation therapy is ongoing. A randomized Phase II clinical trials evaluating BNT113 in combination with pembrolizumab versus pembrolizumab monotherapy as a first-line treatment in patients with PD-L1 positive unresectable recurrent or metastatic HPV-16 positive head, neck squamous cell carcinoma is ongoing. A randomized Phase II clinical trial evaluating BNT111 in combination with cemiplimab, whereas both agents as monotherapy in patients with refractory/relapsed unresectable Stage 3 or 4 melanoma is ongoing, conducted in collaboration with Regeneron. Data from the first-in-human open-label Phase I clinical trial evaluating BNT111 in patients with advanced melanoma have been published and presented. A Phase I basket clinical trial evaluating BNT116 alone and in combination with cemiplimab in patients with non-small cell lung cancer in various settings is ongoing. For example, patients, who have progressed on prior PD-1 inhibitor treatment or are not eligible for chemotherapy, and in combination with the docetaxel in patients, who have received prior platinum-based chemotherapy. The second trial is planned to start this year to evaluate the combination of BNT116 and cemiplimab and cemiplimab alone as first-line treatment of patients with non-small cell lung cancer. Based on the data collected from these trials, we plan to continue the clinical trial advancement and expansion of both our mRNA cancer vaccine program. I'd like to put our first quarter pipeline advancements and additions into the broader context of our clinical stage pipeline, which is depicted on Slide 15. In the first quarter, we added to our pipeline the new assets. Ugur already mentioned. The HER2 targeting ADC, DB-1303 developed by our colleagues at DualityBio, which has recently started the Phase II portion of the ongoing Phase I/II clinical trial. Also in the first quarter, we added ONC-392 to our pipeline, the PH sensitive anti-CTLA4 antibody developed by our partner, OncoC4. ONC-392 is being tested in 2 ongoing clinical trials, the first in [multiple solid tumors] as monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab; and the second trial in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer patients in combination with pembrolizumab. We are excited about accelerating and broadening the clinical development for both of these programs based on the data we've seen in the pre-clinic and clinic. On Slide 16, I want to briefly highlight the mechanism of action and clinical data of ONC-392. CTLA-4 recycles continuously between the cell surface and the endosomes as it does not undergo lysosomal degradation. Interruption of this process is associated with the development of autoimmunity. Autoimmunity and immune-related adverse events are a major limitation of approved anti-CTLA-4 antibodies, such as ipilimumab that disrupts CTLA-4 recycling by promoting lysosomal degradation of this important immune checkpoint modulators.ONC-392 does not interpret with the recycling it dissociates from the CTLA-4 molecule in the endosome and allows normal recycling of both the antibody and the CTLA-4 molecule, and thus is designed for stronger cancer furopoletic effect and less immune-related adverse effects. ONC-392 is being tested in the trial that investigated dose escalation, a single agent and in combination with pembrolizumab. Multiple indications, such as [IO] and resistant non-small cell lung cancer and melanoma are being treated with RP2D. Preliminary data shows that ONC-392 is well tolerated with no DLTs, and the RP2D was determined to be 10 mg/kg without MTDs being reached. Severe immune-related grade-free adverse event rate in the combo dose escalation was 23%, which is considered lower than what was reported for comparable IO/IO combination. The RP2D dose for combination is 6 mg/kg. In summary, ONC-392 dose as monotherapy or in combination was well tolerated, and the safety profile appears to allow higher dosing for a longer duration of treatment as compared to ipilimumab. Early efficacy data as monotherapy in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer patients and in combination with pembrolizumab in multiple solid tumors were promising. Presentation of the first data from the NSCLC expansion cohort of the Phase I/II PRESERVE-001 study is planned at ASCO next month. Building on this data, we are planning to start a Phase III clinical trial in non-small cell lung cancer patients without driver mutations, who have progressed following anti-PD-1. After progressing on an anti-PD-1 treatment, non-small cell lung cancer patients have 8 to 11 months median overall survival and 3 to 4.5 months progression-free survival with a response rate of around 10% when treated with the second-line standard of care docetaxel. With ONC-392, we hope to offer a promising new second-line treatment option for these patients. The randomized open-label controlled multicenter Phase III RESERVE-003 study is planned to treat IO resistant non-small cell lung cancer patients in the dose confirmation part we and OncoC4 plan to assess the efficacy and safety of ONC-392 given at 2 dose levels in comparison to docetaxel. In the subsequent part of the trial, we intend to assess the safety and efficacy of ONC-392 at the collective dose regimen versus docetaxel.Patients with Stage 4 non-small cell lung cancer, who progressed on prior IO treatment with or without chemotherapy and ECOG status of 0 or 1 can be enrolled via IO-IO therapy is allowed. A total of about 600 patients are planned to be enrolled and randomized 1:1 to receive either ONC-392 or docetaxel in this 2-stage study. The primary endpoint is overall survival with objective response rate, PFS and safety as secondary endpoints. The study is planned to start enrolling patients within the next few weeks. The trial in progress poster will be presented at the 2023 ASCO Annual Meeting. Moving to our collaboration with our partner, DualityBio, on Slide 18. As part of the collaboration, we will gain access to DualityBio's lead candidate, DB-1303, a HER2 targeting ADC comprised of the trastuzumab, biosimilar covalently linked to a proprietary DNA topoisomerase-1 inhibitor, P1003 via retrievable linker L101. Approved ADCs have shown antitumor activity and clinical benefits and multiple types of cancer. While current generations of anti-HER2 ADCs have an improved overall therapeutic index, more efficacious and safer anti-HER2 ADCs, for example, regarding potential lung toxicity, such as the severe life-threatening or fatal interspecial lung disease, including pneumonitis may add further clinical benefit. The first data for DB-1303 were presented at the t EORTC-NCI-AACR conference last October and describe to significantly improved therapeutic window of DB-1303 preclinically as compared to DS-8201a or TDM-1 analogs to trastuzumab deruxtecan and trastuzumab emtansin, respectively. In [red] monkey and human plasma, DB-1303 demonstrated high drug to antibody ratio and outstanding plasma stability. In HER2-positive and HER2 negative mixed cell cultures, DB-1303 inhibited the proliferation of both cell types, demonstrating its bi-standard effect. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analysis of DB-1303 in xenograft mouse models showed targeted delivery of the toxin into tumor tissue. Further in VIVO studies in monkeys showed a superior stability of DB-1303 and rapid systemic clearance of the toxin. These pharmacokinetic properties result in maintenance of efficacy and reduction of systemic toxicity in animal models, which are shown on the next slide. Slide 19, DB-1303 exhibited potent antitumor activity in both HER2-positive and HER2-low tumor models, potentially expanding the benefit population of HER2-targeted therapy. Preclinical studies in monkeys demonstrated an improved safety profile compared to DS-8201 with the highest non-severely toxic dose of 80 mg/kg. Further, DB-1303 showed lower risk of causing lung inflammation with no ILD-like lung toxicity. The pharmacokinetic properties of DB-1303 may contribute to a superior safety profile observed in monkeys. Slide 20. The program has received Fast Track Designation from the FDA and is currently being evaluated in a Phase I/II clinical trial for HER2-positive advanced solid tumors. The study is enrolling pretreated patients with advanced or metastatic HER2-positive or HER2-expressing solid tumors. Data from this study will be presented at ASCO this year. After determination of the recommended Phase II dose, further dose expansion cohorts are planned, including tastuzumab-treated HER2 gastric or the gastric esophageal adenocarcinoma, esophageal carcinoma and CRC. HER2 over-expressing and HER2-low endometrial carcinoma, hormone receptor positive HER2-low breast cancer as well as HER2-positive breast cancer and non-small cell lung cancer with activating HER2 mutations. Slide 21 highlights our infectious disease pipeline. In December of last year, we initiated the first clinical trials, investigating an mRNA-based vaccine for malaria prevention. Consistent with our 2023 strategic priorities, we started first in human clinical trials testing new mRNA vaccine candidates in the first quarter of 2023. One is a vaccine against tuberculosis and the other with our partner, Pfizer, a vaccine for shingles. These programs built on our validated platform of mRNA-LNPs that have a backbone optimized design and our nucleos got modified to address diseases with a significant global need. The World Health Organization estimates that about 25% of the world population is latently infected with mycobacterium tuberculosis, the bacterium responsible for the tuberculosis disease. 10.6 million people developed active tuberculosis in 2021 and a total of 1.6 million people died of tuberculosis worldwide. There are limited prophylactic treatment options for tuberculosis and cases of multidrug-resistant mycobacterium tuberculosis strains are increasing worldwide. The only licensed, tuberculosis vaccine, is the mycrobacterium bovis derived and attenuated BCG, which was first introduced in the 1920s and is still routinely administered to newborns in most tuberculosis endemic countries. While BCG provides time protection from severe forms of tuberculosis in childhood, the high number of pulmonary tuberculosis cases that emerge every year illustrates the limited durability and protective efficacy of BCG against tuberculosis disease and transmission in adolescents and adults. Vaccine technology advances are seen as important to ending the tuberculosis epidemic by 2030, which is the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal. Given the major global unmet medical need for tuberculosis vaccines, we and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation are working on multi-antigen our aided lipid nanoparticle vaccine candidates against tuberculosis. The target population of a BNT164 program will include IGRA-negative and positive BCG naive and vaccinated healthy adults. The clinical program in Germany and South Africa, thereby including a non-endemic and endemic country, will investigate with safety, reactogenicity and tolerability of the BNT164 vaccine candidates. The Phase I program is intended to have select for optimal mRNA vaccine candidate and the dose level for advancement to Phase II. The vaccine may prevent infection and subsequent transmission, and when applied to a large enough proportion of the target population that constitutes the infectious reservoir, could enable interruption of transmission. And that bring us closer to the elimination of tuberculosis. We believe that even a vaccine that is only 50% efficacious would be a critical intervention and a success in contributing to the WHO tuberculosis elimination target by 2030. Slide 23. Dynamic evolution of COVID-19 strain requires care vaccine adaptations and innovative next-generation vaccines. We are pursuing several next-gen vaccine concepts. One of these is a T-cell string vaccine component, aka BNT162b4. As shown on the left-hand side, along the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 and particularly pronounced in the omicron sublineages, there has been progressive loss of concert spike protein neutralizing antibody sites. In contrast, HLA Class 1 and 2 presented T-cell epitopes of the spike protein remained mostly unaltered the process of virus evolution. This is not surprising. Indeed, a fundamental difference of T-cell versus B cell-mediated immunity is that owing to their very nature, T-cell epitopes are less likely to be impacted by mutations. And the T cell-mediated layer of immunity is more robust against immunization. T-cell response is likely to remain much less impacted than neutralizing antibodies by new variants of concern and may contribute to prevention or limitation of severe COVID-19 manifestation. Based on this rationale, we are developing BNT162b4, an mRNA that encodes variant conserve immunogenic segment of non-spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2, mainly of nuclear captured membrane and ORF1ab proteins was binding to diverse HLA alleles. For design of this strain, we have built on our platforms and skills developed in the context of designing [thematic] mutation-based cancer vaccines. Our BNT162b4 T-cell strain vaccine component is designed to enhance T-cell immunity and is intended to be combined with variant adapted Comirnaty. We believe we can improve immunity that is variant independent. Our preclinical data was recently published in Cells. In a mouse animal model, we demonstrated that mice immunized with BNT162b2, which is (inaudible) without BNT162b4, which is the T-cell strain non-strong polyfunctional and polyepitopic CD4 and CD8 T-cell responses to the N, M, and ORF1ab proteins of SARS-CoV-2.Thus broadening the T Cell with (inaudible) beyond the spike protein. Data from Syrian hamsters that were immunized with BNT162b4 alone or in combination with BNT162b2 and then challenged with [White] SARS-CoV-2 of the delta variants demonstrate that BNT162b4 alone and in combination protects animals from severe disease and enhances viral clearance. The clinical study investigating this next-generation COVID-19 vaccine component candidate in combination with Comirnaty is ongoing. I look forward to providing additional program updates in the coming months. I will now pass the presentation to our CFO, Jens Holstein, who will present our financial results.Jens H. HolsteinThank you, Özlem, and a warm welcome to everyone who dialed in today's call. I'll start my section with the key highlights for the first quarter of 2023, which you can find on Slide 26. The first quarter of 2023 started strong and fully to our expectations. The quarter was driven by seasonal and some carryover effects from the previous year. As an example, we generated revenues from sales in countries with late approvals of our BA.4/ 5-adapted bivalent COVID-19 vaccine. For the rest of the year, we are expecting an increase in vaccine sales towards the Northern Hemisphere winter season in the countries which are our key markets. As a consequence, we expect the second quarter to be the weakest quarter in 2023. Overall, we reiterate our COVID-19 vaccine revenue guidance of around EUR 5 billion for the full 2023 financial year. I would now like to dive into some key financial figures that underline our successful first quarter. Our total revenues reported for the first quarter of 2023 reached EUR 1.3 billion, mainly related to our share of gross profit from COVID-19 vaccine sales in the collaboration partner territories. These revenues represent a net figure, meaning that we generate a 100% gross margin on those. As a reminder, under our COVID-19 vaccine collaboration, territories have been allocated between us, Pfizer and Fosun Pharma based on marketing and distribution rights. Please keep in mind that Pfizer's fiscal quarter for subsidiaries outside the United States differs from our financial reporting cycle. Hence, Pfizer's international operations from December 2022 will be reflected in their Q1 2023 earnings, whereas we have included the respective estimate already in our Q4 2022 financial figures. This creates a deviation between the numbers of our partner Pfizer publishers versus our numbers on a quarterly and a full year basis. With EUR 1.3 billion in revenues, we ended the first quarter with an operating result of EUR 654.4 million and generated earnings per share on a fully diluted basis of EUR 2.05. With respect to the company's financial position, we ended the first quarter of 2023 with EUR 12.8 billion, comprising EUR 12.1 billion cash and cash equivalents as well as EUR 0.7 billion security investment with a longer time horizon, which we made as part of our investment strategy. When looking at our cash burn during the first quarter of 2023, the cash movement was negatively impacted, for example, due to a onetime payment settling our wage tax liability incurred in the context of our 2022 share-based payment settlement significant tax prepayments relating to the full financial year of 2023 as well as amounts spent as part of our share repurchase program. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, in April 2023, we have received approximately EUR 4 billion in cash from our collaboration partner, Pfizer, settling our gross profit share for the fourth quarter of 2022. Our M&amp;A activities and recent collaboration license agreements announced in the first quarter did not lead to cash outflows during the quarter. In connection with the planned acquisition of InstaDeep and the upfront payments of the collaboration and license agreements with OncoC4 and Duality Biologics, we expect approximately EUR 0.8 billion to be invested in cash and by exchanging shares in the course of 2023. Please note the final InstaDeep purchase price will be determined on closing, and the mentioned amount for M&amp;A does not comprise future earnout and milestone payments. I'll be moving to our financial results for the first quarter of 2023, as shown on Slide 27. Having explained our revenues on the previous slide, let me move to cost of sales that amounted to EUR 0.1 billion in the first quarter of 2023 compared to EUR 1.3 billion for the comparative prior year period. The drop was mainly due to the decrease in COVID-19 vaccine sales. Research and development expenses reached EUR 334 million for the first quarter of 2023 compared to EUR 285.8 million for the comparative prior year period. The increase was mainly due to higher expenses incurred from progressing the clinical studies for pipeline candidates. The increase was further driven by an increase in wages, benefits and social security expenses resulting from an increase in headcount. General and administrative expenses amounted to EUR 119.4 million for the first quarter of 2023 compared to EUR 90.8 million for the comparative prior year period. The increase in G&amp;A was mainly due to increased expenses for IT consulting and IT services as well as an increase in wages, benefits and social security expenses, resulting mainly from an increase in headcount. Income taxes were accrued with an amount of EUR 205.5 million for the first quarter of 2023 compared to EUR 1.3 billion for the comparative prior year period. The derived effective income tax rate for the first quarter of 2023 was approximately 29%, which is expected to decrease over the 2023 financial year to be in line with our guidance. For the first quarter of 2023, net profit reached EUR 502.2 million compared to EUR 3.7 billion for the comparative prior year period. Our diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of 2023 amounted to EUR 2.05 compared to EUR 14.24 for the comparative prior year period. Now turning to Slide 28. I would like to emphasize that we are reiterating the company's outlook for the 2023 financial year. Please note, the following number reflects current base case projections and are calculated based on the constant currency rate. As stated before, we reiterate our estimated COVID-19 vaccine revenues of around EUR 5 billion for the full 2023 financial year. Our capital allocation strategy includes a strong investment in M&amp;A transactions to the extent disclosed. They have been, as far as known, reflected in the R&amp;D expenses and will be updated as needed. Overall, we maintain our guidance for client expenses and growth and maintenance CapEx for operating activities as well as the estimated annual effective income tax rate, which we have summarized for you on the slide. And with that, I would like to turn the call over to our Chief Strategy Officer, Ryan Richardson, for an update on our strategic outlook for 2023 and concluding remarks. Thank you.Ryan RichardsonThank you, Jens. To wrap up our prepared remarks, I'll provide a brief summary of the commercial outlook for our COVID-19 vaccine franchise before concluding with a few important dates to mark on your calendars.In 2023, we aim to develop, manufacture and deploy a seasonal adapted Comirnaty vaccine. We expect a recommendation from governmental authorities regarding vaccine strain composition midyear with a potential approval for an adapted vaccine by the end of this summer. Broad vaccination is planned to start early fall. In addition, we aim to introduce a single-dose, ready-to-use vial, and will continue to improve key Comirnaty features such as shelf stability. In addition, we plan to advance our next-generation COVID-19 vaccine candidates throughout the year. We expect that COVID demand in 2023 will continue to come from a broad range of regions globally. Since the beginning of the first quarter, we have shipped COVID-19 vaccine doses to more than 70 countries and regions. Since the start of the year, our deliveries to middle-income and low-income countries have increased. We have also seen a greater contribution from the pediatric segment so far this year. For the full year 2023, we expect global demand to be driven by existing signed government contracts, which we anticipate will be augmented by the opening of a commercial market in the U.S. in the second half. In the midterm, we see multiple potential growth drivers for our COVID-19 vaccine franchise. These include the potential for volume growth as the seasonal market is established, particularly in high-risk population segments. In addition, we believe continued innovation from variant-adapted vaccines, next-generation vaccines and possible respiratory combination vaccines have the potential to support future franchise growth. The transition to private markets in certain regions is likely to take several years. We believe the shift to commercial pricing will provide further midterm growth potential. We and our partner, Pfizer, believe in the value that our COVID-19 vaccines provide both to individuals and health systems, and we will continue to invest to maintain our leadership position in the market. The next slide summarizes our pipeline news flow for 2023. Some of these points have been covered, so I won't go through them in detail again here. What is clear is that our pipeline of 27 clinical-stage programs is expected to produce several readouts throughout the year across a range of technologies. We expect data updates for our CAR-T cell program, targeting Claudin-6, our anti-CTLA-4 program and our new HER2 antibody-drug conjugate at ASCO, in addition to multiple further updates for other programs later in the year. Before concluding and opening up the floor for questions, I would like to reiterate that we will hold our AGM on May 25 and our next innovation series event on November 7. We'll provide further details in the coming weeks on both events. With that, I'd like to thank our shareholders for their continued support, and I'll conclude our remarks and open up the floor for questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) And your first question comes from the line of Tazeen Ahmad from Bank of America.Tazeen AhmadI have one on pipeline as it relates to the partnership with Pfizer. On the iNeST program for first-line melanoma, can you give us a sense of when exactly this year that data could be presented, if it's still this year? And what level of data we should expect at the top line? And then I have a follow-up.Ryan RichardsonYes, sure. Thank you, Tazeen. I'll start and maybe, Ugur, you want to add. So we've retained our guidance for an update in the first-line melanoma setting for this year. And we've also -- we've stated previously, and it's still the case, that our expectation is that the update would speak to both ORR and also PFS.Ugur, anything you'd like to add?Ugur SahinNo, that's it.Tazeen AhmadOkay. And then as it relates to HER2 with your ADC program, so this is [competitive space] there's multiple candidates that are in development. Can you just talk to us about how you think your program could be differentiated and how you're thinking about the general competitive landscape and what indications could we got served?Ugur SahinYes, maybe I can take this question. So the generation of ADCs, particularly if HER2 provided a massive improvement on existing ADC compounds. We believe that there is still room for improvement, and we also believe that there is room for multiple lines of development, including, for example, HER2 gynecological tumors like ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer, HER2-positive non-small cell lung cancer, but even in the breast cancer space, with a compound that comes with a differentiated safety profile. That could add additional safety features and tolerability features. I would like to mention that we will have a poster at ASCO, which would provide data generated in a larger breast cancer cohort. And that -- and this data could be informative about how this product could be positioned.OperatorAnd the next question comes from the line of Daina Graybosch, SVB Securities.Daina Michelle GrayboschI have -- I'll take 2 questions, too. The first one, I wonder if you could talk about the payload in the immunity -- sorry, in the DualityBio programs, and whether you think that this payload will be as synergistic with IO as some of the other payloads that we've seen late-stage clinical trials and how -- whether its synergy is great or less great, how that will impact your development in combination with your other programs? And then I have a follow-up.Ugur SahinYes, Daina, thank you for the excellent question. Actually, you bring up a key point by we are interested in these ADCs. So the payload is based on topoisomerase inhibitor and linker technology is differentiated, providing a more stable linker with even more reduced release of the spontaneous release of the toxin. And yes, the key aspects of bringing in this new compound class is that we believe that these new compounds would be highly synergistic with our IO pipeline, including the next-generation immune modulators and bispecific antibodies as well as our personalized vaccines and fixed back applications.Daina Michelle GrayboschGreat. And then my second question is on the flu vaccine. And I wonder how much degree of freedom there was and is in designing an mRNA-based flu vaccine? And essentially, I'm trying to get at, how similar or different should we expect Pfizer BioNTech vaccine from the Moderna vaccine in its outcome?Ugur SahinSo there is always flexibility. If you use this mRNA technology, there's a lot of flexibility in having a vaccine with a differentiated profile. As you know, there are challenges in the field of influenza vaccines, particularly if you address the question of influenza A versus B immune responses. Therefore, I believe that the design of these vaccines could provide additional features that can overcome limitations in the field.OperatorAnd your next question comes from the line of Akash Tewari from Jefferies.Unidentified AnalystThis is Ivy on for Akash. We have 2 actually. First is for COVID. So for your EU government orders, I guess, how many doses have been delivered so far? Because the tracker we follow use to suggest there's around 900 million that has been delivered, but now it's only showing around 700 million BioNTech Pfizer doses delivered, with around like 200 million unknown categories. So I guess, any clarification you can give me will be super helpful. Then I have a follow-up question on your IMS program.Jens H. HolsteinYes. Yes, thanks for the question. I mean, as you know, we are currently in discussions with the EU regarding the renegotiation of the contract. And given that we're in the middle of these discussions, we don't want to give any details on this. We don't want to put any burden on those discussions. So please bear with us. We expect that we have some more clarity on the discussions in the course of Q2. That's our expectation, and then we're happy to share the results on those negotiations with you, of course.Unidentified AnalystGot it. So my second question is for BNT122. So for the melanoma data readout this year, I guess you just reiterate that this will be limited to PFS and ORR. Is there any specific reason on why there won't be any OS data? Does that imply a potential longer duration of result?Ugur SahinI can take this question. The maturation of the data is -- will most likely not allow to generate OS data.OperatorAnd your next question comes from the line of Chris Shibutani, Goldman Sachs.Chris ShibutaniSome clarifying questions in terms of how we should think about your results and financials through the year, if I could. The reiteration of the EUR 5 billion of guidance, can you tell us what does that take into account embedded in your base case assumption here, particularly as I recognize that you have the EC contract negotiations are going through? You did mention the second quarter is going to delight us, but then the deliveries, again, in the assumption for the EUR 5 billion through the balance of the year.Similarly to the financials on the R&amp;D-related expense, you have the outlining of the full year level in the first quarter. It was quite a bit less than we had been expecting, and I believe consensus as well. Help us with the sort of the cadence and the shape of spending through the year. And then I have one other follow-up.Jens H. HolsteinYes, Chris, happy to take that question, and Ryan will chime in. Maybe starting with the top line guidance. We reiterated the guidance, as I stated in my speech, before we had a good start in Q1. We believe, Q2, and that's not a surprise to you, will be weaker. I mean it's not really the season for vaccinations as we see it for flu. We assume that the development in terms of how people will get vaccinated is comparable to some extent to what we see in flu. So specifically looking at the Northern Hemisphere, so our expectations for Q3 and Q4 is that these will be the 2 quarters of relevance for us for the full year.We have, of course, seen already before we went out with the guidance that the discussions with the EU will be discussions, where we might have to face, and we stated that when we went out with the guidance that we might have to face some reduction in the total volume for '23 versus what has been negotiated before, that we might have some other implications in some other countries potentially as well, and we try to reflect this accordingly. I would like to reiterate that if you compare the Pfizer guidance of $13.5 billion, if you take that, I think they're also reflected those discussions and negotiations ongoing. And if you translate that, taking into account the currency implication, taking into account that Pfizer reflects their December revenue figure of 2022 in their Q1 figure, and December 2022 has been a very strong month, we -- whereas we have to reflect this month in our full year figures for 2022, so we have from January to December, our revenue figures were at Pfizer for the international part is just looking at November to November. So these things caused some differences, quite significant differences in our estimation, if you compare the December 2022 versus our expectation for December 2023. So there is a big impact coming from this. And if you then take this into account, we feel that the EUR 5 billion that we have reiterated today is something that we can live with. It could be that -- and that has been our assumption that there might be a new variant that we will adapt the existing vaccine that we produce. That's our assumption to reach the EUR 5 billion. And we're -- our assumption in that respect remains valid at this point in time. I hope that helps you.Ryan RichardsonAnd maybe -- I would just add, and maybe you can come back as well to the R&amp;D point.Jens H. HolsteinYes, I'll come back to the R&amp;D part.Ryan RichardsonJust to add two points to that. So first is actually the volumes, while we're not disclosing volumes in the first quarter, we were shipping to quite a broad range of countries in the first quarter, over 70 countries we mentioned. There's still some carryover there to pandemic contracts. And so as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we did see some significant volumes in particular to low and middle income countries in the first quarter.Jens H. HolsteinYes. And then maybe to add on the R&amp;D costs, Chris, so the first quarter has been relatively light if you see (inaudible) that we have booked for Q1, if you put that into relation of the EUR 2.4 billion to EUR 2.6 billion of our guidance. But this is, to a great extent, some sort of phasing implication to a great extent, also coming from our various programs that we have together with our collaboration partner, Pfizer. So I wouldn't read too much into this. I would -- we reiterated that guidance. Please also take into account that we have reflected under and already in there and to a great extent duality, spending for our clinical studies here. So we feel comfortable with the EUR 2.4 billion to EUR 2.6 billion in the course of the next quarters.Chris ShibutaniAnd then to follow-on, Pfizer during their meeting in December outlined their vision for what the vaccines for COVID could look like usage, particularly in the U.S. out for the next 3 or 4 years. There was a factor in there in terms of potential for combination with flu. Can you talk to what the BioNTech house view is? Were you involved with these projections? If there's any fundamental differences in your point of view, where might they lie?Ryan RichardsonYes, thanks for the question. So yes, we're very involved with Pfizer on an operational level and also on the commercial planning level globally as a co-commercialization partner. I think it's fair to say that Pfizer has taken the driver's seat in the U.S. commercial sphere. We've been very involved in Europe and also in other geographies. I think how we look at it, this is that it's a little too early to be precise and prescribe a factor to the contribution from combinations at this point. I think we need to see more data. I think what we outlined today is that we do see combinations, respiratory combination specifically as a potential, one of multiple potential growth drivers over the mid- to longer term for the franchise. So that is something that we're looking very closely at with our partner, multiple angles there. And I think Pfizer brings a lot to the table there, but so do we in terms of thinking about how combinations could be best deployed to meet patient need.Chris ShibutaniGreat. Thanks. We'll look for the data as it progresses.OperatorAnd your next question comes from the line of Yaron Werber from Cowen. As there is no response, I will go to the next question, and your next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn, Morgan Stanley.Terence C. FlynnJust had a follow-up on the iNeST vaccine program. I was wondering if you can just discuss high level about how you're thinking about likelihood of success in the adjuvant versus the metastatic setting. I think Merck and Moderna have focused more on the adjuvant setting, but obviously, you're taking a more broader approach. So just wondering if you could elaborate there.Ugur SahinYes, I can take this question. And the question is a very important one. With regard for the development, we have an early adjuvant study in melanoma, and we have initiated 2 additional adjuvant stage trials, one in triple-negative breast cancer, for which we do not yet have reports; and the second one in pancreatic cancer, which we have reported at ASCO last year and where we are expecting a publication in the next few weeks.And in the adjuvant setting, the clear understanding is that we have, as compared to the metastatic setting, a higher immunogenicity rate even though using the same vaccine platform. And in the melanoma and now previously reported contract at cancer study, we have shown that immune responses are correlated, this prevention of relapses or with a reduced relapse rate in this patient population. We have also reported the metastatic study, Phase I study, which yielded also immunogenicity, but to a much weaker extent than the actual setting. And based on this, we can clearly say that at least in the setting, how the vaccines are used so far, we see an improved activity in the adjuvant-stage. There are other reasons why adjuvant-stage cancers could be more eligible. This is, first of all, the lack of heavily established tumor micro environment, the lower tumor load and most importantly in the adjuvant setting, there is a window of opportunity, so the tumors do not progress in the first 6 to -- or in the first 3 months, giving the opportunity to build an immune response, which can then deal with the tumor. So in the totality, we believe that the adjuvant stage is the type of diseases to go. We have, as you know, randomized clinical trial in colorectal cancers running since 2019. We expect here readout data from this randomized colorectal cancer trial in 2024, yes. And we are planning a Phase II study based -- randomized Phase II study in pancreatic cancer based on the data that we have observed.OperatorAnd your next question comes from the line of Yaron Werber, Cowen.Yaron Benjamin WerberI got a quick question on Pfizer and your flu vaccine, 161. The 25,000 patients -- I'm sorry, U.S. healthy adult study is ongoing. Any sense as to when you think we might be able to see data this year? Is it -- are you thinking sort of in the fall? And is that sufficient to follow? Do you need to run an additional study potentially in the rest of the world or even in the Southern Hemisphere? And then secondly, my understanding that's the quadrant modified RNA vaccine. Any update on the self-amplifying mRNA vaccine for flu as well?Ryan RichardsonYes, Yaron, I'll start and, Ugur, you may want to add to this. But I think it's -- just to start off, it's important to reiterate that we licensed that program in 2018 to Pfizer. So they're really in the driver's seat in terms of development. We do have rights to royalties and milestones upon success. And so of course, we're tracking that with them and working with them on the broader program. But I think Pfizer has guided to an update this year. I don't think they've specified in that we don't want to contradict what they put out. So I'll leave it at that. And the same goes, Yaron, for the self-amplifying program, both are -- fall under our collaboration agreement with Pfizer.Yaron Benjamin WerberSo Ryan, maybe just a follow-up, when for the flu-COVID combo, can you give us any sense at all as to whether your royalty is going to be sort of a blended between your low teens, let's say, for flu and you're 50-50 for COVID?Ryan RichardsonYes, it's a great question. And I think blended is the right way to think about it. We haven't disclosed with Pfizer the specific economics, but I think it's fair to assume that would be a blend. As you know, we have a 50% gross profit share on the COVID-19 vaccine, and we do have a royalty on flu. And so there are still ongoing discussions about that. But I think we'll leave that for now until we can present some data and discuss next steps for the programs.OperatorAnd your next question comes from the line of Jessica Fye from JPMorgan.Unidentified AnalystThis is [Nasan] on for Jessica Fye. I think I want to ask about the FixVac program and the progress there and when we might get to see initial data on that program. And then whether like in light of the comment on metastatic versus adjuvant setting, how you're thinking about the development for FixVac?Ugur SahinMaybe I'll take the second question on, Ryan, if you could take the first question would be great. Yes. So for 6 Vac, we have some generated data in the metastatic setting in patients with melanoma, particularly with a high proportion of patients, who did (inaudible) under existing PD-1 therapy and have seen in objective responses and high rate of [immunogens] of captive responses in combination with anti-PD1 in the range of 35% to 40% with vaccine alone in the range of 20%. The key advantage of FixVac as compared to the customer life the antigen vaccine is the availability of the vaccine directly after patient inclusion. So that means we do not have this 4 to 6 weeks of waiting time until patients can be dosed. Therefore, in principle, FixVac could be an option for patients with advanced metastatic disease. But again, here, it's a question of the combination compound. And this is something that is now in the focus of our upcoming studies evaluating the use of this vaccines in combination with our checkpoint immune model later, for example, the bispecific BNT312 and BNT311 molecules, but as well as our rybocytokine molecules, the modified IL-2, IL-7 have an approach.Ryan RichardsonYes. And in terms of the time lines, we haven't guided any fixed date updates this year. So I would say that 2024 is the most likely. And as you know, we have multiple trials ongoing, multiple trials, so recruiting in NSCLC in refractory melanoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma may name a few, so likely 2024.OperatorAnd your next question comes from the line of Bill Maughan from Canaccord.William Patrick MaughanSo I have 2 on the broader strategy. So first of all, some of the more recent BD, the partnerships our focus to look more on late-stage clinical programs and less on massive paradigm shifting earlier stage programs. So is there an internal push to reach profitability on some certain time line on the non-COVID portfolio? And then second related question is, are there any other technology platforms that you want to get into that you don't have that technology yet?Ryan RichardsonYes, thank you. So maybe I'll take the first one and then, Ugur, if you want to speak to the technology platforms piece. In terms of the rationale for the recent deals, I think what we have been is clear about our intention to go commercial in the oncology portfolio by 2026 onwards. And so we have multiple internal programs that if successful in late-stage trials could give us opportunities around that time period to bring products to market. And so what you've seen us do with these BD deals is basically add depth, further depth to that sort of wave 1 of oncology programs that have potential to be successful to get to market around that same time frame. In addition, we've gone for programs that can serve as backbones. So we've really tried to maximize synergy rather than solving for profitability near term, mid- to long-term synergy with our own pipeline. And so you see that with the anti-CTLA-4 molecule. You see that also with the HER2 ADC with ADC modalities in general. Again, programs and technologies that we think could combine very well with our existing pipeline.Ugur SahinYes. Thank you, Ryan. With regard to technologies, no, we are not looking to any disruptive technology. We have a number on disruptive technologies in-house. But what we are clearly doing is we are evaluating technology modules and that could close gaps in our technology platforms or further augment the activity of our technology platforms.OperatorAnd your next question comes from the line of Zhiqiang Shu from Berenberg.Zhiqiang ShuI have 2. First, I wanted to ask about the FixVac BNT116. I think you mentioned you're going to start a Phase II program in first-line lung cancer. I wonder if you can comment on any signals from Phase I that gives you the confidence to start a Phase II?Ugur SahinShort answer, no, we do not have any updates so far from the running clinical type that is expected end of the season.Zhiqiang ShuGot it. And then a quick follow-up on the -- your ADC deal. Can you talk about the, I guess, the comparison in top 1 pier at the payload versus microtubule inhibitors payload in terms of the combination with IO differences and similarities there?Ugur SahinYes. One, I think the most important aspect is for getting ADC technologies is that we believe that in the next 6, 7, 8 years, this ADC technologies will more or less complete the -- completely replace chemotherapy. So that means any type of combination therapy, which requires chemotherapy backbone might end up in an ADC approach. With regard to the currently evaluated compounds and TOP2 inhibitors come with a profile allowing sustainable and also long-term application. And we have also seen now in several studies that they are ideally suited as backbone for combinations with IO compounds. We do not exclude that we could be -- we might be also interested in microtubule inhibitors, but several of the microtubular inhibitors have been in the past, at least in the chemotherapeutic setting associated with (inaudible), and we believe that this new compound class should give the opportunity to develop treatments, which do not come with dose-limiting toxicity with regard to repeated application.OperatorThank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.]"

(PFE) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pfizer-inc-pfe-attracting-investor-130001901.html,1683550801,STORY,['PFE'],"[Pfizer (PFE) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this drugmaker have returned -7.3%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +1.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, which Pfizer falls in, has gained 3.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Pfizer is expected to post earnings of $0.65 per share, indicating a change of -68.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.2% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.35 points to a change of -49.1% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +1.5%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.40 indicates a change of +1.6% from what Pfizer is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -10.3%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Pfizer.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for PFE _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Pfizer, the consensus sales estimate of $14.26 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -48.6%. The $67.79 billion and $67.46 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -32.4% and -0.5%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPfizer reported revenues of $18.28 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -28.8%. EPS of $1.23 for the same period compares with $1.62 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $16.96 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +7.82%. The EPS surprise was +23%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Pfizer is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Pfizer. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Advertising revenues increased 43%, primarily reflecting the impact of Super Bowl LVII, a higher volume of NFL games and continued growth at Tubi. Affiliate fee revenues increased 3% with 9% growth at the Television segment. Other revenues were essentially unchanged from the prior year quarter.The Company reported a quarterly net loss of $50 million as compared to net income of $290 million reported in the prior year quarter. The variance was primarily due to charges associated with legal settlement costs at FOX News Media, partially offset by the higher fair value of the Company's investments recognized as a gain in Other, net. Net loss attributable to Fox Corporation stockholders was $54 million ($(0.10) per share) as compared to net income of $283 million ($0.50 per share) reported in the prior year quarter. Adjusted net income attributable to Fox Corporation stockholders1 was $494 million ($0.94 per share), an increase of $35 million ($0.13 per share) from the $459 million ($0.81 per share) reported in the prior year quarter.Quarterly Adjusted EBITDA2 was $833 million, an increase of $22 million from the prior year quarter, as the revenue increases noted above were partially offset by higher expenses. The increase in expenses was primarily due to higher programming rights amortization and production costs at FOX Sports driven by the broadcast of Super Bowl LVII and a higher volume of NFL games in the current year quarter, as well as increased digital investment at Tubi.Commenting on the results, Executive Chair and Chief Executive Officer Lachlan Murdoch said:""Our fiscal third quarter once again demonstrated the effectiveness of FOX's strategy to leverage the power of compelling live events to deliver for our viewers, advertisers, and distributors at scale. During the quarter, the largest audience in U.S. television history gathered to watch FOX Sports' broadcast of Super Bowl LVII, underpinning our delivery of double-digit revenue growth, and providing a promotional gateway to FOX's entertainment and news brands. Additionally, the momentum at Tubi continued in the quarter where its stellar growth has led to its emergence as the most watched Free-Advertising-Supported-Television service in the United States. Against a backdrop of macroeconomic uncertainty, our portfolio of leadership brands combined with our balance sheet strength position us well to allow us to focus on creating shareholder value for the long term.""Story continues REVIEW OF OPERATING RESULTSThree Months EndedMarch 31,Nine Months EndedMarch 31,2023202220232022$ MillionsRevenues by Component:Affiliate fee$1,857$1,797$5,280$5,152Advertising1,8751,3075,5984,845Other3523511,003944Total revenues$4,084$3,455$11,881$10,941Segment Revenues:Cable Network Programming$1,570$1,583$4,633$4,637Television2,4751,8207,1236,160Other, Corporate and Eliminations3952125144Total revenues$4,084$3,455$11,881$10,941Adjusted EBITDA:Cable Network Programming$792$864$1,887$2,306Television11735782121Other, Corporate and Eliminations(76)(88)(213)(242)Adjusted EBITDA3$833$811$2,456$2,185Depreciation and amortization:Cable Network Programming$18$16$52$43Television38289782Other, Corporate and Eliminations5048159139Total depreciation and amortization$106$92$308$264 CABLE NETWORK PROGRAMMINGThree Months EndedMarch 31,Nine Months EndedMarch 31,2023202220232022$ MillionsRevenuesAffiliate fee$1,093$1,097$3,148$3,162Advertising3163391,0831,104Other161147402371Total revenues1,5701,5834,6334,637Operating expenses(610)(580)(2,271)(1,940)Selling, general and administrative(172)(144)(487)(405)Amortization of cable distribution investments451214Segment EBITDA$792$864$1,887$2,306 Cable Network Programming reported quarterly segment revenues of $1.57 billion as compared to $1.58 billion in the prior year quarter.

Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS are not measures of performance under GAAP and should be considered in addition to, and not as substitutes for, net income attributable to Fox Corporation stockholders and EPS as reported in accordance with GAAP. However, management uses these measures in comparing the Company's historical performance and believes that they provide meaningful and comparable information to management, investors and equity analysts to assist in their analysis of the Company's performance relative to prior periods and the Company's competitors.The following table reconciles net income and EPS attributable to Fox Corporation stockholders to Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022:Three Months EndedMarch 31, 2023March 31, 2022IncomeEPSIncomeEPS$ Millions, except per share dataNet (loss) income$(50)$290Less: Net income attributable to    noncontrolling interests(4)(7)Net (loss) income attributable to Fox    Corporation stockholders$(54)$(0.10)$283$0.50Other, net5,67201.372340.41Tax provision6(172)(0.33)(58)(0.10)As adjusted6$494$0.94$459$0.81 NOTE 2 – ADJUSTED EBITDA Adjusted EBITDA is defined as Revenues less Operating expenses and Selling, general and administrative expenses. Adjusted EBITDA does not include: Amortization of cable distribution investments, Depreciation and amortization, Impairment and restructuring charges, Interest expense, net, Other, net and Income tax expense.Management believes that information about Adjusted EBITDA assists all users of the Company's Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements by allowing them to evaluate changes in the operating results of the Company's portfolio of businesses separate from non-operational factors that affect net income, thus providing insight into both operations and the other factors that affect reported results. Adjusted EBITDA provides management, investors and equity analysts a measure to analyze the operating performance of the Company's business and its enterprise value against historical data and competitors' data, although historical results, including Adjusted EBITDA, may not be indicative of future results (as operating performance is highly contingent on many factors, including customer tastes and preferences).Adjusted EBITDA is considered a non-GAAP financial measure and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, net income, cash flow and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP. In addition, this measure does not reflect cash available to fund requirements and excludes items, such as depreciation and amortization and impairment charges, which are significant components in assessing the Company's financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.The following table reconciles net income to Adjusted EBITDA for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022:Three Months EndedMarch 31,Nine Months EndedMarch 31,2023202220232022$ MillionsNet (Loss) Income$(50)$290$884$925Add:Amortization of cable distribution investments451214Depreciation and amortization10692308264Interest expense, net5591183285Other, net7719233722375Income tax (benefit) expense(1)100347322Adjusted EBITDA$833$811$2,456$2,185 1Excludes net income effects of Impairment and restructuring charges, adjustments to Equity (losses) earnings of affiliates, Other, net and tax provision adjustments.

The decision to dismiss the lawsuit does not mean she has settled the case, her lawyer, Tanvir Rahman, said Monday. She is continuing her related lawsuit against Fox in New York.""This isn't the end-all, be-all of those claims,"" Rahman said. ""We are figuring out the next steps.""Rahman said one option could be to amend the New York complaint or file a new lawsuit in a different jurisdiction.Grossberg served as head of booking guests on recently fired Fox News host Tucker Carlson's weeknight prime-time show. Prior to that, she was a producer for Fox host Maria Bartiromo's Sunday morning show.She was fired after filing her litigation on March 20 in federal court in Manhattan. Fox said her legal claims were ""riddled with false allegations against Fox and our employees.""In seeking unspecified monetary damages, Grossberg claimed she was subjected to a hostile and discriminatory work environment. She accused Fox of defamation, gender and religious discrimination, and pay equity violations.Grossberg also said Fox intimidated her and fraudulently induced her to make false statements in her September 2022 deposition in the Dominion lawsuit.On April 18 Fox agreed to pay Dominion $787.5 million to settle the voting-technology company's defamation lawsuit in Delaware.

The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Fox is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for FOXA in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 90 cents per share for FOXA, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 88 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for FOXA, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +2.11% heading into earnings season.Fox Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseFox Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseFox Corporation price-eps-surprise | Fox Corporation QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market.

IBM at the time said Watson could “learn” and process human language. But Watson's high cost at the time made it a challenge for companies to use, according to Reuters reporting.Fast forward a decade, chatbot ChatGPT's overnight success is making AI adoption at companies a focus, and IBM is looking to grab new business. This time, the lower cost of implementing the large language AI models means the chances of success are high, IBM CEO Arvind Krishna told Reuters ahead of the company's annual Think conference.""When something becomes 100 times cheaper, it really sets up an attraction that's very, very different,"" said Krishna. ""The first barrier to create the model is high, but once you've done that, to adapt that model for a hundred or a thousand different tasks is very easy and can be done by a non-expert.""Krishna said AI could reduce certain back office jobs at IBM in the coming years. ""That doesn't mean the total employment decreases,"" he said about some media reports talking about IBM pausing hiring for thousands of jobs that AI could replace.""That gives the ability to plow a lot more investment into value-creating activities...We hired more people than were let go because we're hiring into areas where there is a lot more demand from our clients.""He added that IBM was also embracing a more open ecosystem and partnering with open-source AI software development hub Hugging Face and others.IBM said companies can use the watsonx platform to train and deploy AI models, automatically generate code using natural language and use various large language models built for different purposes such as chemical creation or climate change modeling.(Reporting By Jane Lanhee Lee; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)]"

Enterprises turning to AI today need access to a full technology stack that enables them to train, tune and deploy AI models, including foundation models and machine learning capabilities, across their organization with trusted data, speed, and governance - all in one place and to run across any cloud environment.IBM Think 2023Also at Think, IBM is announcing further planned advancements, including a GPU-as-a-service infrastructure offering designed to support AI-intensive workloads, an AI-powered dashboard to measure, track, manage, and help report on cloud carbon emissions, and a new practice for watsonx and generative AI from IBM Consulting that will support client deployment of AI.With watsonx, IBM is offering an AI development studio with access to IBM-curated and trained foundation models and open-source models, access to a data store to enable the gathering and cleansing of training and tuning data, and a toolkit for governance of AI into the hands of businesses that will provide a seamless end-to-end AI workflow that will make AI easier to adapt and scale.""With the development of foundation models, AI for business is more powerful than ever,"" said Arvind Krishna, IBM Chairman and CEO. ""Foundation models make deploying AI significantly more scalable, affordable, and efficient. We built IBM watsonx for the needs of enterprises, so that clients can be more than just users, they can become AI advantaged. With IBM watsonx, clients can quickly train and deploy custom AI capabilities across their entire business, all while retaining full control of their data.""Story continuesClients will have access to the toolset, technology, infrastructure, and consulting expertise to build their own — or fine-tune and adapt available AI models — on their own data and deploy them at scale in a more trustworthy and open environment to drive business success. Competitive differentiation and unique business value will be able to be increasingly derived from how adaptable an AI model can be to an enterprise's unique data and domain knowledge.The IBM watsonx platform consists of three unique product sets to address these needs:IBM watsonx.ai: A next generation enterprise studio, expected to be generally available in July 2023, for AI builders to train, test, tune, and deploy both traditional machine learning and new generative AI capabilities powered by foundation models through an open and intuitive user interface.The AI studio provides a range of foundation models, training and tuning tools, and cost-effective infrastructure that facilitate the entire data and AI lifecycle, from data preparation to model development, deployment, and monitoring.The studio also includes a foundation model library that gives users easy access to IBM curated and trained foundation models.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the data center industry, you can go directly to the 5 Best Data Center Stocks to Buy Now.Data Center companies worldwide posted record revenues in 2022, which reached $321.47 billion, according to a Statista analysis. The analysis anticipates the market to add more than $20 billion to the valuation by the end of this year. The 2022 performance is impressive, considering the global data center revenue was sub-$200 billion just two years ago.According to a research by Allied Market Research, the data center market was worth $187.35 billion in 2020 and was expected to clock $517.17 billion by 2030. Interestingly, Statista's analysis reaches a valuation close to Allied Market Research's, positing that the global data centers market will generate approximately $410.40 billion in revenue by 2027. However, the former's CAGR is significantly smaller, at 4.66%, compared to Allied Market Research's 10.50%. The CAGR mismatch notwithstanding, there appears to be strong agreement that the data centers market has immense potential to break past the half trillion USD mark before the decade's end.The CAGRs that several analyses are quoting at which the data center services market will grow in a particular forecast period are incredible. For example, Allied Market Research quotes 10.50% between 2021 and 2030, while Mordor Intelligence's figure is 13.69% between 2021 and 2026. In this light, a question arises: How will the market achieve an astronomical growth rate? In other words, what factors will drive the growth incredible growth?For Mordor Intelligence, the growing demand for cloud services will carry much weight. The claim is perhaps in response to a Markets and Markets report, which established that the cloud computing market will expand at a 17% CAGR between 2022 and 2027, reaching $1,240.90 billion. Since data centers provide the critical infrastructure that keeps the cloud computing market running, any expansion that cloud computing posts naturally reaches data center services companies.Story continuesBesides cloud computing, increasing demand for e-commerce services will also spur growth in the data center services market. According to Statista, the revenue generated by e-commerce companies worldwide could reach $4.11 trillion at the end of this year. The organization makes a bolder claim that the market should be worth $6.35 trillion by 2027, thanks to an 11.51% CAGR. With the expansion of the e-commerce space comes the possibility of the data center services market's growth potential blowing up. This is because e-commerce customers want more personalized data and better recommendations for what products to buy, which is made possible by services undergirded by data centers.As the growth potential of the data center services market expands, the companies involved in this space have more room to grow revenues. Consequently, with stronger financials comes an increased likelihood for the stocks to climb higher. The corporations whose businesses undergird the data center services market include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), and Equinix Inc (NASDAQ:EQIX).Best Data Center Stocks to Buy Now Our MethodologyWe scanned Insider Monkey's database of 943 hedge funds and picked 11 data center stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors.Best Data Center Stocks to Buy Now 11.

With failed crops, low yields for farmers and diminished grazing for cattle, the Texas Department of Agriculture identified climate change as a potential threat to the state's food supply.Smallholder farmers, particularly those in arid and drought-prone regions, struggle to manage their farms because they lack access to guidance on how much water to use for specific crops to ensure a good yield.""We're in hills, so some areas need less water, and some areas need more,"" said David Chapin, a farmer and IBMer in Lampasas, Texas, that has been helping IBM test water management solutions. ""I don't really know which areas I'm overwatering, and which areas I'm underwatering, so I just take a chance and make adjustments by eye. That's not always the best way to do it. I need a more scientific approach.""That's where digital agriculture comes in.Developing a solution for real-world impactWhat if there was a tool that could recommend when and how much farmers should water their crops, resulting in a reduction in input costs, improved yields and a reduction of polluting runoff? With IBM and Texas A&amp;M AgriLife's partnership through the IBM Sustainability Accelerator, a pro bono social impact program, the development of such a tool is well underway.Apply to the 3rd cohort of the IBM Sustainability Accelerator by May 31, 2023IBM and Texas A&amp;M AgriLife are working together to help farmers receive insights for water usage, which can further crop yield increases while decreasing economic and environmental costs. Texas A&amp;M AgriLife and IBM will deploy and scale Liquid Prep, a tech solution that provides ""when to water"" decision support to farmers, in arid regions of the United States.Using data to inform crop management strategiesTo generate high-quality insights for farmers, it takes huge quantities of data from various sources.Story continuesThe tool works by placing low-cost sensors developed by IBMers into the soil to record moisture and temperature levels, which are then uploaded to the IBM Cloud.The Liquid Prep app will combine weather forecast data from the IBM Environmental Intelligence Suite, crop-specific information from the Soil &amp; Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) (which is co-managed by Texas A&amp;M AgriLife and the United States Department of Agriculture), and real-time soil moisture data from the new sensors. The app will analyze the combined data using artificial intelligence to provide farmers with recommendations on when and how much to water via a smartphone app.""Different soil has different water retention capacity, crop information and crop demands that differ during the season,"" said Gurjinder Baath, Assistant Professor at Texas A&amp;M AgriLife Research. ""We are trying to integrate all these important pieces of information together in this app so a more effective, reliable decision for irrigation can be generated.""What's next for Liquid PrepLiquid Prep is currently in the second phase of the 2-year IBM Sustainability Accelerator program, which is centered on the development and implementation of the tool. Within the first phase, a technical roadmap was produced via the IBM Garage to guide solution design, development and deployment of the solution. New versions of the app and sensor are currently being tested.To ensure the tool was adequately meeting farmers' needs, the researchers also needed to generate feedback from those whom the tool will be targeted to help. Farmers, researchers and water managers in Alabama, Louisiana and Texas tested the previous version of the solution throughout 2022. Over 100 smallholder farmers will be targeted in 2023 to test the solution in Louisiana.""We are trying to get in touch with as many farming communities as possible, and we are trying to get their feedback, because farmers' issues are different,"" Gurjinder said.In addition, IBM is bringing in strategic allies to contribute even more value to the project. For example, the team will work with the Ukrainian Hydrometeorological Institute to gather more data to train and fine-tune the machine learning models used to generate recommendations to farmers. Ukraine is known as the ""breadbasket of Europe,"" so the distinct properties of the region will provide a valuable dataset to help improve the tool.Through this partnership, the tool will also be given a new use case: to guide recovery and resource management amid the war in Ukraine. With information and farming resources difficult to access, the researchers are working on developing a flood and drought assessment system to identify the most affected regions that need the most resources and support.There is power in partnershipsBy uniting experts and technology with the purpose of improving the lives of populations most affected by environmental threats, we have the potential to make lasting, scalable impact on populations in need. IBM's technology and expertise, combined with the background and resources of Texas A&amp;M AgriLife, has increased Liquid Prep's potential to help people around the world.The IBM Sustainability Accelerator helps populations most vulnerable to environmental threats, and has also empowered smallholder farmers in Latin America in the fight for food security. In March, IBM announced a new opportunity to support even more organizations developing solutions like Liquid Prep. The company is currently accepting proposals for the 3rd cohort of the IBM Sustainability Accelerator, which will focus on water management solutions.

Operating income of the segment totaled $3 billion, ahead of its Zacks Consensus Estimate by 19.9%.Marathon Petroleum reported revenues of $35.1 billion, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $32.4 billion but dropped 8.6% year over year on lower-than-expected throughput volumes.In October 2022, the company completed its target of buying back $15 billion in common stock. This was after Marathon Petroleum concluded the sale of its Speedway business, comprising approximately 3,900 c-stores in 35 states to Japan-based retail group Seven &amp;i Holdings — the owner of the 7-Eleven convenience store chain — for $21 billion.In the first quarter, MPC repurchased $3.2 billion of shares and a further $1.2 billion worth of shares in April. The company, which gave an additional $5 billion share repurchase approval, currently has a remaining authorization of $9 billion.Marathon Petroleum Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseMarathon Petroleum Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseMarathon Petroleum Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Marathon Petroleum Corporation Quote Inside MPC’s SegmentsRefining &amp; Marketing: The Refining &amp; Marketing segment reported an operating income of $3 billion, which soared from the year-ago profit of just $768 million. The jump primarily reflects higher year-over-year margins and refined product sales that more than offset lower capacity utilization.Specifically, the refining margin of $26.15 per barrel improved significantly from $15.31 a year ago. Capacity utilization during the quarter was 89% compared to 91% in the corresponding period of 2022. The tickdown reflects planned maintenance activity in the Gulf Coast region.Story continuesMeanwhile, total refined product sales volumes were 3,352 thousand barrels per day (mbpd), up from 3,293 mbpd in the year-ago quarter. Throughput also edged up from 2,833 mbpd in the year-ago quarter to 2,837 mbpd but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 2,851 mbpd.Further, operating costs per barrel increased 8.8% year over year to $5.68. The cost escalation was blamed on turnaround-related outgo.Midstream: This unit mainly reflects Marathon Petroleum’s general partner and majority limited partner interests in MPLX LP MPLX — a publicly traded master limited partnership that owns, operates, develops and acquires pipelines and other midstream assets.Segment profitability was $1.2 billion, up 13.2% from the first quarter of 2022. Earnings were supported by higher tariff rates and the stable, fee-based revenues from MPLX’s wide range of midstream energy services.Costs, Capex &amp; Balance SheetMarathon Petroleum, carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), reported expenses of $31 billion in first-quarter 2023, down 4.2% from the year-ago quarter.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.In the reported quarter, Marathon Petroleum spent $690 million on capital programs (61% on Refining &amp; Marketing and 35% on the Midstream segment) compared to $573 million in the year-ago period. As of Mar 31, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $8 billion and total debt, including that of MPLX, of $27.3 billion, with a debt-to-capitalization of 45.5%.Some Key Refining EarningsWhile we have discussed MPC’s fourth-quarter results in detail, let’s see how some other refining companies have fared this earnings season.Phillips 66 PSX reported adjusted earnings per share of $4.21, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.58. Moreover, the bottom line improved significantly from a profit of $1.32 per share in the year-ago quarter.PSX’s worldwide margins almost doubled to $20.72 per barrel from the year-ago quarter’s $10.83. The same in the Central Corridor and Atlantic Basin/Europe increased to $26.86 and $16.13 per barrel from the year-ago levels of $7.89 and $11.71, respectively. In the Gulf Coast, the metric registered an improvement to $21.28 per barrel from $8.59 in the prior-year quarter. However, the West Coast witnessed a decline in margins from $17.74 per barrel in the year-ago quarter to $16.53 in the March-end quarter of 2023.Another refining giant, Valero Energy VLO, also reported strong first-quarter earnings. The bottom line of $8.27 per share came in well above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.24. The outperformance reflects increased refinery throughput volumes and a higher refining margin. In particular, adjusted operating income in the Refining unit amounted to $4.1 billion, surging from $1.5 billion in the year-ago quarter.At the end of the first quarter, VLO had cash and cash equivalents of $5.5 billion, while the company’s total debt and finance lease obligations amounted to $11.4 billion.

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this refiner have returned -16.9%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +1.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry, which Marathon Petroleum falls in, has lost 7.2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Marathon Petroleum is expected to post earnings of $5.56 per share, indicating a change of -47.6% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -11.5% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $20.85 points to a change of -20.3% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +2.5%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.94 indicates a change of -38% from what Marathon Petroleum is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +7%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Marathon Petroleum is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for MPC _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Marathon Petroleum, the consensus sales estimate of $32.34 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -40.4%. The $134.53 billion and $127.53 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -25.2% and -5.2%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryMarathon Petroleum reported revenues of $35.08 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -8.6%. EPS of $6.09 for the same period compares with $1.49 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $32.45 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +8.11%. The EPS surprise was +6.1%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Marathon Petroleum is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Marathon Petroleum. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Because of their massive footprint, these high-profile companies feature transparent, predictable businesses. However, the other side of this relationship centers on a decided lack of upside potential.Nevertheless, every now and then, some top enterprises slip under the radar. Here, the best blue-chip stocks for 2023 might not always be generating headlines. Or if they do, those headlines might not be the most encouraging for prospective investors. Still, underneath the hood lie compelling operations that may yield significant rewards. In other words, you can have your cake and eat it too. For risk-averse investors, these are the blue-chip stocks with strong fundamentals to consider.LRCXLam Research$497.40MPCMarathon Petroleum$122.53AMATApplied Materials$110.31EQNREquinor$28.16TSMTaiwan Semiconductor$82.25RIORio Tinto$75.97MRNAModerna$130.72InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsLam Research (LRCX)Blue poker chips stacked next to three stacks of $100 bills representing blue chip stocksSource: ShutterstockAn American supplier of wafer fabrication equipment and related services to the semiconductor industry, Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX) easily ranks among the hidden-gem blue-chip stocks to buy now; that is, of course, you’re one of those experts on wafer fabrication equipment. Lam’s quiet, everyday relevance for critical semiconductor industries launched LRCX to a nearly 21% return so far this year. In the past 365 days, it’s up over 9%.Financially, what makes Lam an all-around strong candidate for best blue-chip stocks for 2023 is consistency. As data from Gurufocus.com demonstrates, Lam is consistently profitable. As well, it features a three-year revenue growth rate of 26.6%, above 81.77% of sector players.Enticingly, LRCX also ranks among the blue-chip stocks with low risk and high reward. At present, the market prices shares at a forward multiple of 17.61. As a discount to projected earnings, Lam ranks better than 61.19% of the competition. Finally, Wall Street analysts peg LRCX as a consensus moderate buy. On average, the price target is $545.06, implying 9% upside potential. However, the most optimistic target calls for $600 or up 20%.Story continuesMarathon Petroleum (MPC)A close-up shot of a blue casino chip on red carpet.Source: ShutterstockA relatively easy case for blue-chip stocks to buy now, Marathon Petroleum (NYSE:MPC) specializes in petroleum refining, marketing, and transportation. The former two components represent the downstream segment of the hydrocarbon energy value chain whereas the latter aligns with the midstream segment. Fundamentally, the possible rise in energy prices due to broader oil production cuts cynically augurs well for MPC.Another attractive feature for MPC is that it also ranks among the blue-chip stocks with strong fundamentals. Operationally, Marathon’s three-year revenue growth rate pings at 27.1%, outpacing 81.45% of sector rivals. Also, its free cash flow growth rate during the same period is 57.1%, above 85.28% of competitors.Notably, investors can also consider MPC as one of the blue-chip stocks with low risk and high reward. Currently, the market prices MPC at a trailing multiple of 4.31. As a discount to earnings, Marathon ranks better than 71.79% of the competition. Lastly, analysts peg MPC as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target comes out to $150.85, implying over 22% upside potential.Applied Materials (AMAT)blue chip definition highlightedSource: ShutterstockHeadquartered in Santa Clara, California, Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) is a leader in materials engineering solutions. Enterprise-level clients use Applied Materials’ offerings to produce virtually every new chip and advanced display in the world, per the company’s website. Thanks to its powerful relevancies, AMAT deserves consideration as one of the blue-chip stocks to buy now. Since the Jan. opener, shares popped up over 14%.Overall, AMAT also legitimately deserves the label of blue-chip stock with strong fundamentals. Anchored by a solid balance sheet, investors may focus on the company’s three-year revenue growth rate of 23.9%, which beats out 77.7% of other semiconductor firms. Also, its FCF growth rate pings at an impressive 21% during the aforementioned period.Enticingly, the market prices AMAT at a forward multiple of 14.98. As a discount to projected earnings, Applied Materials ranks better than 66.42% of sector players. Also, it features a dividend yield of 0.92% and a low payout ratio of 13.2%, perhaps making it one of the blue-chip stocks with dividend growth. Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg AMAT as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target hits $135.77, implying nearly 23% upside potential.Equinor (EQNR)Source: ShutterstockBased in Norway, Equinor (NYSE:EQNR) is an international energy company. Throughout its history, Equinor converted natural resources into energy. Now, it’s embarking on a broader transition to support clean and renewable initiatives. Over the intermediate term, the bullish dynamics of the hydrocarbon market may lift EQNR. So far, though, EQNR gave up 13% of its equity value since the Jan. opener.Despite the turbulence, EQNR deserves consideration as one of the blue-chip stocks to buy now. Financially, the company benefits from robust stats. For instance, Equinor commands a cash-to-debt ratio of 1.22, above nearly 61% of sector peers. Operationally, it enjoys an impressive three-year revenue growth rate of 39.5%.Also, what makes EQNR a candidate for the best blue-chip stocks for 2023 is the value proposition. Currently, shares run a price-earnings-growth ratio of only 0.11 times. In contrast, the sector median stands at 0.76 times. To close out, analysts peg EQNR as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target lands at $37.05, implying 31% upside potential.Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM)10 Small-Cap Stocks to Buy Before They Grow UpSource: ShutterstockAlthough it’s difficult to call Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) a candidate for hidden gem blue-chip stocks to buy now, it does make an intriguingly bullish case. First, let’s get address the giant pink elephant in the room. Due to worsening tensions between the U.S. and China, Taiwan Semiconductor operates in a geopolitical hotspot. Still, unless the Chinese government seeks to destroy its economy, it may play it cool regarding the breakaway island.Financially, the company surprisingly delivers the goods because of its massive importance to the global semiconductor supply chain. Notably, TSM’s three-year revenue growth rate comes out to 28.4%, ranked better than 83.28% of its peers. Also, its FCF growth rate during the same period lands at an impressive 53%.For all the heat, TSM is undervalued, making it one of the best blue-chip stocks for 2023. Presently, the market prices TSM at a forward multiple of 15.64, favorably below 64.18% of the industry. Looking to the Street, analysts peg TSM as a unanimous strong buy. Their average price target stands at $118.67, implying over 44% upside potential.Rio Tinto (RIO)Source: ShutterstockA mining and exploration company, Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) deserves the label of hidden gem blue-chip stocks to buy now. Primarily, the company’s headquarters are located in the U.K., making it less likely to be known by the average American. Also, Rio’s core industry – metals mining and extracting – isn’t the sexiest in the world now dominated by memes. Plus, since the Jan. opener, RIO slipped almost 13%.Taking the negativity aside, RIO makes for one of the best blue-chip stocks to buy for 2023 because of its core financials. Operationally, the company features a three-year revenue growth rate of 11.7%, outpacing 61.5% of its peers. On the bottom line, its trailing-year net margin stands at 22.31%, above 86.52%.As a bonus, Rio Tinto is undervalued. The market prices RIO at a forward multiple of 8.48. As a discount to projected earnings, the mining specialist ranks better than 68.78% of the competition. Lastly, analysts peg RIO as a unanimous strong buy. Their average price target pings at $95.64, implying 54% upside potential.Moderna (MRNA)Source: ShutterstockWhile it’s not quite a hidden gem, biopharmaceutical firm Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA) could be a hidden gem right now. With fears of the SARS-CoV-2 virus all but shriveled in the rearview mirror, nobody cares about the vaccine race. Well, I shouldn’t say nobody cares but the furor certainly subsided. Nevertheless, Moderna can leverage its acumen to develop more relevant solutions, making it a worthwhile idea.For its long-term potential, MRNA should rank among the blue-chip stocks to buy now. As well, the finances bolster confidence in the bullish view. Currently, Moderna features an Altman Z-Score of 8.09, indicating high fiscal stability and a low risk of bankruptcy. Operationally, its three-year revenue growth rate shot up into the stratosphere.Further, on the bottom line, the company prints a net margin of 44.3%, above nearly 96% of the competition. And it’s also technically undervalued, priced at only 6.76 times trailing earnings. On a final note, analysts peg MRNA as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $221.92, implying almost 65% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered supplemental to, and not a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The Company's definitions of these non-GAAP measures may differ from similarly titled measures used by others. The non-GAAP financial measures used in this press release adjust for specified items that can be highly variable or difficult to predict. The Company generally uses these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate management's financial and operational decision-making, including evaluation of the Company's historical operating results, comparison to competitors' operating results and determination of management incentive compensation. These non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of the Company's operations that, when viewed with GAAP results and the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, may provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting the Company's business. Because non-GAAP financial measures exclude the effect of items that will increase or decrease the Company's reported results of operations, management strongly encourages investors to review the Company's consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the tables accompanying this release.Cautionary StatementThis release contains ""forward-looking"" statements regarding future results and events.

But don't let that distract from the very nice return generated over three years. In the last three years the share price is up, 57%: better than the market.So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress. View our latest analysis for Waters To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During three years of share price growth, Waters achieved compound earnings per share growth of 11% per year. This EPS growth is lower than the 16% average annual increase in the share price. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did three years ago. It is quite common to see investors become enamoured with a business, after a few years of solid progress.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthIt's good to see that there was some significant insider buying in the last three months. That's a positive. That said, we think earnings and revenue growth trends are even more important factors to consider. Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here..A Different PerspectiveWaters shareholders are down 6.2% for the year, but the market itself is up 0.3%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 9%, each year, over five years. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Waters better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 1 warning sign  with Waters , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.Story continuesThere are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares.

These product launches might have been a tailwind.Further, strong demand in Xevo TQ Absolute and Xevo G3, WAT’s recent instruments, is expected to have benefited the top line in the underlying quarter.This apart, continuous investments in liquid chromatography instruments, mass spectrometers and chemistries are likely to have contributed to the top line in the to-be-reported quarter.Waters’ robust liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry solution, named BioAccord, is expected to have continued benefiting its quarterly performance.Additionally, Waters’ large molecule applications are expected to have witnessed a strong adoption rate, which is likely to get reflected in the first-quarter results.Waters is expected to have continued performing well in Asia, Europe and the Americas in the quarter under discussion.However, supply-chain disruptions due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic might get reflected in the upcoming quarterly results.Increasing expenses, supply-chain constraints and inflationary pressure are expected to have affected WAT’s quarterly performance.Story continuesWhat Our Model SaysOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Waters this time around.

For investors looking to follow in his footsteps, identifying undervalued Buffett stocks to buy in 2023 is an excellent place to start.But with so many available stocks, which are the best Buffett stocks to consider? This article will examine the three most undervalued Buffett stocks to buy in May 2023, offering investors a solid starting point for their investment portfolios.By focusing on undervalued Buffett value stocks, investors can take advantage of the Oracle of Omaha’s time-tested approach to investing, while potentially realizing significant gains over the long term.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsBuffett’s impressive investment record has earned him legendary status. As a result, concentrating on his stock picks can bring peace of mind.So, let’s look at the top three undervalued Buffett stocks to consider in 2023.GMGeneral Motors$31.71UPSUnited Parcel Service$173.55CVXChevron$156.62General Motors (GM)General Motors (GM) headquarters building with blue GM logoSource: Linda Parton / Shutterstock.comGeneral Motors (NYSE:GM) is a stock on the radar of value investors. GM has been one of the best Buffett stocks to buy in recent years because of its solid fundamentals and undervaluation.GM is the second largest U.S. electric vehicle maker and plans multiple EV launches in 2023 including the Silverado EV will launch to fleets in Q2, the Blazer EV is coming this summer and the Equinox EV later this year.GM’s commercial unit, BrightDrop, aims for $1 billion in revenue. This year, it will increase the delivery of electric vans.GM aims to achieve $225 billion of total revenue by 2025, including at least $50 billion from electric vehicles. Economies of scale and falling battery costs will drive profitability in the electric vehicle business by then.GM aims to attain a revenue of approximately $300 billion by 2030 while simultaneously expanding its operating margins to the low teens as part of its long-term objectives.Story continuesAdditionally, the company’s self-driving unit, Cruise, is expected to generate revenue of $50 billion by 2030.Although GM’s results may fluctuate with the economy, it’s in a good place to lead the EV industry. Its balance sheet’s strong, with $21.4 billion cash and $16.4 billion debt, which provides stability.GM is an ideal Buffett stock since it’s a dominant player in a concentrated industry with growth potential and an attractive valuation, making it a long-term investment.Its focus on electric vehicles and autonomous driving tech makes it one of the best Buffett stocks in 2023. Therefore, it’s an undervalued Buffett value stock to watch and one of the best Buffett stocks to buy in 2023.United Parcel Service (UPS)Close up of UPS logo printed on a delivery truck; partial view of the driver sitting at the wheel, waiting at a red traffic light in south San Francisco baySource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comUnited Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) has been doing poorly recently.UPS stock had its biggest one-day drop in three years because of weak Q1 2023 results and revised guidance.The package delivery company’s new forecast predicts 2023 revenue of $97 billion, a 12.8% adjusted operating margin, and $5.4 billion in dividend payments. This would end UPS’ recent strong growth trend, including 2022’s 10-year revenue high of over $100 billion and a 13% operating margin.Despite a potential all-time high dividend payment of $5.4 billion, UPS faces revenue, and operating margin declines because of challenging macro conditions and consumer behavior changes.UPS is continuously implementing a series of measures to improve its margins. CEO Carol Tome’s “better, not bigger” framework guides the company’s approach, focusing on maximizing existing assets and enhancing network productivity.In addition, UPS is showing a greater willingness to be selective in its deliveries rather than pursuing volume for the sake of it. The company is shifting its focus to prioritize profitable deliveries, resulting in a more profitable business model.Under Tomé’s leadership, UPS has focused on growing margins over volume, partnering with high-margin customers like big businesses, healthcare providers, and international deliveries.This strategy differentiates UPS from competitors and has proven successful, as the company earns more from these categories than from residential deliveries.Overall, UPS has strong potential as a long-term core holding due to its excellent management team led by CEO Carol Tomé. The recent weakness is a great reason to purchase more of this undervalued Buffett stock.Chevron (CVX)CVX stockSource: tishomir / Shutterstock.comThe stock market’s volatility can scare investors, but resilience is key to building long-term wealth. Following successful investors like Warren Buffett can calm nerves, especially when investing in dividend powerhouses like Chevron (NYSE:CVX), with a yield of 3.68%.Warren Buffett’s portfolio includes a $28.6 billion stake in Chevron, an oil supermajor. The Oracle of Omaha purchased Chevron stock in Q4 2020, making up approximately 8.2% of his portfolio.Chevron’s status as a premier dividend opportunity among energy stocks makes it no surprise that Buffett is enthusiastic about its stocks. The Big Oil company has hiked its dividend distribution for 36 consecutive years.According to management’s dividend policy, it plans to continue for the next five years, provided that the benchmark oil price, Brent Crude per barrel, averages above $50.Want to continue reading about long-term stock picks?

It leaves investors with a great payout and increased dividend potential due to being able to purchase more shares with less capital.There are a couple of metrics and company highlights to find bargain stocks. Price-to-earnings (P/E) is one of the most popular ratios. Typically, a low P/E ratio is 20 or less, but this ratio depends on the industry. Also, shareholder equity will tell you what the company would be worth if it was liquidated and all debts were paid off. The last significant piece to pay attention to is simple. Has the company grown steadily over the years regarding net income and revenue? The company may be experiencing a rough patch if the share price falls. But, if there is solid growth in the past, that is a good indicator for the future.Here are three companies with undervalued stocks to buy.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsGeneral Motors (GM)Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comGeneral Motors (NYSE:GM) is an auto manufacturer with legacy brands such as Chevrolet, GMC, and Buick. GM begun to ramp up its Electric Vehicle (EV) production. In April, they overtook Ford (NYSE:F) in total EV sales with over 20,000 being sold in the first quarter of 2023. Those numbers ranked it as the second largest American manufacturer of EVs only behind Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).Additionally, Morgan Stanley analysts have upgraded General Motors to a buy, and it’s expected to outperform other companies within its industry. GM currently has a one-year price target that predicts a possible increase in the share price of nearly 50%.On April 25, the company released its first-quarter earnings for 2023. They reported revenue growth of 11% and EPS of $1.69, which is up 25% compared to the previous year. With the company’s share price being cut in half since a near all-time high back at the beginning of 2022. GM has been massively oversold and has room to grow following its continued positive EV news and EPS growth.Story continuesJackson Financial (JXN)Source: ShutterstockJackson Financial (NYSE:JXN) is a financial holdings company that supplies a wide range of retirement products, such as annuities and life insurance policies. In February, Jackson Financial increased its quarterly dividend to 62 cents, a 13% increase compared to the previous year.JXN released its full-year earnings report for 2022 showing revenue growth of over 57% compared to the full-year 2021, and an EPS that nearly doubled.The company’s IPO date was mid-2021, and its share price reached an all-time high near $50 back in the middle of February. Since then the stock has fallen by over 25%, partially due to the disappointing fourth-quarter earnings results, but the company has seen very positive earnings year-over-year.Qualcomm (QCOM)Qualcomm (QCOM) logo on the side of a building in San Jose, CA.Source: jejim / Shutterstock.comQualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) is a global technology company that focuses on the wireless industry. They have seen a decrease in share price since its all-time high at the beginning of 2022. Their recent earnings were lackluster, with a decrease in revenue of 17% and an EPS that dropped by over 40%. They have also seen a decline in sales of some of their most popular products.QCOM really shined during Covid-19 pandemic. When they, along with other similar companies, saw a significant increase in sales. Qualcomm is still an industry leader and has year-over-year net income growth.

227,919f263d-f752-3593-9d08-d5a204ee6567,GM,2023-05-09,3 Top EV Industry Trends to Watch in 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-top-ev-industry-trends-194341246.html,1683229421,STORY,"['TSLA', 'F', 'GM']","[Undoubtedly, 2022 was an excellent year for the EV industry. In the U.S., 5.7% of all vehicles sold during the year were electric. That’s notable, because 5% has historically been a tipping point for mass adoption across other countries. This trend strongly suggests sustained future growth, and eliminates fears that the EV revolution will be a flash in the pan. They’re here to stay, meaning everyone will watch top EV industry trends in 2023.Those trends will affect participants from manufacturers to consumers to regulators and more. Let’s dive in, as these widespread catalysts take investors in the electrification realm on a wild ride.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsChanging Tax CreditsToy electric car and dollar bills. Money we spend on fancy cars and modern electronic devices on black mirrored background. 2023 EV tax creditSource: Roschetzky Photography / Shutterstock.comOne of the most important trends in the EV sector this year is the changing tax credits. Federal income tax credit rules for EVs are changing significantly in 2023. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) is an important legislation related to this conversation.The IRA effectively reshaped the eligibility landscape for EVs. Some manufacturers had been ineligible for the credit, as it required 200,000 EV sales per the previous regulations. The IRA removed that clause, making those manufacturers eligible again. At the same time, the IRA now requires EVs to be made in North America, invalidating previously-qualified EVs.The Department of Energy is undertaking a massive push to convert light-duty vehicles to electric vehicles. The impetus was a study finding that it would be the most significant opportunity to achieve a net-zero economy by 2050.Further, tax credits will only apply to specific vehicle classes at certain price points. Large EVS must be priced below $80,000, and small EVs below $55,000.Lower PricesTesla (TSLA stock) Motors store in Piazza Gae Aulenti square in Milan, ItalySource: Zigres / Shutterstock.comLower prices are a clear focal point across the EV sector in 2023. Elon Musk has slashed prices on the most popular Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) vehicles several times this year. So far, rival legacy auto manufacturers Ford (NYSE:F) and General Motors (NYSE:GM) have remained firmly committed to keeping prices unchanged.Story continuesMusk’s intent is clear. Tesla aims to produce 2 million vehicles in 2023, double the number it had a year ago. Margins will decrease, but the logic is that the volume increase will more than makeup for that decline. Tesla’s rivals warn that its fleet of vehicles may already be stale and need a refresh. In focusing on volume, they warn Tesla will fall farther behind.While the outcome of Tesla’s strategy remains to be seen, lower prices are likely to be a norm for 2023. The government’s incentivizing of lower-priced vehicles in combination with credits could spare demand in lower-priced cars. Meanwhile, volume has become a paramount metric, and other manufacturers may lower prices and follow Tesla’s lead to spike sales.A Focus on InfrastructureA series of roads and overpasses connect in an aerial view.Source: ShutterstockI think 2023 will see a continued focus on infrastructure. If mass EV adoption is here, it will require a massive push to make charging infrastructure more available.The Biden Administration’s bipartisan Infrastructure Act is a big part of that conversation. It sets out goals for 500,000 EV chargers along U.S. highways by 2030. In addition, it aims to spur auto manufacturers to have 50% of all new car sales comprised of EVs by 2030.The law earmarks $7.5 billion for charging, $10 billion for clean transportation, and $7 billion for batteries. There are currently 130,000 EV chargers on U.S. roads. If 500,000 charging stations are to be built by 2030, it’s clear that a lot of activity will have to occur in the interim.Overall, look for a significant push toward all things infrastructure build-out related. Those chargers will need to be more available, reliable, and user-friendly. Government investment means that firms engaged in any such activities have apparent advantages for the medium-term.On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

With variables like rising interest rates, inflation, geopolitical tensions, and risk of economic slowdown there are so many factors that can shake out and unnerve investors. Nonetheless, market indexes have been very strong.The best way to stay grounded in markets like this is to utilize a proven process. The Zacks Rank is an extremely effective way to find stocks with a high likelihood of appreciating in price over the near-term, dramatically improving investors’ odds of success.Marriot International MAR, MGM Resorts International MGM, and United Airlines UAL are all Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks, indicating upward trending earnings revisions, and near-term bullish expectations.Upgrades across these three stocks may also indicate some interesting developments brewing. Each of these stocks were hit very hard following the Covid pandemic, and still hover around or below their pre-Covid highs. But with airlines, hotels and gaming companies expecting better earnings, we could be seeing the early stages of a full recovery and breakout in the tourism industry.This would run counter to the narrative of a slowing economy and may suggest a contrarian trade thesis. If so, each of these stocks could be starting a major bull run.Marriot InternationalWhile it has been a bumpy ride, Marriot International has been an extremely strong performing stock over the last 10 years. Compounding at an annual rate of 16% over that time, it has outperformed the broad market by a significant margin.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchEarnings estimates for Marriot International are extremely bullish. Analysts are in unanimous agreement in upgrading expectations, revising current quarter estimates 6% higher and FY23 estimates 7% higher over the last 60 days. Additionally, during the most recent quarterly report, MAR beat earnings expectations by 12%. In response to the beat, MAR stock rallied 5%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCurrent quarter sales are expected to be strong as well. Analysts are projecting 11.5% growth to $5.9 billion for the quarter, and 12% growth to $23.3 billion for FY23. These are very robust growth rates for such a mature company.MAR is trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 21x, which is below the industry average of 22x, and below its 10-year median of 24x. As a leading franchise in the industry, with recognizable brands across the spectrum of customers, MAR is well positioned for near and long-term stock appreciation. Earnings upgrades, and historically lows valuations make for a very bullish setup.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMGM Resorts InternationalMGM Resorts International is an internationally recognized hotel and casino brand that has performed well over the last decade. MGM stock has underperformed the broad market over that period; however, it was able to make an epic comeback from its Covid pandemic lows.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMGM has several very promising business developments in the pipeline that should contribute to the top and bottom line over the very long term. Online sports betting and iGaming are a secular economic mega trend that MGM should benefit massively from. With extensive experience in traditional brick and mortar gaming operations, the transition to digital should be seamless. Since its launch in 2018 this segment has done extremely well and is now operating in 24 markets boasting a growing market share.Another major development is the acquisition of Empire City Casino in New York. Growing a footprint in a market as significant as New York will provide a new long-term source of revenue for the gaming giant.Analysts have revised earnings estimates significantly higher for MGM. After dealing with several quarters of negative earnings last year, profits have now flipped back to positive territory. This positive earnings metric was only priced in over the last two months, so estimates are now much higher.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAfter overcoming the challenges posed by the lockdowns in the US and more recently China, MGM has proven competent management and strong staying power. MGM is currently trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 22x, which is above the market average of 19x, and well below its 10-year median of 33x. This historically low valuation along with the multiple bullish catalysts listed makes MGM a strong candidate for investors portfolios.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchUnited Airlines United Airlines stock has struggled over the past decade. The underperformance is marked by a painful drop in 2020, which the stock has yet to recover from. However, improving earnings expectations, and a resumption of international and domestic travel may be exactly what UAL needs to start trending higher again.  Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAnalysts have unanimously upgraded earnings expectations for UAL. Current quarter earnings estimates have been revised higher by 50% over the past two months, and all other timeframes are expecting improved results as well. Current quarter sales are expected to grow 15% YoY to $13.9 billion and FY23 sales are expected to climb 18% YoY to $53 billion.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchUAL is trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 5x, which is below the industry average of 10x, and below its 10-year median of 9x. This is a historically cheap valuation for the airline and offers an opportunity to own an industry leading stock, that has several bullish catalysts on the horizon.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineMarket and industry dynamics have shifted at breakneck speed over the past three years. Tourism and travel were some of the sectors that took the worst of the economic pain. But these industries are clearly seeing a turn for the better. Having survived one of the worst possible scenarios these stocks should be better positioned than ever. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

To skip our detailed analysis of online shopping and its development in recent years, you can go directly to see the Top 5 Online Shopping Websites in USA in 2023.Electronic commerce, or e-commerce, has been a major part of the global economy for several years now. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted just how much utility can be found in this sector by offering consumers across the globe the option of shopping for essential goods at a time when one couldn't even leave their home.The e-commerce market is one that has grown exponentially for years, and this growth is expected to continue well into the next decade. As we mentioned in one of our previous articles, the ecommerce market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 11.9% from 2022 to 2030, rising from its value in 2022 ($48 billion) to $117.7 billion. This growth is expected even after the pandemic has ended since consumer behavior has been shaped at this point to prefer seamless and frictionless shopping experiences that are hassle-free and time-saving.Growth in Online ShoppingAccording to a survey conducted by professionals at PwC in December, 43% of global consumers are planning to increase their online shopping in the following six months. The survey also showed the interest of many consumers in next-generation digital platforms such as the metaverse. About 26% of the respondents in this survey noted that they had participated in metaverse-related activities in the six months leading up to December, for instance.While e-commerce has been growing, in-store shopping managed to retain its position as the most popular mode of shopping, according to the survey. About 43% of the respondents picked in-store shopping as their mode of shopping in December. However, shopping online through mobile phones was the second-most popular option, with 34% of the respondents picking this mode. The third and fourth-most popular modes were also online, through personal computers or tablets (23% and 15%, respectively). This shows that online shopping is managing to retain its popularity even in a post-COVID world.Story continuesAs a result, major retailers such as Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), and Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) that also operate online shopping websites are continuing to rake in profits. Even though inflation is resulting in many consumers cutting down their spending, the vast majority of the global population is continuing to shop online, enabling the e-commerce sector to maintain its profitability. Hence, we have compiled a list below of the top US online shopping websites in 2023 to highlight the major players in this dynamic and ever-evolving sector.Top Online Shopping Websites in USA in 2023Photo by CardMapr.nl on UnsplashLet's now take a look at the top 20 online shopping websites in USA in 2023.Our MethodologyTo compile our list below, we selected American online shopping websites that are popular among online shoppers in the US and which generate the largest revenues in the country.

(NASDAQ:ISRG) boasts of strong institutional backing",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/87-ownership-intuitive-surgical-inc-140032315.html,1683554432.0,STORY,['ISRG'],"[Key InsightsInstitutions' substantial holdings in Intuitive Surgical implies that they have significant influence over the company's share price50% of the business is held by the top 21 shareholders Analyst forecasts along with ownership data serve to give a strong idea about prospects for a businessEvery investor in Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 87% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Intuitive Surgical, beginning with the chart below. Check out our latest analysis for Intuitive Surgical ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Intuitive Surgical?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Intuitive Surgical. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Intuitive Surgical's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Intuitive Surgical. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 8.4%. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 8.1% and 6.0% of the stock.Story continuesA closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 21 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Intuitive SurgicalWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Intuitive Surgical, Inc.. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$517m worth of shares. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 13% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Intuitive Surgical. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.I like to dive deeper into how a company has performed in the past. You can find historic revenue and earnings in this detailed graph.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

Longtime Regions associate Lee Ann Petty served as volunteer services coordinator in Regions' Community Affairs division. She passed away on Dec. 30, 2020, following a courageous battle against cancer.No matter where you look, you will be hard pressed to find anyone who pours more of their heart into serving others than Ginger.Wendi Boyen, community advocacy and financial wellness manager for RegionsYet her sincere commitment to serving others continues to inspire thousands of Regions associates in several states.And because of her own incredible dedication to making a positive impact, Regions is proud to honor Ginger Donohue with the inaugural award that pays tribute to Petty's legacy.""No matter where you look, you will be hard pressed to find anyone who pours more of their heart into serving others than Ginger,"" said Wendi Boyen, community advocacy and financial wellness manager for Regions. ""Not only do our Vicksburg customers know she is looking out for them, the community knows it, too. Regions Bank's mission is to make life better for the people and places we serve. Ginger Donohue puts our mission into action every single day.""Donohue, a 21-year veteran of Regions Bank, has lived and worked in Vicksburg all her life. To many, she's known as ""Ms. Vicksburg."" While she supports several organizations, she has a particular soft spot for children - especially those in need.Story continuesDonohue organizes an annual school supply drive, gathers toys and gifts for holiday campaigns, raises money for scholarship funds, teaches Bible school and serves as an instructor for Regions Next Step financial wellness classes at Vicksburg High School, among other activities.In one recent year, she logged nearly 200 volunteerism hours. That's the equivalent of five standard full-time work weeks.Indeed, as this powerful new video from Regions illustrates, Donohue's life of service has been a natural progression, starting when she was a girl collecting donations door-to-door with her mother for Easterseals and March of Dimes.Ginger is one of the most humble, giving, loving, supportive people I have ever met in my entire life.Michele Connelly, executive director of United Way of West Central Mississippi""My momma was passionate about giving back and was very involved in many nonprofit organizations,"" Donohue said. ""And my daddy had an incredible work ethic. He always said, ‘If you have a dollar, give a quarter away. If you don't have any money, then you give your talents and your time.'""In addition to serving children, Donohue's talents and time are also poured into leadership roles with the Vicksburg Kiwanis Club and the boards of the Vicksburg-Warren Chamber of Commerce and United Way of West Central Mississippi.""Ginger is one of the most humble, giving, loving, supportive people I have ever met in my entire life,"" said Michele Connelly, executive director of United Way of West Central Mississippi. ""She's the epitome of someone who understands the importance of giving back - why it's necessary to give back. She's not doing it to put on a resume or move faster up the corporate ladder. She's not doing it to make friends. She's doing it because she knows there are people in the community who need what she can provide.""Donohue credits Regions for giving her the support and encouragement to serve.""Without Regions, I couldn't do what I do for Vicksburg,"" she said. ""Not only do they ‘let' me do what I want to do for the community, they ‘want' me to do what I love to do. And my Beechwood branch team is like family, and they get out there and volunteer with me.""Vicksburg may be a smaller city.

""That's very important for our business, as well as our community engagement.""In recognition of Donohue's service, Regions is making a $2,500 donation to United Way of West Central Mississippi. In addition, Donohue was honored at Regions' 2023 Chairman's Club celebration in Boston, where the company recognized its top performers this week.

The company partnered with Agrotoken, Microsoft, and Sinqia to develop its submission.After months of collaborative work between each company’s world-class researchers and engineers, Visa and its team are excited to share the results of their LIFT Challenge participation — a programmable finance platform for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), particularly farmers, that is designed to enable greater access to global capital markets, facilitate interoperability between currencies, improve operational processes, and uncover new growth opportunities.Small Businesses Drive Global EconomiesSMEs are often beholden to localized market structure in negotiating favorable contracts. For example, factoring is a well-known financing method today where a farmer can sell their future receivable at a discount to receive money today to purchase supplies and pay wages. This process routinely leads to a sizable percentage loss of the farmer’s receivable to the entity providing financing.Visa’s prototype is designed to provide local farmers with more timely and greater access to a global pool of investors for financing, allowing the SMEs to get the best price discovery for their goods. By empowering SMEs with additional options to finance their businesses in a secure and frictionless way, Visa’s prototype platform aims to improve existing money movement operations and alleviate pain points caused by inaccessibility to traditional services.""Small businesses are essential contributors to our local economies, such as in Brazil where they employ over half the population and contribute to nearly a third of the country’s GDP. At Visa, we are committed to help them grow, exploring new technologies that will empower them to more easily maintain and expand their business operations,"" said Catherine Gu, Global Head of CBDC for Visa.Story continues""Brazil is one of the world’s leading markets for innovation,"" she continues. ""By contributing our expertise, scale, network, and cutting-edge technologies in this market, we are able to help advance real-world applications of digital currencies — in this case making it possible for a soybean farmer to create and globally auction a tokenized contract on a permissioned version of the Ethereum blockchain, while utilizing different forms of money and interoperating between them.""How Visa can Enable Programmable Finance in CBDCsWith many of the world’s central banks exploring the value of a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), Visa and its partners have demonstrated how CBDCs can enable new cross-border payments programmatically, as well as provide international investment resources to SMEs. The programmable aspects of digital currencies, which allow delivery and payment of assets and currencies to be automatically settled only when certain conditions are met, open the door for more efficient capital usage and reduced counterparty risks, while leveraging the security, stability, and safety of a central bank liability via CBDC as a reliable settlement currency.The prototype platform brings existing financial processes and assets on-chain, allowing farmers to tokenize traditional financing contracts. To achieve this, Agrotoken brought its agriculture-based tokenization expertise from their existing solutions in Brazil and Latin America and Visa delivered a tokenization process for turning existing Brazilian legal documents into an on-chain tradeable NFT.""Agrotoken has a mission to democratize agribusiness by making transactions with soy and corn more accessible. To achieve this, we have chosen solid partners, such as Visa, to join us in our journey towards this goal,"" said Anderson Nacaxe, Director of Agrotoken in Brazil.Combined with tokenization, Visa implemented a new onchain sealed-bid auction mechanism through smart contracts to enable a global pool of investors on the blockchain to participate in the financing process, achieving competitive price discovery. Additionally, the platform leverages a Visa technology called Universal Payments Channel (UPC), which can interconnect between the Real Digital (CBDC) and other CBDCs, stablecoins or tokenized deposits, to help ensure future interoperability between digital currencies across different markets and networks.This year’s LIFT Challenge Real Digital sought innovative tech research projects within the financial sector to assess use cases for the Digital Brazilian Real. Visa developed this Proof of Concept as part of the company’s ongoing efforts to work with industry partners, lead exploratory work and apply emerging technologies to creatively solve for well-known real world problems.Visa works with Central Banks around the world and other players of the payment ecosystem to identify compelling CBDC opportunities that can be scaled and executed through secure, innovative, convenient, and reliable technologies, with the goal of developing innovative digital payment solutions that can help individuals, businesses and governments participate in the digital economy and ultimately thrive.To learn more about Visa’s work with CBDC, visit our Digital Currency Innovation Hub.

AFRM is set to report its third-quarter fiscal 2023 results on May 9, after the closing bell.Important EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter fiscal 2023 loss per share of 91 cents suggests a 379% plunge from the prior-year loss of 19 cents. The estimate remained stable over the past week. The consensus estimate for third-quarter fiscal 2023 revenues of $366.9 million indicates a 3.4% increase from the year-ago reported figure.Affirm beat on earnings in one of the trailing four quarters and missed thrice, the average negative surprise being 0.1%. This is depicted in the graph below.Affirm Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseAffirm Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseAffirm Holdings, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Affirm Holdings, Inc. QuoteBefore we get into what to expect for the to-be-reported quarter in detail, it’s worth taking a look at AFRM’s previous-quarter performance first.Q2 Earnings RewindIn the last reported quarter, this leading payment network’s adjusted loss per share of $1.10 missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8.9%, primarily due to increased operating costs. This was partially offset by growing transactions and a significant increase in servicing income.Now, let’s see how things have shaped up prior to the third-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings announcement.Q3 Factors to NoteResilient consumer spending in the March quarter despite inflationary pressures is expected to have benefited the payment solution provider. Travel and entertainment-related spending is expected to have risen in the quarter under review. This, in turn, is likely to have augmented the strength of active merchants and consumers.The sales figures from the virtual card networks are anticipated to have risen. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for virtual card network revenues is pegged at $25.8 million, indicating an 11.3% year-over-year rise.The consensus mark for interest income in the fiscal third quarter is pegged at $166.1 million, indicating a 23.4% jump from the previous fiscal-year quarter’s $134.6 million. These are expected to have positioned the company for year-over-year growth in the fiscal third-quarter top line.Story continuesThe positives are likely to have been partially offset by lower servicing income, merchant network revenues and higher operating costs. The consensus mark for servicing income indicates a 2.3% year-over-year fall. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for gain on sales of loans suggests a 10.1% year-over-year decline.Moreover, the consensus estimate for merchant network revenues is pegged at $111.4 million, indicating a decrease of 8% from a year ago. Reductions in the concentration of certain APR loans are expected to have affected the metric.Also, operating costs are likely to have increased in the quarter under review, affecting the bottom line. Higher processing and servicing costs, as a result of increased volumes, are anticipated to have boosted the operating costs, reducing profits and making an earnings beat uncertain.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Affirm this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Earnings ESP: The company currently has an Earnings ESP of -23.08%. This is because the Most Accurate Estimate currently stands at a loss of $1.12 per share, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 91 cents.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Affirm currently carries a Zacks Rank #2.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.How Other Stocks PerformedHere are some companies from the Business Services space that have already reported earnings for the March quarter. These include Mastercard Incorporated MA, Visa Inc. V and The Western Union Company WU.Mastercard reported first-quarter 2023 adjusted earnings of $2.80 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.3%. The quarterly results were driven by improved cross-border travel, coupled with an expanding payment network and value-added services and solutions. However, the upside was partly offset by the company’s escalating operating expense level.Visa reported second-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings of $2.09 per share, which outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.97. The quarterly results were aided by higher payments, and cross-border volumes and processed transactions. Steady cross-border travel growth and lower-than-expected client incentives aided the results, partially offset by higher costs.Western Union reported first-quarter 2023 earnings per share of 43 cents, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 30.3%. WU’s earnings were supported by the strength witnessed in the Middle East business, Evolve 2025’s momentum, lower consumer acquisition costs and transaction growth. However, adverse currency impact, discontinuation of operations across Russia and Belarus and promotional pricing activities partially offset the positives.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

245,a50e37f1-3d46-3300-bbd8-be69ef496680,MAR,2023-05-09,Top 5 Stocks With High ROE to Buy as Markets Show Resilience,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-5-stocks-high-roe-121412942.html,1683548052,STORY,"['MAR', 'DHI', 'DKS', 'TRTN']","[The U.S. equity markets showed immense resilience by breaking a four-day losing streak and returning to the growth trajectory last Friday, courtesy of a rebound in the regional banking sector and a strong earnings performance by Apple. The markets have been mostly on tenterhooks as investors remained worried about another financial banking crisis after the collapse of two other mid-sized banks, namely Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. Although JPMorgan Chase acquired First Republic Bank to avert a similar banking catastrophe, the market sentiments largely trended down.However, the shares of regional banks shrugged off the pessimism and witnessed an uptrend to buoy the overall market swing. In addition, strong iPhone sales and key inroads in India and other emerging markets helped Apple to record solid quarterly earnings results. The latest data from Labor Department's job report further revealed that non-farm payrolls increased by 253,000 in April compared with broad-based expectations of a rise of 180,000. Wages increased 4.4% year over year in April after climbing 4.3% in March, while the unemployment rate fell to 3.4%.With improving job market conditions and softening inflationary pressures, investors largely expect the Fed to hold the interest rates in the near term. Moreover, the Fed indicated earlier that there might be just another hike in the current year depending on the macroeconomic factors, as tightening credit conditions could put pressure on the economy.As investors employ a wait-and-see approach in a classic example of “backing and filling” in the market, they can benefit from “cash cow” stocks that garner higher returns. However, identifying cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless it is backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting cash at a high rate of return. Marriott International, Inc. MAR, DICK'S Sporting Goods, Inc. DKS, D.R. Horton, Inc. DHI, ON Semiconductor Corporation ON and Triton International Limited TRTN are some of the stocks with high ROE to profit from.Story continuesROE: A Key MetricROE = Net Income/Shareholders’ EquityROE helps investors distinguish profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify companies that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.Moreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry — the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management’s efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.Screening ParametersIn order to shortlist stocks that are cash-rich with high ROE, we have added Cash Flow greater than $1 billion and ROE greater than X-Industry as our primary screening parameters. In addition, we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy.Price/Cash Flow lesser than X-Industry: This metric measures how much investors pay for $1 of free cash flow. A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow-generating stock.Return on Assets (ROA) greater than X-Industry: This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset, which includes cash, accounts receivable, property, equipment, inventory and furniture. The higher the ROA, the better it is for the company.5-Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X-Industry: This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated into solid cash strength.   Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Here are five of the 12 stocks that qualified the screen:Marriott: Headquartered in Bethesda, MD, Marriott is a leading worldwide hospitality company focused on lodging management and franchising.

246,5371123f-1efc-3e7a-a407-ef35f615d95c,MAR,2023-05-09,3 Travel Stocks Set to Profit This Summer,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-travel-stocks-set-profit-090052427.html,1683277252,STORY,"['ABNB', 'MAR', 'BKNG']","[If you’ve tried to book a flight or lodging recently, you’ve probably noticed that prices are significantly higher than they were a few years or even a few months ago. That’s because prices are rising along with surging travel demand, both due to pent-up demand following the pandemic and seasonal trends as we head into the prime summer travel season. This makes now an interesting time to consider the best travel stocks to buy.With demand showing no signs of cooling off and travelers seemingly willing to pay increasingly higher prices, travel companies stand to reap the benefits following a tough couple of years. Indeed, many travel stocks are rebounding along with key industry metrics such as bookings and occupancy rates.For investors looking for the best travel stocks to buy in 2023, check out the three names below.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsABNBAirbnb$117.63BKNGBooking Holdings$2,603.57MARMarriott International$176.48Airbnb (ABNB)A close-up shot of the Airbnb (ABNB) app on a smartphone screen.Source: AngieYeoh / Shutterstock.comI must admit, I haven’t rented that many vacation properties through Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) over the past decade. However, when a friend’s construction company started building a house on the ocean outside Halifax, Nova Scotia, to rent out through Airbnb, I got a lot more interested in the company and its stock.I understand there are a number of objections to short-term rental properties — everything from party houses in generally quiet neighborhoods to reducing the availability of long-term housing — but the reality is that people have to stay somewhere when they travel. So, why not in a place that’s home-like, comfortable, and often cheaper than a local hotel or motel? The fact is Airbnb provides a service. Most of the time, that service goes off without a hitch. I can remember when I was a teenager, my family rented a motorhome in Calgary and drove it to Vancouver and back. The experience was so horrendous, my older brother started walking back to the Calgary airport to fly home to Toronto. Someday, somebody will come up with the motorhome and trailer version of Airbnb or a car share program. They probably already have. Story continuesIn October, Center for Housing Economics Director Roger Valdez wrote in Forbes that short-term rentals aren’t the problem with expensive housing; the lack of supply is. He uses Steamboat Springs, Colorado, as his example. It’s a recommended read. The one thing I’ve found about Airbnb Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Brian Chesky is that he’s not afraid to listen to his guests and hosts. So, it’s not surprising that the company did a deep dive into complaints from its guests and came up with 50 improvements to the Airbnb platform.   Airbnb is very profitable. Now it intends to be the best-liked short-term rental platform anywhere. That’s money in the bank.Booking Holdings (BKNG)The home page of the Internet booking of hotels booking.com on the screen the Chinese Xiaomi smartphone in male hand on a computer monitor. BKNG stock.Source: Andrey Solovev / ShutterstockI recently recommended Booking Holdings (NASDAQ:BKNG) as one of the three most innovative companies disrupting their industries. In the online travel world, Booking has used artificial intelligence (AI) for more than a decade to improve the customer experience, according to CEO Glenn Fogel. Booking Holdings’ business, which includes popular sites like Booking.com, Kayak and OpenTable, is booming. In 2022, revenue jumped 56% to $17.1 billion, while operating income surged 165% to $3.1 billion. Even more impressive was that its free cash flow margin was 36.2%, 13.2 percentage points higher than a year earlier.This week, the company reported better-than-expected first-quarter results. Revenue increased 40% year over year to $3.78 billion, coming in slightly ahead of estimates, while adjusted earnings of $11.60 per share easily beat the $10.61 per share analysts were expecting.Shares are up 29% year to date and more than 60% from their 52-week low, yet from a valuation perspective, they’ve rarely been cheaper. BKNG is trading at 6.1 times sales and 15.9 times cash flow. Of the 31 analysts that cover its stock, 17 rate it “overweight” or a “buy,” with a median target price of $2,850, which is 9.5% higher than where it’s currently trading. I think BKNG has a little more left in the tank for the second half of 2023. Marriott International (MAR)Marriott logo in Milan, Italy. MAR stock.Source: DELBO ANDREA / ShutterstockI am not a fan of hotels, but boy was I surprised at how much my wife and I enjoyed our four-day stay over Easter at St. Regis — a Marriott International (NASDAQ:MAR) brand — in the heart of downtown Toronto. The staff was friendly, yet professional. There was an E-Butler app that allows guests to contact the staff during their stay. When the plug in our bathtub didn’t work, my wife texted the staff through the app while we were out to lunch and it was fixed long before we got back to the room.I’m sure if you travel a lot this is no big deal. However, this was our second stay since 2019 at St. Regis, and it was our second great experience. That’s not a coincidence. And it’s evidence that the changes in the hotel industry over the past decade, with many hotel operators like Marriott going asset-light by ditching the real estate to focus on guests, was a smart move. MAR stock is up more than 20% over the past two years compared to a less than 4% gain for the S&amp;P 500. In fact, shares hit a new all-time high this week after the company reported better-than-expected Q1 earnings and delivered an upbeat forecast. Yet, even though shares are within spitting distance of their record high, they are trading for just 2.6 times sales, which is roughly half what they were at in 2021. Marriott is an excellent travel stock to buy for the long haul. If it could survive the pandemic, it can survive anything.  On the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

247,39064b35-b73f-3b01-a419-22d6070cf335,KLAC,2023-05-09,Here's What We Like About KLA's (NASDAQ:KLAC) Upcoming Dividend,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-klas-nasdaq-klac-upcoming-100112646.html,1683626472,STORY,['KLAC'],"[Some investors rely on dividends for growing their wealth, and if you're one of those dividend sleuths, you might be intrigued to know that KLA Corporation (NASDAQ:KLAC) is about to go ex-dividend in just 2 days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. Therefore, if you purchase KLA's shares on or after the 12th of May, you won't be eligible to receive the dividend, when it is paid on the 1st of June.The company's upcoming dividend is US$1.30 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$5.20 per share to shareholders. Calculating the last year's worth of payments shows that KLA has a trailing yield of 1.4% on the current share price of $383.52. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. As a result, readers should always check whether KLA has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut. See our latest analysis for KLA If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. KLA is paying out just 20% of its profit after tax, which is comfortably low and leaves plenty of breathing room in the case of adverse events. Yet cash flows are even more important than profits for assessing a dividend, so we need to see if the company generated enough cash to pay its distribution. Luckily it paid out just 22% of its free cash flow last year.It's positive to see that KLA's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. That's why it's comforting to see KLA's earnings have been skyrocketing, up 34% per annum for the past five years. KLA earnings per share have been sprinting ahead like the Road Runner at a track and field day; scarcely stopping even for a cheeky ""beep-beep"". We also like that it is reinvesting most of its profits in its business.'Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. KLA has delivered 13% dividend growth per year on average over the past 10 years. It's exciting to see that both earnings and dividends per share have grown rapidly over the past few years.Final TakeawayFrom a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid KLA? KLA has been growing earnings at a rapid rate, and has a conservatively low payout ratio, implying that it is reinvesting heavily in its business; a sterling combination. It's a promising combination that should mark this company worthy of closer attention.With that in mind, a critical part of thorough stock research is being aware of any risks that stock currently faces. Case in point: We've spotted 1 warning sign for KLA you should be aware of.A common investing mistake is buying the first interesting stock you see.

Frankly, it’s getting a little bit toasty on Wall Street, which is why stability may come at a premium.Naturally, the failure of First Republic – the third such collapse of a banking enterprise this year – generated plenty of jitters. Despite JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon’s encouraging words that the FRC takeover averted a crisis, circumstances still appear bleak. Add on various geopolitical events that may influence the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy and you have brewing skepticism.That’s not to say that the so-called blue-chip stocks 2023 provide all the answers. However, these industry stalwarts enjoy business predictability.

And in the past year-and-a-half period, this narrative has become explosively cynical. For our purposes today, I’m not even going to touch the subject that’s on everyone’s mind. Instead, I think it’s useful for investors to consider the company’s relevance in the space economy.Fundamentally, Lockheed focuses on developing next-generation technologies, which include designing, building, and testing lunar and deep-space exploration capabilities. As Morgan Stanley analysts stated, the broader space economy could become a $1 trillion ecosystem by 2040.Story continuesFinancially, Lockheed compels because of its steady three-year revenue growth rate of 5.8%. As well, the enterprise benefits from consistent profitability. Notably, its trailing-year net margin comes in at 8.6%, above 72.63% of sector players. Finally, analyst peg LMT as a consensus hold. However, their average price target is $495.08, implying over 9% upside potential.Amgen (AMGN)A close-up shot of a blue casino chip on red carpet.Source: ShutterstockAn American multinational biopharmaceutical firm, Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) is one of the best in the business. At the time of writing, AMGN carries a market cap of $122.53 billion. Since the beginning of this year, AMGN gave up over 12% of its equity value. And in the trailing one-year period, it slipped about 3%. Nevertheless, this may be one of the discounted blue-chip stocks to buy.Right now, the market prices AMGN at a forward multiple of 13.18.

The bottom line improved 23.3% on a year-over-year basis.GAAP EPS was $5.71, up 130.2% from the year-ago quarter’s level.Revenue DetailsRevenues of $68.91 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.1%. The top line increased 4.2% year over year, reflecting strong growth in the United States. This was partially offset by lower international sales due to divestitures of its European businesses.Q4 Segmental AnalysisRevenues at the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment were $61.68 billion, up 14.9% year over year. Per management, the upside was primarily driven by market growth and a higher volume of specialty products, including an increase in volumes from retail national account customers. However, branded-to-generic conversions partially offset the upside.The U.S. Pharmaceutical segment reported an adjusted operating profit of $861 million, up 10.4% from the prior-year quarter’s level. This was due to growth in the distribution of specialty products to providers and health systems, partially mitigated by lower demand for COVID-19 vaccine distribution. The adjusted metric for the segment was up 9%, excluding the impact of the abovementioned vaccine’s distribution.At the International segment, revenues amounted to $3.36 billion, down 60.6% year over year. This was due to divestitures of McKesson’s European businesses.Adjusted operating profit at the segment totaled $88 million, down 45.6% from the year-ago quarter’s figure.Revenues at the Medical-Surgical Solutions segment totaled $2.69 billion, down 6.4% year over year. This was due to lower COVID-19-related sales, partially offset by growth in the primary and extended care business.The Medical-Surgical segment reported an adjusted operating profit of $248 million, down 17% year over year. Excluding the impact of COVID-related items, the adjusted metric was up 2%.Story continuesRevenues at the Prescription Technology Solutions segment totaled $1.18 billion, up 15.9% from that recorded a year ago. The improvement can be attributed to higher technology services revenues and an increase in prescriptions from third-party logistics.Adjusted operating profit came in at $218 million at the Prescription Technology Solutions segment, up 34.6% from the prior-year quarter’s level.McKesson Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseMcKesson Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseMcKesson Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | McKesson Corporation QuoteMarginsGross profit in the reported quarter was $3.07 billion, down 7.6% on a year-over-year basis. The figure accounted for 4.4% of net revenues.The company reported an operating income of $980 million, up 54.8% from the year-ago quarter’s figure. Operating margin accounted for 1.4% of net revenues.Financial UpdateIn the quarter under review, cash and cash equivalents were $4.67 billion compared with $2.77 billion in the previous quarter.Cumulative net cash provided by operating activities amounted to $5.16 billion, up from $4.43 billion recorded in the year-ago period.Fiscal 2024 GuidanceMcKesson provided its adjusted earnings guidance for fiscal 2024. It projects adjusted EPS to be in the range of $26.10-$26.90. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $26.30.Summing UpMcKesson exited the fiscal fourth quarter of 2023 on a strong note, wherein it beat both earnings and revenue estimates. The outperformance reflects strong demand for its pharmaceuticals and prescription technology solutions.However, lower COVID-19 related sales and divesture of European businesses hurt top and bottom-line growth for Medical-Surgical Solutions and International segments, respectively.The company expects the impact of COVID-related sales and divesture to be lower in fiscal 2024. A strong earnings outlook for the year raises optimism.However, price fluctuation of generic pharmaceuticals and stiff competition in the MedTech space are strong headwinds.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderMcKesson currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are AmerisourceBergen Corporation ABC, Merit Medical Systems, Inc.

Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for McKesson: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future.

RLI recently approved a hike in the company’s quarterly dividend to enhance shareholder value. RLI will now pay out a dividend of 27 cents per share compared with 26 cents paid in February 2023, reflecting an increase of 3.8%. Shares of RLI have gained 0.5% in the last trading day.Shareholders of record as of May 31, 2023 will receive the increased dividend on Jun 20, 2023. Based on the closing share price of $136.59 on May 4, the raised payout represents a dividend yield of 0.7%, better than the industry average of nearly 0.3%. Prior to this, the insurer had raised its quarterly dividend by 4% to 26 cents per share last May.RLI has been paying dividends for 186 consecutive quarters and increased regular dividends in the last 47 straight years, at an eight-year (2016-2023) CAGR of 3.8%.In addition, the insurer has also been paying special dividends since 2011.The recent approval of $7 in special dividend in November 2022 marks the 13th straight special dividend. Over the last 10 years, the insurer has returned $1.37 billion to shareholders and the quarterly dividend has grown an average of 5% per year. RLI did not repurchase any shares so far in 2023. It has $87.5 million of remaining capacity from the repurchase program.The dividend increase is supported by the insurer’s strong capital structure. Its healthy balance sheet with unparalleled financial flexibility allows investment in the business. RLI Corp. has a sound capital structure, helping it meet the interests of its policyholders, enhance operations in the insurance sector and aid growth in its book value for the long term. RLI maintains a conservative underwriting and reserving policy and continues to achieve favorable reserve releases from the prior years. Such a robust capital position provides significant financial flexibility to the operating subsidiaries.In the first quarter of 2023, RLI reported solid operating results and its financial position remained strong. Operating cash flows in the first quarter of 2023 benefited from increased premium receipts.RLI expects the cash generated by operations and investments to provide sufficient sources of liquidity to meet the anticipated needs over the next 12 to 24 months. The insurer also maintains a revolving line of credit, which has a borrowing capacity of $100 million. This facility, entered into during the first quarter of 2023, replaced the $60 million credit line that expired in March 2023. Under certain conditions, the line may be increased up to an aggregate principal amount of $130 million.Return on equity, a profitability measure of how efficiently a company utilizes its shareholders money, is 19.2% in the trailing 12 months, better than the industry average of 6.6%. The metric expanded 250 basis points year over year.Shares of this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) P&amp;C insurer have outperformed the industry in the past year. The stock has gained 15.1%, outperforming the industry’s increase of 3.2%. We expect improvement in the top line and a solid capital position to drive shares in the near term.Story continuesYou can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchGiven the solid capital level of the insurance industry and improving operating backdrop favoring strong operational performance, insurers like The Travelers Companies, Inc. TRV, American Financial Group, Inc. AFG and CNO Financial Group, Inc. CNO have resorted to effective capital deployment to enhance shareholder value.The Travelers boasts a strong market presence in auto, homeowners’ insurance and commercial U.S. property-casualty insurance with solid inorganic growth. In April 2023, the board approved an 8% increase in its quarterly dividend to $1 per share, marking 19th consecutive years of dividend increase. TRV has a dividend yield of 2%, better than the industry average of 0.3%. Over the past five years, TRV has increased its dividend six times and its payout ratio presently stays at 30% of earnings.American Financial’s board of directors approved a special cash dividend of $4.63 per share for the first quarter, which includes a $4 per share special dividend paid in February. In addition, American Financial bought back shares worth $24 million in the reported quarter. AFG has a dividend yield of 2.1%, better than the industry average of 0.3%. The excess capital of AFG provides the financial flexibility to make opportunistic repurchases, pay additional special dividends and grow specialty property and casualty business organically and through acquisitions and start-ups.In May 2023, CNO Financial’s board approved a 7.1% increase in its quarterly dividend to 15 cents per share, which marked its 11th consecutive annual increase. The board also approved an additional $500 million to repurchase the company's shares. It currently yields 2.6%. CNO Financial has been raising its quarterly dividend since 2013. It is committed to deploying 100% of excess capital, which should attract investors’ attention. At the first quarter-end, CNO had remaining repurchase funds of $171.8 million.Shares of TRV and CNO have gained 6% and 1.3% in the past year, respectively, whereas AFG has lost 19.7%.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Story continues*Certain results in this release, including in the highlights above, include references to non-GAAP financial measures on a consolidated, continuing operations basis and a segment basis. Additional information regarding these measures and reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP historical results can be found below. In addition, as discussed below, it is not possible, without unreasonable efforts, to identify the timing or occurrence of future events, transactions, and/or investment activity that could have a significant effect on the Company's future GAAP EPS or cash flow used for investing activities if any of these events were to occur.Air Products (NYSE: APD) today reported second quarter fiscal 2023 results, including GAAP EPS from continuing operations of $1.97, down 17 percent from prior year. This includes an unfavorable $0.77 per share impact, primarily from business and asset actions related to the Company's withdrawal from projects in Indonesia and Ukraine. GAAP net income of $450 million was down 16 percent and GAAP net income margin of 14.1 percent decreased 410 basis points from the prior year as higher costs, including the charge for business and asset actions, were only partially offset by higher pricing and higher volumes, as well as higher equity affiliates' income from the Jazan project.For the quarter, on a non-GAAP basis, adjusted EPS from continuing operations of $2.74 increased 17 percent over the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA of $1,151 million was up 13 percent and adjusted EBITDA margin of 36.0 percent increased 140 basis points over the prior year, as higher pricing, higher volumes, and higher equity affiliates' income more than offset higher costs.Second quarter sales of $3.2 billion increased nine percent over the prior year on eight percent higher pricing and six percent higher volumes, partially offset by four percent unfavorable currency and one percent lower energy cost pass-through. Higher pricing across the regions and higher on-site volumes drove the results.Commenting on the results, Air Products' Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Seifi Ghasemi said, ""Our team successfully drove pricing and volumes in our base business, delivering critical productivity, efficiency and sustainability benefits for our customers. The team also continued to advance our first-mover clean hydrogen mega projects that will decarbonize heavy transportation and industrial sectors globally. I am proud of the continued achievements of our team who delivered outstanding results despite the ongoing economic and geopolitical challenges in the world.""Fiscal 2023 Second Quarter Results by Business Segment Americas sales of $1,373 million were up 16 percent over the prior year on nine percent higher volumes and eight percent higher pricing, partially offset by one percent unfavorable currency. Operating income of $324 million increased 18 percent and adjusted EBITDA of $514 million increased 14 percent, in each case due to higher pricing and higher volumes, partially offset by higher costs. Operating margin of 23.6 percent increased 40 basis points primarily due to higher pricing, while adjusted EBITDA margin of 37.4 percent decreased 50 basis points.Asia sales of $814 million increased eight percent over the prior year, as seven percent higher volumes, five percent higher pricing and three percent higher energy cost pass-through more than offset seven percent unfavorable currency. Operating income of $233 million increased 14 percent and adjusted EBITDA of $350 million increased nine percent, in each case due to the favorable volumes and pricing, partially offset by higher costs and unfavorable currency. Operating margin of 28.6 percent increased 150 basis points and adjusted EBITDA margin of 43.0 percent increased 20 basis points.Europe sales of $753 million increased two percent over the prior year, driven by 11 percent higher pricing and three percent higher volumes, partially offset by six percent lower energy cost pass-through and six percent unfavorable currency. Operating income of $173 million increased 49 percent and adjusted EBITDA of $251 million increased 32 percent, in each case primarily driven by higher pricing. Operating margin of 23.0 percent increased 720 basis points and adjusted EBITDA margin of 33.3 percent increased 760 basis points.Middle East and India equity affiliates' income of $99 million increased 39 percent compared to the prior year, primarily due to the completion of the second phase of the Jazan project.Corporate and other sales of $215 million decreased 10 percent compared to the prior year, driven by lower sale of equipment activity.OutlookAir Products provides adjusted EPS guidance on a continuing operations basis, excluding the impact of certain items that management believes are not representative of the Company's underlying business performance, such as the incurrence of costs for cost reduction actions and impairment charges, or the recognition of gains or losses on disclosed items. It is not possible, without unreasonable efforts, to predict the timing or occurrence of these events or the potential for other transactions that may impact future GAAP EPS. Similarly, it is not possible, without unreasonable efforts, to reconcile the forecasted capital expenditures to future cash used for investing activities because management is not able to identify the timing or occurrence of future investment activity, which is driven by management's assessment of competing opportunities at the time the Company enters into transactions. Furthermore, it is not possible to identify the potential significance of these events in advance, but any of these events, if they were to occur, could have a significant effect on the Company's future GAAP results. Management therefore is unable to reconcile, without unreasonable effort, the Company's forecasted range of adjusted EPS or the capital expenditures to a comparable GAAP range.Air Products expects full-year fiscal 2023 adjusted EPS guidance of $11.30 to $11.50, up 10 to 12 percent over prior year adjusted EPS. For the fiscal 2023 third quarter, Air Products' adjusted EPS guidance is $2.85 to $2.95, up 10 to 14 percent over fiscal 2022 third quarter adjusted EPS.Effective beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, management reviews adjusted EPS excluding the impact of non-service related components of the net periodic benefit/cost for the Company's defined benefit pension plans. The projected percentage increase in adjusted EPS for full year fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2023 third quarter is calculated using fiscal 2022 results recast on a consistent basis. Refer to the reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP historical results below for additional information.Air Products continues to expect capital expenditures of $5.0 - $5.5 billion for full-year fiscal 2023.Earnings TeleconferenceAccess the fiscal 2023 second quarter earnings teleconference scheduled for 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time on May 9, 2023 by calling 323-701-0225 and entering passcode 4444766 or by accessing the Event Details page on Air Products' Investor Relations website.About Air ProductsAir Products (NYSE:APD) is a world-leading industrial gases company in operation for over 80 years focused on serving energy, environmental, and emerging markets.

MEASURES(Millions of U.S. Dollars unless otherwise indicated, except for per share data)We present certain financial measures, other than in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP""), on an ""adjusted"" or ""non-GAAP"" basis. On a consolidated basis, these measures include adjusted diluted earnings per share (""EPS""), adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, and capital expenditures. On a segment basis, these measures include adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin. In addition to these measures, we also present certain supplemental non-GAAP financial measures to help the reader understand the impact that certain disclosed items, or ""non-GAAP adjustments,"" have on the calculation of our adjusted diluted EPS. For each non-GAAP financial measure, we present a reconciliation to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP.In many cases, non-GAAP financial measures are determined by adjusting the most directly comparable GAAP measure to exclude non-GAAP adjustments that we believe are not representative of our underlying business performance. For example, we exclude the impact of the non-service components of net periodic benefit/cost for our defined benefit pension plans as further discussed below. Additionally, we may exclude certain expenses associated with cost reduction actions, impairment charges, and gains on disclosed transactions. The reader should be aware that we may recognize similar losses or gains in the future.When applicable, the tax impact of our pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments reflects the expected current and deferred income tax impact of our non-GAAP adjustments. These tax impacts are primarily driven by the statutory tax rate of the various relevant jurisdictions and the taxability of the adjustments in those jurisdictions.We provide these non-GAAP financial measures to allow investors, potential investors, securities analysts, and others to evaluate the performance of our business in the same manner as our management. We believe these measures, when viewed together with financial results computed in accordance with GAAP, provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our historical financial performance and projected future results. However, we caution readers not to consider these measures in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Readers should also consider the limitations associated with these non-GAAP financial measures, including the potential lack of comparability of these measures from one company to another.NON-GAAP ADJUSTMENTSBusiness and Asset ActionsDuring the second quarter of fiscal year 2023, we recognized a noncash charge of $185.6 ($153.7 attributable to Air Products after tax, or $0.69 per share) to write-off assets associated with our withdrawal from coal gasification in Indonesia as well as a plant in Ukraine for which construction was permanently suspended due to ongoing uncertainty related to Russia's invasion of the country. The charge is reflected within ""Business and asset actions"" on our consolidated income statements and was not recorded in segment results.Non-service Pension Cost (Benefit), NetEffective beginning in fiscal year 2023, our adjusted EPS excludes the impact of non-service related components of net periodic benefit/cost for our defined benefit pension plans. The prior year non-GAAP financial measures presented below have been recast accordingly to conform to the fiscal year 2023 presentation. Non-service related components are recurring, non-operating items that include interest cost, expected returns on plan assets, prior service cost amortization, actuarial loss amortization, as well as special termination benefits, curtailments, and settlements. The net impact of non-service related components is reflected within ""Other non-operating income (expense), net"" on our consolidated income statements. Adjusting for the impact of non-service pension components provides management and users of our financial statements with a more accurate representation of our underlying business performance because these components are driven by factors that are unrelated to our operations, such as recent changes to the allocation of our pension plan assets associated with de-risking as well as volatility in equity and debt markets. Further, non-service related components are not indicative of our defined benefit plans' future contribution needs due to the funded status of the plans.ADJUSTED DILUTED EPSThe table below provides a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure for each of the major components used to calculate adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations, which we view as a key performance metric. In periods that we have non-GAAP adjustments, we believe it is important for the reader to understand the per share impact of each such adjustment because management does not consider these impacts when evaluating underlying business performance. Per share impacts are calculated independently and may not sum to total diluted EPS and total adjusted diluted EPS due to rounding.Three Months Ended 31 MarchQ2 2023 vs. Q2 2022OperatingIncomeEquity Affiliates' IncomeOther Non-Operating Income/Expense, NetIncome Tax ProvisionNet IncomeAttributable to Air ProductsDilutedEPSQ2 2023 GAAP$459.8$165.9($13.9)$121.0$439.8$1.97Q2 2022 GAAP561.9120.89.1122.7530.52.38$ Change GAAP($0.41)% Change GAAP(17 %)Q2 2023 GAAP$459.8$165.9($13.9)$121.0$439.8$1.97Business and asset actions(A)185.6——26.9153.70.69Non-service pension cost, net——22.95.717.20.08Q2 2023 Non-GAAP (""Adjusted"")$645.4$165.9$9.0$153.6$610.7$2.74Q2 2022 GAAP$561.9$120.8$9.1$122.7$530.5$2.38Non-service pension benefit, net——(11.9)(2.9)(9.0)(0.04)Q2 2022 Non-GAAP (""Adjusted"")$561.9$120.8($2.8)$119.8$521.5$2.34$ Change Non-GAAP (""Adjusted"")$0.40% Change Non-GAAP (""Adjusted"")17 %(A) Charge includes $5.0 attributable to noncontrolling interests.ADJUSTED EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDA MARGINWe define adjusted EBITDA as net income less income from discontinued operations, net of tax, and excluding non-GAAP adjustments, which we do not believe to be indicative of underlying business trends, before interest expense, other non-operating income (expense), net, income tax provision, and depreciation and amortization expense. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin provide useful metrics for management to assess operating performance.

These decisions, either individually or in the aggregate, could have a significant effect on our cash used for investing activities.We expect capital expenditures for fiscal year 2023 to be $5.0 to $5.5 billion.OUTLOOKThe guidance provided below is on an adjusted continuing operations basis and is compared to adjusted historical diluted EPS attributable to Air Products. These adjusted measures exclude the impact of certain items that we believe are not representative of our underlying business performance, such as the non-service components of net periodic benefit/cost for our defined benefit pension plans, the incurrence of costs for business, asset, and cost reduction actions and impairment charges, or the recognition of gains or losses on disclosed items. The per share impact for each of our non-GAAP adjustments is calculated independently and may not sum to total adjusted diluted EPS due to rounding.It is not possible, without unreasonable efforts, to identify the timing or occurrence of similar future events or the potential for other transactions that may impact future GAAP EPS. Furthermore, it is not possible to identify the potential significance of these events in advance; however, any of these events, if they were to occur, could have a significant effect on our future GAAP EPS. Accordingly, management is unable to fully reconcile, without unreasonable efforts, our forecasted range of adjusted EPS on a continuing operations basis to a comparable GAAP range.Diluted EPSQ3Full Year2022 Diluted EPS$2.62$10.08Business and asset actions—0.27Equity method investment impairment charge—0.052022 Adjusted Diluted EPS$2.62$10.41Per share impact of non-service pension benefit, net(A)(0.03)(0.15)2022 Adjusted Diluted EPS, excluding per share impact of non-service pension benefit, net(A)$2.58$10.252023 Adjusted Diluted EPS Outlook(A)$2.85–$2.95$11.30–$11.50$ Change(A)0.27–0.371.05–1.25% Change(A)10%–14%10%–12%(A) Fiscal year 2022 diluted EPS has been adjusted as illustrated and as discussed in the Adjusted Diluted EPS Reflecting Adjustments for Non-Service Pension Impacts section below in order to present fiscal year 2022 results and fiscal year 2023 guidance on a consistent basis.

This compares to earnings of $1.69 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 3.91%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this chemical company would post earnings of $0.96 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.98, delivering a surprise of 2.08%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.Cabot , which belongs to the Zacks Chemical - Diversified industry, posted revenues of $1.03 billion for the quarter ended March 2023, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.73%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.09 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Cabot shares have added about 6.7% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 7.7%.What's Next for Cabot?While Cabot has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Cabot: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.96 on $1.18 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $6.38 on $4.61 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Chemical - Diversified is currently in the bottom 26% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Another stock from the same industry, Air Products and Chemicals (APD), has yet to report results for the quarter ended March 2023. The results are expected to be released on May 9.This seller of gases for industrial, medical and other uses is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.64 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +10.9%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.1% lower over the last 30 days to the current level.Air Products and Chemicals' revenues are expected to be $3.02 billion, up 2.5% from the year-ago quarter.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Fox said her legal claims were ""riddled with false allegations against Fox and our employees.""In seeking unspecified monetary damages, Grossberg claimed she was subjected to a hostile and discriminatory work environment. She accused Fox of defamation, gender and religious discrimination, and pay equity violations.Grossberg also said Fox intimidated her and fraudulently induced her to make false statements in her September 2022 deposition in the Dominion lawsuit.On April 18 Fox agreed to pay Dominion $787.5 million to settle the voting-technology company's defamation lawsuit in Delaware.

Opponents labeled the measure the ""don't say gay"" law.The company alleged DeSantis rallied the Republican-controlled legislature to strike back at ""woke Disney"" and seize control of an administrative district, created in 1967, that helped Disney develop theme parks and resorts. The district, originally known as Reedy Creek Improvement District, was also named as a defendant.Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis acknowledges supporters as he arrives at a news conference at the Reedy Creek Administration Building, Monday, April 17, 2023, in Lake Buena Vista, Fla. (AP Photo/John Raoux)FLORIDA'S LAWSUIT AGAINST DISNEY Rather than responding in federal court, the administrative district, which lawmakers put under DeSantis' control and renamed the Central Florida Tourism Oversight District, fired back on May 2, countersuing Disney in state court.The new district leadership accused the company of striking last-minute ""backroom"" deals with the prior board, just before the legislature changed the board structure.The new board asked the state court to void those Disney-friendly deals, which gave the company control over development in the district for decades and which limited the new board's authority.In this handout image provided by Disney, Actor and model Millie Bobby Brown brought some fun to the Dark Side at Walt Disney World Resort in Lake Buena Vista, Fla. on September 27, 2022. (Photo by Courtney Kiefer/Disney via Getty Images)HOW THE LAWSUITS DIFFER Disney's lawsuit was filed in federal court and alleges that DeSantis violated the company's protections under the U.S. Constitution, including its First Amendment right to free speech.It also alleges the new district board violated of the Due Process, Contracts and the Takings Clauses of the U.S. Constitution by declaring void the company's development agreements that were struck with the old board. Disney is asking the court to strike down laws that created the new board and that voided the agreements with Disney.Story continuesIn contrast, the state court lawsuit against Disney focuses on the procedures the old board followed in approving the agreements with Disney. It alleges those deals were approved at meetings that failed to follow state rules for things like giving the public advance notice. The Florida district is asking the state court to void the Disney agreements.WHAT HAPPENS NEXT IN LAWSUITS? Disney's case is proceeding before U.S. District Judge Mark Walker in Tallahassee, who previously has struck down some laws that define the governor's conservative agenda. The Florida district's case is in state court before Circuit Judge Margaret Schreiber in Orlando.The district could file a motion in federal court to ask Walker to dismiss or pause Disney's federal case while the state court proceeds. Legal doctrines hold that federal judges should refrain from hearing a case where there is a related state court proceeding, particularly when a state court decision could resolve the federal lawsuit.But Walker might still allow Disney's federal lawsuit to proceed because the company is claiming a major Constitutional violation, which is the kind of claim a federal judge is inclined to hear.COULD THERE BE CONFLICTING RULINGS? Both cases could proceed simultaneously. While the legal theories are different, both courts were asked to decide if the agreements between Disney and the prior board were valid, so it's conceivable that the judges could reach conflicting answers. In that scenario, it is likely that the side that prevails first would ask the other judge to respect that ruling. The prevailing party would likely cite the doctrine of res judicata, which says that a claim that reaches judgment in one court should not be relitigated in a second.(Reporting by Tom Hals in Wilmington, Delaware; Editing by Amy Stevens and Lisa Shumaker)]"

So far, the feared “earnings apocalypse” has failed to materialize, helping keep sentiment somewhat in check.And soon, we’ll hear from the media and entertainment titan Walt Disney Company DIS. Disney has assets that span movies, television shows, and theme parks.It raises a valid question: how does the company shape up heading into its earnings release? We can use streaming results from Netflix NFLX as a small read-through. Let’s take a closer look.Netflix Streaming titan Netflix posted mixed top and bottom line results, exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by 2% but delivering revenue just marginally under expectations. Below is a chart illustrating the company’s revenue on a quarterly basis.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn addition, Netflix reported Net Subscriber Additions of roughly 1.8 million, representing a massive improvement from the year-ago quarter when the streaming titan lost 200k subscribers.Following the release, the market didn’t react well, as we can see illustrated by the green arrow circled in the chart below.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchDisneyAnalysts haven’t been bullish for Disney’s quarter to be reported, with the $0.88 per share earnings estimate being revised 10% lower since February. The quarterly earnings estimate implies an 18% pullback within earnings year-over-year.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn addition, our quarterly revenue estimate presently sits a $21.7 billion, implying a 13% climb from the year-ago quarter. Since February, the revenue estimate is down a marginal 0.7%, as we can see in the chart below.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchInvestors will closely monitor Disney+ results, similar to what we saw in NFLX's release. For the quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Disney+ subscribers stands at 166 million, implying growth of 20% year-over-year.Story continuesDisney has consistently surprised positively on this metric, chaining together five consecutive quarters of exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchRegarding valuation, Disney’s 2.1X forward price-to-sales ratio sits below the five-year median and highs of 3.4X in 2022, with the company carrying a Style Score of “C” for Value.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineWhile this week may not be as hectic as others regarding earnings releases, we still have several notable quarterly reports scheduled to come, including one from the Walt Disney Company DIS.Analysts haven’t been bullish regarding Disney’s earnings outlook, with the current quarterly EPS Estimate seeing negative revisions since February. On the flip side, the company’s revenue picture remains relatively stable, down marginally over the last few months.Heading into the release, Disney is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) with an Earnings ESP Score of -5.8%.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Revenue is expected to come in at $21.8 billion dollars, with adjusted earnings per share of $0.93.The media giant is projected to report strong earnings growth on its direct-to-consumer offerings.Yahoo Finance's Seana Smith and Akiko Fujita interviewed Jason Bazinet, Citi Managing Director, on what investors should expect this quarter.Bazinet believes a potential Hulu sale would be a ""grave mistake"" for Disney.Bazinet says he is in the ""minority among investors"" as he would like to see Disney buy the balance it doesn't own in order to merge with Disney+ and create what he calls a ""TV substitute on the streaming world.""Disney currently owns two-thirds of Hulu with Comcast's (CMCSA) NBCUniversal controlling the rest.See the full interview here.Key Video Takeaways:0:00:00 - What Wall Street is focused on0:01:14 - Hulu's future with DisneyVideo TranscriptAKIKO FUJITA: All eyes are going to be on that direct-to-consumer business. What are you expecting on that number?JASON BAZINET: Well, just to frame it for you, remember, Disney lost about $4 billion in the streaming business last fiscal year. Their quarter-- their first fiscal quarter, they lost about $1 billion in the quarter. And so no real discernible improvement, right? A billion dollars in a loss times 4 is another 4 billion loss. So what the Street will be focused on is, hopefully, a sharp reduction in the direct-to-consumer losses. The company is [INAUDIBLE] to about $200 million of smaller losses. So call it 800 million. And I think that's what the Street will be focused on. If we end up with a much smaller loss, the shares, I think, will do quite well.SEANA SMITH: Jason, what do you think we're going to hear when it comes to Hulu? Lots of talk about what exactly that's going to look like here just in terms of its future with Disney, whether or not it could potentially sell its stake. How do you see Disney addressing Hulu down the road?JASON BAZINET: Look, I was flabbergasted on the last earnings call, right, which was Mr. Iger's first quarter back, when he said everything was on the table when it came to Hulu. He was uncomfortable with what he called ""general entertainment,"" which pointed towards a potential Hulu sale. I think that would be a grave mistake. We would like to see Disney buy in the balance of Hulu it doesn't own, merge that with Disney+, rationalize some costs and really create a-- what I'll call a TV substitute on the streaming world.But I will tell you, I'm in the minority among investors. Every investor I chat with would be thrilled if Disney sold Hulu. So I'm in the minority. But if anything that Mr. Iger does tomorrow or Disney does tomorrow that indicates that they're more open to selling it, the Street would applaud that. I think actually it would be a mistake.

It also gains from diverse customer base. The company is expected to benefit from increasing pipeline volumes and fee-based commitments as production volumes rise.However, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has to face strong competition in the pipeline business that could be a strong growth deterrent.TailwindsONEOK continues to invest in organic growth projects to expand in the existing operating regions. It also aims to provide a broad range of services to crude oil as well as natural gas producers and end-use markets. Capital expenditures (including maintenance) totaled $289 million in the first quarter compared with $257 million in the year-ago period. OKE expects total capital expenditures in the $1,270-$1,480 million range in 2023. This indicates that systematic investments are made to expand and strengthen infrastructure with the expected increase in producer activity.With production volumes resuming normalcy, ONEOK is poised to benefit from long-term fee-based commitments in all three of its segments. Approximately 90% of its 2022 earnings were fee-based. A substantial portion of its 2023 earnings are expected to be fee-based too.OKE is well poised to scale further as production volumes continue to improve. This can be attributed to the company’s completed projects, and its 40,000 miles of natural gas liquid and natural gas pipelines in the most prolific U.S. shale basins. ONEOK’s Natural Gas Pipeline segment is expected to benefit from its transportation capacity of 5.5 Bcf/d and connectivity between key markets.HeadwindsThe natural gas and natural gas liquids pipeline industries are highly competitive. Apart from the existing pipeline companies, the midstream section has recently seen many energy companies forming master limited partnerships to begin pipeline services. Although the partnerships’ assets are well spread out, ONEOK’s ability to withstand competitive challenges will depend on the efficiency, quality and reliability of its services.Story continuesStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks for investors interested in the same sector are Cactus, Inc.

(NYSE: UA, UAA) today announced unaudited financial results for its fourth quarter and fiscal year ended March 31, 2023. The company reports its financial performance following accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (""GAAP""). This press release refers to ""currency neutral"" and ""adjusted"" amounts, which are non-GAAP financial measures described below under the ""Non-GAAP Financial Information"" paragraph.Under Armour, Inc. Logo. (PRNewsFoto/Under Armour, Inc.)""I'm honored to lead this iconic brand, and I'm pleased that Under Armour delivered fiscal 2023 revenue and earnings results that were in line with our previous outlook,"" said Under Armour President and CEO Stephanie Linnartz. ""Fiscal 2024 will be a year of building for the brand. I am prioritizing significantly amplifying global brand heat; delivering elevated design and products, with a focus on Sportstyle, footwear, and women; and positioning us to drive better sales growth in the United States.""Linnartz continued, ""We will leverage our strong portfolio of franchises, including Heat Gear, Cold Gear, and compression apparel, to drive innovation across new products and markets. We must deliver better for athletes and our customers and meaningfully increase returns for shareholders in the years ahead. My job is to make that vision a reality.""Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2023 ReviewRevenue was up 8 percent to $1.4 billion (up 10 percent currency neutral).Gross margin declined 310 basis points to 43.4 percent compared to the prior year, driven primarily by higher promotions, mix impacts related to higher footwear revenue, and adverse effects from changes in foreign currency.Selling, general &amp; administrative expenses decreased 4 percent to $572 million.Operating income was $35 million.Net Income was $171 million. Excluding an $87 million benefit primarily from a tax valuation allowance release related to prior-period restructuring, adjusted net income was $84 million.Diluted earnings per share was $0.38.

Excluding the company's litigation reserve, adjusted operating income was $304 million.Net Income was $387 million. Excluding a $45 million earn-out benefit in connection with the sale of the MyFitnessPal platform, a $96 million benefit from a tax valuation allowance release related to prior-period restructuring, and a $20 million litigation reserve expense, adjusted net income was $266 million.Diluted earnings per share was $0.84. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.58.Share Buyback UpdateDuring the fourth quarter, Under Armour repurchased one million shares of its Class C common stock, consistent with the final settlement of accelerated share repurchase transactions entered into during the prior quarter.

Currency-neutral financial information is calculated to exclude changes in foreign currency exchange rates. References to adjusted financial measures exclude the effect of the company's litigation reserve, the company's 2020 restructuring plan and related tax effects, and any gain or loss from divestitures (including associated earn-outs and expenses) and related tax effects. Management believes these adjustments are not core to the company's operations. The reconciliation of non-GAAP amounts to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated according to GAAP is presented in supplemental financial information furnished with this release. All per-share amounts are reported on a diluted basis. In addition, in connection with its change in fiscal year-end from December 31 to March 31, Under Armour is presenting select non-GAAP financial measures for the twelve months beginning on April 1, 2021, and ending March 31, 2022, to provide comparable reference periods against the company's new fiscal 2023 year, which began April 1, 2022, and ended on March 31, 2023. These supplemental non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation. They should be contemplated in addition to, and not as an alternative to, the company's reported results prepared per GAAP. Additionally, the company's non-GAAP financial information may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.About Under Armour, Inc.Under Armour, Inc., headquartered in Baltimore, Maryland, is a leading inventor, marketer, and distributor of branded athletic performance apparel, footwear, and accessories.

Siegel moved Peloton to a market perform rating, saying in a note that ""after all this time, the risk/reward has shifted, even seeing a likely upward skew at current levels."" He joined Yahoo Finance Live to further discuss, noting that the company has shifted away from its ""instagram-able, beautiful"" bikes and instead focusing on content. Recently Peloton guidance forecasted subscribers down in the next quarter, which doesn't deter Siegel. Instead, the ""saturation concerns"" paired with ""seasonality"" made it make sense to guide subscribers down. Ultimately, Siegel says it will be ""very important"" to figure out the company's ultimate market size.Siegel points to previously prestige brands like Victoria's Secret (VSCO), Michael Kors (CPRI) and Under Armour (UAA) who had to navigate a transition from being a prestige brand to one of ubiquity battling declining demand. But just because a brand is going back down ""does not mean they are dead,"" Siegel explains. Peloton (PTON) will soon have to navigate a similar trend. ""I don't think Peloton is a dead brand at all,"" Siegel says, but it ""certainly doesn't stand for what it used to stand for."" It's important for Peloton to look at this decline and ""bear hug"" brand loyalists, rather than push products on customers that don't want them.In his full interview, Simeon dives deeper into his Peloton upgrade with Brad Smith and Julie Hyman.Top Video Moments00:00:15 Peloton pivoting from machine to content00:00:44 PTON won't be guiding down forever00:02:13 Brands declining on ubiquity aren't ""dead""00:02:40 Where did Peloton go wrong?00:03:00 ""Bear hug"" brand loyalistsVideo TranscriptSIMEON SIEGEL: I think what made Peloton so special initially was the fact that it was this Instagrammable beautiful machine that people want to say they had a Peloton Bike, even more so in that they were using the Peloton content. And I think the company is pivoting that conversation to say it's the content that makes us special. The equipment-- which, by the way, has been losing money-- that's-- not gonna say necessarily evil, but that's the way that we get there.Story continuesIf you can get there without it, that's important as well, which is why, over the next month, they're talking about a big relaunch of the digital program. I don't know what that's gonna look like. I think, to be very clear, this upgrade is not suggesting all of a sudden we think the addressable market size is huge.I think the point here is you knew that this number-- the company guided subscribers down for the first time this quarter. They had to do that because seasonally, it's beautiful outside. So you take all the saturation concerns. You overlay that with seasonality. And it made sense for them to guide down.What I don't think is this is just the be-all, end-all. I don't think that forever we're gonna be guiding down. But I do think it is important to acknowledge they have stretched this market. They have pulled forward the market, rather.So figuring out what that ultimate addressable market size is is going to be very important. What I think, though-- and, Julie, you and I have talked about this forever a la Victoria's Secret and Under Armour-- sometimes you can sell less and charge more and make more money. What's fascinating is they guided subscribers down. The amount that the subscribers are paying is going up.JULIE HYMAN: Well, and sort of on a similar front, Simeon, the arc of this brand from, like, this coveted status symbol thing having this bike has just changed enormously. And as you look at the parallels between it and other retailers who have been able to manage that transition-- like a Michael Kors pops into my head, for example-- like, what can we learn from those other situations? They're not exact parallels, right? But they have some parallels, so, you know, about what Peloton can do to manage that transition correctly from, like, a prestige product to a mass product, right?SIMEON SIEGEL: No, I think you're putting it perfectly. I think the key word used there was a brand. I think we think about tech companies. They're not as much brands, whereas you think about whether it's Michael Kors or Under Armour. You think about brands that were once on a growth arc that then find themselves too ubiquitous, and now they're going back down.It does not mean they are dead. I mean, this was the conversation. Remember, we were kind of aghast when I upgraded L Brands back in the beginning of the pandemic, saying Victoria's Secret wasn't a dead brand. It had $5 billion of revenue.I don't think Peloton is a dead brand at all, but it certainly doesn't stand for what it used to stand for. It's certainly not garnering that Instagram appeal. And so what I think those brands have to internalize is where did they go wrong. What changed?And a lot of times, it's tied to ubiquity. With fitness, it's also tied to just-- I'm not gonna say humanity's laziness, because that's not nice. But it's just hard, right, to continue to inspire yourself to do it.What I think they should do-- and we've been saying this for a long time and [INAUDIBLE] been saying this for a long time. I think they need to bear-hug their brand loyalists. What Michael Kors did was they said, we're OK giving up volume if it gives us price and brand equity because inevitably, the best thing I could get is more dollars per handbag, in Michael Kors' case, Under Armour getting more dollars per sneaker, right? Victoria's Secret-- more dollars per intimate.If you overextend, and that forces you to promote in a bad way-- I'm not against promotions broadly. But if it forces you to force your product to someone, sometimes you can do better by selling less and charging more and making more money. And that Victoria's Secret-- I mean, listen, we saw L Brands. It was the top 10 stocks within the S&amp;P for two years running, even though revenues came down.So revenues coming down doesn't have to be a scary thing if it's under your control. And I think that's this conversation the company is focusing on free cash. I think that's where this opportunity now lies for them to say they are certainly not being valued as a growth company.]"

For more companies, head on over to 5 Biggest Cybersecurity Companies In the World.In just a short time period, two technologies have revolutionized the corporate sector. These are the semiconductor and the Internet, both of which work together to generate vast amounts of computing power and connectivity to enable companies to streamline their operations and overcome geographic limitations.However, at the same time, the growth in global cyberinfrastructure has also led to a growth in malicious activities. The cost of these activities is likely to stun you when you look at just how much it costs to protect against cyber threats and how much they end up costing the victims. For instance, a report from Cybersecurity Ventures believes that cybercrime cost victims a stunning $6 trillion in 2021 - and it will only grow in the future. The statistics outline that from 2021 until 2025, the costs will grow by no less than 15% annually to sit at an equally stunning $10.5 trillion. To understand the significance of this, consider the fact that the world's third largest economy - Japan - has a gross domestic product (GDP) of $4.4 trillion. In fact, cybercrime is such a big threat that the legendary Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B) believes that cyber attacks are the biggest problem faced by mankind. Given that Mr. Buffett's other name is the 'Oracle of Omaha', his statements are quite worrisome yet also make sense given the massive costs of cyber attacks that we've outlined above.Building on this, the next step in analyzing the cybersecurity sector is to take a look at what are the costs of fighting the trillion dollar attacks. On this front, the consulting firm McKinsey has some estimates. These show that only a fraction of the costs is currently being spent on developing and operating mitigations against them. McKinsey shares that companies and organizations spent $150 billion in 2021 on cybersecurity, but it adds that the threat sector is quite dynamic. The firm's survey of 4,000 companies reveals that 80% of the threat groups and 40% of malware in 2021 were completely new. McKinsey adds that the $150 billion is just a hairline fraction of the total addressable market (TAM) in cybersecurity, and even if there was a ten percent penetration, then the market can blossom to $1.5 trillion.Story continuesEstimates provided by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) show that rogue nations such as North Korea have stolen billions of dollars from dozens of countries through malicious cyber activities. The IMF believes that the global financial system can play a crucial role in securing the world against these threats, since it is the most exposed to criminal activities and has the potential to lead the battle from the front.So, it's clear that the market for cybersecurity is huge and underdeveloped at the same time. The next step in our analysis is to understand whether the growing attention to cybersecurity is also translating into the income statement performance of some of the largest players in the sector. Taking a look at the financials of Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET), one of the predominant players in protecting websites against cyberattacks, reveals that between 2019 and 2022, the firm's revenue has more than doubled. Cloudflare brought in $287 million in revenue in 2019 and by 2022 end, the firm had grown this by a stunning 239% to a whopping $975 million. Mind you, this growth took place during some of the most turbulent economic conditions in recent history, with the coronavirus pandemic impacting the business environment and 2022 straining budgets.Yet, it looks as if the bump in cyber demand during the pandemic due to remote working and remote leisure seems to have provided a permanent stimulus to the sector. However, still, all might not be well for Cloudflare as the firm's shares tanked by a massive 25% in aftermarket trading on April 27, 2023, as it projected $305 million in revenue for the second quarter compared to the rosier analyst estimates of $320 million.Finally, adding another look at what's in store for this year, the management of Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW), one of the largest cybersecurity companies in terms of market capitalization, shared during the firm's earnings call for the second quarter of fiscal year 2023:While there has been discussion on moderation and cloud consumption in the market, we believe the relatively early stage of cloud security adoption has and will continue to shelter us from this headwind. Before I move on to Cortex and talk about continuing signs of optimism I see in that category, I feel compelled to take a detour towards AI. Clearly, AI has been on everyone’s mind given the continued conversation in the tech industry. Most of you know the story of arrival with the Palo Alto Networks. I talked about fragmentation and the need for a solution there, which we have talked a lot about. I also talked about automation and AI. We counted, I used the word AI more time than my first six months in Palo Alto Networks than platform or consolidation.The challenges you all know is that AI has been a data problem and continues to be so. Unlike consumer AI, where we can talk about Sonnets and ChatGPT’s creative capabilities and the revolution that is going to drive in search or advertising, its ability to summarize data and continue to amuse and inform us, the demands from AI and enterprise are far more exacting and so are the returns. An enterprise AI needs to be clean. It has to have comprehensive data. And in security, especially it needs to be real time. So not only do you need to have the best data to create great security outcomes, you also need to be positioned in line to block threats. Let me make a case why with petabytes of data from trillions of events, billions of sessions, hundreds of millions of URLs and tens of millions of flies flowing — files, not flies — flowing through our product across cloud, network and endpoints daily, we are best positioned to deliver security outcomes using AI machine learning.With these details in mind, let's take a look at the biggest cybersecurity companies in the world, with the top picks being Fortinet, Inc.

However, it isn't easy to find a great growth stock.In addition to volatility, these stocks carry above-average risk by their very nature. Also, one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end.However, it's pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.Colgate-Palmolive (CL) is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends. The company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this consumer products maker a great growth pick right now.Earnings GrowthEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.While the historical EPS growth rate for Colgate-Palmolive is 1.2%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 5.4% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 1.9%.Impressive Asset Utilization RatioAsset utilization ratio -- also known as sales-to-total-assets (S/TA) ratio -- is often overlooked by investors, but it is an important indicator in growth investing. This metric exhibits how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales.Story continuesRight now, Colgate-Palmolive has an S/TA ratio of 1.15, which means that the company gets $1.15 in sales for each dollar in assets. Comparing this to the industry average of 0.92, it can be said that the company is more efficient.In addition to efficiency in generating sales, sales growth plays an important role. And Colgate-Palmolive is well positioned from a sales growth perspective too. The company's sales are expected to grow 6% this year versus the industry average of 1.5%.Promising Earnings Estimate RevisionsBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.The current-year earnings estimates for Colgate-Palmolive have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 1% over the past month.Bottom LineColgate-Palmolive has not only earned a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This combination positions Colgate-Palmolive well for outperformance, so growth investors may want to bet on it.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

300,dbe7cd83-841e-3270-9e50-289f85db181d,CMCSA,2023-05-09,Disney selling Hulu would be a 'grave mistake': Analyst,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/disney-selling-hulu-grave-mistake-220132282.html,1683583292,VIDEO,"['DIS', 'CMCSA']","[The Walt Disney Company (DIS) is set to release its fiscal second quarter earnings after the closing bell on Wednesday. Revenue is expected to come in at $21.8 billion dollars, with adjusted earnings per share of $0.93.The media giant is projected to report strong earnings growth on its direct-to-consumer offerings.Yahoo Finance's Seana Smith and Akiko Fujita interviewed Jason Bazinet, Citi Managing Director, on what investors should expect this quarter.Bazinet believes a potential Hulu sale would be a ""grave mistake"" for Disney.Bazinet says he is in the ""minority among investors"" as he would like to see Disney buy the balance it doesn't own in order to merge with Disney+ and create what he calls a ""TV substitute on the streaming world.""Disney currently owns two-thirds of Hulu with Comcast's (CMCSA) NBCUniversal controlling the rest.See the full interview here.Key Video Takeaways:0:00:00 - What Wall Street is focused on0:01:14 - Hulu's future with DisneyVideo TranscriptAKIKO FUJITA: All eyes are going to be on that direct-to-consumer business. What are you expecting on that number?JASON BAZINET: Well, just to frame it for you, remember, Disney lost about $4 billion in the streaming business last fiscal year. Their quarter-- their first fiscal quarter, they lost about $1 billion in the quarter. And so no real discernible improvement, right? A billion dollars in a loss times 4 is another 4 billion loss. So what the Street will be focused on is, hopefully, a sharp reduction in the direct-to-consumer losses. The company is [INAUDIBLE] to about $200 million of smaller losses. So call it 800 million. And I think that's what the Street will be focused on. If we end up with a much smaller loss, the shares, I think, will do quite well.SEANA SMITH: Jason, what do you think we're going to hear when it comes to Hulu? Lots of talk about what exactly that's going to look like here just in terms of its future with Disney, whether or not it could potentially sell its stake. How do you see Disney addressing Hulu down the road?JASON BAZINET: Look, I was flabbergasted on the last earnings call, right, which was Mr. Iger's first quarter back, when he said everything was on the table when it came to Hulu. He was uncomfortable with what he called ""general entertainment,"" which pointed towards a potential Hulu sale. I think that would be a grave mistake. We would like to see Disney buy in the balance of Hulu it doesn't own, merge that with Disney+, rationalize some costs and really create a-- what I'll call a TV substitute on the streaming world.But I will tell you, I'm in the minority among investors. Every investor I chat with would be thrilled if Disney sold Hulu. So I'm in the minority. But if anything that Mr. Iger does tomorrow or Disney does tomorrow that indicates that they're more open to selling it, the Street would applaud that. I think actually it would be a mistake. But again, I'm in the minority.]"

(PX) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on May 15. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.21 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +16.7%.Revenues are expected to be $57.04 million, up 31.8% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for P10, Inc.For P10, Inc.The Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -12.91%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that P10, Inc. Will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that P10, Inc. Would post earnings of $0.21 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.22, delivering a surprise of +4.76%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.P10, Inc. Doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAmong the stocks in the Zacks Financial - Miscellaneous Services industry, Owl Rock Capital Corporation (ORCC) is soon expected to post earnings of $0.43 per share for the quarter ended March 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +38.7%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $352.05 million, up 33.3% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Owl Rock Capital Corporation has remained unchanged. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 0.47%, reflecting a higher Most Accurate Estimate.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), suggests that Owl Rock Capital Corporation will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Dushyant Sharma, our Founder and CEO. Dushyant?Story continuesDushyant SharmaThank you, David. As you can see from Slide 3, we once again had a very success with top line growth and adjusted EBITDA ahead of our expectations. Revenue increased 27.1% on a year-over-year basis to reach $148.3 million. Our first quarter adjusted EBITDA was $8.4 million, which was 56.4% higher than Q1 of last year. Contribution profit for the quarter was also higher than we had originally expected at $53.5 million despite the ongoing macro. These numbers are especially exciting to me from a profitability standpoint and demonstrate our continued progress. On a year-over-year basis, our adjusted EBITDA grew by $3 million or 56.4%, which means 50% of incremental contribution profit dollars drop through the adjusted EBITDA line. We believe this is even more compelling if we factor in the macro environment. Between Q4 and Q1, we had about 400 to 500 basis points of macro and seasonality-related inflationary impact. Meaning on an inflation-neutral basis, we would have expected to drop the vast majority for our contribution profit to adjusted EBITDA as OpEx did not increase on a relative basis. As we continue to make pricing adjustments to address inflation, over time, we believe these adjustments will become a tailwind for us when energy prices were closer to the preinflationary levels. We are also encouraged that our core biller business has been growing well and is scaling profitably, again, as more of our incremental revenue dollars dropped to adjusted EBITDA. Parallel to this, we continue to make investments in complementary offerings in our instant payment network or IPM and to small and medium-sized businesses or SMBs. ITN remains an exciting part of our strategy and is growing well. On SMB, we are receiving positive feedback from our partners and seeing encouraging early signs from the SMBs. As a reminder, IPN which is still under 10% of our overall revenue, is growing faster than our core business, even though IPN SMB are currently dilutive to our adjusted EBITDA margins. Said differently, Q1 adjusted EBITDA from our core biller business was meaningfully higher than the reported number of 15.7% taking into consideration the financial impact of the strategic investments we are making to drive our future growth. Key highlights from the quarter as listed on Slide 4. From a bookings perspective, we had a very strong quarter, our best ever, which resulted in a strong backlog at the quarter end. This is especially important for us. Having these substantial bookings at the end of the first quarter gives us a great deal of runway to get our clients implemented for revenue recognition in 2024.To add some additional color here, our bookings for the quarter included several large-scale clients across diverse verticals. We expect that most of these new clients will not be affected by inflation once they go live. Both the way we price these transactions with variable fees and the underlying industry segment itself. These new clients included a large estate agency, a sizable property management company, an extensive health care system, multiple large insurance companies and a large utility. As a reminder, the biggest impact from inflation has been from the energy utilities and not from the other industry verticals. In addition to bookings, we remain laser focused on onboarding speed and related customer engagement. Our successful client launches in Q4 contributed to our better-than-expected Q1 performance. A subset of these clients also have seasonally higher volumes in Q1 versus our quarters. We are pleased that we were able to get these clients live before Q1 to recognize the benefit. We similarly on client onboarding during Q1 and are happy with improving post pandemic conditions that allow for increased face-to-face large client engagements. We expect these high-touch engagements during the first quarter will lay the groundwork for us to bring additional clients live in Q2, and we are off to a good start. During the quarter, we expanded our long-term relationship with Oracle by certifying with Oracle Cloud in addition to the on-prem solution. This allows Oracle CIS cloud clients to easily integrate with our platform. We continue to see growth in our Oracle CIS client base. During the quarter, we also expanded our relationship with Guidewire, a software platform for more than 500 property and casualty insurers. As part of this, we have launched an integrated billing app, that is available to Guidewire customers and allows insurance companies to keep pace with a rapidly evolving customer need for a streamlined payment and billing experience. We also completed and launched another implementation of our billing and payment platform for a large municipal utility, adding another state capital to our list of growing customers. Ranked as a top tier municipal utility in the nation, the city leaders identified 3 primary objectives for this project. First, to drive more on-time payments; second, lower customer service costs; and third, increased customer satisfaction by letting the customer -- the cities customers pay how, when and where they want, with innovative payment methods and inclusive payment channels for their entire customer base. We upgraded our with our platform to achieve all the objectives to position well for the future. Let me now touch base on implementation backlog and how it relates to our expected growth trajectory and ability to deliver expanded adjusted EBITDA margins in 2024. From where we sit today, with the strength of the exiting 2024, coupled with Q1 2023 performance, we have a lot of confidence in our ability to deliver growth in 2024. At the same time, our first quarter results also demonstrate our improving ability to deliver incremental adjusted EBITDA margins and dollars to the bottom line. All these factors leave us well positioned to continue growing revenues and to expand profitability even for the next year. In summary, I'd reiterate what we said on the last call -- on our last call that we remain very confident regarding the long-term growth prospects of the business. This is especially true given the expanding IP and ecosystem we are building, which we believe allows us to reach a broader TAM and leverages the entire spectrum of interchange from a cost center in our biller business to interchange neutral IPM business, to interchange being a revenue source in our SMB offering and beyond. We are already off to a good start as indicated by our first quarter results, and we look forward to updating you on our progress in future calls. Now let me turn it over to Sanjay to review our financial results in greater detail.Sanjay KalraThank you, Dushyant. I'm very excited to be a part of Paymentus, and thank you all for joining us today. Before I discuss our quarterly results and outlook, I'd like to remind everyone that the financial results I'll be referring to include non-GAAP financial measures. As David mentioned earlier, our Q1 press release and earnings presentation includes reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP that are discussed on this call. Both of these are available on our website. Turning to Slide 5. For the first quarter of 2023, we delivered solid financial results that were above the top end of our guidance range. We believe these results demonstrate the strength of our business, which continues to perform well despite macroeconomic challenges still at play. Our first quarter results included revenue of $148.3 million, contribution profit of $53.5 million and adjusted EBITDA of $8.4 million. We continue to experience solid business momentum in the first quarter, which drove robust bookings, enabling us to exit the quarter with a solid backlog. Based on our strong quarterly performance and the positive market trends Dushyant mentioned earlier and our expectations for the remainder of 2023, we are modestly raising our full year 2023 revenue, contribution profit and adjusted EBITDA guidance, which I'll talk about shortly. Now let's review our first quarter financials in more detail. As I mentioned, Q1 revenue was $148.3 million, up 27.1% year-over-year. This growth was largely driven by increased transactions from existing billers, and launch of new billers and increased activity in our Instant Payment Network or IPM business. Transactions grew to $108.5 million in the first quarter, up 23.4% year-over-year. First quarter '23 contribution profit increased to $53.5 million, up 13% year-over-year. Contribution margin was 36.1% for the first quarter compared to 40.6% in the prior year period. Contribution profit per transaction for the quarter was $0.49, down from $0.54 in the prior year period. Contribution profit growth lagged revenue growth primarily due to continued inflation in the utility sector and mix with larger billers coming on board. As we've noted in the past, variables outside our control, such as an increase in the average payment amount or changes in the payment mix can influence contribution profit on a quarterly basis. To offset some of the impact of continuing inflationary conditions, we are currently engaged in active repricing conversations with our customers and are encouraged by what we have already achieved to date. Adjusted gross profit was $43.7 million for the first quarter, up 16.9% year-over-year. Operating expenses increased to $41.1 million, a 13.4% increase year-over-year. Increase is primarily due to increased sales and marketing expenses as we continue to focus resources on our go-to-market strategy. During Q1 '23, we made a change to the employee merit and compensation cycle. In the previous years, raises were given on the employees' anniversary, more or less evenly distributed throughout the year. In 2023, all wages were effective from January 1, 2023. Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $8.4 million or 15.7% of contribution profit, up 56.4% compared to $5.4 million or 11.4% of contribution profit in the prior year. This annual growth is a result of our repricing and continued expense management actions. I believe this also demonstrates the inherent operating leverage we have in the business and our ability to adapt to changing market conditions as we continue to grow. Other income was $1.4 million during the first quarter, reflecting increased interest income from our bank deposits and effective cash management. Non-GAAP net income was $2.9 million or $0.02 per share, compared to non-GAAP net income of $3.7 million or an EPS of $0.03 in the prior year, largely due to higher income tax benefit in the prior year. We'll now discuss our balance sheet and liquidity position. We ended Q1 with unrestricted cash of $143.6 million compared to $147.3 million at the end of 2022. The $3.7 million decrease is primarily comprised of $4.8 million of cash generated from operations offset by $8.3 million cash used in investing activities. The company does not have any debt. Our days sales outstanding at the end of Q1 was 46 days, consistent with DSO at the end of 2022. Working capital at the end of Q1 was approximately $181 million, an increase of approximately $3.8 million from the end of 2022. We had 123.3 million shares outstanding at the end of Q1 compared to 123.2 million shares outstanding at the end of 2022. The marginal increase was due to vesting of employee restricted stock units. Now I share some brief observations since joining Paymentus as a CFO, then review our updated outlook for Q2 and the full year 2023. Since I joined the company 2 months ago, my initial focus has been on 2 main priorities. First, acquainting myself with everything Paymentus does. Its business model and DevOps operations. Our strategy, meeting the entire team, learning as much as possible about what has transpired since the IPO. And second, doing a deep dive into the financials in order to gain a better understanding of our 2023 budget and 2024 financial goals. On the first point, now that I'm more familiar with the inner workings of the company. I am even more amazed than I was originally by the expanding and compelling opportunities that I believe lie ahead for Paymentus. We are well positioned to capitalize on the attractive industry trends in the end market that we serve. I'm also excited by the depth of talent and experience of my team members and look forward to working with them and contributing to Paymentus future growth. As I now turn more attention to Paymentus long-range financial model and targets, I'm also considering how we can best provide investors and analysts with greater color on the performance of our business. This includes evaluating our current KPIs and non-GAAP disclosures. While this process is still underway, 1 specific metric which has drawn my attention is exit backlog. I believe our new bookings in Q1 demonstrate the robust demand for our technology solutions and our strong exit backlog gives us further confidence and visibility in the growth trajectory for the company. Now I'll turn to our non-GAAP guidance for Q2 '23, beginning on Slide 6. In Q2 '23, we expect revenues to be in the range of $142 million to $148 million, representing 21% year-over-year growth at midpoint. Contribution profit to range from $54 million to $56 million, which is 13% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. And adjusted EBITDA of $8 million to $9 million, representing a growth of 70% year-over-year at the midpoint. Given the progress we have already seen in Q1 and our expectation for the remainder of the year, for the full year 2023, on Slide 7, we now expect revenue in the range of $591 million to $606 million, up 2% from the midpoint of our prior guidance. Contribution profit in the range of $225 million to $237 million, also up modestly versus our prior guidance; and adjusted EBITDA to range from $34 million to $38.5 million, representing a 3.6% increase at the midpoint versus our prior guidance. In summary, we had a strong first quarter, where we continue to build on our solid momentum from 2022, which we have carried into 2023. As a result, we believe we have positioned ourselves well for the balance of 2023. Thank you, everyone, for your attention today. And now I'll turn it back to Dushyant for final remarks before we open up the call for questions.Dushyant SharmaThanks, Sanjay. In closing, based on our first quarter results and the strength of our backlog, we believe we are extremely well positioned for the balance of 2023 and into 2024. We also are laser-focused on bringing more and more of these new customers live on our platform to continue to expand profitability and adjusted EBITDA margins. Our strategy remains simple and in this order: first, sign as many clients as possible to grow the network. This includes larger clients. Second, onboard those clients as quickly as possible and simultaneously deliver best-in-class service. And third, improve operating efficiencies and manage costs in order to drive margin expansion and bring more to the bottom line. I want to take this opportunity to thank each of my colleagues at Paymentus, who worked tirelessly to serve our clients. Thank you. That concludes our prepared remarks. I'll now open the line up for questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from John Davis with Raymond James.John Kimbrough DavisDushyant, you talked a lot about kind of the pricing changes that you're going to make headed into this year given inflation. Just curious how those conversations have gone in the unexpected attrition. Obviously, numbers were good, good to see the increase in guide for the full year. But just curious how these conversations have gone with your customers as you implemented pricing changes that you talked about late last year.Dushyant SharmaJohn, thank you for the question. The conversations are going extremely well, actually. Clients are very understanding and they -- we are not the only ones who are talking to them about the challenges in their vendor network, if you will. So we are seeing positive feedback. Some of the conversations have resulted into actual meaningful pricing increases, which we will continue to deploy throughout the year. But 1 thing I do want to highlight to you and the rest of the analyst community on the Investor Day is that as we are seeing the trend, what we are doing now is, as an account management team or account management function, we are just including the pricing discussions as an ongoing framework. So we think that until the inflation is completely behind us, we'll continue to have these discussions as we are seeing positive trends here.John Kimbrough DavisOkay. That's helpful. And then just quickly on -- I think when you set out the initial 2023 outlook, you assume kind of no incremental new wins in the contribution profit outlook and EBITDA outlook for the full year. You mentioned numerous wins here in the first quarter. So just -- have you had to put those into the guide? Or are you still excluding new wins from the guide? Just help us think about where the guide is today versus 90 days ago?Sanjay KalraJohn, this is Sanjay. Thanks for the question. When we guided earlier versus when we are guiding now, the major increase we are seeing is based on the activity we have seen from the growth with the existing billers and also increased transactions. We did launch some big billers in Q4 last year, and we have seen a decent growover from them as well. So all that's coming from that on the growth -- I mean, the increased growth in the outlook is coming from these things we have seen. We have not baked in any significant revenue from the new wins. That remains the same what we said last time.OperatorOur next question comes from Dave Koning with Baird.David John KoningNice quarter. And maybe a couple of questions. My first one, just implementations, I remember that was part of a little bit of the weakness kind of midyear last year and through the end of last year. You talked about implementations being a little slower. Have those picked up? Are they according to plan? Are they actually may be ahead of plan now? Or how are you seeing those?Dushyant SharmaActually, David, that's a great question. And I was trying to allude to in my prepared remarks. The post-pandemic conditions is now actually helping us a little bit, especially in the large deals. That's where we saw some of the -- more of the stretching of the implementation time lines. We are now able to see customers, first of all, both in the sales cycle, but also in the implementation phase as well. So those high-touch engagements are giving us a lot of confidence that we'll be able to keep within the time lines we anticipate. So the implementation as a whole is actually on a better footing than where we were last year.David John KoningOkay. No, that sounds great. And I guess my second question is a numbers question around the gap between gross and net revenue, really. It was reasonably small in Q4, I think a few percent gap. This quarter, it's about a 14% gap, right? It gross grew 27%, net grew 13%. And next quarter, you're guiding for that gap to be cut in half, basically what are the dynamics? I understand the inflation impacts, but what are the dynamics of that gap kind of moving around?Dushyant SharmaYes, a great question. The growth of revenue at 27% and the growth of contribution profit at 13% definitely brings a question. So let me give a around what we are seeing and what we expect to happen. First of all, both these are going to converge as time passes. We are seeing this as a temporary phase. And one of the reasons, as we said, is inflation we are seeing and then, in fact, seasonality is a part of it as well. But we have also started adding to some extent, larger billers in the mix. And what larger billers means is billers with heavy volume of transactions, where the contribution margin on these are slightly lower than the corporate contribution margins. So it's giving a temporary impact where the contribution margins seem low. But as time passes and as we fail more, we expect this gap to converge. And overall, we should realize economies of scale, which should ultimately improve our contribution margin together with contribution profit dollars. In fact, if you look at what we delivered in Q1 and compared with the guidance of Q2 and the guidance for the full year, both in all the 3 scenarios, you will see that this gap is already converging. And in the outer years, we expect this to converge even more. So we think it's a temporary phase. And eventually, this will be behind us. And right now, it's a great opportunity for us to see how we can scale the business and eventually get a better contribution profit and margin in the long run. Just a quick point I would add to that is that even Q1 bookings give us a lot of encouragement in that regard as well.OperatorOur next question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America.Unidentified AnalystThis is Tyler on for Jason. First, I just want to start by looking at the EBITDA margins. I mean, they came in pretty healthy this quarter. Can you maybe just speak to what, in particular, drove that upside to price and sort of how we should be thinking about margins going through 2023 as well? Is it still the right idea to think about quarterly expansion on a year-on-year basis? And I guess going off that point as well, where are you anticipating the most margin efficiencies to come from throughout the year? Is it mostly G&amp;A? Or any color there would be helpful.Dushyant SharmaYes, Jason, I'll say that when we guided, we were expecting close to 40% growth year-over-year, and we came at 56.7%. So we definitely are all are very encouraged about the results. And the thing that Dushyant pointed out, I will just remind that the company's objective is to drop as much as possible the contribution profit dollars we generate to the bottom line. There's a significant inherent operating leverage in the business. We don't really need to spend the money if the contribution profit is increasing. So I would say that the increase is mainly coming from operating expenses, not increasing in the same line or in the same ratio as the contribution profit is increasing. So overall, I think the operating leverage exists. And in future where that will come will also be from the same. Right now, we are putting some investments in Q2 in our sales marketing and also in Q3. But over time, we expect that the operating leverage would be more than what we see this year. In fact, for the whole year, you've seen EBITDA up by 27% year-over-year at the midpoint. In Q2, we are seeing good growth there as well. So we are encouraged by what we delivered, and we believe that this growth is going to come. And on the top line, just to mention as well on the contribution profit line, the growth is coming from -- it's mainly organic growth and increase in transactions from the existing billers. And we are also seeing traction on IPN as well, which we will talk more as it grows significantly, but we are seeing good increases there as well. So I think everything is contribution -- is contributing in the right direction, helping us grow the EBITDA dollars.Unidentified AnalystOkay. That's helpful. And then just curious, as a follow-up on bookings growth. It looks like you had a robust increase in that as well as the number of transactions. But maybe if you could just spend a minute or 2 parsing out how much of that growth was from new versus existing clients? And if there's any vertical concentration that's worth mentioning? And then I guess also jumping through that as well, just sort of how we should think Paymentus is anticipating revenue conversion. Just curious if we should be thinking like how we should be thinking about average conversion rates given the current macro backdrop?Dushyant SharmaI think we have not shared in the past the new versus existing. But you could actually -- it is safe to assume that we work very hard towards the tail end of the year to bring as many customers live as possible to actually beat our 2022 top line guidance, which we did. And then in all ourselves up for 2023, as we exited the year with a healthy backlog. So we have done that. We're also seeing some same-store sales, which Sanjay alluded to earlier. So I think all of those are pointing in the right direction. In terms of the conversion itself, I think we'll continue to take a look at whether we can start to share some of the information, the backlog and the -- and how that converts over time. But I can tell you, as I said earlier, we are seeing positive trends in the implementation area in the overall business just because we are able to interact with our clients, especially the large ones, in the high-touch engagement that is needed to bring them live.OperatorOur next question comes from Andrew Estes with Wolfe Research.Andrew Lee EstesIt's Andrew on for Darren. Just a few on the strategy side, can you maybe talk about the Oracle CIS client base and the opportunity that exists within, especially with the updated implementation? And then with regards to the IPN, remind us where you are with respect to executing on the third horizon of that strategy.Dushyant SharmaSure. Thank you, Andrew. In terms of Oracle, Oracle is a great partner, has been a great partner. We have been doing a lot of things together with them in the sense our Oracle customer base continues to grow. This cloud integration actually helps us where an Oracle cloud -- Oracle CIS cloud of the client would find it very easy to integrate with Paymentus through the certification of the integration we have achieved. So we are very excited about that. In terms of the IPN itself, look, IPN to us is a multidimensional strategy. First, on its own, you're trying to bring in -- or we are trying to bring in the participants who have been left behind, if you will, through the platform we built for the billers. So what I mean by that is the banks and other fintechs who are left behind, they wanted to play in the Paymentus space, but just couldn't get in just because of the strength of the services we provide directly to the billers through our platform. So with IPN now, we are able to bring those in, and we have tremendous progress there, a lot of interest in the market. But the second thing about IPN, which I think will become a lot more clear as we continue to execute on our strategy is a very efficient distribution model for us -- or channel for us. We have banks as partners, we have our partners, and we also have distribution to a lot of businesses through our payment network, and many of which could utilize our increasing functional footprint of receivable payment payables, expense management and accounting and so on, especially in the SMB space. So we're very excited about that. And so far, we have seen great progress.OperatorOur next question from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan.Tien-Tsin HuangA lot of the good stuff. I wanted to ask already. I wanted to get a little bit more, maybe, Dushyant, on the SMB push with the payables discussion you had last time as well. Just any surprises there in terms of momentum and start to connect closer to the SMBs?Dushyant SharmaYes. Thank you, Tien-Tsin. Good question. I was responding about the word surprises. We are seeing a lot of positive excitement about the product. And it's early stages and a lot of discussions early on and getting a lot of positive feedback as well as from the SMBs themselves. Folks using the product, giving us feedback, and we are seeing a lot of encouraging signs there. We believe that the whole SMB strategy and our strategy to build SMB in a way that all of that functionality is available for enterprise clients as well, especially those who use our receivable capabilities can now leverage payables and expense management and all of that, that comes with it. I think gives us a lot of confidence that we are setting ourselves up for a great future ahead. So that's the one I'm able to share right now, but we will share more as we see more progress.Tien-Tsin HuangOkay. Great. My quick follow-up, just to expand or dig deeper into the -- what's going on in the bank partner side. Given all the stresses in the banking system and all the turmoil, et cetera, that -- have you noticed any change in terms of existing relationships or even prospective on the banking side.Dushyant SharmaActually, some of our large bank partners, they're getting even stronger. So we're very excited about that. But in terms of the overall our bank network, we are not seeing any negative change that we did just as bullish as we were before about the entire ecosystem of our platform, whether it's on the bank side or the credit union side.Unidentified AnalystI wanted to follow up on some of the backlog commentary, you had it sounded like that was sort of what was catching your eye early on.Dushyant SharmaWe appreciate the question. I am a little reluctant at this point to share the numbers. I'll be honest. I'm very excited about looking at the backlog and various other KPIs. Quantification is not something I'd like to go here, but it's -- I would say it's a significant increase year-over-year. And if I may maybe add to that is that where we sit today, and we are looking at how -- where we want to be next year based on how well we have executed against the implementation backlog to bring customers live especially in the Q4 and then what we're -- how hard we worked in Q1 to bring some of the customers live in Q2. Combined that with the backlog and the early success in Q1, we feel good about where we are relative to 2023 and 2024. And one of the things, which I think I just want to highlight is that when we measure the backlog, we take out all of the same-store sales from it. So said differently, let's see if I book a client for $1 million in second half of 2022 and the client goes live in some time 2023, there is some tailwinds, the digitization tailwinds that take place. And then by the time, over a period of time, that customer continues to rise with us as well as the same-store sales. So when you factor that in is even becomes more impressive, especially with the size of the backlog. But we will take a look at it, as Sanjay mentioned, that what we could share as the time goes by.Tien-Tsin HuangGot it. Makes a lot of sense. I appreciate that. And then I guess as a follow-up question. When you guys think about EBITDA conversion over the next couple of years, obviously, you've had a lot of investment priorities, whether it's the IPN, small business platform, some of the acquisitions. But when we look at kind of CapEx and capitalized software, it is running around close to 100% of EBITDA. So just wondering how you're thinking about the level of investment in the business, what the outlook is for that and whether we could see the very strong top line growth contribute towards more cash flow conversion as we get into 2024.Dushyant SharmaI think that -- I would say this is actually one of the key points you wanted to get across. And that was that -- we have always been a relatively profitability-centric organization obviously, being public, has some costs associated with it that challenged some of the profitability dimensions we had or the metrics we used to have and then obviously, the macro and so on. But one of the things we wanted to get across was that we have the ability to drop a lot of the top line and the contribution profit dollars to the EBITDA line. And we are already doing a lot with our core biller business the IPN and the SMB, some of those new initiative investments we are making. But we feel good about generating -- dropping more to the cash line, if you will, in 2024, just because even as we are making the investments, we feel good about where we sit today with our current OpEx itself. Sanjay, do you want to add something?Sanjay KalraI'd just add that -- I appreciate the question. You see $8.4 million EBITDA; and then in the cash flow, you see $8.1 million software CapEx and hence the question. But if you look at our cash flow statement, even though the cash might have dropped by around $3.8 million in the quarter. But overall, our working capital has significantly increased. So a lot of cash is sitting in accounts receivable, which we plan to turn around in the next quarter. Next quarter, the cash should go up. That's the expectation. And while we don't give cash, but going forward, our planning for cash is either to stay neutral or maybe slightly negative, depending if the software development increases. But overall, all that investment is happening for future growth for the projects for which we don't see revenue yet. And that is basically going to drive more growth, and that's where all this investment is going. So that outer years revenue growth, which is invested today, and I think we are on track in terms of managing cash as well for the whole year.OperatorThere are no further questions playing at this time. So I will pass the conference back over to the management team for any closing remarks.Dushyant SharmaWell, thank you, everyone. Thank you for being here with us today, and have a great day, and stay safe.Sanjay KalraThank you all.OperatorThat concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.]"

312,e0ec23fd-41f3-3e3b-a57c-4bdaac29cc46,MU,2023-05-09,3 Semiconductor Stocks to Ditch Before the Great Recession,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-semiconductor-stocks-ditch-great-103634446.html,1683282994,STORY,"['AMD', 'MU', 'ENPH']","[Are we heading for a semiconductor stocks crash? It’s increasingly looking that way. After the semiconductor shortages of 2021 and 2022, the pendulum has swung sharply in the other direction.People have gone back to school, returned to the office, and so on, alleviating the need for so much extra computing technology at home. Meanwhile, it seems semiconductor companies revved up production too much and have excess supply. Now, there is a glut of inventory in various parts of the semiconductor industry. Memory chips, graphics chips, and even analog chips are showing signs of strain.Throw in global macroeconomic concerns and the overall picture becomes more fraught. Many economists expect a recession to start by early next year, and if it’s a big one, it could be devastating for the already struggling chips industry. All that makes these three semiconductor stocks ones to sell today.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAMD (AMD)Sign of AMD office in Markham, Ontario, Canada. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. is an American multinational semiconductor company.Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comInvestors love AMD (NASDAQ:AMD). The firm is led by its charismatic CEO, Lisa Su. There is no denying AMD’s accomplishments in recent years as the firm has roared back from its prior doldrums while stealing market share from key rivals.However, the momentum has ended. As the glut in the semiconductor industry has piled up, earnings are under pressure.To that point, AMD just announced a disappointing set of quarterly results. Revenues slipped 9% and gross margin fell by 400 basis points. Despite the drop in revenues, AMD’s costs soared, leading the firm into the red. The firm swung to a loss of $139 million versus a profit of $786 million for the same quarter last year.AMD has fantastic technology, and it seems set to become a player in the growing AI space as well. But semiconductors are a cyclical industry and AMD has already fallen into unprofitability even before the recession starts. It could be a rough year or two for AMD stock before the current downturn ends.Story continuesMicron Technology (MU)An outside image of a Micron Technology, Inc. headquarters. MU stock.Source: Charles Knowles / Shutterstock.comMicron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) is a leader in memory chips. Specifically, it earns the lion’s share of its income from DRAM and NAND flash products.As technology continues to evolve, we’ve needed far more memory — particularly to power new mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. Combined with a consolidation in the memory chip industry, investors felt that Micron could overcome its shaky history and become a steady growth story.Unfortunately, the economic cycle has caused MU stock to sink once again. Micron and other memory chip makers made way too much product last year amid the temporary surge in consumer electronics devices. Now, as its latest quarterly results show, Micron is slashing prices, writing down inventory, and otherwise dealing with the fallout of a sudden downturn in its fortunes.Rough days are ahead. Analysts are projecting that Micron will lose more than $4 per share in 2023. And with a great recession potentially on the horizon, we could see a steep drop in consumer electronics spending, which could trigger another big leg down in MU stock.Enphase Energy (ENPH)mobile phone screen with enphase energy logo on it to represent renewable energy stocksSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comEnphase Energy (NASDAQ:ENPH) is a firm that makes semiconductor-based microinverters for the solar photovoltaic industry.ENPH stock has been incredibly successful in recent years, with shares rising from around $10 to a peak of more than $300 over the past few years. However, it appears that the lights are going out on Enphase; shares are plunging amid a rapidly darkening outlook for the company.What’s gone wrong? It starts with valuation. The stock hit nearly 100 times earnings at its peak and remains expensive even after its recent decline. Arguably, investors got much too excited about semiconductor technology companies with a green energy angle. Under the Biden Administration, there have been heavy incentives for green power deployments.But that momentum appears to be running out. The Republican Party retook control of Congress in 2022, placing a substantial obstacle to future solar subsidies. Additionally, some members of Congress are aiming to slash green energy subsidies as part of the current standoff over the debt ceiling.To sum up, Enphase is an incredibly expensive stock. Its catalyst around subsidies already came and went. And now it faces the prospect of falling spending and a setback in the green energy industry at the same time that the economy is barreling toward a recession.On the date of publication, Ian Bezek did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

It’s just one fintech in a sea of competitors looking to get a piece of the B2C (business to consumer) and C2C (consumer to consumer) pie.Story continuesWhile it’s certainly possible that Block will see a pop in the stock price should it manage to top earnings expectations when it reports on May 4, I recommend that investors disregard whatever the Q1 report shows.Allegations that Block is overstating user growth and glossing over user acquisition costs for its CashApp unit are of more significant concern.When you throw in the competition from other well-heeled digital platforms and the company’s high valuation (35 times forward earnings), Block is a hard pass for me.SQ stock has a “D” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Exela Technologies (XELA)A concept photo for the Internet Computer (ICP) crypto.Source: ShutterstockWould you want to own a stock on the verge of delisting? Of course not. Exela Technologies (NASDAQ:XELA), a computing company that specializes in business automation, is trying to fend that off as we speak.The company’s stock is around 3 cents per share and has been under $1 since August 2022, so Nasdaq is threatening to delist it. XELA is planning a special meeting to ask shareholders to approve a reverse stock split at a ridiculous margin of 1-for-100 or 1-for-200.That doesn’t solve Exela’s problem, though. The company’s seeing falling revenue, is cutting workers and is more than $1 billion in debt. That’s unhealthy when the company has a market cap of only $41 million.A reverse stock split is essentially rearranging chairs on the Titanic. XELA stock has an “F” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Meta Materials (MMAT)Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography Concept - EUV and EUVL - An EUV Laser Pulse Projecting Circuit Patterns onto a Silicon Wafer to Produce Next-Gen Microchips - 3D Illustration.

Its work develops materials that help prevent battery fires, for instance.However, the company is losing far more money than it’s bringing in. The fourth quarter included revenues of $1.4 million and operating expenses of $24.8 million. The company posted a net earnings loss of $79.1 million for the entire year.MMAT stock is down 84% this year, falling to less than 20 cents per share. It’s trying to raise money through a $25 million underwritten public offering of 83.33 million shares of common stock priced at 30 cents.This is a stock to avoid. MMAT stock has a “D” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Intel (INTC)The Intel logo in blue on a black screen.Source: Kate Krav-Rude / Shutterstock.comIntel (NYSE:INTC) is one of the best-known names in the semiconductor space, but the stock is having some issues these days.Intel is notably losing market share to Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), seeing its share sliced from 82% in 2018 to 62% in 2022. It also cut its dividend payout in February by 66%.Earnings for the first quarter saw revenue fall by nearly 36% year-over-year to $11.7 billion. Its net loss was $2.8 billion, or 66 cents per share, the biggest quarterly loss in company history.The company also posted a loss of 4 cents per share. A year ago, Intel had a net profit of $8.1 billion and $1.98 per share.Those are difficult numbers to digest. It’s no wonder that INTC stock is down 32% in the last 12 months.Intel is trying to turn things around, and it has an ambitious plan to turn its factories into foundries that can make chips for other companies, but that work will take time.Intel is targeting 2026 as a goal in which it will compete for high-profile work.That’s too long to hold onto a stock that’s retrenching. INTC stock has an “F” rating in the Portfolio Grader.HP (HPQ)Source: Tomasz Wozniak / Shutterstock.comFormerly known as Hewlett-Packard, HP (NYSE:HPQ) makes personal computers, printers and printer supplies. It also works in the 3D printing space.But it’s been a tough few months for HP, as global PC shipments dropped by more than 28% in the fourth quarter of 2022, followed by a drop of 29% in the first quarter of this year.In the fiscal fourth quarter, HP’s sales fell by 11.2% overall, with notebook sales dropping by 26% and desktop sales falling by 3%.The company’s fiscal first quarter of 2023 wasn’t any better. HPQ saw its revenue fall nearly 19% year over year to $13.83 billion, while analysts expected revenue of $14.17 billion. Its PC shipments dropped by 24% in the quarter.The bottom line is that computer makers like HP are being hurt by weaker demand and too much inventory, a situation expected to continue potentially into the third quarter of the year, the Wall Street Journal reported.I’m not saying that HP is a bad company, but as far as May goes, it’s a tech stock to avoid. HPQ has a “D” rating in the Portfolio Grader right now.Micron Technology (MU)AI. Circuit board. Technology background. Central Computer Processors CPU concept. Motherboard digital chip. Tech science background. Integrated communication processor. 3D illustration representing semiconductor stocksSource: ShutterstockMicron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) is another semiconductor stock that’s fallen on more challenging times.As recently as January 2022, the stock was nearly $100 per share, but today it barely touches $60.It’s also failing to gain market share. In fact, it is losing ground in the lucrative semiconductor space. Last year, Micron had a global market share of 4.6%. It hasn’t been over 5% since 2018, when it had a 6.3% market share.Earnings for the company’s fiscal second quarter raised plenty of red flags. Revenue of $3.69 billion dropped 52% from a year ago and came in less than analysts’ expectation for $3.71 billion. The company lost $1.91 per share, while Wall Street expected an EPS loss of only 88 cents per share.Micron’s being lapped by the competition, and nothing will change in May. MU stock has a “D” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Western Digital (WDC)Front of a Western Digital (WDC) building in Malpitas, California.Source: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.comWestern Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) makes computer data storage devices, including hard drives, flash drives and enterprise storage platforms.It’s suffering from the same headwinds as HP—bloated inventories and a drop in demand. Benchmark Analytics notes companies like Western Digital will be affected into 2024 by a decline in NAND flash drive pricing and high NAND inventory levels.Western Digital reports first-quarter earnings in May, and Wall Street hopes for an improvement from its December report. The company then posted revenue of $3.11 billion, a fall of 35.7% year-over-year.Also, note that Western Digital is reportedly talking to Kioxia Holdings about a deal that could see Western spin off its flash business. The talks seem in response to activist investor Elliott Management, which proposed last year that Western Digital split into two companies.WDC stock is down 24% in the last three months, and I expect it to stay there for a while until inventories correct themselves. WDC stock has a “D” rating in the Portfolio Grader.On the date of publication, Louis Navellier held MU.

For more top stocks, head on over to Goldman Sachs' Top 5 Stock Picks for 2023. After a vicious drubbing in 2022 that led to growth and technology stocks sometimes bleeding as much as half of their value on the stock market, 2023 appears to be off to a good start. Companies such as Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) are up by a whopping 94% year to date, giving some hope that perhaps, for the technology industry, the worst might be over.This sentiment is also encouraged by statements from the Federal Reserve. The Fed's extremely hawkish actions last year aimed at bringing down inflation saw it increase U.S. benchmark interest rates by a massive 5 percentage points, bringing it up from the 0.25% rate that had been set during the onset of the coronavirus pandemic when the bank had cut rates by 2.5% in March 2020. At the same time, the Fed's latest meeting which saw it increase rates by 25 basis points (0.25%) came with optimistic commentary from both the monetary policy committee and chairman Jerome Powell.Investment bank The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS), on the other hand, is taking a look at the impact of the Fed rate hikes on the general economic health. The bank's outlook for 2023 is cautiously upbeat as well if we go by its Economic Outlook Report. Goldman believes that it is possible to reduce inflation without pushing the economy into a recession, and subsequently, it has diverged from the consensus view which is certain that a recession is on the horizon. Au contraire, the investment bank outlines that if the GDP growth is carefully managed - by keeping growth close to 1% for reducing labor demand to bringing down wages for diminishing purchasing power - then a recession, typically defined as consecutive quarters of reduced economic growth, can be avoided.Naturally, this rather interesting balance of macroeconomic indicators also merits a look at what Goldman Sachs is recommending on the investment front, and which recommendations are performing well so far this year. Some of the companies that are covered in the article are Expedia Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE), Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), and Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD).Story continuesGoldman Sachs' Top 15 Stock Picks for 2023Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyWe used a list of Goldman Sachs' top stock picks for 2023 that were revealed earlier this year, and picked out those with the highest upside to price target.Goldman Sachs' Top 15 Stock Picks for 202315.

Customers are smart. Our guests come in, and they don't want to get nickel and dimed,"" Hochman said on Yahoo! Finance Live (video above).It's hard to argue diners at Chili's are getting ripped off on the Big Bacon BBQ burger. At a cost of $17.19, you get nearly 1,700 calories, consisting of two enormous patties, six slices of bacon, BBQ sauce, cheddar cheese, red onion, pickles, and a side of fries.For a value-focused restaurant player such as Brinker, giving diners more bang for their buck worked out well in the first quarter.Same-restaurant sales at Chili's and Maggiano's rose a hearty 9.6% and 21.6%, respectively. The company said the sales gains were fueled by higher menu prices and more orders of premium items like that Big Bacon BBQ burger.Operating profit margins for Brinker rose to 13.4% from 13.1% a year ago. Margins improved year over year at both Chili's and Maggiano's.Earnings per share surged 34% from a year earlier.The big burgers at Chili's are moving. (Chili's)Serving up feasts at a great price has also worked out well for long-time Brinker International competitor Darden (DRI), owner of value chains Olive Garden and Longhorn Steakhouse.Same-restaurant sales at Olive Garden rose 12.3% in the most recent quarter, followed by a 10.8% increase at Longhorn Steakhouse.Operating profits increased 16% from a year ago for Darden.""Consumers continue to seek value, which is not about low prices,"" Darden CEO Rick Cardenas told analysts on an earnings call.Shares of Brinker International and Darden are up 16% and 11%, respectively this year, compared to a 7.7% gain for the S&amp;P 500.Story continuesSuccessful quarters (and as a result, favorable stock-price reactions) for some of the country's largest sit-down restaurant chains come amid growing economic stress on lower-income to middle-income diners.These cohorts have taken to cutting back on items purchased at fast-food chains such as McDonald's (MCD) and Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) owned Dairy Queen.The read may be that these cash-strapped diners see greater overall value in spending a little more sitting down to eat at a Chili's or Olive Garden for all-you-can-eat breadsticks or a 1,700-calorie burger and fries for under $20.A less stomach-filling McDonald's Big Mac, fries, and soda could set you back more than $15, depending on where you live.Says Brinker's Hochman, ""Guests know when they are getting a fair deal and they are getting abundant quality.""Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

317,46c0ef35-ec2c-35ad-b795-b424b620d4da,YUM,2023-05-09,"Pulling back 4.0% this week, Yum! Brands' NYSE:YUM) five-year decline in earnings may be coming into investors focus",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pulling-back-4-0-week-110035320.html,1683630035,STORY,['YUM'],"[When we invest, we're generally looking for stocks that outperform the market average. And the truth is, you can make significant gains if you buy good quality businesses at the right price. For example, the Yum! Brands, Inc. (NYSE:YUM) share price is up 63% in the last 5 years, clearly besting the market return of around 44% (ignoring dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 26% in the last year , including dividends .Since the long term performance has been good but there's been a recent pullback of 4.0%, let's check if the fundamentals match the share price. View our latest analysis for Yum! Brands While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During five years of share price growth, Yum! Brands actually saw its EPS drop 0.02% per year.So it's hard to argue that the earnings per share are the best metric to judge the company, as it may not be optimized for profits at this point. Therefore, it's worth taking a look at other metrics to try to understand the share price movements.We doubt the modest 1.8% dividend yield is attracting many buyers to the stock. In contrast revenue growth of 4.7% per year is probably viewed as evidence that Yum! Brands is growing, a real positive. In that case, the company may be sacrificing current earnings per share to drive growth.The graphic below depicts how earnings and revenue have changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-and-revenue-growthYum! Brands is a well known stock, with plenty of analyst coverage, suggesting some visibility into future growth. You can see what analysts are predicting for Yum! Brands in this interactive graph of future profit estimates.Story continuesWhat About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Yum! Brands, it has a TSR of 78% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!A Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that Yum! Brands has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 26% in the last twelve months. That's including the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 12%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Yum! Brands better, we need to consider many other factors. For instance, we've identified   4 warning signs for Yum! Brands (2 make us uncomfortable)  that you should be aware of.But note: Yum! Brands may not be the best stock to buy.

The Nasdaq Composite advanced but just slightly, less than 0.1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&amp;P 500 lost 1.2% and 0.8%, respectively.The week’s trade was dominated by the anticipation and aftermath of the Fed’s rate hike.  Markets had already priced in a 25 bps rate hike, and the decision did not come as a surprise. Yet, the regional banking crisis deepened throughout the week, raising hopes that the central bank might take a more pragmatic view of the situation. However, with signals coming in from the Fed that a rate pause was not a certainty even in the coming months, the first four sessions of the week reeled under the resultant gloom and doom.But a blockbuster Friday marked a rebound for the indexes, and much of last week’s losses were pared off. Robust jobs data and unexpectedly bright earnings reported by the mega-cap tech companies led the comeback.Regardless of market conditions, we, here at Zacks, provide investors with unbiased guidance on how to beat the market. As usual, Zacks Research guided investors over the past three months with its time-tested methodologies. Given the prevailing market uncertainty, you may want to look at our feats to prepare better for your next action.Here are some of our key achievements:General Mills and Manitowoc Surge Following Zacks Rank UpgradeShares of General Mills, Inc. GIS have soared 17% (versus the S&amp;P 500’s 0.1% increase) since it was upgraded to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) on February 20.Another stock, The Manitowoc Company, Inc. MTW, which was upgraded to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) on February 21,  has returned 7.9% since then (versus the S&amp;P 500’s 0.1% rise).Zacks Rank, our short-term rating system, has earnings estimate revisions at its core. Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements. Story continuesThis stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +24.8% since 1988.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks Rank #1 stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;A hypothetical portfolio of Zacks Rank #1 stocks returned 9.7% this year (through March 6) versus 5.4% for the S&amp;P 500 Index.Check General Mills’ historical EPS and Sales here&gt;&gt;&gt;Check Manitowoc’s historical EPS and Sales here&gt;&gt;&gt;Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Recommendation Upgrade Drives Brambles and Taylor Wimpey HigherShares of Brambles Limited BXBLY and Taylor Wimpey plc TWODY have advanced 16.9% (versus the S&amp;P 500’s 1.8% rise) and 7.5% (versus the S&amp;P 500’s +1.7% increase), respectively, since their Zacks Recommendation was upgraded to Outperform on February 24 and February 13, respectively.While the Zacks Rank is our short-term rating system that is most effective over the one- to three-month holding horizon, the Zacks Recommendation aims to predict performance over the next 6 to 12 months. However, just like the Zacks Rank, the foundation for the Zacks Recommendation is trends in earnings estimate revisions.The Zacks Recommendation classifies stocks into three groups — Outperform, Neutral and Underperform.

PLD is well-positioned to bank on the favorable industrial real estate market environment, backed by its solid operating platform and robust scale. The company, which has emerged as a market leader in this asset category, is witnessing solid demand for its industrial real estate, as reflected by the leasing, rent and occupancy levels of the properties.Undoubtedly, with the e-commerce boom, growth in industries and companies making efforts to improve supply-chain efficiencies, the demand for logistics infrastructure and efficient distribution networks has risen. This is aiding the industrial real estate market to prosper and benefit Prologis, STAG Industrial, Inc. STAG and First Industrial Realty Trust, Inc. FR.Resilience is essential to the future of the supply chains. Therefore, over the long term, apart from the fast adoption of e-commerce, logistics real estate is expected to benefit from an increase in inventory levels, offering possibilities to industrial landlords, including Prologis, STAG Industrial and First Industrial Realty, to enjoy a favorable market environment.Prologis, in particular, has been witnessing a decent operating performance. The average occupancy level in Prologis’ owned and managed portfolio was 98% in the first quarter of 2023. Further, 49.7 million square feet (msf) of leases commenced in the company’s owned and managed portfolio, with 41.6 msf in the operating portfolio and 8.1 msf in the development portfolio. The retention level was 77.2% in the quarter.Prologis’ share of net effective rent change was 68.8% in the January-March quarter, which marked an all-time high and was led by the United States at 78.8%. The cash rent change was 41.9%, representing an all-time high.Cash same-store net operating income (NOI) grew 11.4% in the first quarter and denoted an all-time high. For 2023, management expects cash same-store NOI (Prologis share) of 9-9.75%.With healthy operating fundamentals in the industrial real estate markets, Prologis has capitalized on growth opportunities through acquisitions and developments. Prologis’ investments over the years comprise a wide array, including the largest M&amp;A transactions in the real estate sector and individual off-market deals below $5 million. For 2023, the company anticipates acquisitions at Prologis share between $300 million and $600 million, whereas development starts are expected to be $2.5-$3 billion.Prologis is focused on bolstering its liquidity. The company boasts a liquidity position of $6.7 billion, inclusive of $1.0 billion of additional line of credit capacity closed in April. Given its balance sheet strength and prudent financial management, PLD is well-poised to capitalize on growth opportunities.Moreover, solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticements for REIT shareholders and Prologis is committed to that. In the last five years, Prologis has increased its dividend five times and its five-year annualized dividend growth rate is 12.87%. Check Prologis’ dividend history here.However, with the asset category being attractive in these challenging times, there is a development boom in a number of markets. The high supply is likely to fuel competition and curb pricing power. New supply is likely to create pressure on vacancy levels and rent growth to some extent in the upcoming quarters.The stabilization of e-commerce sales growth raises concerns for Prologis. Moreover, a hike in the interest rate is concerning for PLD. Rising rates imply higher borrowing costs for the company, affecting its ability to purchase or develop real estate. Further, the dividend payout may become less attractive than the yields on fixed-income and money market accounts.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have rallied 17.0% in the past six months compared with the industry’s growth of 1.3%.

Just 7% plan to spend less, despite a challenging economic outlook for many markets. Indeed, just 2 in 5 travelers surveyed (41%) said macroeconomic factors will change how they travel over the next three months, with two-thirds of these (65%) citing higher living costs, due to inflation, as the reason. Around two-fifths (41%) will travel for shorter periods, while a third (31%) will take fewer trips.City-breaks remain popularWhile beach destinations feature prominently in the list of top leisure trip destinations, it's the world's major cities that will continue to dominate travel demand between June and August. According to Tripadvisor's site behavioral data, Paris, London and Rome are the top three international destinations for travel over the next three months. Even in Australia, where travelers typically look to South-East Asia for winter sun, the data shows London will be the most in demand destination, with Paris third on the list and Rome seventh.Younger travelers eager to explore this seasonMillennials, in particular, seem eager to get back out there, with the Index revealing that this group are more likely to travel this upcoming season, compared to other age groups. However, younger respondents (Gen Z and millennials) are also more likely to alter upcoming travel plans due to macroeconomic factors compared to older groups (49% vs 31%, on average).Vacation planners looking for new experiencesOver half of respondents (56%) have booked or plan to book on-trip activities ahead of their upcoming trip, highlighting a trend for more experiential trip elements. About three-quarters of these will book their activities prior to their trip beginning, with a fifth (20%) booking four or more weeks before their trip. Gen Z and Millennial travelers are more likely to make advance bookings for experiences and activities than older age groups (68% vs. 41%, on average).Story continuesAlice Jong, Research and Insights Senior Analyst, Media at Tripadvisor commented: ""With so many eager to get away this summer, early planning and booking are vital to secure preferred accommodations, flights, and experiences. With many consumers conscious of cost in the current climate, a little flexibility during the planning process can help to drive down the price of their trips. For example, when we look at the top international destinations over the next three months, Paris hotel prices are lowest during the week June 19-25, while August 28 - September 03 is the most affordable week to visit London.""Traveler Sentiment Survey DataOf those surveyed, two-thirds (78%) of respondents plan to travel for leisure this upcoming seasonUS: 82%UK: 81%AUS: 66%JP: 65%SG: 84%Collectively, over half of respondents (53%) are planning to travel more this upcoming season than they did last year.US: travel more (55%), about the same (39%), less (6%)UK: travel more (42%), about the same (48%), less (10%)AUS: travel more (43%), about the same (49%), less (8%)JP: travel more (50%), about the same (48%), less (2%)SG: travel more (66%), about the same (31%), less (3%)Of those, over three-quarters (77%) plan to take between 1-2 trips, while more than one-in-five (22%) plan to take three or more trips.US: 1-2 trips (62%), 3-5 trips (31%), 6+ trips (7%)UK: 1-2 trips (79%), 3-5 trips (18%), 6+ trips (3%)AUS: 1-2 trips (87%), 3-5 trips (10%), 6+ trips (2%)JP: 1-2 trips (84%), 3-5 trips (13%), 6+ trips (3%)SG: 1-2 trips (80%), 3-5 trips (15%), 6+ trips (5%)Almost half (46%) plan to travel domestically, while around a quarter will travel either internationally (27%), or both domestically and internationally (28%)US: Domestic (70%), International (6%), both (25%)UK: Domestic (31%), International (32%), both (37%)AUS: Domestic (57%), International (16%), both (27%)JP: Domestic (80%), International (5%), both (15%)SG: Domestic (4%), International (68%), both (28%)Over half of travelers globally (55%) plan to spend more on travel this upcoming season compared to the same period last year.US: 60%UK: 46%AUS: 50%JP: 57%SG: 68%Only two in five respondents (41%) said macroeconomic factors will change how they travel over the next three months.US: 41% (41% will take shorter trips, 37% will take fewer trips)UK: 32% (48% will take shorter trips, 40% will take fewer trips)AUS: 29% (38% will take shorter trips, 32% will take fewer trips)JP: 47% (36% will take shorter trips, 18% will take fewer trips)SG: 50% (43% will take shorter trips, 39% will take fewer trips)Cost/affordability (65%) is nearly twice as important to respondents as other factors such as trip length (38%) and trip type (35%) when planning a vacation.US: Cost/affordability (62%), trip length (41%), trip type (36%)UK: Cost/affordability (71%), trip length (45%), trip type (45%)AUS: Cost/affordability (72%), trip length (45%), trip type (32%)JP: Cost/affordability (71%), trip length (27%), trip type (35%)SG: Cost/affordability (63%), trip length (38%), trip type (21%)Top DestinationsDates of search: January 10  - April 10, 2023Dates of travel: May 29 - August 31, 2023Global OverallDomestic               International1.

As the company tightens its belt after a period of explosive growth, it has made numerous moves to reduce delivery-related costs across the company.Amazon late last year hiked the price of its annual Prime subscription that includes free shipping benefits by $20 to $139. It also has raised minimum order thresholds for free grocery delivery, encouraged customers to have all of their packages delivered on a designated day of the week, and expanded speedier same-day parcel delivery with a fee for orders under $25.

For investors looking to follow in his footsteps, identifying undervalued Buffett stocks to buy in 2023 is an excellent place to start.But with so many available stocks, which are the best Buffett stocks to consider? This article will examine the three most undervalued Buffett stocks to buy in May 2023, offering investors a solid starting point for their investment portfolios.By focusing on undervalued Buffett value stocks, investors can take advantage of the Oracle of Omaha’s time-tested approach to investing, while potentially realizing significant gains over the long term.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsBuffett’s impressive investment record has earned him legendary status. As a result, concentrating on his stock picks can bring peace of mind.So, let’s look at the top three undervalued Buffett stocks to consider in 2023.GMGeneral Motors$31.71UPSUnited Parcel Service$173.55CVXChevron$156.62General Motors (GM)General Motors (GM) headquarters building with blue GM logoSource: Linda Parton / Shutterstock.comGeneral Motors (NYSE:GM) is a stock on the radar of value investors. GM has been one of the best Buffett stocks to buy in recent years because of its solid fundamentals and undervaluation.GM is the second largest U.S. electric vehicle maker and plans multiple EV launches in 2023 including the Silverado EV will launch to fleets in Q2, the Blazer EV is coming this summer and the Equinox EV later this year.GM’s commercial unit, BrightDrop, aims for $1 billion in revenue. This year, it will increase the delivery of electric vans.GM aims to achieve $225 billion of total revenue by 2025, including at least $50 billion from electric vehicles. Economies of scale and falling battery costs will drive profitability in the electric vehicle business by then.GM aims to attain a revenue of approximately $300 billion by 2030 while simultaneously expanding its operating margins to the low teens as part of its long-term objectives.Story continuesAdditionally, the company’s self-driving unit, Cruise, is expected to generate revenue of $50 billion by 2030.Although GM’s results may fluctuate with the economy, it’s in a good place to lead the EV industry. Its balance sheet’s strong, with $21.4 billion cash and $16.4 billion debt, which provides stability.GM is an ideal Buffett stock since it’s a dominant player in a concentrated industry with growth potential and an attractive valuation, making it a long-term investment.Its focus on electric vehicles and autonomous driving tech makes it one of the best Buffett stocks in 2023. Therefore, it’s an undervalued Buffett value stock to watch and one of the best Buffett stocks to buy in 2023.United Parcel Service (UPS)Close up of UPS logo printed on a delivery truck; partial view of the driver sitting at the wheel, waiting at a red traffic light in south San Francisco baySource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comUnited Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) has been doing poorly recently.UPS stock had its biggest one-day drop in three years because of weak Q1 2023 results and revised guidance.The package delivery company’s new forecast predicts 2023 revenue of $97 billion, a 12.8% adjusted operating margin, and $5.4 billion in dividend payments. This would end UPS’ recent strong growth trend, including 2022’s 10-year revenue high of over $100 billion and a 13% operating margin.Despite a potential all-time high dividend payment of $5.4 billion, UPS faces revenue, and operating margin declines because of challenging macro conditions and consumer behavior changes.UPS is continuously implementing a series of measures to improve its margins. CEO Carol Tome’s “better, not bigger” framework guides the company’s approach, focusing on maximizing existing assets and enhancing network productivity.In addition, UPS is showing a greater willingness to be selective in its deliveries rather than pursuing volume for the sake of it. The company is shifting its focus to prioritize profitable deliveries, resulting in a more profitable business model.Under Tomé’s leadership, UPS has focused on growing margins over volume, partnering with high-margin customers like big businesses, healthcare providers, and international deliveries.This strategy differentiates UPS from competitors and has proven successful, as the company earns more from these categories than from residential deliveries.Overall, UPS has strong potential as a long-term core holding due to its excellent management team led by CEO Carol Tomé. The recent weakness is a great reason to purchase more of this undervalued Buffett stock.Chevron (CVX)CVX stockSource: tishomir / Shutterstock.comThe stock market’s volatility can scare investors, but resilience is key to building long-term wealth. Following successful investors like Warren Buffett can calm nerves, especially when investing in dividend powerhouses like Chevron (NYSE:CVX), with a yield of 3.68%.Warren Buffett’s portfolio includes a $28.6 billion stake in Chevron, an oil supermajor. The Oracle of Omaha purchased Chevron stock in Q4 2020, making up approximately 8.2% of his portfolio.Chevron’s status as a premier dividend opportunity among energy stocks makes it no surprise that Buffett is enthusiastic about its stocks. The Big Oil company has hiked its dividend distribution for 36 consecutive years.According to management’s dividend policy, it plans to continue for the next five years, provided that the benchmark oil price, Brent Crude per barrel, averages above $50.Want to continue reading about long-term stock picks?

Yet, the business environment continues to be challenging. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Over the past year, Abbott has been outperforming the industry it belongs to. The stock has lost 0.8% compared with the industry’s 28.1% fall.Abbott exited the first quarter of 2023 with better-than-expected earnings and revenues. Organic sales growth excluding COVID testing increased 10%, led by double-digit growth in Medical Devices, Established Pharmaceuticals and Nutrition. Within EPD, sales increased 11% in the quarter led by strong performance in Brazil, China, and Southeast Asia and across several therapeutic areas, including cardiometabolic, gastroenterology, CNS and pain management. EPD successfully continued its double-digit sales growth momentum in the last two years.Within Nutrition, sales increased more than 10%. In the United States, pediatric nutrition growth of more than 35% was driven by favorable year-ago comparable (lower sales in the first quarter of 2022 were due to a voluntary recall of certain infant formula products). Abbott continued to make good progress, increasing manufacturing production and recovering market share in this business. Internationally, total nutrition sales grew in mid-single digits overall. Sales in global adult nutrition also grew mid-single digits, driven by the strong performance of the company’s market-leading Ensure brand.Within Diagnostics, excluding COVID testing, organic sales growth was led by mid-to-high single-digit growth in Core Lab, Rapid and Point of Care Diagnostics. Despite dull sales in China, Core Lab Diagnostics sales showed year-over-year improvement, led by strong performance in the United States and Europe.Within Medical Devices, sales grew 12.5% globally on an organic basis, including mid-teens growth in the United States and double-digit growth internationally. In Diabetes Care, sales of FreeStyle Libre grew more than 25% on an organic basis in the quarter, including approximately 50% growth in the United States and mid-teens growth internationally.Abbott currently forecasts total organic sales growth, excluding the impact of COVID testing-related sales to be in the high-single digits for 2023.Story continuesAbbott Laboratories PriceAbbott Laboratories PriceAbbott Laboratories price | Abbott Laboratories QuoteAbbott’s first-quarter worldwide sales were down 18.1% year over year on a reported basis. Total sales were negatively impacted by COVID-19 testing-related sales decline. In Diagnostics, as forecast, sales growth was negatively impacted by a significant decrease in COVID testing sales compared with the first quarter of 2022. Worldwide COVID-19 testing sales were $730 million in the first quarter compared with $3.3 billion in the year-ago period. Further, in Core Lab Diagnostics, growth was partially offset by soft market conditions in China.Challenging macroeconomic environment, adverse currency translation and stubborn inflationary situation severely impacted the company’s profitability in the first quarter. The ongoing inflation situation across the globe is adversely impacting input costs for Abbott.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Zimmer Biomet ZBH, Hologic, Inc. HOLX and Insulet PODD.Zimmer Biomet, carrying a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present, has an earnings yield of 5.35% compared to the industry’s -2.55%.

The supply-chain challenges that adversely impacted shipments in 2022 started to dissipate in the last quarter of 2022 and the improvement continues in 2023.As the supply chain eases going forward, top-line growth will continue to improve. The European and international markets are also showing signs of a steady recovery in demand for medical products. Meanwhile, the rising cost of materials and labor shortages that resulted in inflationary pressure in 2022 are likely to continue. However, the impact is likely to be less severe than last year due to a favorable base effect. A gradual increase in pricing of products and services will also help to offset higher costs and expenses.Several industry players have the potential to ride on the recovery trend within the industry, creating wealth for investors. Industry participants like Stryker, Boston Scientific, Zimmer Biomet and Insulet are likely to gain from the rebound in demand and new cost-cutting initiatives.Industry DescriptionThe industry includes companies providing medical products and cutting-edge technologies for diagnosis, observation, consultation, treatment and other healthcare services. The industry players are primarily focused on research and development. The industry participants primarily cater to vital therapeutic areas like cardiovascular, nephrology and urology devices, to name a few.A strengthening dollar and labor shortages are hurting top-line growth. Ongoing disruption due to volume-based procurement policy in China is hurting sales. Recent inflationary pressure and labor shortages are weighing on gross and operating margins of the industry players. The trend is likely to continue in 2023. However, rising demand for medical procedures along with cost-cutting initiatives is likely to drive industry performance going forward.Story continuesMajor Trends Shaping the Future of the Medical Products IndustryAI, Medical Mechatronics &amp; Robotics: The rising utilization of minimally-invasive robot-assisted surgeries, self-automated home-based care, use of IT for quick and improved patient care and the shift of the payment system to a value-based model underscore the growing influence of AI in the Medical Products space. In fact, mechatronics — a high-end technology incorporating electronics, machine learning and mechanical engineering — is rapidly becoming a defining characteristic of the space.There are several companies that have shown substantial prowess when it comes to their involvement in AI, robotics and medical mechatronics. Advancements in robot-assisted surgical platforms continue to be crucial with respect to minimally-invasive surgery that helps in reducing trauma associated with open surgery.With respect to Mechatronics, the benefits of the same have been demonstrated in the form of 3D printing, which has altered the face of the medical devices industry. Currently, 3D printing is being utilized to print stem cells, blood vessels, heart tissues, prosthetic organs and skin.Rising Demand for IVD: Toward the end of February 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak started to spread rapidly and took the shape of a pandemic. This led to a rise in global demand for diagnostic testing kits in order to curb the spread of the virus. Testing became the need of the hour and that led to a shift in the pipeline of IVD products, with a large number of rapid, point-of-care devices going into development. Companies not only received emergency use authorization (EUA) from the FDA but also bolstered production to aid testing shortages. Industry players anticipate significant demand for rapid diagnostic testing in the future as well and are well-poised to capitalize on the same.Emerging Markets Hold Promise: Given the rising medical awareness and economic prosperity, emerging economies have been witnessing solid demand for medical products. An aging population, relaxed regulations, cheap skilled labor, increasing wealth and government focus on healthcare infrastructure make these markets extremely lucrative for global medical device players.Zacks Industry RankThe Zacks Medical Products industry falls within the broader Zacks Medical sector.It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #96, which places it in the top 38% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all member stocks, indicates encouraging near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Before we present a few medical products stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let's take a look at the industry's recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Industry PerformanceThe industry has underperformed its own sector and the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite in the past year.Stocks in this industry have collectively declined 28.1% compared with the Zacks Medical sector's decline of 6.2%. The S&amp;P 500 has lost 1.1% in the same time frame.Industry's Current ValuationOn the basis of the forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E), which is commonly used for valuing medical stocks, the industry is currently trading at 23.1X compared with the S&amp;P 500's 18.2X and the sector's 22.9X.Over the last five years, the industry has traded as high as 29.9X and as low as 19.2X, with the median being 23.7X.4 Promising Medical Products StocksInsulet: The company is a leading developer, manufacturer and marketer of the Omnipod Insulin Management System. The system is equipped with a self-adhesive, small and lightweight disposable tubeless Omnipod device along with the wireless and handheld Personal Diabetes Manager for pain-free automated cannula insertion and blood glucose meter integration. Insulet earns a huge share of revenues from the Omnipod System in the United States, Canada, Europe and Israel.The company's performance benefited from record quarterly U.S. and Total Omnipod new customer starts during the first quarter. This was driven mainly by a strong start to the company's U.S. full market release of the Omnipod 5 automated insulin delivery system.However, the substantial fall in Drug Delivery sales is discouraging. Contraction in margins does not bode well. On a year-over-year basis, the company expects gross margin to be impacted by higher costs associated with the U.S. manufacturing ramp, product line mix due to the ramp-up of Omnipod 5 and lower drug delivery revenues. Supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressure continue to challenge business operations.Following the first-quarter results, Insulet raised the total revenue growth guidance to the range of 18-22% on a reported basis (up from the prior projection of 14-19%). Total Omnipod sales are likely to improve by 21-25% in 2023.For this Acton, MA-based company, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 revenues suggests an improvement of 16.5%. The consensus estimate for earnings indicates an improvement of 1742.9%. It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 59.81%, on average. Presently, the company sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Stryker: Stryker is one of the world's largest medical device companies operating in the global orthopedic market. The company has three business segments: Orthopaedics, MedSurg, and Neurotechnology &amp; Spine.Stryker continues to deliver strong organic sales growth on the back of robust demand for its MedSurg and Neurotechnology businesses, led by Endoscopy, Instruments and Neurocranial. The Orthopedics and Spine businesses are also on an encouraging growth path, reflecting procedural recovery throughout the quarter.The company witnessed strong performance across its segments in the United States. Strong International sales also buoy optimism. It expects the momentum to continue into 2023 on the back of ongoing procedural recovery and a strong order book for capital equipment. Stryker continues to witness strong demand for its robotic-arm-assisted surgery platform — Mako — on the back of its unique features and healthy order book. However, supply-chain challenges and inflationary pressures continue to impede growth.Following its strong first-quarter 2023 results, the company expects total revenue growth at a constant exchange rate (""CER"") of 8-9% for 2023. Adjusted EPS is now expected to be within $10.05-$10.25, up from the prior guidance of $9.85-$10.15. Currently, the company carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.For this Kalamazoo, MI-based company, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 revenues is pegged at $19.9 billion. The consensus mark for earnings stands at $10.12 per share. It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 1.60%, on average.Boston Scientific: The company manufactures medical devices and products used in various interventional medical specialties worldwide. It is one of the leading players in the interventional cardiology market with its coronary stent product offerings. Boston Scientific first-quarter 2023 adjusted earnings and revenues exceeded market expectations by decent margins.The company registered a strong year-over-year improvement in organic sales, indicating a solid rebound in the legacy business even amid several macroeconomic issues. The increased 2023 guidance increases investors' confidence, indicating that the company is well-poised to handle the industry-wise trend of currency headwinds and global inflationary pressure. However, mounting operating expenses are putting pressure on the company's gross margin.Following the strong first-quarter results, Boston Scientific raised total revenue growth guidance to the range of 8.5-10.5% on a reported basis (up from the prior projection of 5-7%). Organic revenue growth is currently expected in the range of 8-10%. The company also raised the lower end of its guidance for adjusted earnings from $1.86-$1.93 to $1.90-$1.96.For this Natick, MA-based company, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 revenues suggest an improvement of 9.2%. The consensus estimate for earnings indicates an improvement of 13.5%. It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 1.88%, on average. Presently, the company carries a Zacks Rank of 2.Zimmer Biomet: It is a leading musculoskeletal healthcare company that designs, manufactures and markets orthopedic reconstructive products; sports medicine, biologics, extremities and trauma products; spine, bone healing, craniomaxillofacial and thoracic products; dental implants; and related surgical products.Zimmer Biomet ended the first quarter of 2023 with better-than-expected earnings and revenues. Each of the company's geographic segments and product divisions recorded strong year-over-year sales growth at CER. Management noted continued procedure recovery, solid execution and increasing traction around innovations in the reported quarter.Even amid the challenging macroeconomic conditions, expansion in the company's adjusted gross and operating margins is encouraging.

335,b804ac7d-b0b5-3a73-811b-37d9e295a4df,ZBH,2023-05-09,Here's Why Investors Should Retain Syneos Health (SYNH) for Now,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-investors-retain-syneos-122412357.html,1683548652,STORY,"['SYNH', 'ZBH', 'PODD']","[Syneos Health, Inc. SYNH is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, backed by strategic partnership deals and contributions from the Syneos One portfolio. The company’s Clinical Solutions arm holds potential, despite registering a year-over-year decline in the segment’s revenues in the fourth quarter of 2022. However, a strict regulatory environment and a tough competitive landscape do not bode well for Syneos Health’s business.In the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has declined 42.8% compared with the 20.5% fall of the industry and a 3.3% rise of the S&amp;P 500 composite.The renowned biopharmaceutical solutions company has a market capitalization of $4.10 billion. SYNH projects earnings growth of 14.63% in 2024 as it remains confident about the long-term strength of its business, given the robust backlog and the unique market position.Syneos Health surpassed estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed the same in one, delivering an earnings surprise of 1.7%, on average.Let’s delve deeper.UpsidesValue-Added Partnerships: Syneos Health has been progressing well with its partnership deals.In February 2023, Syneos Health entered into a strategic partnership with Haystack Health – a Roivant Health portfolio company developing advanced Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing solutions. The combined capabilities of both companies are expected to enhance the identification and enrollment of patients for clinical trials.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe collaboration with Equicare allows Syneos Health to use proximity — an innovative cloud-based software platform that advances the transfer of clinical trial subject data from multiple electronic health records to the sponsor’s electronic data capture systems.Earlier in January 2023, Syneos Health entered into a strategic partnership with Fosun Pharma USA. As part of the partnership, Syneos Health will provide full-service commercial support through its Syneos One team for the launch of Serplulimab — a novel anti-PD-1 antibody for extensive-stage-small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) — in the United States.Story continuesIn the same month, Syneos Health entered into a new strategic partnership with the temperature-controlled supply-chain company, Cryoport. The partnership will support the global advancement of cell and gene therapies, providing the industry's first fully integrated biopharmaceutical and supply-chain solution.Earlier, in December 2022, Syneos Health extended its strategic partnership with Medable — the technology platform provider for patient-centered clinical trials.In October 2022, Syneos Health expanded its partnership with Datavant to leverage the full suite of capabilities in Datavant Switchboard and Datavant’s large data ecosystem to accelerate the clinical development and commercialization of new therapies for patients.The Potential of the Syneos One Portfolio: SYNH coordinates integrated solutions across the entire clinical development and commercialization continuum. This offering provides a cost-effective option for divesting, out-licensing or co-promoting assets for small to mid-sized customers. It also gives large biopharmaceutical customers an opportunity to decrease their fixed-cost infrastructure as well as an alternative approach to develop and promote their non-core assets.In the fourth quarter of 2022, Syneos Health’s Commercial Solutions business registered 2.5% revenue growth, driven by higher reimbursable expenses and growth in Deployment Solutions. Excluding reimbursable expenses and on a constant-currency basis, Commercial Solutions revenues increased 0.5%, driven by Deployment Solutions, primarily due to the contribution from the Syneos One portfolio.The company also initiated planning activities for other product launches in 2022, subject to the fulfillment of final regulatory approval. Meanwhile, additional launches are expected in 2023 and beyond.A Strong Clinical Solutions Arm: The full-service portion of SYNH’s Clinical Solutions segment represents nearly 60% of the company’s total revenues. More than 70% of the clinical businesses comprise essential therapeutic areas that are experiencing the reduced impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak.For example, oncology, rare disease, orphan diseases and other complex diseases are the areas where patients have limited treatment options. Although the impact of the pandemic might continue for the full year, it is diminishing, with the economy gradually getting back to normalcy.In the fourth quarter of 2022, the segment’s revenues rose 0.7% at CER, including reimbursable expenses. The rise was driven primarily by growth in the large pharma business and partially offset by lower net awards and backlog conversion delays.Clinical Solutions’ book-to-bill ratio was 0.4 times in the third quarter, excluding reimbursable expenses resulting in a 0.77 times TTM book-to-bill. The commercial demand environment remains healthy, with particular strength in the larger pharma customer segment as the company leverages Kinetic and new digital capabilities to drive new growth opportunities.In February 2023, Syneos Health launched a Decentralized Clinical Trial (“DCT”) Site Network to drive appropriate DCT adoption and enable the high-quality delivery of DCTs and digital health technology solutions. This complements the company’s existing Site Advocacy Group, continuing the momentum for decentralized solutions to bring clinical trials closer to patients.DownsidesA Strict Regulatory Environment: The biopharmaceutical industry is governed by stringent governmental regulations in domestic and global markets. Within the Clinical Solutions business, the FDA regulates the clinical trials of drug products in human enrollments and the form and content of regulatory applications. Globally, clinical trials are governed by the laws and regulations of the country where these are conducted.A Tough Competitive Landscape: Syneos Health operates in a highly competitive environment, dominated by firms varying from large Contract Research Organizations (CROs) and smaller specialty CROs, large global communications holding companies, smaller specialized communications agencies, contract sales organizations and a wide range of consulting companies.In the Clinical Solutions segment, Syneos Health primarily competes with full-service CROs and services offered by the in-house R&amp;D departments of biopharmaceutical companies, universities and teaching hospitals. Some major players the company has to compete against within the segment are Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings, PRA Health Sciences, Inc. and ICON plc. among others.Moreover, some prominent competitors in the Commercial Solutions segment are Ashfield, IQVIA, Havas SA and Omnicom Group Inc. among others.Estimate TrendSyneos Health has been witnessing a negative estimate revision trend for 2023. In the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings has moved 9.4% south to $3.28.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 revenues is pegged at $5.03 billion, suggesting a 6.7% decline from the year-ago reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Zimmer Biomet ZBH, Hologic, Inc.

But when you pick a company that is really flourishing, you can make more than 100%. For example, the Tractor Supply Company (NASDAQ:TSCO) share price has soared 238% in the last half decade. Most would be very happy with that.With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. See our latest analysis for Tractor Supply While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Over half a decade, Tractor Supply managed to grow its earnings per share at 24% a year. This EPS growth is reasonably close to the 28% average annual increase in the share price. Therefore one could conclude that sentiment towards the shares hasn't morphed very much. Rather, the share price has approximately tracked EPS growth.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Tractor Supply has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? You could check out this free report showing analyst revenue forecasts.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, Tractor Supply's TSR for the last 5 years was 263%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that Tractor Supply shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 24% over the last year. Of course, that includes the dividend. However, the TSR over five years, coming in at 29% per year, is even more impressive. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Tractor Supply better, we need to consider many other factors. To that end, you should learn about the   4 warning signs  we've spotted with Tractor Supply (including 1 which is significant) .But note: Tractor Supply may not be the best stock to buy.

But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY), which has not only revenues, but also profits. While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it. See our latest analysis for Occidental Petroleum Occidental Petroleum's Improving ProfitsIn business, profits are a key measure of success; and share prices tend to reflect earnings per share (EPS) performance. So a growing EPS generally brings attention to a company in the eyes of prospective investors. It's an outstanding feat for Occidental Petroleum to have grown EPS from US$2.12 to US$13.83 in just one year. While it's difficult to sustain growth at that level, it bodes well for the company's outlook for the future. This could point to the business hitting a point of inflection.One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. The good news is that Occidental Petroleum is growing revenues, and EBIT margins improved by 20.5 percentage points to 37%, over the last year. Both of which are great metrics to check off for potential growth.The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.earnings-and-revenue-historyThe trick, as an investor, is to find companies that are going to perform well in the future, not just in the past. While crystal balls don't exist, you can check our visualization of consensus analyst forecasts for Occidental Petroleum's future EPS 100% free.Story continuesAre Occidental Petroleum Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Owing to the size of Occidental Petroleum, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$120m. While that is a lot of skin in the game, we note this holding only totals to 0.2% of the business, which is a result of the company being so large. So despite their percentage holding being low, company management still have plenty of reasons to deliver the best outcomes for investors.Does Occidental Petroleum Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?Occidental Petroleum's earnings per share have been soaring, with growth rates sky high. That EPS growth certainly is attention grabbing, and the large insider ownership only serves to further stoke our interest. The hope is, of course, that the strong growth marks a fundamental improvement in the business economics. So based on this quick analysis, we do think it's worth considering Occidental Petroleum for a spot on your watchlist. We should say that we've discovered 2 warning signs for Occidental Petroleum (1 is potentially serious!) that you should be aware of before investing here.There's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares.

Over the weekend, the icon spoke positively about the iPhone’s rock-solid status among consumers, a big reason why he believes in the company.Apple’s quarterly results took the spotlight last week, with the tech titan delivering a positive 5.6% EPS surprise and reporting revenue nearly 2% above expectations. The company also announced a 4% increase to its quarterly cash dividend, payable on May 18th.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn addition, the company posted solid iPhone results; iPhone revenue throughout the reported quarter totaled $51.3 billion, 4% above the Zacks Consensus Estimate and improving 1.5% from the year-ago period.As we can see from the chart below, the better-than-expected iPhone results snapped a streak of back-to-back negative surprises.Suprise (%) - iPhone RevenueZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBank of America (BAC)Despite the recent turmoil within banking, Buffett still remains optimistic about BAC. The legendary investor is well-known for his purchase of BAC shares back in 2011.Similar to AAPL, Bank of America posted results that came in nicely above expectations in its latest release, exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by nearly 20% and delivering a positive 4.7% revenue surprise.The market didn’t have a great reaction to the results post-earnings, as we can see by the green arrow in the chart below.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStill, the company has consistently shown a shareholder-friendly nature, carrying a solid 10.8% five-year annualized dividend growth rate. Currently, BAC shares yield 3.2% annually, well above the Zacks Finance sector average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOccidental Petroleum (OXY)Buffett’s been in the headlines many times over the last year regarding his OXY purchases. At the annual shareholder meeting, the Oracle of Omaha said that there were no plans to fully acquire the company despite the rapid buying of shares.Keep an eye out for OXY’s upcoming quarterly release expected on May 9th after the market’s close; the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate of $1.30 reflects a pullback of roughly 40% from the year-ago period.Analysts haven’t been bullish for the quarter to be reported, with the quarterly EPS estimate being revised 15% lower since February of this year.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchA favorable operating environment has allowed OXY to generate substantial cash over the last year, helping it increase its dividend payout by nearly 40% during the period. The company generated $2.4 billion of free cash flow in its latest quarter, down year-over-year but well above pre-pandemic levels.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineWith the Oracle of Omaha making headlines over the weekend following the annual Berkshire Hathaway shareholder meeting, revisiting some of his favorite holdings is beneficial.And all three stocks above – Apple AAPL, Bank of America BAC, and Occidental Petroleum OXY – are all examples of companies that the legendary investor has placed sizable bets on.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The CEO saying, quote, ""We are not going to be making an offer for control of Occidental."" You can see, shares are almost 2%-- almost down 2%, I should say. Now 3% here on the news.For more, we're joined by Lee Munson, Portfolio Wealth Advisors President and CIO. Lee, good to talk to you today. This is a stock that was one of the best performing in the S&amp;P 500 last year, it is down already. Are you still bullish on Occidental, even after what we heard from Warren Buffett over the weekend?LEE MUNSON: Yeah, let's think about what we know about Warren Buffett, OK? He's got about a quarter of the shares, he's authorized to buy half of it, and he's got warrants at 59 bucks, right, where he can buy a ton of it. He's got some preferred stock that he's making 8% yield. I mean, in this market, when we're expecting-- I mean, earnings to be a little flat, maybe a mild recession, why is he in such a big hurry?But here's the thing, what we do know is where he'd like to buy the stock. And it's around that $59 where he has the warrants. So why is he going to go in and say, hey, I want to pay a big, what, 10, 20, 30% premium when he can sit around all year and accumulate the stock. So I don't necessarily look at this as a negative, I don't think it's a-- I think it just tells you that right around here is a good and fair value that he's comfortable with. And I think that that's all there is really is to read into it.And he loves the CEO. He loves how that company is run. And that's what we're supposed to gleam from his comments, not that there's going to be some easy money. As if we go and listen on Saturday for stock picks, right. That's not what the point of the Berkshire Annual Meeting is. It's to try to get some sense of wisdom from these two old guys.Story continues- Yeah, Lee, that's interesting because when you take a look at this share reaction today, you'd think that maybe it brought some fear out there among shareholders, just in terms of what exactly the future looks like for Occidental. But it sounds, like what you're saying, is that some of these people that have possibly been chasing Buffett here buying in on Occidental Petroleum, they shouldn't necessarily be discouraged by this. Rather, they should be encouraged by how well positioned he thinks the company currently is, right?LEE MUNSON: Yeah, and also that he likes the valuation, right? I mean, if you're a value investor, you don't want the stock to jump up all at first, you want to be able to accumulate it at a reasonable price. Remember, this is a guy who has about 20 to 25% of the company right now. And he has-- I mean, he might buy up to half of it. And I know he says, well, we wouldn't know what to do with it right now, right. We don't want to take over the whole firm.He didn't say he doesn't want to accumulate more. But he did make it very clear, it's hard for him to want to buy the whole company when he's going to be giving up a bunch of yield. So I think you just have to think about what his psychology is, right. He's not here to give you a hot stock pick. He's not here to make you rich on some sort of buyout rumor. What he's here to do is use accumulating companies that he thinks that you can compound in the future and make a lot of money.And when he says the words, we've got all these warrants around $59, and he says, oh, we we're comforted. We like that we have all these warrants. We like that we can buy it at roughly the price it's trading at today, right. So if he likes $59, that means we should like $59 and consider accumulating. If you're looking to buy an individual stock in the energy arena, I would agree and say that this is probably one of your better bets.- Yeah, Lee, you could argue that Warren Buffett, sort of a calming voice over the weekends in light of the choppiness that we saw last week, especially with the banks. Apple, specifically, he highlighted that we know he's added to those holdings recently, but he said, look, this is a better company than any we own. In fact, he said I made some mistakes a few years ago when I sold shares when I shouldn't have. I'm curious what stood out to you in some of those comments that we got from him on that space because you talk about him value investing. I mean, Apple has been steady value for him.LEE MUNSON: Well, it has. And I think it should suggest that-- when he says, I don't know what interest rates are going to be in 5 or 10 years, I don't know. I think there's another company-- I think it might have been Ford Motor Company or Tesla or something like that-- where he says, I don't know where it's going to be in 5 or 10 years but he said, I believe I know where Apple is going to be 5 to 10 years from now.And what he means when he says that, the way I interpret that, because I've been reading his annual shareholder letter forever, I've been watching this stuff since I was a little kid, he believes that Apple will still be able to compound at a reasonable rate of return. In fact, he thinks Apple is his best compounder right now, right.And so when he thinks that he has that future site, I think that what it means is that you can tell me that we don't know where Apple, the share price is going to be over the next three months, but he definitely is long on this stock. He thinks it's the one best place where he wants to keep his money, that's why it's such a large position. And he thinks it's going to continue to compound.Now the valuation is a different thing. We've seen Warren Buffett, quarter to quarter, year to year, chop certain positions just based on valuation, but he's not saying that right now. And because Apple is the largest component of the S&amp;P 500, I think that bodes well for the broader cap weight index, which everybody wants to hate on right now. I think the issue is that everybody hates that they don't own only five companies of the S&amp;P 500. But I don't think it's time to necessarily ditch out on the S&amp;P because of that.- Lee, what about some of his comments? I mean, Apple clearly has worked out for Buffett. What did you make of what he had to say about streaming? Because he was a little bit more-- much more critical of what we have seen in that space, yet he's sticking with his investment, has stuck with his investment in Paramount.LEE MUNSON: The problem with value investors, we all stick with some companies that we should sell, and we sort of kick ourselves in the head. Even 92-year-old Buffett will do that too. Here's what we need to know, Buffett is very clear, there's not going to be a bunch of new eyeballs coming to streaming, right. We're not going to have a billion new people coming to streaming.And he told this story about the gas station that he owned when he was 20. You know, like when we were teenagers and owned gas stations and things like that. And he said, his gas station out in Omaha, his profit was determined by his larger competitor, right. And he's saying streaming is the same way. You have big players and none of them want to quit.And you can tell Buffett's frustrated with it. He wants to shake out some of these weak players, and they're not being shaken out. And so I understand that pain, I own Disney, right, Disney Plus, Hulu. Streaming is a big reason why I own that Disney stock. He owns Paramount because of streaming.But as long as we have these major players that are-- basically what's happening is every competitor is keeping the ability to profit from everybody else. So I think you have to stick with the top two or three streamers and hope that we eventually become profitable. But you'll notice he's not selling Paramount. He's not. He just doesn't like the prospects because of that dividend cut.- Yeah, just hope that they become profitable, that's a big one there, Lee. Lee Munson, Portfolio Wealth Advisors President and CEO. It's good to talk to you today.LEE MUNSON: Thank you.]"

The supply-chain challenges that adversely impacted shipments in 2022 started to dissipate in the last quarter of 2022 and the improvement continues in 2023.As the supply chain eases going forward, top-line growth will continue to improve. The European and international markets are also showing signs of a steady recovery in demand for medical products. Meanwhile, the rising cost of materials and labor shortages that resulted in inflationary pressure in 2022 are likely to continue. However, the impact is likely to be less severe than last year due to a favorable base effect. A gradual increase in pricing of products and services will also help to offset higher costs and expenses.Several industry players have the potential to ride on the recovery trend within the industry, creating wealth for investors. Industry participants like Stryker, Boston Scientific, Zimmer Biomet and Insulet are likely to gain from the rebound in demand and new cost-cutting initiatives.Industry DescriptionThe industry includes companies providing medical products and cutting-edge technologies for diagnosis, observation, consultation, treatment and other healthcare services. The industry players are primarily focused on research and development. The industry participants primarily cater to vital therapeutic areas like cardiovascular, nephrology and urology devices, to name a few.A strengthening dollar and labor shortages are hurting top-line growth. Ongoing disruption due to volume-based procurement policy in China is hurting sales. Recent inflationary pressure and labor shortages are weighing on gross and operating margins of the industry players. The trend is likely to continue in 2023. However, rising demand for medical procedures along with cost-cutting initiatives is likely to drive industry performance going forward.Story continuesMajor Trends Shaping the Future of the Medical Products IndustryAI, Medical Mechatronics &amp; Robotics: The rising utilization of minimally-invasive robot-assisted surgeries, self-automated home-based care, use of IT for quick and improved patient care and the shift of the payment system to a value-based model underscore the growing influence of AI in the Medical Products space. In fact, mechatronics — a high-end technology incorporating electronics, machine learning and mechanical engineering — is rapidly becoming a defining characteristic of the space.There are several companies that have shown substantial prowess when it comes to their involvement in AI, robotics and medical mechatronics. Advancements in robot-assisted surgical platforms continue to be crucial with respect to minimally-invasive surgery that helps in reducing trauma associated with open surgery.With respect to Mechatronics, the benefits of the same have been demonstrated in the form of 3D printing, which has altered the face of the medical devices industry. Currently, 3D printing is being utilized to print stem cells, blood vessels, heart tissues, prosthetic organs and skin.Rising Demand for IVD: Toward the end of February 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak started to spread rapidly and took the shape of a pandemic. This led to a rise in global demand for diagnostic testing kits in order to curb the spread of the virus. Testing became the need of the hour and that led to a shift in the pipeline of IVD products, with a large number of rapid, point-of-care devices going into development. Companies not only received emergency use authorization (EUA) from the FDA but also bolstered production to aid testing shortages. Industry players anticipate significant demand for rapid diagnostic testing in the future as well and are well-poised to capitalize on the same.Emerging Markets Hold Promise: Given the rising medical awareness and economic prosperity, emerging economies have been witnessing solid demand for medical products. An aging population, relaxed regulations, cheap skilled labor, increasing wealth and government focus on healthcare infrastructure make these markets extremely lucrative for global medical device players.Zacks Industry RankThe Zacks Medical Products industry falls within the broader Zacks Medical sector.It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #96, which places it in the top 38% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all member stocks, indicates encouraging near-term prospects.

Contraction in margins does not bode well. On a year-over-year basis, the company expects gross margin to be impacted by higher costs associated with the U.S. manufacturing ramp, product line mix due to the ramp-up of Omnipod 5 and lower drug delivery revenues.

The new feature is being implemented into the aircraft’s development and flight test program and will be available as a standard feature at time of entry into service.This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230508005455/en/The Beechcraft Denali single-engine turboprop (Photo: Business Wire)The Beechcraft Denali aircraft is designed and will be manufactured by Textron Aviation Inc., a Textron Inc. (NYSE:TXT) company.The Garmin Emergency Autoland system is the world’s first certified system of its kind. It provides a means for the aircraft to land automatically in the unlikely event of pilot incapacitation. A passenger can activate the Emergency Autoland system by pressing a dedicated button in the cockpit. Once activated, the system immediately takes control of the aircraft and informs ATC of the emergency. It then calculates a flight path to the most suitable airport or runway, while avoiding terrain and adverse weather, initiates a stabilized approach and automatically lands the aircraft, bringing it to a stop before shutting down the engine.""The Autoland system is an excellent addition to the Beechcraft Denali and the G3000 avionics suite, and we’ve included it in the program as a direct response to continued conversations with our customers,"" said Lannie O’Bannion, senior vice president, Sales &amp; Flight Operations. ""The feature makes the Denali even more desirable to a wider audience as it adds yet another element of assurance and peace of mind for pilots and passengers.""Textron Aviation is aligning the Beechcraft Denali aircraft certification timing, which is expected in 2025, to the certification timeline for the new Catalyst engine. The Denali is the first aircraft powered by the new, more efficient engine.Story continues""We continue to experience great progress with the Denali development program, and we believe the aircraft will be a game changer in the single-engine, high-performance turboprop segment,"" said Chris Hearne, senior vice president, Engineering.

Like the company’s other aircraft, the Denali can also use sustainable aviation fuel.The airplane is also equipped with McCauley’s new 105-inch diameter composite, 5-blade, constant speed propeller, which is full feathering with reversible pitch and ice protection.The cockpit features the Garmin G3000 intuitive avionics suite with high-resolution screens and touchscreen controllers.

Vance, and the safety measure to be considered Wednesday includes key provisions from that bill. Vance on Monday said the latest version of the legislation had won the backing of Republican former President Donald Trump and Republican Senators Mike Braun, Roger Marshall and Mitt Romney.The Cantwell-Vance-Brown Railway Safety Act to be considered on Wednesday builds on the legislation proposed in March, Cantwell said. It would also increase maximum civil penalties from $100,000 to $10 million for rail safety violations and requires two crewmembers to operate a train to prevent a situation where only a single employee is on the train in an emergency.The Association of American Railroads said ""negotiations on the Rail Safety Act have yielded improvement, but challenging provisions remain that must be resolved.""The U.S. Justice Department sued Norfolk Southern Corp on March 31 seeking to ensure that the railroad pays the full cost of cleanup and any long-term effects of the derailment in East Palestine, Ohio.The Norfolk train derailment of 38 cars, including 11 carrying hazardous materials, caused cars carrying toxic vinyl chloride and other hazardous chemicals to spill and catch fire.Norfolk last month took a $387 million charge in the first quarter due to the derailment, mostly related to environmental costs. No deaths or injuries were reported after the incident but since the derailment, some of East Palestine's 4,700 residents have reported ailments such as rashes and breathing difficulties.

But on the bright side, you can make far more than 100% on a really good stock. For instance, the price of Waste Management, Inc. (NYSE:WM) stock is up an impressive 104% over the last five years. On top of that, the share price is up 11% in about a quarter. The company reported its financial results recently; you can catch up on the latest numbers by reading our company report.With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. View our latest analysis for Waste Management While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During five years of share price growth, Waste Management achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 3.4% per year. This EPS growth is lower than the 15% average annual increase in the share price. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Waste Management has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? Check if analysts think Waste Management will grow revenue in the future.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Waste Management the TSR over the last 5 years was 123%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that Waste Management has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 7.5% in the last twelve months. And that does include the dividend. Having said that, the five-year TSR of 17% a year, is even better. The pessimistic view would be that be that the stock has its best days behind it, but on the other hand the price might simply be moderating while the business itself continues to execute. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Waste Management better, we need to consider many other factors.

The affected parties were low-income Americans who were eligible for the IRS Free File program but ended up paying TurboTax for federal returns filed in the 2016, 2017 and 2018 tax years. New York Attorney General Letitia James accused TurboTax of “predatory and deceptive marketing.”You might be eligible to receive a payment if you were told you didn’t qualify for the free software, paid Intuit to complete your return and didn’t use the company’s own Free File product in a previous year, according to the settlement website. Millions of people should receive checks.Most eligible consumers should receive around $30, CNBC reported, though payments might go as high as $85 if you used TurboTax during all three tax years. Rust Consulting, the settlement fund administrator, will contact you by email if you are eligible for a payment. Checks will be issued throughout May 2023.James’ investigation focused on how TurboTax “steered customers” into paying for tax prep even though they qualified for the free government program, according to ProPublica, whose 2019 reporting led to the investigation.“TurboTax’s predatory and deceptive marketing cheated millions of low-income Americans who were trying to fulfill their legal duties to file their taxes,” James said. “Today we are righting that wrong and putting money back into the pockets of hardworking taxpayers who should have never paid to file their taxes.”Intuit did not admit wrongdoing in the settlement.Story continuesThe settlement underscores the importance of digging deeper into ad claims to find out if they are legitimate, legal experts say. The fact that it happened in the first place shows how easy it is for companies to mislead customers.In a February 2023 blog, the Todd Friedman law offices noted that “if false advertising were obvious, it wouldn’t be so successful.”One common deception is claiming that a product is “clinically proven” to do something. For example, last decade L’Oreal faced fraudulent advertising charges for claiming that its Lancôme Génifique and L’Oréal Paris Youth Code skincare products were “clinically proven” to help customers’ skin look younger even though the company had no scientific evidence to back the claim up, according to the Friedman blog.Another example was Volkswagen claiming that some of its diesel vehicles had lower levels of pollutants. As the blog noted, the Federal Trade Commission later found that the car company used “illegal emission defeat devices” that aimed to mask high emissions during government tests.“When you’re considering a product, it’s best not to take the advertising and packaging at its word,” the Friedman blog said.Take Our Poll: What Are You Worth to Your Company?Learn: This Secret IRS Loophole Lets You Reduce Your Retirement TaxesHere are some things to look for to spot false or misleading ads, according to a separate blog from TorHoerman Law:The price seems too good to be true for certain product types.Photos and descriptions don’t match up with the product you’ve received.Online reviews of a product that are overwhelmingly positive but don’t provide “realistic context.” Even the best products get poor reviews from time to time.A business doesn’t respond to inquiries or questions about its product.The business is not officially registered or recognized with government agencies such as the Better Business Bureau.If you suspect you’ve been the victim of a product sold under false or deceptive advertising, TorHoerman Law recommends contacting a product liability attorney to get information on legal recourses available.More From GOBankingRates5 Expensive Renovations Homeowners Always RegretFinancial Insight in Your Inbox: Sign Up for GBR's Daily Newsletter3 Ways to Recession Proof Your Retirement7 Things You Must Do To Create a Plan for Your MoneyThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: What You Should Learn From TurboTax’s False Advertising and $141 Million Settlement]"

The supply-chain challenges that adversely impacted shipments in 2022 started to dissipate in the last quarter of 2022 and the improvement continues in 2023.As the supply chain eases going forward, top-line growth will continue to improve. The European and international markets are also showing signs of a steady recovery in demand for medical products. Meanwhile, the rising cost of materials and labor shortages that resulted in inflationary pressure in 2022 are likely to continue. However, the impact is likely to be less severe than last year due to a favorable base effect. A gradual increase in pricing of products and services will also help to offset higher costs and expenses.Several industry players have the potential to ride on the recovery trend within the industry, creating wealth for investors. Industry participants like Stryker, Boston Scientific, Zimmer Biomet and Insulet are likely to gain from the rebound in demand and new cost-cutting initiatives.Industry DescriptionThe industry includes companies providing medical products and cutting-edge technologies for diagnosis, observation, consultation, treatment and other healthcare services. The industry players are primarily focused on research and development. The industry participants primarily cater to vital therapeutic areas like cardiovascular, nephrology and urology devices, to name a few.A strengthening dollar and labor shortages are hurting top-line growth. Ongoing disruption due to volume-based procurement policy in China is hurting sales. Recent inflationary pressure and labor shortages are weighing on gross and operating margins of the industry players. The trend is likely to continue in 2023. However, rising demand for medical procedures along with cost-cutting initiatives is likely to drive industry performance going forward.Story continuesMajor Trends Shaping the Future of the Medical Products IndustryAI, Medical Mechatronics &amp; Robotics: The rising utilization of minimally-invasive robot-assisted surgeries, self-automated home-based care, use of IT for quick and improved patient care and the shift of the payment system to a value-based model underscore the growing influence of AI in the Medical Products space. In fact, mechatronics — a high-end technology incorporating electronics, machine learning and mechanical engineering — is rapidly becoming a defining characteristic of the space.There are several companies that have shown substantial prowess when it comes to their involvement in AI, robotics and medical mechatronics. Advancements in robot-assisted surgical platforms continue to be crucial with respect to minimally-invasive surgery that helps in reducing trauma associated with open surgery.With respect to Mechatronics, the benefits of the same have been demonstrated in the form of 3D printing, which has altered the face of the medical devices industry. Currently, 3D printing is being utilized to print stem cells, blood vessels, heart tissues, prosthetic organs and skin.Rising Demand for IVD: Toward the end of February 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak started to spread rapidly and took the shape of a pandemic. This led to a rise in global demand for diagnostic testing kits in order to curb the spread of the virus. Testing became the need of the hour and that led to a shift in the pipeline of IVD products, with a large number of rapid, point-of-care devices going into development. Companies not only received emergency use authorization (EUA) from the FDA but also bolstered production to aid testing shortages. Industry players anticipate significant demand for rapid diagnostic testing in the future as well and are well-poised to capitalize on the same.Emerging Markets Hold Promise: Given the rising medical awareness and economic prosperity, emerging economies have been witnessing solid demand for medical products. An aging population, relaxed regulations, cheap skilled labor, increasing wealth and government focus on healthcare infrastructure make these markets extremely lucrative for global medical device players.Zacks Industry RankThe Zacks Medical Products industry falls within the broader Zacks Medical sector.It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #96, which places it in the top 38% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all member stocks, indicates encouraging near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Before we present a few medical products stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let's take a look at the industry's recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Industry PerformanceThe industry has underperformed its own sector and the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite in the past year.Stocks in this industry have collectively declined 28.1% compared with the Zacks Medical sector's decline of 6.2%. The S&amp;P 500 has lost 1.1% in the same time frame.Industry's Current ValuationOn the basis of the forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E), which is commonly used for valuing medical stocks, the industry is currently trading at 23.1X compared with the S&amp;P 500's 18.2X and the sector's 22.9X.Over the last five years, the industry has traded as high as 29.9X and as low as 19.2X, with the median being 23.7X.4 Promising Medical Products StocksInsulet: The company is a leading developer, manufacturer and marketer of the Omnipod Insulin Management System. The system is equipped with a self-adhesive, small and lightweight disposable tubeless Omnipod device along with the wireless and handheld Personal Diabetes Manager for pain-free automated cannula insertion and blood glucose meter integration. Insulet earns a huge share of revenues from the Omnipod System in the United States, Canada, Europe and Israel.The company's performance benefited from record quarterly U.S. and Total Omnipod new customer starts during the first quarter. This was driven mainly by a strong start to the company's U.S. full market release of the Omnipod 5 automated insulin delivery system.However, the substantial fall in Drug Delivery sales is discouraging. Contraction in margins does not bode well. On a year-over-year basis, the company expects gross margin to be impacted by higher costs associated with the U.S. manufacturing ramp, product line mix due to the ramp-up of Omnipod 5 and lower drug delivery revenues. Supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressure continue to challenge business operations.Following the first-quarter results, Insulet raised the total revenue growth guidance to the range of 18-22% on a reported basis (up from the prior projection of 14-19%). Total Omnipod sales are likely to improve by 21-25% in 2023.For this Acton, MA-based company, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 revenues suggests an improvement of 16.5%. The consensus estimate for earnings indicates an improvement of 1742.9%. It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 59.81%, on average. Presently, the company sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Stryker: Stryker is one of the world's largest medical device companies operating in the global orthopedic market. The company has three business segments: Orthopaedics, MedSurg, and Neurotechnology &amp; Spine.Stryker continues to deliver strong organic sales growth on the back of robust demand for its MedSurg and Neurotechnology businesses, led by Endoscopy, Instruments and Neurocranial. The Orthopedics and Spine businesses are also on an encouraging growth path, reflecting procedural recovery throughout the quarter.The company witnessed strong performance across its segments in the United States. Strong International sales also buoy optimism. It expects the momentum to continue into 2023 on the back of ongoing procedural recovery and a strong order book for capital equipment. Stryker continues to witness strong demand for its robotic-arm-assisted surgery platform — Mako — on the back of its unique features and healthy order book. However, supply-chain challenges and inflationary pressures continue to impede growth.Following its strong first-quarter 2023 results, the company expects total revenue growth at a constant exchange rate (""CER"") of 8-9% for 2023. Adjusted EPS is now expected to be within $10.05-$10.25, up from the prior guidance of $9.85-$10.15. Currently, the company carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.For this Kalamazoo, MI-based company, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 revenues is pegged at $19.9 billion. The consensus mark for earnings stands at $10.12 per share. It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 1.60%, on average.Boston Scientific: The company manufactures medical devices and products used in various interventional medical specialties worldwide. It is one of the leading players in the interventional cardiology market with its coronary stent product offerings. Boston Scientific first-quarter 2023 adjusted earnings and revenues exceeded market expectations by decent margins.The company registered a strong year-over-year improvement in organic sales, indicating a solid rebound in the legacy business even amid several macroeconomic issues. The increased 2023 guidance increases investors' confidence, indicating that the company is well-poised to handle the industry-wise trend of currency headwinds and global inflationary pressure. However, mounting operating expenses are putting pressure on the company's gross margin.Following the strong first-quarter results, Boston Scientific raised total revenue growth guidance to the range of 8.5-10.5% on a reported basis (up from the prior projection of 5-7%). Organic revenue growth is currently expected in the range of 8-10%. The company also raised the lower end of its guidance for adjusted earnings from $1.86-$1.93 to $1.90-$1.96.For this Natick, MA-based company, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 revenues suggest an improvement of 9.2%. The consensus estimate for earnings indicates an improvement of 13.5%. It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 1.88%, on average. Presently, the company carries a Zacks Rank of 2.Zimmer Biomet: It is a leading musculoskeletal healthcare company that designs, manufactures and markets orthopedic reconstructive products; sports medicine, biologics, extremities and trauma products; spine, bone healing, craniomaxillofacial and thoracic products; dental implants; and related surgical products.Zimmer Biomet ended the first quarter of 2023 with better-than-expected earnings and revenues. Each of the company's geographic segments and product divisions recorded strong year-over-year sales growth at CER.

RodriguezThank you, Nic, and thank you all for joining the call today. 2023 is off to a strong start for DaVita. We entered the year with a cautious balance of optimism about our ability to execute against our plan and uncertainty by treatment volume in a challenging labor market. In the first quarter, we performed well in our key metrics and our results benefited from an improving macro environment. While some external uncertainties remain, the continuation of current trends would put us on a path to deliver strong results for the full year.Before I get into the details about the quarter, I would like to elaborate on an area of our long-term strategy which is to connect transitions of care through solutions for our patients across each step in the Kidney Care continuum that lead me to our clinical highlight around CKD education.Periodically, we have provided updates on our community education program called Kidney Smart. Raising awareness through education in the Kidney Care community is critical particularly given the fact that 1 in 7 American adults have chronic kidney disease and the majority of these people are not aware. Our Kidney Smart program is designed to help those patients understand and manage their kidney health and is frequently recommended by nephrologist as a go-to resource for patient education. To help remove the barriers to health equity, we've offered these classes in 10 different languages.In 2022, over 33,000 CKD patients attended a Kidney Smart class, the best ever for the 12-year history of the program. Moreover, in 2022, DaVita patients who attended Kidney Smart classes were more than twice as likely to choose a home modality in consultation with their nephrologist and care team.Transitioning to our financial performance. In the first quarter, we delivered adjusted operating income of $352 million and adjusted earnings per share of $1.58. As we discussed in prior quarters, we implemented a number of initiatives in the second half of 2022 to respond to the pressures associated with lower volumes and higher costs. These plans, combined with the strong operating rigor translated into positive results in the quarter, and we're now seeing some of the operating metrics that impacted margin in 2022 begin to normalize.I'll start with the biggest driver of Q1 outperformance, labor. We made good progress on labor costs in the quarter, which reflected a combination of operating dividends and improvement in the overall labor environment. As we have said in the past, successful labor management requires effectively managing the interplay between wage growth, contract labor and training costs.Our operators continue to improve on the permanent staffing levels within our clinics which has enabled us to drive further reduction in contract labor costs during Q1. We're tracking ahead of plan and our efforts to cut our full year contract labor expense in half relative to last year. The increase in permanent teammates combined with elevated turnover resulted in training costs in the quarter above historical norms, although below the peak we saw last summer. This is in line with our expectations and we anticipate improvement in our training productivity in the back half of the year. This will largely depend on successful teammate retention, which has historically tracked closely with the health of the broader labor market.Moving on to treatment volume. Quarter-over-quarter treatments per day were up approximately 1% and better than the middle of our expected range. This was driven by net census gains due to both higher admit and lower mortality. Because of the annualization of access mortality from 2022, we still anticipate a reduction in overall treatment volume on a year-over-year basis and we continue to assume excess mortality over the balance of this year. That said, we're encouraged by our first quarter volume results. What we saw in Q1 proved to be a trend we would expect to finish the year in the top half of our volume forecast range of down 3% to flat relative to 2022.Transitioning to a couple of strategic topics. On April 1, DaVita and Medtronic announced the launch of Mozarc Medical, a new independent device company focused exclusively on innovative kidney health technologies. Mozarc's current products and its R&amp;D pipeline ranging from kidney access technologies to advance home dialysis and acute therapies are intended to improve the overall patient experience and increased access to home-based care. This investment reaffirms our commitment to realizing scale transformation in Kidney Care and allow us to fuel innovation in partnership with Medtronic, a global leader in health care technology.And finally, a note on Integrated Kidney Care, or IKC, we continue to make progress consistent with our business plan and demonstrate that our model of care is improving the health and well-being of our patients. I'll highlight 2 examples of this. First, across our IKC program, more than half of our patients achieved an optimal start, which means that patient initiates dialysis treatment at home or appropriate vascular access in place. Optimal starts reduced costly and difficult hospitalization and on average, leads to a reduction in the continuing cost of care in the month and year that follow.Second, recent data continued to show an encouraging differentiation in hospitalization rates from patients in our IKC program versus our overall patient population. As we continue to scale our IKC business, which is measured by the total dollars of medical spend in our program, we will continue to focus on driving our net saving rate while pursuing a cost-efficient model of care.In summary, looking across our most important operating metrics, we're seeing progress at a faster rate than assumed in our initial forecast. Therefore, we are revising our adjusted operating income range of $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion to a range of $1.475 billion to $1.625 billion and revising our adjusted earnings per share range of $5.45 to $6.95 to a range of $6.20 to $7.30.Aside from the COVID disruption in the labor market, other important factors for the remaining of the year include continued progress against our cost-saving initiatives, which Joel will elaborate on, and of course, our continued effort to restore patient benefit protection to our advocacy efforts.I will now turn it over to Joel to discuss our financial performance and outlook in more detail.Joel AckermanThanks, Javier. I'll start with some additional commentary on first quarter results, and then I'll add detail on our expectations for the remainder of the year.As Javier said, Q1 adjusted operating income was $352 million. Adjusted EPS was $1.58 and free cash flow was $265 million. Overall, the results were at the high end of the range of our expectations for the quarter, driven roughly equally by 3 things: first, strong operating performance in the U.S. dialysis business; second, timing of certain items in our IKC results; and third, some normal positive variability in a couple of cost items that we are not forecasting to recur in the rest of the year. With that, let me provide some additional detail.First, U.S. dialysis treatments per day were up almost 1% in Q1 compared to Q4. As Javier mentioned, this was due to higher patient census. Missed treatment rates remained elevated compared to pre-COVID levels and were consistent with our expectations. Revenue per treatment was down $0.16 quarter-over-quarter, driven by normal seasonal impact of high patient responsibility offset by annual increases in Medicare fee-for-service rates that begin in January, growth of MA and seasonal increases in acute treatment.On a non-GAAP basis, patient care cost per treatment decreased by $1.18 sequentially. The biggest drivers of the change were pharmaceutical cost savings from our anemia management transition to MIRCERA, reductions in our contract labor spend and positive variability in health benefits and insurance costs. These were offset by higher compensation costs and 2 fewer treatment days in the quarter.On a non-GAAP basis, G&amp;A expenses were down $24 million quarter-over-quarter largely due to normal variability in our G&amp;A spend. IKC's adjusted OI for the quarter was approximately the same as Q4 and better than expected. The quarterly IKC results benefited from revenue that was forecasted to hit later in the year and the deferral of certain expense items that we expect will be recognized in Q3 and Q4. Excluding these items, IKC results were in line with our expectations.International adjusted operating income was up $12 million relative to Q4, driven roughly equally by foreign exchange and acquisition-related expenses in Brazil during Q4. Looking at our capital structure, we ended the quarter with a leverage range of approximately 3.9x EBITDA. We did not buy back any shares during the quarter as our focus continues to be to get back to our target leverage ratio of 3 to 3.5x EBITDA. In the last week of April, we closed on a successful $2.75 billion refinancing of our revolving credit facility and Term Loan A despite a challenging capital markets environment.Looking forward, we still expect interest expense of $100 million to $110 million per quarter for the rest of the year. The April 1st launch of Mozarc Medical, our partnership with Medtronic will result in approximately $20 million of pretax losses below the OI line in Q2. This is less than previously shared due to timing shifts of certain standup costs. In the back half of the year, we still anticipate $15 million of negative impact on other income per quarter and as we shared previously, we expect Mozarc's OI to trend towards breakeven in approximately the next 3 years.Regarding the savings initiatives we've talked about in the past, we're on track to realize year-over-year savings within the range of $125 million to $175 million consistent with prior expectations. This is primarily driven by a reduction in pharmaceutical costs and our ongoing facility consolidation. During Q1, we initiated our conversion to MIRCERA, which will continue to roll out over the remainder of the year.Additionally, in Q1, we consolidated 20 centers and currently anticipate consolidating another 40 to 50 centers over the remainder of the year. We continue to achieve high patient and teammate retention rates related to these shifts as the majority of patients at consolidated centers have transitioned to nearby DaVita facilities.That concludes my prepared remarks for today. Operator, please open the call for Q&amp;A.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Justin Lake with Wolfe Research.Justin LakeAppreciate all the color. Joel, maybe you could talk a little bit about what you're seeing? You talked about higher turnover and lower temp labor costs. What's going on with turnover there? What are you expecting for the rest of the year? And how are labor costs tracking versus kind of the headwind that you had laid out for us?And then maybe given the upside in the quarter, what are you projecting for the rest of the year relative to Q1? And if you do hit these numbers, when do you think you get back to kind of your target leverage ratio and therefore, the potential to buy back shares?Javier J. RodriguezOkay. Well, there's a lot in there. So let me just pull up for a second and then Joel can answer some of your follow-up questions, Justin, this is Javier.First, on labor, we started to give a little more color when we had more volatility in some of the underlying metrics. But I think it's a good time right now to pull up, as you asked, which is a bigger number. But just so we're clear on all of the metrics. When you talk about SWBs, you take into account wages, productivity, benefits, training and contract labor. Within wages, there's -- obviously, you can double-click on that, you've got over time, shift differential and other things. But let's stay with those 5.In the third quarter of 2022, we had a spike in training in contract labor that we called out because they were outliers to our historical numbers. But then as we fast forward to today, we worry that people aren't fast enough with the math to calculate the interplay between the 5. So let me see if I get to your number, and if not, you can follow up a question.So from 2018 to 2022, we had a CAGR of roughly 2% in SWB. In 2022, which, of course, had that outlier that we were just talking about, that number went to roughly 8% growth. And in 2023, over 2022, we expect that number that incorporates all those variables to be more in the 4% to 5% growth.So does that answer the question on labor? Or do you want to ask a follow-up on that?Justin LakeYes, just mostly on labor, what I'm trying to figure out is versus that 4% to 5%. If you continue at this pace, where do you think you end up?Joel AckermanI'd say, Justin, we're thinking -- we're about $25 million ahead of where we thought we would be on the total labor cost. So if you think of our guide increase at the middle of the range of $50 million, I'd say half of that is labor and half of that is volume, and that's how I get to $25 million.Justin LakeAnd is that just for the first quarter, Joel? And I'm kind of trying to think about like if this continues, does that mean you're [$100 million] better?Joel AckermanWell, in the labor line itself, there were some items that we don't think will recur. They were good guys in lines like benefits and workers' comp that I'd strip out as you think about annualizing things. So the $25 million would be a full year number in terms of where we need to go from here, we're expecting continued wage pressure as the year presses on. There will be a little bit of improvement in contract labor, but we've seen most of the improvement in contract labor that we're likely to see because it just happened faster than we thought.And -- on the productivity side, we haven't seen much. We're off the peak that we saw in the middle of last year, but we're still well above pre-COVID levels. And what we're currently building in is some progress in the back half of the year, but ending the year still above pre-COVID levels, and that's really driven largely by the turnover that we're seeing.OperatorOur next caller is Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.Unidentified AnalystThis is actually [Nabiya Guterres] on for Kevin. I had just another quick question on labor. You said you expect continued wage pressure in the year. What are you assuming for wage inflation this year? And how does it compare to last year and pre-COVID levels?Javier J. RodriguezYes. I think it was really answered a little bit with Justin, so let me make sure we're asking the same thing. So we just basically said that if you take all of the variables into account, that we think that SWB will be 4% to 5% higher, '23 over '22. Does that answer your question?Unidentified AnalystYes.OperatorOur next caller is Andrew Mok with UBS.Unidentified AnalystThis is [Thomas] on for Andrew. [Start], could you walk us through the underlying drivers of the treatment growth beat in the quarter as well as provide an update on how mistreatment rates are tracking sequentially?Joel AckermanSure. Thanks for the question. So I'd like to use the treatment per day number, and you'll see that, that number is up about 90 bps quarter-over-quarter. That is largely driven by census increases, and that's the result of admissions increases in Q1, offset by continued excess mortality, which is way down relative to prior years, but remains higher than it was pre-COVID.In terms of mistreatment rates, it continues to trend well above the pre-COVID number. It can move around from one quarter to the next. There's a lot of seasonality and other impacts in it but we are still seeing it running roughly 100 basis points higher than what we saw pre-COVID.Unidentified AnalystGot it. That's helpful. And a quick follow-up. I wanted to ask about the ESA switch to MIRCERA. Specifically, are there any KPIs you can share to track the transition? And do you have any update on the cadence of the rollout?Javier J. RodriguezWe do not have any disclosures on it. All I can tell you is that the rollout is going as well as we expected and that from a clinical perspective, we are seeing the results that we wanted. So it's going as planned.Operator(Operator Instructions) Our next caller is Pito Chickering from Deutsche Bank.Philip ChickeringSo follow-up here on Justin's question, on the $50 million operating income raise, you said half is labor and half was better volumes. You added almost 60% new lives into IKC. I guess any changes on how that is tracking versus your previous guidance? And then on the guidance raise, can you walk us through what $50 million of operating income is transitioning into $100 million of free cash flow, is that just working capital or anything else in there?Javier J. RodriguezLet me take the first part of that, and Joel can take the second part of that. On IKC, as you can imagine, it is a growing business and while we're making really good progress, it is clearly in the investment phase of the business. And so there is no change in what we see the full year. We had a bit of timing in there. So the number looks a little better on a quarter-to-date than it will on an annualized basis. We're still on target to what we've said.Joel AckermanYes. Pito, on the free cash flow, as you pointed out, obviously, an increase in OI helps that. The other 2 things are: one, cash taxes are trending better than we expected. And the second is working capital. You see the DSOs were down considerably. So we think we'll get a bit of a tailwind to that as well for the year.Philip ChickeringOkay. And then just Cigna [IKC] for a second, realizing that when you add on 50%, almost 60% new lives, that's going to be sort of a drag as you guys think about those coming online. But any sort of color on sort of how the medical trends are tracking for your people that you had coming into the year? I mean we've seen spikes of utilization in other areas of healthcare. Just curious on how that class of 2022 was tracking during the first quarter?Javier J. RodriguezYes. It's -- as you said, we agree. It's a little hard to say because we have so much noise and volatility because of COVID. And so there's not a lot to report, what we're seeing is that the savings are coming in line to where we expect the model of care is a little less efficient than we want. We need to build more scale, and we need to standardize a whole bunch of these things that right now are manual. So we're still work in progress. We're growing a lot of things that we want to be, and we're still expecting to be breakeven in 2026.Philip ChickeringOkay. And then so one last question here, which won't shock you, looking at the NAG growth, sort of flat year-over-year, definitely a lot better sort of trending that we've seen for the last several quarters, [Baxter] was talking about sort of similar normalization utilization. I guess any color you can give us on how many patients you guys added this quarter, how did that sort of track versus, say, 2022 versus pre-COVID? And then any more color you can give us on where mortality is tracking on the current patient base today?Joel AckermanYes. So let me walk you through some numbers, Pito here. So the net census growth in Q1 was about 1,350 patients. If you compare that to what it was in Q1 of '22, that was negative almost 500 patients. So an almost 2,000 patients swing -- most of that is explained by the change in excess mortality, although some of it is also the result of a better admit quarter this quarter than we saw last year. So on both the mortality side and the admit side, we saw progress.Philip ChickeringSo on the admit side, I guess, can you give us a color of sort of the 1Q '23 new adds and how there was 1Q '19? Just to some comparison on pre-COVID.Joel AckermanIf you were to look at this, excluding excess mortality, I don't have the numbers in front of me, but I can tell you it was definitely higher this quarter than it was Q1 of 2019. That said, I would be cautious before we start extrapolating this out. This is one quarter of data, this metric historically has been variable quarter-to-quarter. And I'd want to wait to see what happens for a few more months before we're ready to really declare a trend here.Philip ChickeringSo I mean just a last question on that one. Sorry to sort of keep going there. But you're looking at the USRDS data, we go back for many years, the incidence rate of (inaudible) disease has been fairly consistent for I mean, nearly a decade, all signs you're seeing that we are returning to normalization of incidence rates and for you it's just too soon, some lead to call it at this point?Javier J. RodriguezIt's a little too early to call it. We've been studying and evaluating all different data sources, and we're not ready to draw any conclusions but there's a lot of movement upstream on the CKD population, in particular, with COVID. And so we will look because, as you know, there's some things that are making progression slower. On the other hand, there are things that are expanding life expectancy. And so our math is not leading to any conclusion at this point.Philip ChickeringAnd then last piece there, I promise I'll stop here, at least for now, is on mortality, I guess, any color on sort of where the normal mortality was in excess mortality? And sort of how we should think about both of those continuing in the back half of the year? And I'll stop there.Joel AckermanYes. So excess mortality was about 900 patients in the quarter. We have brought down slightly our expectations of excess mortality for the balance of the year but we're still looking at a number somewhere between 2,500 and 3,000 patients in terms of what's built into the middle of our guidance range.OperatorOur next caller is Gary Taylor with Cowen.Gary Paul TaylorI think just 2 quick number ones for me. Joel, you had mentioned or at least in the release, some favorable items in G&amp;A, including an advocacy refund. Just wondering if you could size that for us. And then on IKC, I know there's a ton of moving parts there, but I'm just trying to sort of foot how the revenue was down $4 million sequentially from 4Q, but you said you had better than -- or some early revenue there and some delayed expects. So I'm just trying to sort of foot down, but still including some early revenue recognition.Joel AckermanSure. So $6 million is the ballot number you're looking for. In terms of IKC we saw about $20 million, roughly half in the revenue line, half in the expense line that we were expecting. We were just expecting it later in the year. In terms of the timing of the revenue we generally view IKC revenue to be back half of the year loaded. As you think about the claim's lags filling up or maturing and then ultimately, the calculations on shared savings being done -- that usually happens in the back half of the year, and that's when we'll recognize the shared savings dollars. That's why you see the decline from Q4 with still a call it, a positive timing surprise.OperatorOur next caller is Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank.Philip ChickeringAll right. Sorry, I just had a couple of ones I wanted to come back to you on. So revenue per treatment sort of flatter sequentially, primarily due to sort of the seasonal co-pays. Just curious sort of 2 questions, I guess. What are you seeing from managed care on cost-of-living updates? And then how should we think about revenue per treatment sort of going through the rest of the year?Javier J. RodriguezYes. Thanks, Pito. A couple of things. We're not seeing anything to report on from the managed care negotiations and just to refresh you, we've talked about our contractor multiyear. In any given year, we negotiate roughly about 20% or so of our portfolio and we're not seeing anything different in this year. What we've talked about in Q4 last year is that we said that we would get a revenue per treatment increase year-over-year from 2% to 2.5%, '23 and over '22.Philip ChickeringOkay. Great. And then sort of on the efficiencies from closing centers, you sort of closed 20 this quarter, you talked about consolidating another 40 to 50 centers. I guess how much of savings do you think you're going to realize in '23 from those center consolidations just solely on that line? And how much of that then should trend through for 2024?Joel AckermanYes. So we haven't quantified the number. We've always said it will be part of the $125 million to $175 million, but not the biggest piece. The biggest piece of that is MIRCERA we'll get -- so that will be in '23, There'll still be some amount that will roll over into '24, but we'll get most of it in 2023.Philip ChickeringOkay. And then sort of last one here for me. What -- maybe I missed it, but what was the contract labor dollars this quarter? What are you seeing for the rest of the year? And then any color on what your hiring was and net hiring was in the first quarter?Javier J. RodriguezYes. So I think what we said was that in the year -- last year, remember, contract labor was running around $100 million. And we said for the year, this year, we'd be half of that. And now today, we moved that -- that we are moving better -- at a better pace so that number will be more like $35 million. But again, I would point you to the beginning of the conversation where we said the most important part is the interplay between all the variability of all those metrics because, of course, training productivity wages benefits and contract labor are all intertwined. But that's the number.Philip ChickeringAnd I guess the second part is just can you quantify for us the number of hires you had in the quarter and what the net hires was after turnover and how that should trend throughout the year? Because you mentioned about lower training costs as this bachelor comes online, just a helpful I think you can quantify them for us.Joel AckermanYes. So here's the way I'd think about the training cost. They were -- they peaked last year as a result really of 2 things: higher turnover, combined with the need for us to net add staff. And those combined to a high training level. As we sit here today, the turnover remains elevated. It's gotten better on with some class of late bird and others, but it still remains elevated. So we're expecting continued high training levels until that comes down, we're modeling the back half of the year but we are much closer or at fully staffed. So some of the training associated with getting the staffing levels back up is now done, and that will mitigate some of the training costs relative to the peak we saw in Q3 last year.Philip ChickeringSo then when you talk about sort 4% to 5% increase in SMB, I guess how much of that is sort of more of a once it comes from the training costs that are embedded within the guidance that should sort of roll off as you think about '24?Joel AckermanNot a lot. The change in contract labor is a much bigger tailwind relative to '22 in the training productivity. And that's -- it's partly because we're not going to see the training productivity improve until the back half of the year. It's also partly because in the beginning of 2022, training productivity was still low. So we saw the spike in Q3, but that was only 1 quarter.OperatorAnd at this time, I am showing no further questions.Javier J. RodriguezThank you, Michelle, and thank you all for the questions. As I hope you've heard today, we have some positive momentum to start the year with the results of Q1 proved to be a sustainable trend. We're excited about the implications for our patients, our teammates and our financial performance in 2023 and beyond. Thank you all for joining the call, and be well.OperatorThank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may go ahead and disconnect at this time.]"

The year to date change was primarily driven by a net increase in the Medicare rate due to base rate in 2023 partially offset by reinstatement of 2% sequestration. The increase was also impacted by the continued shift to Medicare Advantage plans and increases in hospital inpatient dialysis revenues.Patient care costs: The quarter change was primarily due to decreases in pharmaceutical costs, health benefit expenses, contract wages and insurance expense. These decreases were partially offset by increases in compensation expenses and fixed other direct operating expenses in our dialysis centers due to fewer number of treatments in the first quarter of 2023. Other drivers of this change include increases in center closure costs, as described below, and increases in costs related to management meetings. The year to date change was primarily due to increased compensation expenses including increased wage rates and headcount. Other drivers of the increase include other direct operating expenses associated with our dialysis centers as well as increases in center closure costs, as described below, and travel costs. These increases were partially offset by decreased pharmaceutical costs, contract wages and health benefit expenses.General and administrative: The quarter change was primarily due to decreased professional fees, a refund received related to 2022 advocacy costs, seasonal decreases in other general and administrative costs, including IT costs and other purchased services as well as health benefit expenses. These decreases were partially offset by increased long-term incentive compensation expense. The year to date change was primarily due to increases in compensation expenses including increased wage rates and severance costs, as described below. Other drivers of this change include increased costs related to travel and management meetings, center closure costs, as described below, and higher IT-related costs. These increases were partially offset by refund received related to 2022 advocacy costs.Certain items impacting the quarter operating results:Closure costs. During the third quarter of 2022, we began a strategic review of our outpatient clinic capacity requirements and utilization, which have been impacted both by declines in our patient census in some markets due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as by our initiatives toward, and advances in, increasing the proportion of our home dialysis patients. This review has resulted in higher than normal charges for center capacity closures.During the first quarter of 2023, we incurred charges for U.S. dialysis center closures of approximately $22.2 million, which increased our patient care costs by $12.6 million, our general and administrative expenses by $4.8 million and our depreciation and amortization expense by $4.8 million. These capacity closure costs included net losses on assets retired, lease costs, asset impairments and accelerated depreciation and amortization.Severance costs and other. During the fourth quarter of 2022, we committed to a plan to increase efficiencies and cost savings in certain general and administrative support functions. As a result of this plan, we recognized expenses related to termination and other benefit commitments in our U.S. dialysis business, integrated kidney care (IKC) business and corporate administrative support of $16.9 million, 0.4 million $0.6 million, respectively, during the first quarter of 2023.Financial and operating metrics: Three months endedMarch 31,Twelve months endedMarch 31,2023202220232022Cash flow:(dollars in millions)Operating cash flow$            463$            322$         1,705$         2,099Free cash flow(1)$            265$            147$            935$         1,297(1)For definitions of non-GAAP financial measures, see the note titled ""Note on Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" and related reconciliations beginning on page 16. Three months endedMarch 31, 2023Effective income tax rate on:Income from continuing operations20.5 %Income from continuing operations attributable to DaVita Inc.(1)27.5 %Adjusted income from continuing operations attributable to DaVita Inc.(1)27.0 %(1)For definitions of non-GAAP financial measures, see the note titled ""Note on Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" and related reconciliations beginning on page 16.Center activity: As of March 31, 2023, we provided dialysis services to a total of approximately 246,000 patients at 3,058 outpatient dialysis centers, of which 2,707 centers were located in the United States and 351 centers were located in 11 countries outside of the United States. During the first quarter of 2023, we opened a total of three new dialysis centers and closed 20 dialysis centers in the United States. We also opened three dialysis centers and closed two dialysis centers outside of the United States during the first quarter of 2023.Integrated kidney care (IKC): As of March 31, 2023, we had approximately 67,000 patients in risk-based integrated care arrangements representing approximately $5.2 billion in annualized medical spend. We also had an additional 15,000 patients in other integrated care arrangements; we do not include the medical spend for these patients in this annualized medical spend estimate. See additional description of these metrics at Note 2.Outlook:The following forward-looking measures and the underlying assumptions involve significant known and unknown risks and uncertainties, including those described below, and actual results may vary materially from these forward-looking measures. For example, the widespread impact of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to generate significant risk and uncertainty, and as a result, our future results could vary materially from the guidance provided below. We do not provide guidance for operating income or diluted net income per share attributable to DaVita Inc. on a basis consistent with United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) nor a reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures on a forward-looking basis because we are unable to predict certain items contained in the GAAP measures without unreasonable efforts. These non-GAAP financial measures do not include certain items, including capacity closure charges, severance costs and foreign currency fluctuations, which may be significant.

The leverage ratio determines the interest rate margin payable by the Company for its Term Loan A and revolving line of credit under the Credit Agreement by establishing the margin over the base interest rate (LIBOR) that is applicable. The calculation below is based on the last twelve months of ""Consolidated EBITDA,"" as of the end of the reported period and pro forma for acquisitions or divestitures that occurred during the period, and ""Consolidated net debt"" at the end of the reported period, each as defined in the Credit Agreement. The Company's management believes the presentation of ""Consolidated EBITDA"" is useful to investors to enhance their understanding of the Company's leverage ratio under its Credit Agreement. The leverage ratio calculated by the Company is a non-GAAP measure and should not be considered a substitute for the ratio of total debt to operating income, determined in accordance with GAAP. The Company's calculation of its leverage ratio might not be calculated in the same manner as, and thus might not be comparable to, similarly titled measures of other companies.Twelve months endedMarch 31, 2023December 31, 2022March 31, 2022Net income from continuing operations attributable to DaVita Inc.$                   500$                   547$                903Income taxes185198279Interest expense350326268Depreciation and amortization738733688Noncontrolling interests and equity investment income, net233221223Stock-settled stock-based compensation9595102Other 815520""Consolidated EBITDA""$               2,182$               2,175$            2,481March 31, 2023December 31, 2022March 31, 2022Total debt, excluding debt discount and other deferred financing costs(1)$               8,701$               8,969$            8,927Letters of credit issued1511091088,8539,0779,035Less: Cash and cash equivalents including short-term investments(2)(364)(318)(344)Consolidated net debt$               8,489$               8,759$            8,691Last twelve months ""Consolidated EBITDA""$               2,182$               2,175$            2,481Leverage ratio3.89x4.03x3.50xMaximum leverage ratio permitted under the Credit Agreement5.00x5.00x5.00xCertain columns or rows may not sum or recalculate due to the presentation of rounded numbers.(1)The debt amounts as of March 31, 2023, December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022 presented exclude approximately $41.5, $44.5 and $53.6, respectively, of debt discount, premium and other deferred financing costs related to our senior secured credit facilities and senior notes in effect or outstanding at that time.(2)This excludes amounts not readily convertible to cash related to the Company's non-qualified deferred compensation plans for all periods presented. The Credit Agreement limits the amount deducted for cash and cash equivalents, including short-term investments, to the lesser of all unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, including short-term investments of the Company or $750.DAVITA INC.INTEGRATED CARE METRICS(unaudited)Note 2:   Integrated Care MetricsOur integrated kidney care (IKC) business is party to a variety of risk-based integrated care and disease management arrangements, including value-based care (VBC) contracts under which we assume full or shared financial risk for the total medical cost of care for patients below or above a benchmark.The aggregate amount of medical spend associated with risk-based integrated care arrangements that we disclose includes both medical costs included in our reported expenses for certain risk-based arrangements (such as its special needs plans), as well as the aggregate estimated benchmark amount above or below which we will incur profit or loss on for VBC arrangements under which third-party medical costs are not included in our reported results. This metric is an annualization of our estimate of this amount for the most recent quarter.A number of our VBC contracts are subject to complex or novel patient attribution mechanics and benchmark adjustments, some of which are based on information not reported to us until periods after we report our quarterly results. As a result, our estimates of our patients under, and the dollar amount of, our value-based contracts remain subject to estimation uncertainty.DAVITA INC.RECONCILIATIONS FOR NON-GAAP MEASURES(unaudited)Note on Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresAs used in this press release, the term ""adjusted"" refers to non-GAAP measures as follows, each as reconciled to its most comparable GAAP measure as presented in the non-GAAP reconciliations in the notes to this press release: (i) for income and expense measures, the term ""adjusted"" refers to operating performance measures that exclude certain items such as impairment charges, (gain) loss on ownership changes, capacity closure charges, restructuring charges, accruals for legal matters and debt prepayment and refinancing charges; and (ii) the term ""effective income tax rate on adjusted income from continuing operations attributable to DaVita Inc."" represents the Company's effective tax rate excluding applicable non-GAAP items and the tax associated with them as well as noncontrolling owners' income, which primarily relates to non-tax paying entities. Note that the non-GAAP measures presented for prior periods below have been conformed to the non-GAAP measures presented for the current period.These non-GAAP or ""adjusted"" measures are presented because management believes these measures are useful adjuncts to GAAP results. However, these non-GAAP measures should not be considered alternatives to the corresponding measures determined under GAAP.Specifically, management uses adjusted measures of operating expenses for its U.S. dialysis business, adjusted U.S. dialysis patient care costs per treatment, adjusted operating income, adjusted net income from continuing operations attributable to DaVita Inc. and adjusted diluted net income per share from continuing operations attributable to DaVita Inc. to compare and evaluate our performance period over period and relative to competitors, to analyze the underlying trends in our business, to establish operational budgets and forecasts and for incentive compensation purposes. We believe these non-GAAP measures also are useful to investors and analysts in evaluating our performance over time and relative to competitors, as well as in analyzing the underlying trends in our business. Furthermore, we believe these presentations enhance a user's understanding of our normal consolidated results by excluding certain items which we do not believe are indicative of our ordinary results of operations. As a result, adjusting for these amounts allows for comparison to our normalized prior period results.The effective income tax rate on adjusted income from continuing operations attributable to DaVita Inc. excludes noncontrolling owners' income and certain non-deductible and other charges which we do not believe are indicative of our ordinary results. Accordingly, we believe these adjusted effective income tax rates are useful to management, investors and analysts in evaluating our performance and establishing expectations for income taxes incurred on our ordinary results attributable to DaVita Inc.Finally, free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less distributions to noncontrolling interests and all capital expenditures (including development capital expenditures, routine maintenance and information technology); plus contributions from noncontrolling interests and proceeds from the sale of self-developed properties.

369,6c4e37fa-77bd-389c-bfda-fb1cf9ee37e4,IR,2023-05-09,"At US$58.94, Is It Time To Put Ingersoll Rand Inc. (NYSE:IR) On Your Watch List?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-58-94-time-put-114152641.html,1683632512,STORY,['IR'],"[Today we're going to take a look at the well-established Ingersoll Rand Inc. (NYSE:IR). The company's stock saw a decent share price growth in the teens level on the NYSE over the last few months. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let’s take a look at Ingersoll Rand’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. See our latest analysis for Ingersoll Rand What's The Opportunity In Ingersoll Rand?According to my valuation model, Ingersoll Rand seems to be fairly priced at around 13% below my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Ingersoll Rand today, you’d be paying a fair price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $67.43, then there’s not much of an upside to gain from mispricing. Although, there may be an opportunity to buy in the future. This is because Ingersoll Rand’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company’s shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.What does the future of Ingersoll Rand look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Ingersoll Rand's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 67%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? IR’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on IR, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.So if you'd like to dive deeper into this stock, it's crucial to consider any risks it's facing.

376,cbb2850d-7010-3933-ac27-0e9e104cc5f7,GE,2023-05-09,Top Supersonic Travel Companies in the World,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-supersonic-travel-companies-world-142604496.html,1683555964,STORY,"['GE', 'SPCE', 'BA', 'NOC']","[In this piece, we will take a look at the top supersonic travel companies in the world. For more supersonic companies, head on over to Top 5 Supersonic Travel Companies in the World. Think for a second if you were living in 1923 instead of in 2023. It's been five years since the first world war ended and long distance passenger travel is still done either through buses or ships. While human flight is possible, it's not without caveats and limitations. Now, transport yourself to 2023, and imagine seeing a ghastly elongated cylindrical metal object emitting fire from its bottom and landing on a ship in the ocean.If you'd carried out our small thought experiment, you'll realize that in just a hundred years, humanity has come a long, long way. While folks in 1923 could only travel in air in pairs, these days jumbo jets manufactured by The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) and Airbus SE (OTCMKTS:EADSF) are capable of transporting hundreds of people all over the world at more than five times the speed of the Airco DH.4 - one of the world's first passenger planes.But what if you wanted to go faster? Well, for that, you'll have to transport yourself back to the past once again. But not too far back; only just two decades, to the era of the Concorde. The Concorde was the world's second supersonic commercial aircraft and the most widely flown plane as well. The aircraft could travel twice as fast as the speed of sound, but several considerations such as an inability to conduct flights over land due to supersonic booms and high operating costs ended up shelving the project. To understand just how expensive it was to fly the Concorde, consider the fact that it could travel 14 passenger miles per gallon of fuel, compared to the 91 passenger miles per gallon of the Boeing 747. The supersonic aircraft was also a fuel guzzler, as for every passenger transported a hundred kilometers, it would use 16.6 liters of fuel, which is significantly higher when considering the 3.3 liters for the Boeing.Story continuesYet, the Concorde's retirement doesn't mean that dreams of supersonic flight are over. While the world's largest aircraft manufacturers Airbus and Boeing do not have any plans for making commercial supersonic jets, others do have such plans, and some of these involve rockets as well. At the same time, even though the supersonic travel industry is quite limited right now, and no point to point travel on Earth options exist, there is some value to the sector. For instance, a research report from The Business Research Company points out that the supersonic jet market was worth $22.9 billion last year and will grow to $23.5 billion by the end of this year. From then until 2027, the sector will post a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4% and be worth $27.53 billion by the end of the forecast period. The research firm believes that growth in global air passenger traffic will drive the industry forward, along with newer technologies that aim to reduce emissions and the high sounds produced by these airplanes.However, while point to point supersonic flights still haven't 'taken off' since the Concorde's retirement, that does not mean civilians are not traveling supersonically. In fact, the rapid growth in the astronautics sector has led to private astronauts flying both to the boundary between Earth and Space, called the Karman line, the International Space Station (ISS), and around the Earth. In fact, it's private astronauts, and not crew from space agencies such as NASA, who have flown the highest orbit around the Earth as well. This particular mission was the Inspiration4 flight which took off from NASA's Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in 2021. The mission was flown by the billionaire Jared Isaacman as part of his efforts to raise funds for a children's cancer hospital, and it saw Isaacman and his crew of four fly to an orbit of 585 kilometers - the highest orbit since a Hubble space telescope mission in 1999. However, the mission's apogee - its furthest point in orbit - was a whopping 1,368 kilometers away from Earth and the highest in human history for missions in orbit. Of course, astronauts part of NASA's Apollo program that took humans to the Moon have flown further, but their mission was beyond the Earth's orbit.Just as was the case with the Concorde, supersonic travel of today is also limited to the rich simply due to the high costs of flying expensive rockets. Apart from Mr. Isaacman, other billionaires have also traveled to space although, of course, he is the one to have flown the farthest. The other two flew missions for their own companies. The first of these was British billionaire Sir Richard Branson who flew to the boundary of space on his space company Virgin Galactic Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:SPCE)'s SpaceShipTwo spaceplane in July 2021. Sir Branson was followed by the retail billionaire Jeff Bezos, who also flew to the Karman line in his space company Blue Origin's New Shepard rocket. Both these vehicles travel faster than the speed of sound during their missions, but their destinations are not on Earth.With these details in mind, let's take a look at some top supersonic travel companies, out of which the top picks are Virgin Galactic Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:SPCE), Space Exploration Technologies Corporation (SpaceX), and Blue Origin LLC.Top Supersonic Travel Companies in the WorldPhoto by Hermeus on UnsplashOur Methodology To compile our list of the top supersonic travel companies, we first made a list of all firms that have supersonic aircraft designs, manufacture engines for these aircraft, and provide the services. For the ranking, the periphery firms, such as the engine companies, are listed first. These are followed by companies with design projects. Finally, firms that have actual supersonic products are ranked the highest.Top Supersonic Travel Companies in the World10. General Electric Company (NYSE:GE)General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) is an American firm headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts. It is the sole supplier of the jet engine for Lockheed Martin and NASA's X-59 supersonic aircraft, which aims to demonstrate quiet supersonic flight for future passenger planes. A central piece of the aircraft is its engine since it must function with a specially designed nozzle that reduces noise without compromising performance for a high power aircraft.By the end of last year's fourth quarter, 59 of the 943 hedge funds part of Insider Monkey's database had bought a stake in General Electric Company (NYSE:GE). The firm's largest investor is Richard S. Pzena's Pzena Investment Management which owns 13.2 million shares that are worth $1 billion.Virgin Galactic Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:SPCE), General Electric Company (NYSE:GE), Space Exploration Technologies Corporation (SpaceX), and Blue Origin LLC are some top supersonic travel companies in the world.9. Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC)Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) is an American firm based in Falls Church, Virginia. It has partnered up with the supersonic airplane designer Boom Supersonic to develop a quick response supersonic military transport plane for the United States military.As of December 2022, 49 of the 943 hedge funds part of Insider Monkey's database had held a stake in Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC). The firm's largest hedge fund in our database is Rajiv Jain's GQG Partners with a $428 million stake that comes via 784,927 shares.8. EON Aerospace, Inc.EON Aerospace, Inc. is an aerospace firm set up by a South African billionaire. Its plane is called the NXT-01 which aims to have a top speed of Mach 1.9. However, few details are available about the jet.7. Exosonic, IncExosonic, Inc is a U.S. firm that is one of the younger companies in the supersonic travel industry. The firm was set up in 2019 and it operates out of Los Angeles, California. The firm is developing a low boom supersonic passenger aircraft, which aims to be suitable for flights over populated areas. This lends it a large market opportunity since supersonic flights in the U.S. are banned due to noise generated by the sonic booms. Exosonic, Inc aims to achieve Mach 1.8 with its aircraft, with 5,000 nautical miles range, and a passenger capacity of 70 people. The jet is intended to have two different variants, one for the private jet industry and the other for commercial airlines.The business jet model will have two private suites and video teleconferencing capabilities. It will also have lay flat seats that will enable passengers to sleep during their flight. The firm promises to complete the journey from London to Hong Kong in just six hours compared to the standard travel time of eleven hours.6. Spike Aerospace, Inc.Spike Aerospace, Inc. is an American aerospace firm with offices in Florida and Massachusetts. Like Exosonic, Spike is also developing a quiet supersonic jet, but it has limited its design to business jets only. Spike's jet, called S-512, is slower than than Exosonic's, with a speed of 1.6 Mach. The jet aims to have a maximum capacity of 18 people, but it's a rare plane that aims to provide passengers with a panoramic view of their surroundings so that they can fully understand where they are and how fast they are traveling.Spike Aerospace, Inc. joins Virgin Galactic Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:SPCE), Space Exploration Technologies Corporation (SpaceX), and Blue Origin LLC in our list of the world's top supersonic travel companies. Click to continue reading and see Top 5 Supersonic Travel Companies in the World. Suggested Articles:15 Biggest Airplanes in the World in 202312 Best Aerospace Stocks To Buy15 Biggest Private Jet Companies in the WorldDisclosure: None.

From diagnostic systems like MRIs and CAT scans to high-tech glucose monitoring systems to devices that destroy tumors, medicine makes use of many such technologies. Companies that develop technologies for the healthcare sector are referred to as healthtech companies. In this column, I will provide information about three of the best healthtech stocks available, focusing on companies that have developed non-drug technologies to combat or diagnose diseases.Another major trend in medicine is digital health. According to the FDA, “digital health technologies use computing platforms, connectivity, software, and sensors for health care and related uses.”The three names that I will discuss are also digital health stocks.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsMedtronic (MDT)Medtronic (MDT) sign outside office building representing healthcare stocksSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comMedtronic (NYSE:MDT) is one of the world’s top medical device makers.In the last 18 months, the company has launched a number of new, very promising products. On May 1, the FDA approved two of MDT’s “leadless pacemakers,” called Micra AV2 and Micra VR2. According to the company, the devices are “the world’s smallest pacemakers, provide longer battery life and easier programming than prior Micra pacemakers, while still delivering the many benefits of leadless pacing such as reduced complications compared to traditional pacemakers.” Given these devices’ many important, competitive advantages, they should boost MDT’s financial results going forward.Moreover, as I noted in a previous column, the company has launched “a robot that helps perform surgeries” using artificial intelligence. Speaking to an analyst on March 10, MDT CFO Karen Parkhill said that Hugo is “going to be a strong contributor to our revenue growth for many years to come. ”Also likely to boost Medtronic are a few moves by Washington on the diabetes front. First, the FDA last month eliminated restrictions that it had imposed on MDT’s insulin pumps. Secondly, the agency approved the company’s new insulin pump.Story continuesFinally, Medtronic, which markets continuous glucose-monitoring systems, should be boosted by a recent decision by Medicare to cover the cost of such systems for some diabetes patients who don’t receive daily insulin injections.Dexcom (DXCM)Dexcom (DXCM) logo on an app store page on a mobile phoneSource: FOOTAGE VECTOR PHOTO / Shutterstock.comDexcom’s (NASDAQ:DXCM) main business is marketing continuous glucose monitors, including its Dexcom G7, which “delivers real-time glucose numbers to [patients’] smartphone[s].” As a result, Dexcom should benefit from Medicare’s recent decision “to cover the cost of such systems for some diabetes patients who don’t receive daily insulin injections.”Indeed, the company cited the new coverage rules, along with its strong first-quarter results, as the reasons for its decision to raise its 2023 sales guidance on April 27. Specifically, DXCM increased its full-year top-line outlook to $3.4 billion to $3.52 billion from $3.35 billion to $3.49 billion. Given how widespread diabetes is and the importance of Medicare coverage for selling devices, I think that the guidance will probably end up being conservative.In Q1, Dexcom’s top line climbed 18% year over year to $741.5 million, while its operating income, excluding some items, increased 2.6 percentage points YOY.UBS responded to the Q1 results by increasing its price target on the shares to $150 from $142 while keeping a “buy” rating on the name. The bank expects the company to deliver “beat and raise” quarterly results “throughout the year.”GE HealthCare Technologies (GEHC)GE Healthcare (GEHC) sign. GE Healthcare is an American company founded in 2014 and spun off from GE in 2023.Source: testing / Shutterstock.comGE Healthcare (NASDAQ:GEHC) spun off from General Electric (NYSE:GE) in January. GE Healthcare is “a leading manufacturer and distributor of diagnostic imaging agents and radiopharmaceuticals.” Among its top products are CT machines, MRIs, ultrasounds and mammograms. The company also sells many digital tools that help manage its leading products.On April 25, GEHC reported that its top line had climbed an impressive 12% year over year, excluding acquisitions and divestments, while its adjusted earnings before interest and taxes climbed to $664 million from $599 million. Moreover, the company reported that it expects its earnings per share, excluding some items, to climb 7% to 11% this year to $3.60-$3.75.Before GEHC reported its results, investment bank Piper Sandler on April 20 started coverage of the name with a $95 price target and an “overweight” rating. The bank noted that the company had a large backlog of $14 billion, and thinks that it will be able to introduce significant new products after it raised its investment in R&amp;D.On the technology front, the company recently launched a system “designed to deliver high-performance ultrasound guidance” for multiple types of surgeries. And GEHC received an award from research firm MedTech Breakthrough for a “Best New Ultrasound Technology Solution.” Both pieces of news bode well for GEHC’s outlook as they suggest that the company is indeed on the cutting edge of medtech and an excellent healthtech stock to buy.As of the date of publication, Larry Ramer owned shares of GE.

MUSA announced first-quarter 2023 earnings per share of $4.80, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.06. The outperformance could be attributed to higher volumes and retail fuel contribution.However, MUSA’s bottom line was significantly below the year-earlier quarter’s adjusted profit of $6.08 per share, dragged down by a fall in the retail gasoline price.Meanwhile, Murphy USA’s operating revenues of $5.1 billion edged down 0.8% year over year but breezed past the consensus mark by $118 million, primarily due to improved merchandise sales.Merchandise sales, at $966.2 million, rose 8.3% year over year and outperformed the consensus mark of $887 million. However, revenues from petroleum product sales came in at $4 billion, falling 3.4% short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate and declining 3.7% from the first quarter of 2022.Murphy USA Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Murphy USA Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseMurphy USA Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Murphy USA Inc. Quote Key TakeawaysMUSA’s total fuel contribution fell 10.8% year over year to $329.9 million due to margin contraction. On a bearish note, total fuel contribution (including retail fuel margin plus product supply and wholesale results) came in at 28.9 cents per gallon, which dropped 15% from the first quarter of 2022.Retail fuel contribution increased 4.4% year over year to $264.7 million even as margins, at 23.2 cents per gallon, remained essentially unchanged from the corresponding period of 2022. Retail gallons rose 4.9% from the year-ago period to 1,141.8 million in the quarter under review but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 1,147 million. Volumes on an SSS basis (or fuel gallons per store) improved 2.2% from the first quarter of 2022 to 227.8 thousand. Meanwhile, the average retail gasoline price during the quarter came in at $3.15 per gallon, down from $3.43 per gallon a year ago.Contribution from Merchandise increased 6.5% to $187.1 million on higher sales, which more than offset the fall in unit margins, from 19.7% a year ago to 19.4% in the first quarter of 2023. On an SSS basis, total merchandise contribution was up 5% year over year, primarily on the back of 5.6% higher non-tobacco margins. Meanwhile, merchandise sales increased 6% on an SSS basis due to an increase in tobacco as well as non-tobacco sales.The Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company’s monthly fuel gallons were up 2.4% from the prior-year period, while merchandise sales increased 6% on an average per store month basis.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Story continuesBalance SheetAs of Dec 31, Murphy USA — which opened eight new retail locations in the quarter to take its store count to 1,720 — had cash and cash equivalents of $102.1 million and long-term debt (including lease obligations) of $1.8 billion, with a debt-to-capitalization of 71.4%.During the quarter, MUSA bought back shares worth $13.7 million.Some Key Refining EarningsWhile we have discussed MUSA’s fourth-quarter results in detail, let’s see how some other refining companies have fared this earnings season.Phillips 66 PSX reported adjusted earnings per share of $4.21, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.58. Moreover, the bottom line improved significantly from a profit of $1.32 per share in the year-ago quarter.PSX’s worldwide margins almost doubled to $20.72 per barrel from the year-ago quarter’s $10.83. The same in the Central Corridor and Atlantic Basin/Europe increased to $26.86 and $16.13 per barrel from the year-ago levels of $7.89 and $11.71, respectively. In the Gulf Coast, the metric registered an improvement to $21.28 per barrel from $8.59 in the prior-year quarter. However, the West Coast witnessed a decline in margins from $17.74 per barrel in the year-ago quarter to $16.53 in the March-end quarter of 2023.Another refining giant, Valero Energy VLO, also reported strong first-quarter earnings. The bottom line of $8.27 per share came in well above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.24. The outperformance reflects increased refinery throughput volumes and a higher refining margin. In particular, adjusted operating income in the Refining unit amounted to $4.1 billion, surging from $1.5 billion in the year-ago quarter.At the end of the first quarter, VLO had cash and cash equivalents of $5.5 billion, while the company’s total debt and finance lease obligations amounted to $11.4 billion. Valero’s first-quarter capital investment was $524 million. Of the total, $341 million was allotted for sustaining the business.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

381,9ae2b1e5-9f61-3eb4-bad0-5101911f791c,UNH,2023-05-09,7 Dividend-Paying Large-Cap Stocks to Buy in May,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-dividend-paying-large-cap-204135409.html,1683232895,STORY,"['AVGO', 'ABBV', 'MA', 'UNH', 'RTX', 'LIN']","[Large-cap stocks are those that have a market capitalization above $10 billion and are synonymously known as big cap stocks. A company’s market capitalization is calculated by multiplying the share price by the number of shares outstanding. By that metric, all of the shares listed below qualify as large cap. Each stock listed below also pays out a dividend, providing shareholders with a dependable source of income. May is a great month to buy these companies despite the old adage to “sell in May and go away.” There may be a historical precedent for weaker performance during the summer, but investors in these dividend-paying large-cap stocks generate passive income year round. Investors who choose to direct their capital into the safety of large-cap dividend stocks should consider doing so right now, at least in these names. AVGOBroadcom$610.16RTXRaytheon$95.92LINLinde$360.80ABBVAbbVie$147.36HSYHershey$274.64MAMastercard$376.12UNHUnitedHealth Group$487.28InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsBroadcom (AVGO)broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office buildingSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.comBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions firm with a strong history. It is indeed among the group of large-cap stocks, boasting a market cap north of $250 billion. Broadcom designs, develops, and sells its software well. This is reflected in the company’s strong fundamentals and valuation metrics, which I think make it a company worthy of investment. Although it is currently earnings season, Broadcom actually released its results two months ago. Earnings were strong, and the market reacted in kind, sending share prices from $598 to around $630 overnight. That would have been a better time to establish a position, but now is as good a time as any. That’s partly because the company’s share price has since sunk back down toward the $610 level, significantly below the average analyst target price above $700. Story continuesIn short, Broadcom grew its revenue 16% on a year-over-year basis. This enabled the company to repurchase shares and provide a decent outlook for 8% growth in Q2.  Broadcom is still working to acquire VMWare, which is likely to spike its stock price closer to that $700 level if it goes through. Raytheon (RTX)Raytheon (RTX) defense company logo hanging from glass buildingSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comThere’s good reason to believe Raytheon (NYSE:RTX) stock could move $10 higher toward its target price in the coming months. The defense company released Q1 results on April 25 which showed investors a strong, predictable firm with good prospects. Raytheon reported 10% overall sales growth along with 10% organic growth. So, why should RTX stock be expected to grow now? I think the answer to that question relates to a few key factors. For one, demand for its products and services is high. The company has a record $180 billion backlog and a book-to-bill ratio of 1.25. Book-to-bill is a comparison of booked orders relative to those that have been processed and are ready to bill.  Those figures seem to vindicate the general idea that defense spending is trending upward as geopoltical tensions rise. Raytheon reduced its dividend in 2021, but has since increased it twice. The dividend yields a modest 2.2% currently and is at a healthy payout range. Linde (LIN)Back View of the Head of the Project Holds Laptop and Discussing Product Details with Chief Engineer while They Walk Through Modern Factory., FR rents out these spaces in the U.S.Source: Gorodenkoff / Shutterstock.comLinde (NYSE:LIN) also pays a modest dividend, but is a company that has a more reliable track record than Raytheon’s. Currently, LIN stock yields 1.4%, and was last reduced in 1996. Linde is an industrial gases firm with a global footprint and serves multiple end markets from chemicals &amp; energy, to healthcare, manufacturing and more. Linde’s Q1 earnings report was quite satisfactory overall. Although sales were flat at $8.2 billion and up only 3% year-over-year, the period was strong overall. Operating profit increased by over 16%, reaching $2 billion. However, earnings per share was where Linde really shined. The company delivered earnings per share of $3.42, well beyond the highest end of the analyst range. In fact, it was the fourth straight quarter in which Linde’s EPS exceeded analysts’ predictions. Linde’s continued strong earnings performance suggests that it has strong upside potential over the long-term. AbbVie (ABBV)Closeup of AbbVie (ABBV) building corporate office, an American biopharmaceutical company with its headquarters in Lake Bluff, Illinois, USASource: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.comNow is the time to invest in AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV), even as Humira sales decline sharply. The blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drug accounted for $5.587 billion of AbbVie’s $12.23 billion in sales during Q1. However, sales also declined sharply for the drug, falling 25.2% year-over-year.That led to an overall sales decline at AbbVie of 9.7%. None of this sounds particularly positive. AbbVie relies on Humira, which is losing patent protection for a large portion of its business. A predictable decline is occurring as expected. But there’s a caveat here. AbbVie’s sales were slightly above those expected on Wall Street. The earnings beat, though small, suggests AbbVie is strategically doing what it should be, in promoting the other parts of its portfolio and pushing for greater sales and market share.  AbbVie didn’t do worse than expected, but investors simply didn’t care to see Humira sales soften, although everyone knew they would. The markets were being irrational when they dinged ABBV stock for these results, meaning there’s an opportunity for keen investors. Hershey (HSY)The entrance to the Hershey factory in downtown Hershey, Pennsylvania. HSY stock.Source: George Sheldon / Shutterstock.comHershey (NYSE:HSY) stock informs investors why any sort of business improvement is positive, no matter how it comes. Let me explain. Hershey currently expects sales to decline by 8% in 2023 after releasing Q1 earnings on April 27. Additionally, the company expects its earnings per share to shrink by 15%. This is a case of seemingly bad news being good news. An 8% decline in 2023 sales is an upward adjustment to the high end of Hershey’s previous range. That is also true for its earnings per share figures. Indeed, this appears to all be a result of strong consumer demand that resulted in a revenue increase of 12.1% (12.2% organic) in Q1, with overall revenue reaching $2.898 billion. Net income also came in at $587.2 million, up 10.9%. These strong results are attributable to the fact that consumers remain willing to pay more for everyday items. That truth has been evident across the market as earnings continue to come in and companies continue to report the same idea that consumers are still willing to absorb higher prices. Mastercard (MA)A close-up shot of Mastercard credit or debit cards.Source: Alexander Yakimov / Shutterstock.comMastercard (NYSE:MA) is a dividend-paying stock to consider buying right now. Notably, MA stock pays a very modest 57 cent dividend that yields 0.6%. Admittedly, that isn’t a particularly compelling reason to buy. Investors don’t really buy this stock for its dividend – it’s the company’s growth profile that continues to shine. Indeed, Mastercard is a smart choice right now for a different set of reasons. Consumer spending remains very strong for one. Mastercard notes as much in its earnings report. Management also notes that cross-border travel continues to strengthen given the company further tailwinds. But at the same time, that’s all a positive spin on a bitter truth. American credit card debt is spiraling out of control. It reached $986 billion in total in Q4, up by $61 billion in Q3. American consumer spending benefits Mastercard tremendously as balances rise. The bill is going to come due, and Mastercard will likely be one of the primary beneficiaries.UnitedHealth Group (UNH)The UnitedHealth (UNH) headquarters in Minnetonka, Minnesota.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comUnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) continues to be a strong pick among large-cap dividend stocks. The insurance and healthcare provider’s better-than-expected first quarter results reaffirm that idea. The company’s earnings per share of $6.26 beat expectations by 10 cents. Likewise, the company’s medical loss ratio, at 82.2%, came in lower than expected. That means the company paid fewer medical care premiums overall, in turn contributing to stronger earnings per share figures. UnitedHealth Group’s dividend is rock-solid, yet modest. Currently, UNH stock yields only 1.35%, but was last reduced in 1990. Let’s run some hypothetical math here to understand the real beauty of UNH stock as an investment. Shares currently trade for $492 but have a target price of $596. Assuming dividends remain the same for the next year an investor could reasonably expect their $492 to be worth $602.60 if analysts are correct ($596 + 1.65(4)). That equates to a 22.47% return. That’s an excellent return over a 12 to 18 month period. On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

The Nasdaq Composite advanced but just slightly, less than 0.1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&amp;P 500 lost 1.2% and 0.8%, respectively.The week’s trade was dominated by the anticipation and aftermath of the Fed’s rate hike.  Markets had already priced in a 25 bps rate hike, and the decision did not come as a surprise. Yet, the regional banking crisis deepened throughout the week, raising hopes that the central bank might take a more pragmatic view of the situation. However, with signals coming in from the Fed that a rate pause was not a certainty even in the coming months, the first four sessions of the week reeled under the resultant gloom and doom.But a blockbuster Friday marked a rebound for the indexes, and much of last week’s losses were pared off.

The type of consistency we crave in our dividends tends to be a cultural consistency and one that can be found throughout the years of various management at the firm. On the surface, we are looking for dividend stocks to buy. But in reality, we are looking for dividend aristocrats that can deliver across the board. That doesn’t mean simply paying out or raising a dividend. It also includes consistency with its business and the long-term returns generated for investors. Put simply, I want to own a business that can hold up to various fluctuations in the stock market, regardless of what’s going on. Let’s look at a few dividends for 2023.JNJJohnson &amp; Johnson$162.13PEPPepsiCo$193.38ORealty Income$61.92Dividend Stocks to Buy: Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ)A photo of a young boy wearing sunglasses, jeans, a blazer, a white shirt and suspenders holding money in various denominations in one hand and sitting in a plush chair.Source: Dmitry Lobanov/Shutterstock.comThere’s one moment that really sticks with me and that was April 2020. The Covid-19 pandemic had exploded around the world and stocks were getting killed. It wasn’t odd to see the S&amp;P 500 down 5%, 6%, 7%, or more — in a single session!Then Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) reported solid earnings, told a pretty reassuring tale, and raised its dividend. The stock jumped 4.5% the next day and the report kickstarted a 12.5% rally in the share price. What a way to reassure investors during a time of immense uncertainty. Fast-forward a few years and the firm recently raised its dividend for the 61st consecutive year. While it pays just a 2.9% dividend yield, it’s one of the most dependable yields in the market. Then consider J&amp;J’s other attributes and it becomes very difficult to ignore.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsFor instance, shares trade at roughly 15 times this year’s earnings estimates, while analysts expect mid-single-digit earnings and revenue growth. That’s a rather low valuation and even if the growth rate isn’t robust, growth is growth and in a tough environment, that’s all we can ask for.Story continuesPepsiCo (PEP)A hand reaches out of a mailbox holding a wad of cash.Source: ShutterstockWant something with a little bit more growth? Try out PepsiCo (NYSE:PEP), a name every investor knows. This stock has quietly rallied to all-time highs and given the uncertain investing environment, it’s no surprise that investors are piling into names with predictable earnings and dependable cash flow.Think about it. PepsiCo not only dominates the beverage space with brands like Pepsi, Mountain Dew, Gatorade, Tropicana, OceanSpray, and others, but it also dominates snack brands too, owning Tostitos, Ruffles, Rold Gold, Lay’s, Cheetos, Doritos and plenty of others. Put simply, PepsiCo dominates the food and beverages aisles at the grocery store. In good times and bad, there will be demand for its products — and so far, demand has remained pretty strong.The company recently beat earnings and revenue expectations and gave a slight boost to its organic growth expectations. Further, PepsiCo upped its dividend by 10%. While it yields “just” 2.65%, the firm has now raised its payout in 51 consecutive years. So regardless of what the stock market does, it’s clear that PepsiCo is one of the best dividend stocks out there.Realty Income (O)7 Winning High-Yield Dividend Stocks With Payouts Over 5%Source: ShutterstockA list of dividend stocks to buy in any environment could be pretty long. Perhaps the hardest was choosing between Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE:PG) and Realty Income (NYSE:O). Ultimately I went with the latter, but there is a pretty big caveat to mention.This is not a stock for short-term investors. Further, Realty Income — or O stock for short — is one of the few stocks out there that hasn’t gone on to make new highs since the Covid-19 selloff. Conversely, P&amp;G has roared to 52-week highs in recent trading. Despite the rally, P&amp;G trades at roughly 26 times earnings with a nearly non-existent growth forecast for this year. That’s okay for some investors, as P&amp;G is a dividend stud. However, Realty Income shouldn’t be ignored either.Although there is the commercial real estate risk that could weigh on REITs — that being the “caveat” I mentioned a moment ago — Realty Income is really impressive when it comes to long-term investors buying, holding, and dripping the dividend. Shares yield just over 5%, the highest on this list, while the company pays its dividend monthly, not quarterly. Lastly, it has raised its dividend in 102 consecutive quarters (or more than 25 years) and has paid its monthly dividend consecutively for more than 52 years!On the date of publication, Bret Kenwell held a long position in JNJ.

Interest rates in America are now at their highest level in 16 years. While higher rates might tame inflation in the long run, they are likely to slow the economy in the near term and cause problems for certain companies. As such, investors should position their portfolios to defend against the negative consequences of a high-interest rate environment, and consider these seven top stocks to sell.PACWPacWest Bancorp$3.50GPSGap$8.27PGProcter &amp; Gamble$155.24TSLATesla$161.23TAT&amp;T$16.88VVisa$225.17INTCIntel$31.26Stocks to Sell: PacWest Bancorp (PACW)Death: grim reaper in black cloakSource: ShutterstockWith higher interest rates, we could see another bank failure. On the shortlist of banks that might also fail is PacWest Bancorp (NASDAQ:PACW), whose share price has fallen more than 30% since May 1 as investors and traders assume that the lender is on shaky ground.While major lenders such as JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) appear largely immune to the current turmoil in the banking sector, mid-size regional lenders like PacWest Bancorp continue to be vulnerable. Trading in PACW stock has been so volatile recently that it has been halted several times. PacWest recently reported a Q1 earnings beat and that its deposits remain stable. But until the Fed stops raising interest rates, regional lenders such as PacWest will remain under a cloud. PACW stock has fallen 79% in the last 12 months.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsStocks to Sell: Gap (GPS)A white clock indicates it's time to sell.Source: ShutterstockClothing retailers such as Gap (NYSE:GPS) take it on the chin when interest rates rise and the economy slows. This is because consumers view clothing such as the items sold at Gap as discretionary and tend to put off spending on those products when times get tough. This reality has certainly been reflected in earnings at Gap, which have disappointed over multiple quarters. The current high-interest rate environment has proven to be a double whammy for The Gap, coming after two years of pandemic restrictions at its stores.Story continuesGap is trying to right its ship, announcing staff layoffs and a shake-up in its executive ranks. But the retailer is likely to continue struggling while interest rates remain high and consumers struggle to balance their budgets. The pressure exerted by higher interest rates, coupled with slowing sales and poor financial results, have pushed GPS stock 32% lower in the last year. The company’s share price is now down nearly 70% over the past five years.Stocks to Sell: Procter &amp; Gamble (PG)little girl holding a stock chart with athumbs down. stocks to avoidSource: ShutterstockOn their recent earnings call, executives at U.S. consumer products giant Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE:PG) acknowledged they can only raise prices so far in the current environment before consumers start to look for cheaper alternatives. The company, whose brands include Tide, Gillette, and Febreze reported that its sales volumes fell 3% in this year’s first quarter as price-sensitive consumers opted for cheaper items.The decrease in sales volumes at Procter &amp; Gamble was offset by price increases that averaged 10% on its various items. But executives said that further price increases are likely to be limited. With interest rates rising further, consumers are even less likely to splash out for Gillette razors when they can buy a cheaper, generic version. Procter &amp; Gamble has now reported four consecutive quarters of declining sales volumes. All of its divisions reported lower sales in Q1, except for its health and beauty unit. The decline is likely to worsen. PG stock is flat over the last 12 months, up only a slight 0.64%.Tesla (TSLA)a frustrated man with a white board behind him that features a black downward arrowSource: ShutterstockConsumers these days are sensitive to the interest rates charged on loans, especially when those loans are used for big-ticket purchases such as a new vehicle. And loans just got more expensive after the Fed took interest rates in the U.S. to a 16-year high. This helps to explain why Tesla’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) sales have been falling, impacting both the company’s earnings and its stock. Shares of the electric vehicle maker tanked 8% recently after the company reported a 24% year-over-year decline in its Q1 net income.On an earnings call to announce the poor results, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said he sees an “uncertain” economic environment and expects 12 months of “stormy weather” ahead for the automaker. To try and kickstart sales, Tesla has been aggressively cutting prices on its electric vehicles in jurisdictions all over the world. Tesla said it expects to produce 1.8 million vehicles this year, with the possibility of hitting a two million production milestone, depending on demand. TSLA stock is down 46% over the last 12 months.AT&amp;T (T)earningsSource: ShutterstockDifficult economic times and rising interest rates force consumers to prioritize essentials such as food and shelter and cut back on other items such as high-speed internet. This is largely why AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) recently reported abysmal quarterly results that caused its share price to fall 10%, marking the biggest one-day drop in T stock since the technology bubble burst in December 2000. Poor subscriber numbers jumped off the company’s earnings sheet.AT&amp;T reported that it added 424,000 regular monthly wireless subscribers in Q1 of this year, which was nearly 40% fewer than the company added a year earlier. It blamed the lower subscriber numbers on high inflation and rising interest rates, which, the company said, made consumers reluctant to spend money on 5G wireless service. AT&amp;T reiterated that it is on track to surpass 30 million fiber-optic internet subscribers by the end of 2025. But that forecast is based on interest rate hikes ending in the near term. T stock is down 11% over the last 12 months.Visa (V)a keyboard with a greet enter key marked sell, representing overvalued stocks to sellSource: ShutterstockCredit card giant Visa (NYSE:V) reported strong first-quarter earnings driven by spending on international travel. But can that last as interest rates rise and the global economy slows? Visa said that its Q1 outperformance was due to an acceleration of global travel, with cross-border volumes on its credit cards up 24% from a year earlier. The company said it is benefitting as consumers around the world travel more after two years of Covid-19 lockdowns. Overall volume on Visa’s credit cards rose 9% to $3.6 trillion during Q1.While Visa didn’t warn of an immediate slowdown in worldwide travel, most economists (and the World Bank) are forecasting that higher rates will tip the global economy into a recession this year. Should that happen, it will no doubt hit the travel industry and ding credit card issuers such as Visa. While Visa has remained resilient so far, its business could face a downturn in this year’s second half, notably during the summer travel season. Visa’s stock has risen 9% in the last 12 months.Intel (INTC)sell written on a chalkboard representing overvalued stocks to sellSource: ShutterstockThere are a lot of reasons to sell Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). After all, the company did just report the biggest loss in its 55-year history for this year’s first quarter. However, Intel is borrowing so much money right now as it spends more than $20 billion to reposition its chip factories as foundries that higher interest rates are sure to be a drag on its balance sheet. Companies taking out loans to fund growth are particularly vulnerable to higher rates.Intel is already struggling, announcing a 133% annual reduction in its Q1 earnings per share and reporting that its revenue in Q1 fell 36% from a year earlier to $11.7 billion. Worse, the company forecast that it will lose 4 cents a share on revenue of $12 billion in the current second quarter, below Wall Street expectations. This year’s Q1 marked the fifth consecutive quarter of falling sales at Intel. The company is being hurt by declining sales of personal computers that use its chips and semiconductors, which has been prompted by high-interest rates.INTC stock is down 32% in the past year.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole held long positions in BAC and V.

This article explores the best monthly dividend stocks for 2023 and explains their benefits, including long-term capital appreciation.These stocks offer a steadier flow of income, which benefits retirement-age investors who prefer frequent distributions. They also generally provide a significant income stream.A select group of monthly dividend stocks pays dividends at a rate of 10% or higher. Those are the ones on this list. Investors should be aware of the risks involved, such as share price fluctuations and payout rate disruptions that can change the yield in the future.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsDespite these risks, some investors may be willing to pursue big and reliable paydays. If that’s the case, here are three monthly dividend stocks worth considering.Oxford Square Capital (OXSQ)Graphic of side view of virtual financial charts with tech aesthetic, symbolizing fintechSource: shutterstock.com/whiteMoccaOxford Square Capital (NASDAQ:OXSQ) functions as a business development company. To generate returns, it focuses on private equity investments, mezzanine financing, and senior and junior debt offerings.Oxford Square focuses on investing in companies that are not too big or small, with annual revenues of less than $200 million. These companies are significant enough to be serious concerns but not too small to obtain financing at local bank branches.Oxford Square’s BDC is a particularly attractive option if economic disruptions subside and inflation and supply chain disruptions are controlled. Such conditions are conducive to growth for monthly dividend stocks.OXSQ stock has a dividend yield of 14.1% as of this writing.San Juan Basin Royalty Trust (SJT)miniature oil barrel and oil well figures on top of stack of moneySource: ShutterstockBefore investing in San Juan Basin Royalty Trust (NYSE:SJT), take a moment to evaluate it.SJT is valued at around $328 million, and its investments are in the fixed reserves of fossil fuels. Returns come from the extraction and sale of oil and gas. SJT has brought a significant portion of its reserves to market, benefiting from favorable energy prices. However, oil prices have been dropping recently, which may impact future yields.Story continuesIt is important to remember that oil prices fluctuate, and SJT’s yields may not always remain at the same level. If oil prices remain firm and the San Juan Basin reserves are ample, SJT may provide a double-digit yield via monthly dividends. However, all forms of investment carry inherent risks.At the time of writing, SJT stock has a dividend yield of 18.2%.SL Green Realty Corp (SLG)Group of colleagues discuss something in an office conference room.Source: GaudiLab / ShutterstockSL Green Realty Corp (NYSE:SLG) is a major player in the Manhattan office market with a diversified portfolio of 60 buildings totaling 33.1 million square feet. SLG, as a real estate investment trust (or REIT), must distribute 90% of its taxable income to shareholders, resulting in regular dividend payments.While SL Green’s monthly payout has decreased slightly from just under 32 cents per share earlier in 2022 to about 27 cents currently, the annualized yield remains significant. Therefore, it becomes a compelling alternative for investors searching for steady cash flow.SL Green also has a solid track record and a diversified portfolio in one of the world’s most coveted real estate markets. This makes it a strong candidate for investors seeking regular income streams through monthly dividend stocks.At the time of writing, SLG stock has a dividend yield of 15.1%.With that said, if you want to continue reading about dividend stocks, you are in luck.

The markets have been mostly on tenterhooks as investors remained worried about another financial banking crisis after the collapse of two other mid-sized banks, namely Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. Although JPMorgan Chase acquired First Republic Bank to avert a similar banking catastrophe, the market sentiments largely trended down.However, the shares of regional banks shrugged off the pessimism and witnessed an uptrend to buoy the overall market swing. In addition, strong iPhone sales and key inroads in India and other emerging markets helped Apple to record solid quarterly earnings results. The latest data from Labor Department's job report further revealed that non-farm payrolls increased by 253,000 in April compared with broad-based expectations of a rise of 180,000. Wages increased 4.4% year over year in April after climbing 4.3% in March, while the unemployment rate fell to 3.4%.With improving job market conditions and softening inflationary pressures, investors largely expect the Fed to hold the interest rates in the near term. Moreover, the Fed indicated earlier that there might be just another hike in the current year depending on the macroeconomic factors, as tightening credit conditions could put pressure on the economy.As investors employ a wait-and-see approach in a classic example of “backing and filling” in the market, they can benefit from “cash cow” stocks that garner higher returns. However, identifying cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless it is backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting cash at a high rate of return. Marriott International, Inc. MAR, DICK'S Sporting Goods, Inc. DKS, D.R. Horton, Inc. DHI, ON Semiconductor Corporation ON and Triton International Limited TRTN are some of the stocks with high ROE to profit from.Story continuesROE: A Key MetricROE = Net Income/Shareholders’ EquityROE helps investors distinguish profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify companies that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.Moreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry — the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management’s efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.Screening ParametersIn order to shortlist stocks that are cash-rich with high ROE, we have added Cash Flow greater than $1 billion and ROE greater than X-Industry as our primary screening parameters. In addition, we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy.Price/Cash Flow lesser than X-Industry: This metric measures how much investors pay for $1 of free cash flow. A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow-generating stock.Return on Assets (ROA) greater than X-Industry: This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset, which includes cash, accounts receivable, property, equipment, inventory and furniture.

There was a new note out from JPMorgan Chase. Now, the banking giant turning bullish on American Airlines, upgrading the airline to overweight from neutral while raising its price target to 29 bucks from $26 a share. Now saying in this note, quote, ""it's now the larger airlines that control the high ground.""And Akiko, when we take a look at American specifically and what JPMorgan liked about American, they mentioned the revenue guides, the margin improvement, the fact that the company posted a $10 million profit last quarter. Revenue was up 37%. A lot of that strength, Akiko, coming from the demand to travel internationally as we do see more and more COVID restrictions lifted worldwide. People are back out. They want to travel international. And we're seeing that reflected not only in American's plans, but from a number of its competitors as well.- Yeah. I mean, when you think about where JPMorgan is coming in overweight, they were already overweight the other carriers. So American Airlines just joining the pack here. But really is about the domestic versus international. Obviously, the discount carriers don't have that. So we are seeing that dynamics shift in a big way.You talk about the debt picture for American Airlines. Significant improvement on that front. 60% on their way to completing its goal of cutting debt by $15 billion by the end of 2025. JPMorgan saying in this note that, yes, that's a good thing. It doesn't mean that things are fixed. But they are on track here at a quicker rate in terms of addressing that debt.- Yeah. Certainly. And we can see, obviously, JP Morgan, they're not alone in the optimistic view that they have for a number of the larger carriers here in the US. But, Akiko, also on this note, JP Morgan didn't really have the same rosy picture, or outlook, I should say, for some of those discount airlines, particularly you're looking at Southwest. They downgraded that stock to neutral from overweight. Also reduced their price target to 39 bucks a share from 64. Southwest shares hovering near the flatline. Less than an hour here to go before the bell. Off just about 2/10 of a percent. They also downgraded Frontier as well, just saying that the path forward here is a little bit less clear for some of those discount airlines.Story continues- Yeah. I mean, Southwest, of course, coming off of a bumpy-- no pun intended really here, but a bumpy ride for that airline when we're talking about delays and challenges with travelers. So that's already, in some ways, we've already seen that weigh on the stock. But when you think about how things are shaping up for the summer, Seana, we keep hearing that there is really this demand, that consumers are still willing to shell out money for that big summer travel. It's going to be interesting to me to watch.I mean, we're obviously seeing where the note is saying that they think international demand is continuing to stay strong. I mean, those tickets, I don't know if you've been searching, but they are not cheap. I'd be curious to see how much, to what extent that demand continues, especially in the face of inflation.- Yeah, Akiko. I'm so happy you brought that up because it has certainly been astonishing. We're talking about the fact that Americans are facing higher prices in nearly every aspect on their lives. They're pulling back in many situations on their discretionary spending. When you take a look at airfares, they're up, what, about 30% still on a year over year basis. Those international flights are very, very expensive. So I would not be shocked if some people are forced to, unfortunately, maybe change their travel plans over the coming months, given the fact that inflation remains so sticky.]"

Start your free 7-day trial to get on board.According to the firm, the upgrade is based on recent comments from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and other third-party consumption models, which indicate that the optimization headwinds experienced by the group over the last 9 months are stabilizing. With easing comps in H2/23, the firm expects Snowflake's revenue growth to stabilize in the high 30% range. Additionally, the firm anticipates that management's discipline will continue to drive margins and FCF significantly higher.The company is set to report its Q1 earnings on May 25.American Airlines upgraded to Overweight JPMorgan upgraded American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) to Overweight from Neutral and raised its price target to $29.00 from $26.00. Shares gained 3% today.According to the firm, American Airlines has made commendable progress in reducing its debt burden (60% of its way to reducing its total debt by $15 billion by the end of 2025) and its current valuation is too attractive to ignore, despite the stock trading 35% below its debt peak in Q2/21.2 more picksFortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT) shares rose 2% today after BofA Securities upgraded the company to Buy from Neutral and raised its price target to $75.00 from $66.00.The new price target is based on a premium to cybersecurity peers, but the firm added that it “is warranted given the company’s strong fundamentals.”The firm noted that despite concerns of weak orders being masked by backlog drawdowns, Fortinet's trends are robust and the company continues to deliver high value to its customers. The firm believes that the strong business momentum offsets concerns regarding backlog drawdowns.Story continuesThe company reported its Q1 results on Thursday, with EPS and revenues coming in better than the consensus estimates.Wells Fargo initiated coverage on Stagwell (NASDAQ:STGW) with an Overweight rating and a price target of $9.00.

398,cd51b779-602c-374b-b4fa-8586fce463da,AAL,2023-05-09,5 Broker-Friendly Stocks to Sail Through the Turbulent Scenario,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-broker-friendly-stocks-sail-113611648.html,1683545771,STORY,"['DAL', 'CVGI', 'AAL', 'AVT', 'CLF']","[The ongoing Q1 earnings season has thrown up a stable picture. According to our latest Earnings Outlook, 77.6% of the S&amp;P 500 companies have surpassed EPS estimates. This is highly reassuring, especially in the current scenario, which is engulfed by inflationary woes and other headwinds. What is all the more encouraging is that many companies, which have already reported their respective Q1 numbers, have issued better-than-expected guidance.Given this backdrop, investors would like to add outperformers to their respective portfolios for healthy returns.However, the task is far from easy with a plethora of companies present in the market. Moreover, the complexities related to the stock market and the prevalent turbulence make it even more difficult for individual investors to select outperformers in their portfolios without proper handholding. One way to proceed is by paying heed to broker advice. We believe that broker-favorite stocks like American Airlines AAL, Delta Air Lines DAL, Cleveland-Cliff CLF, Avnet AVT and Commercial Vehicle Group CVGI should be on an investors’ watchlist.Why Broker Advice Holds ValueBrokers have a better understanding of stocks, deeper knowledge of the industry and a grasp over the broader economy. They scrutinize the company’s fundamentals and place them against the prevalent economic scenario to find out how attractive a stock is or otherwise as an investment option.Since brokers arrive at their recommendation (buy, sell or hold) on a stock after thoroughly analyzing the nitty-gritty associated with the company, it is advisable for investors to be guided by the direction of estimate revisions while deciding their course of action on a particular stock. The estimate revisions serve as an important pointer regarding the price of a stock. Estimates can move north for a number of reasons – favorable earnings performance, a bullish guidance, product launch or any favorable macro scenario.Story continuesOne of the well-accepted investment strategies is to maintain a diversified portfolio to generate handsome returns irrespective of market conditions. For instance, in the face of extremely low oil prices, analysts adopt a bullish stance on airline stocks and consequently raise estimates.  Naturally, adding such stocks to one’s portfolio in such a scenario might prove to be a bullish strategy.Formulating a Winning PortfolioWe have designed a screener to arrive at stocks based on improving analyst recommendations and upward earnings estimate revisions over the last four weeks. However, considering only these factors does not make our strategy foolproof as the top line has not been considered.Actually, according to many market watchers, a top-line outperformance is more creditable for a company than a mere earnings outperformance. To address top-line concerns, we have included the price/sales ratio in our screener, which serves as a strong complementary valuation metric.Screening Criteria# (Up-Down Rating)/ Total (4 weeks) =Top #75: This gives the list of top 75 companies that have witnessed net upgrades over the last 4 weeks.% change in Q (1) est. (4 weeks) = Top #10: This gives the top 10 stocks that have witnessed earnings estimate revisions over the past 4 weeks for the upcoming quarter.Price-to-Sales = Bot%10: The lower the ratio, the better. Companies meeting this criterion are in the bottom 10% of our universe of over 7,700 stocks.Price greater than 5: A stock trading below $5 will not likely be of significant interest to most investors.Average Daily Volume greater than 100,000 shares over the last 20 trading days: Volume has to be significant to ensure that these are easily traded.Market value ($ mil) = Top #3000: This gives us stocks that are the top 3000 in terms of market capitalization.Com/ADR/Canadian= Com: This takes out the ADR and Canadian stocks.Here are five of the 10 stocks that passed the screen test:American Airlines is based in Fort Worth, TX. The gradual increase in air-travel demand (particularly for leisure) is aiding AAL. However, high fuel costs are hurting the bottom line.Over the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for AAL’s 2023 earnings has been revised 17.3% upward.

DAL is being bolstered by an uptick in demand for air travel (particularly for leisure). Driven by higher air-travel demand, total revenues increased 36.5% on a year-over-year basis in first-quarter 2023.High fuel costs are, however, a bane. Over the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for DAL’s 2023 earnings has been revised 3.1% upward.Cleveland-Cliffs is a leading iron ore producer in the United States. It supplies differentiated iron ore pellets under long-term contracts to major blast furnace steel producers in North America. The Mining and Pelletizing operation gains from low-cost, high-quality iron ore pellet production with substantial logistics and transportation advantages to serve the Great Lakes steel market. The company should gain from its merger with AK Steel Holding Corporation.Over the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for CLF’s 2023 earnings has been revised 21.9% upward. Cleveland-Cliffs currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.Avnet is benefiting from robust demand for its products across Asia, Europe, the Middle East and Africa regions. Improvement in the Americas also served as a tailwind. Its continued focus on boosting IoT capabilities is helping it expand in the newer markets and win customers.

399,b7e8e0e0-011c-3c5f-a2ee-b6bff34b500a,AFL,2023-05-09,Aflac (AFL) Could Be a Great Choice,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/aflac-afl-could-great-choice-154503473.html,1683560703,STORY,['AFL'],"[All investors love getting big returns from their portfolio, whether it's through stocks, bonds, ETFs, or other types of securities. However, when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.Cash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns.Aflac in FocusHeadquartered in Columbus, Aflac (AFL) is a Finance stock that has seen a price change of -6.05% so far this year. Currently paying a dividend of $0.42 per share, the company has a dividend yield of 2.49%. In comparison, the Insurance - Accident and Health industry's yield is 2.44%, while the S&amp;P 500's yield is 1.74%.Looking at dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $1.68 is up 5% from last year. In the past five-year period, Aflac has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 11.72%. Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company's payout ratio; a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Aflac's current payout ratio is 30%, meaning it paid out 30% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.AFL is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $5.74 per share, with earnings expected to increase 7.69% from the year ago period.Bottom LineInvestors like dividends for many reasons; they greatly improve stock investing profits, decrease overall portfolio risk, and carry tax advantages, among others. It's important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout.Story continuesFor instance, it's a rare occurrence when a tech start-up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend. It's more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends. Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, AFL is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Also known as Consumer Confidence Reports, these reports are annual performance measures of the drinking water supplied by Pennsylvania American Water in comparison to the compliance standards established by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection.""We encourage our customers to review the latest reports and see for themselves that we continue to supply clean, safe water to their taps,"" said Brandy Braun, director of water quality and environmental compliance at Pennsylvania American Water.

But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.Veolia Environnement SA has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), while American Water Works has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now. This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that VEOEY is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.VEOEY currently has a forward P/E ratio of 8.41, while AWK has a forward P/E of 31.13. We also note that VEOEY has a PEG ratio of 0.72. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. AWK currently has a PEG ratio of 3.78.Another notable valuation metric for VEOEY is its P/B ratio of 1.32. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, AWK has a P/B of 3.03.Based on these metrics and many more, VEOEY holds a Value grade of A, while AWK has a Value grade of D.Story continuesVEOEY has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than AWK, so it seems like value investors will conclude that VEOEY is the superior option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Here's how much to save This is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home A recent conversation between Fortune’s Phil Wahba and PepsiCo’s CHRO Ronald Schellekens caught my attention. Schellekens shared that PepsiCo has never—and as far as he’s concerned, will never—waver on its unique commitment to hiring 2,000 U.S. graduates each year. Cut to my immediate reaction: In this economy? The conversation, part of an exclusive Fortune Connect panel, detailed how the food and beverage juggernaut stays true to its “people as assets” approach. “Many companies invest in management and leadership training, but few do it as systematically as PepsiCo,” wrote Phil in his December feature detailing the food and beverage giant's leadership development strategy.Though hiring 2,000 graduates annually is not a formalized commitment in writing, Schellekens says it's necessary for building a robust talent pipeline. “That requires, I think, a kind of institutionalized culture where we say, 'Okay, this is the belief of the company. This is how we build leaders for the future.'”Many of today's Fortune 500 CEOs had career pit stops at PepsiCo. There's Brian Cornell at Target, Lauren Hobart at Dick’s Sporting Goods, and Dave Kimbell at Ulta Beauty, to name a few. In total, 16 current Fortune 500 CEOs have previously worked at PepsiCo.“Our early hiring programs are vital to this effort of building a pipeline, and we’re proud that we’ve been tracking roughly the same number over at least the past two recruitment cycles,” shared a spokesperson for PepsiCo. “This is purely based on hiring needs and the belief in our college [and] university hiring programs.”PepsiCo's approach to internal career growth has earned it the reputation of a ""talent academy,"" and it's always assessing workers' potential, Schellekens says. “We don’t like it when people leave our company and become CHRO or CEO of another company, but they always leave us for much bigger jobs...They always make a big jump.”Story continuesAmber Burtonamber.burton@fortune.com@amberbburtonEditor’s Note: Do you utilize A.I. in your people practice?

(NYSE:AMP) lost 3.8% last week but have reaped the benefits of longer-term growth",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/institutional-investors-ameriprise-financial-inc-120023347.html,1683547223,STORY,['AMP'],"[Key InsightsInstitutions' substantial holdings in Ameriprise Financial implies that they have significant influence over the company's share priceThe top 15 shareholders own 50% of the company Recent sales by insiders A look at the shareholders of Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (NYSE:AMP) can tell us which group is most powerful. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 86% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).No shareholder likes losing money on their investments, especially institutional investors who saw their holdings drop 3.8% in value last week. However, the 14% one-year return to shareholders may have helped lessen their pain. We would assume however, that they would be on the lookout for weakness in the future.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Ameriprise Financial. See our latest analysis for Ameriprise Financial ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Ameriprise Financial?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.Ameriprise Financial already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Ameriprise Financial's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Ameriprise Financial. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 13%. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 8.6% of common stock, and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. holds about 4.7% of the company stock.Story continuesA closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 15 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Ameriprise FinancialThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Ameriprise Financial, Inc.. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$122m worth of shares. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 13% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Case in point: We've spotted   2 warning signs for Ameriprise Financial  you should be aware of.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do.

Interest rates in America are now at their highest level in 16 years. While higher rates might tame inflation in the long run, they are likely to slow the economy in the near term and cause problems for certain companies. As such, investors should position their portfolios to defend against the negative consequences of a high-interest rate environment, and consider these seven top stocks to sell.PACWPacWest Bancorp$3.50GPSGap$8.27PGProcter &amp; Gamble$155.24TSLATesla$161.23TAT&amp;T$16.88VVisa$225.17INTCIntel$31.26Stocks to Sell: PacWest Bancorp (PACW)Death: grim reaper in black cloakSource: ShutterstockWith higher interest rates, we could see another bank failure. On the shortlist of banks that might also fail is PacWest Bancorp (NASDAQ:PACW), whose share price has fallen more than 30% since May 1 as investors and traders assume that the lender is on shaky ground.While major lenders such as JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) appear largely immune to the current turmoil in the banking sector, mid-size regional lenders like PacWest Bancorp continue to be vulnerable. Trading in PACW stock has been so volatile recently that it has been halted several times. PacWest recently reported a Q1 earnings beat and that its deposits remain stable. But until the Fed stops raising interest rates, regional lenders such as PacWest will remain under a cloud. PACW stock has fallen 79% in the last 12 months.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsStocks to Sell: Gap (GPS)A white clock indicates it's time to sell.Source: ShutterstockClothing retailers such as Gap (NYSE:GPS) take it on the chin when interest rates rise and the economy slows. This is because consumers view clothing such as the items sold at Gap as discretionary and tend to put off spending on those products when times get tough. This reality has certainly been reflected in earnings at Gap, which have disappointed over multiple quarters. The current high-interest rate environment has proven to be a double whammy for The Gap, coming after two years of pandemic restrictions at its stores.Story continuesGap is trying to right its ship, announcing staff layoffs and a shake-up in its executive ranks. But the retailer is likely to continue struggling while interest rates remain high and consumers struggle to balance their budgets. The pressure exerted by higher interest rates, coupled with slowing sales and poor financial results, have pushed GPS stock 32% lower in the last year. The company’s share price is now down nearly 70% over the past five years.Stocks to Sell: Procter &amp; Gamble (PG)little girl holding a stock chart with athumbs down. stocks to avoidSource: ShutterstockOn their recent earnings call, executives at U.S. consumer products giant Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE:PG) acknowledged they can only raise prices so far in the current environment before consumers start to look for cheaper alternatives. The company, whose brands include Tide, Gillette, and Febreze reported that its sales volumes fell 3% in this year’s first quarter as price-sensitive consumers opted for cheaper items.The decrease in sales volumes at Procter &amp; Gamble was offset by price increases that averaged 10% on its various items. But executives said that further price increases are likely to be limited. With interest rates rising further, consumers are even less likely to splash out for Gillette razors when they can buy a cheaper, generic version. Procter &amp; Gamble has now reported four consecutive quarters of declining sales volumes. All of its divisions reported lower sales in Q1, except for its health and beauty unit. The decline is likely to worsen. PG stock is flat over the last 12 months, up only a slight 0.64%.Tesla (TSLA)a frustrated man with a white board behind him that features a black downward arrowSource: ShutterstockConsumers these days are sensitive to the interest rates charged on loans, especially when those loans are used for big-ticket purchases such as a new vehicle. And loans just got more expensive after the Fed took interest rates in the U.S. to a 16-year high. This helps to explain why Tesla’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) sales have been falling, impacting both the company’s earnings and its stock. Shares of the electric vehicle maker tanked 8% recently after the company reported a 24% year-over-year decline in its Q1 net income.On an earnings call to announce the poor results, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said he sees an “uncertain” economic environment and expects 12 months of “stormy weather” ahead for the automaker. To try and kickstart sales, Tesla has been aggressively cutting prices on its electric vehicles in jurisdictions all over the world. Tesla said it expects to produce 1.8 million vehicles this year, with the possibility of hitting a two million production milestone, depending on demand. TSLA stock is down 46% over the last 12 months.AT&amp;T (T)earningsSource: ShutterstockDifficult economic times and rising interest rates force consumers to prioritize essentials such as food and shelter and cut back on other items such as high-speed internet. This is largely why AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) recently reported abysmal quarterly results that caused its share price to fall 10%, marking the biggest one-day drop in T stock since the technology bubble burst in December 2000. Poor subscriber numbers jumped off the company’s earnings sheet.AT&amp;T reported that it added 424,000 regular monthly wireless subscribers in Q1 of this year, which was nearly 40% fewer than the company added a year earlier. It blamed the lower subscriber numbers on high inflation and rising interest rates, which, the company said, made consumers reluctant to spend money on 5G wireless service. AT&amp;T reiterated that it is on track to surpass 30 million fiber-optic internet subscribers by the end of 2025. But that forecast is based on interest rate hikes ending in the near term. T stock is down 11% over the last 12 months.Visa (V)a keyboard with a greet enter key marked sell, representing overvalued stocks to sellSource: ShutterstockCredit card giant Visa (NYSE:V) reported strong first-quarter earnings driven by spending on international travel. But can that last as interest rates rise and the global economy slows? Visa said that its Q1 outperformance was due to an acceleration of global travel, with cross-border volumes on its credit cards up 24% from a year earlier. The company said it is benefitting as consumers around the world travel more after two years of Covid-19 lockdowns. Overall volume on Visa’s credit cards rose 9% to $3.6 trillion during Q1.While Visa didn’t warn of an immediate slowdown in worldwide travel, most economists (and the World Bank) are forecasting that higher rates will tip the global economy into a recession this year. Should that happen, it will no doubt hit the travel industry and ding credit card issuers such as Visa. While Visa has remained resilient so far, its business could face a downturn in this year’s second half, notably during the summer travel season. Visa’s stock has risen 9% in the last 12 months.Intel (INTC)sell written on a chalkboard representing overvalued stocks to sellSource: ShutterstockThere are a lot of reasons to sell Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). After all, the company did just report the biggest loss in its 55-year history for this year’s first quarter. However, Intel is borrowing so much money right now as it spends more than $20 billion to reposition its chip factories as foundries that higher interest rates are sure to be a drag on its balance sheet. Companies taking out loans to fund growth are particularly vulnerable to higher rates.Intel is already struggling, announcing a 133% annual reduction in its Q1 earnings per share and reporting that its revenue in Q1 fell 36% from a year earlier to $11.7 billion. Worse, the company forecast that it will lose 4 cents a share on revenue of $12 billion in the current second quarter, below Wall Street expectations. This year’s Q1 marked the fifth consecutive quarter of falling sales at Intel. The company is being hurt by declining sales of personal computers that use its chips and semiconductors, which has been prompted by high-interest rates.INTC stock is down 32% in the past year.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole held long positions in BAC and V.

Therefore, investors should pay special attention to the fundamentals of these stocks before purchasing them.On the other hand, some of these stocks may have been punished unjustly due to temporary headwinds. As a result, they may be offering high return potential. In this article, we will discuss the prospects of three high-yield stocks that are trading under $10 and offering yields above 5%.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWhitestone REIT (WSR)Real estate investment trust REIT on an office desk.Source: Vitalii Vodolazskyi / ShutterstockWhitestone REIT (NYSE:WSR) is a commercial real estate investment trust (REIT) that acquires, owns, manages, develops and redevelops properties it believes to be e-commerce resistant in metropolitan areas with high rates of population growth. The trust currently owns 57 properties with approximately 5.1 million square feet of gross leasable area.The properties of Whitestone are located primarily in Phoenix and Houston, with smaller allocations to other major cities in Texas. These areas have favorable demographics, such as income and economic growth. Whitestone believes that its investment properties are resistant to the threat of e-commerce thanks to the essential goods they provide.Between 2012 and 2015, Whitestone acquired 2.465 million square feet of gross leasable area. Between 2016 and 2019, the REIT acquired 0.778 million square feet of gross leasable area. The decline in acquisitions is due in part to a focus on deleveraging. The leverage ratio (net debt to EBITDA) of the REIT currently stands at seven, which is excessive.Management believes that post-pandemic investments in acquisitions, re-development and development projects can drive returns of at least 10%. Nevertheless, due to the ongoing deleverage process, we expect the REIT to grow its funds from operations (FFO) per unit by 3% per year on average over the next five years.Story continuesWhitestone has provided lackluster guidance for this year. It expects 2.5%-4.5% growth of same-store net operating income and FFO per share of 95-99 cents. The REIT forecasts an ending occupancy of about 94% and potentially higher bad debt of 0.75%-1.50% of revenue (versus 0.83% in 2022). It also forecasts general and administrative expense to rise by about 8% and interest expense to rise 19% due to the adverse environment of rising interest rates.Due to the impact of high interest rates on the interest expense of the REIT, the stock has declined 31% over the last 12 months. As a result, it is currently trading at a nearly 10-year low price-to-FFO ratio of 9.5, which is much lower than the five-year average of 11.4.Moreover, Whitestone is offering a 5.3% dividend yield with a healthy payout ratio of 49%. The company had maintained a payout ratio above 100% for several years in a row. Thus, it was forced to cut its dividend by 63% in 2020 due to the coronavirus crisis. However, the reduced dividend has a meaningful margin of safety thanks to the decent payout ratio. Overall, Whitestone is attractively valued right now. Whenever interest rates begin to decrease, the stock is likely to highly reward patient investors.Gladstone Capital CorporationBusiness Development Company BDC concept is shown by businessman.Source: wsf-s / Shutterstock.comGladstone Capital Corporation (NASDAQ:GLAD) is a business development company (BDC) that invests primarily in small and medium businesses. These investments are made via a variety of equity (10% of portfolio) and debt instruments (90% of portfolio), generally with very high yields. Loan size is typically in the range of $7 million to $30 million and have terms of up to seven years. The stated purpose of the company is to generate income it can distribute to its shareholders. It offers its distributions on a monthly basis.The BDC sector is characterized by intense competition. Therefore, Gladstone does not possess any competitive advantages. In addition, the company is vulnerable to recessions, as some of its borrowers are likely to face liquidity issues during adverse economic periods. Indeed, Gladstone slashed its dividend during the Great Recession and has not restored it to that level yet.Moreover, Gladstone is highly dependent upon funding costs and the spreads it can earn on its debt and equity investments. As the company borrows funds based on short-term interest rates, the steep increase in short-term interest rates since early last year has formed a headwind for the company. Nevertheless, Gladstone has maintained decent business performance so far.Gladstone has exhibited markedly stable performance over the last nine years. The consistent business performance is admirable for a company that belongs to the BDC sector. On the other hand, Gladstone has grown its earnings per share by only 0.7% per year on average over the last nine years. Therefore, it is prudent for investors to keep their growth expectations at a minimum.On the other hand, GLAD stock has become remarkably cheap in recent months. The stock has shed 25% over the last 12 months due to the strong business headwinds facing the company, namely an adverse environment of high interest rates and an economy that has greatly decelerated and may even fall into a recession. As a result, the stock is currently offering a nearly 10-year high dividend yield of 10.1%.As BDCs distribute most of their earnings in the form of dividends, the payout ratio of 86% of Gladstone is reasonable for a BDC. However, the high payout ratio of Gladstone and its sensitivity to recessions render the dividend of the stock vulnerable. Nevertheless, thanks to its consistent performance record, Gladstone is attractive from a long-term perspective. In the absence of a severe recession, the company is likely to highly reward investors off its depressed stock price whenever interest rates begin to normalize.The Gap (GPS)A close-up view of a Gap (GPS) sign in the window of a Los Angeles, California mall.Source: Alex Millauer / Shutterstock.comThe Gap (NYSE:GPS) is an American clothing and accessories retailer with 3,380 store locations in more than 40 countries. The company was founded in 1982 and operates six business lines: Gap, Banana Republic, Old Navy, Intermix, Hill City and Athleta.Despite the popularity of its brands, Gap has incurred a collapse in its earnings over the last decade due to cut-throat competition. During this period, its sales have decreased only 3%, but its operating margins have become extremely thin due to competition. As a result, the company has switched from earnings per share of $2.33 in 2012 to a loss per share of -40 cents last year.Even worse, The Gap is currently facing a perfect storm due to the surge of inflation to sky-high levels. Inflation has greatly reduced the real purchasing power of consumers. Hence, it has taken its toll on consumer spending. As a result, The Gap has provided guidance for a low- to mid-single digit decrease in sales this year. In addition, the surge of inflation has greatly increased the operating costs of the company. It is thus easy to understand why the stock has slumped 70% off its peak almost two years ago.The Gap is currently offering a nearly 10-year high dividend yield of 6.2%, but its payout ratio is exceptionally high, at 102%. Given also the current business headwinds and the challenges that were facing the company even before the surge of inflation, the prospects of the company are uncertain. If The Gap experiences a recovery in its business, the stock will probably rally, but it is highly risky and speculative. Therefore, it is suitable only for risk-tolerant traders. The vast underperformance of the stock over the last five years (-66% vs. +55% of the S&amp;P 500) is a testament to the excessive risk of the stock.On the date of publication, Bob Ciura did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

She has led development efforts within national and global nonprofits, the University of California, and the California Department of Food and Agriculture. After focusing the majority of her career on food systems and food waste, she made a slight pivot in 2021 to center on climate solutions in general, understanding that diversification is the best strategy for addressing our climate crisis. Nicole believes in the power of collective action and the relationships we build to create systemic change. She loves spending time outside with her sons, skiing, climbing, surfing, and gardening.Rooted to the EarthGrowing up in rural Maine, I spent much of my childhood exploring the outdoors with my family - scrambling on rocks and exploring tidal pools on the coast, skiing, hiking, and swimming in the mountains. Being outside with friends and family was an integral part of how I grew up. These experiences instilled in me a true love for our Earth and the people on it, which is why I chose to focus my work on sustainability and climate solutions.My passion for philanthropy was greatly influenced by my parents, both of whom worked in hospitals mainly helping underserved communities. They were my role models in turning to nonprofit work. I remember a specific moment when I was 12 years old and did ""take your daughter to work day"" with my dad, who was a physician at a hospital for military veterans. I was in awe of how he went above and beyond to help people. While I didn't follow his path into medicine, I chose the nonprofit path, which is in line with the type of work that he did to help people and causes that don't normally get prioritized.Story continuesI have focused the majority of my career on sustainable food systems and in recent years the power of food waste as a climate solution. While researching, I discovered the book Drawdown edited by Paul Hawken, which identifies 93 technologies and practices that dramatically reduce concentrations of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere. Instead of getting depressed, I became inspired and excited for what humans could do with technology. I felt I had to pivot my career to focus on climate solutions in general. With the power of technology and community, we can come together to make a difference and solve the most pressing problem of our time.Hope for the FutureThis is why I still feel hope even after the release of the most recent report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). I see transitioning the global workforce into climate-related careers as the most impactful method to deploying a myriad of solutions to drastically cut greenhouse gasses.Work on Climate, where I am the Director of Fundraising, is a nonprofit organization building the workforce needed to solve climate change equitably and justly. Our vision is one where climate work is no longer siloed among enthusiasts but becomes mainstream, with the entire global talent pipeline (schools, job boards, conferences etc.) giving hundreds of millions of workers the skills and direction to participate in building the new green economy. As a member of this network, I am part of a movement of professionals creating a talent ecosystem poised to address the urgent need for climate solutions, and this brings me hope.Our mission began when our co-founders, Eugene and Cass, left their dream jobs at Google to pursue work that aligned with their values and concerns about the climate crisis. To guide their journey, they built a Slack community of similarly minded climate jobseekers and founders. After Eugene's farewell message went viral, the community exploded. Clearly their experience resonated with others and suddenly, they were talking to hundreds of people saying, ""I want to work on climate, but I don't know where to start, or if I'm even needed.""Building a Community to Address the Climate CrisisWe are now 20,000+ members strong, with people from all walks of life: from students to executives and artists to chemical engineers, spread all over the globe. Member experience is curated based on jobs, roles, topics, and geographies so users find the right information for their climate job needs. We also coordinate community events and mentorship programs, ensuring we are effective in helping members find climate work. We estimate that we have aided over 2,000 people find climate jobs and employees, start climate companies, meet mentors, investors, LPs, advisors, customers, and more. We have also helped countless others feel positively connected to peers experiencing similar climate anxiety.However, helping a few thousand people will not deploy solutions at the scale we need. We need to make the entire talent ecosystem climate-ready, and our research shows that the current system is ill-equipped to prepare individuals for climate work at the necessary scale. We need a movement to make this happen.The Work on Climate community represents the foundation of our movement. Through these relationships, we are building partnerships with organizations best fit to make large changes across industries: schools, job boards, government bodies, conferences, industry associations, and so on. These initial partnerships will create blueprints for ways in which other organizations can support the climate workforce. Our efforts also aim to eliminate silos by making the transition top of mind to both climate and mainstream workforce organizations.And we have been successful!With the help of our community members in our #topic-ai community, we partnered with Predictive Analytics World (PAW), a major machine learning conference, to run PAW Climate - a conference on the commercial applications of machine learning for climate solutions, thus bringing climate solutions to the attention of the mainstream machine learning workforce.With the help of our #role-student community, we are bringing a series of seminars with climate founders explaining their business models to UPenn business school students in partnership with Penn Climate Ventures.We completed a research project to understand the barriers for active climate jobseekers and are now conducting the next project, focused on understanding the barriers stopping the general population from becoming climate jobseekers, in partnership with Terra.do and PureSpectrum.Work on Climate's impact is not just measured by the number of individuals we have helped find climate work, but in the millions of people who will need to transition into climate-related careers to solve the climate crisis. By building a movement in the talent ecosystem, we aim to enlist the help of organizations that have the ability to reach more people. With this collective action, we can bring hundreds of millions of people into careers focused on inventing and deploying climate solutions in every industry.I am inspired by the boundless potential of human ingenuity and the belief that we can solve the most pressing problems of our time. We are looking to make an impact that will help ensure a sustainable future for generations to come. If you share the passion for climate solutions and want to join Work on Climate in building a climate-ready talent ecosystem, we invite you to learn more about our work and to get involved. Together, we can make a difference.View original content here.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Cisco Systems Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Cisco Systems Inc.Website: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/cisco-systems-incEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Cisco Systems Inc.View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/753428/Work-on-Climate-Creating-a-Talent-Ecosystem-To-Address-the-Urgent-Need-for-Climate-Solutions]"
