Verisk (Nasdaq: VRSK), a leading global data analytics and technology provider, is expanding its anti-fraud claims solution with artificial intelligence that will enable insurers to identify potential fraud in claims photos with lightning speed and laser precision.Drawing on millions of claims images in Verisk’s databases, including the loss history database ClaimSearch®, the image forensics solution analyzes every image submitted as part of a claim to detect indicators of fraud. Without any human intervention, the solution automatically flags photos that have been altered, manipulated or downloaded from the internet. Using ClaimSearch, Verisk’s solution also identifies images that have been submitted to other insurers. The image forensics solution will be featured in a webinar on June 21.The digital transformation of insurance fraudReusing or altering photos is just one example of the growing trend of insurance fraud, which costs the United States approximately $308.6 billion annually, according to the Coalition Against Insurance Fraud.A Verisk study of a sample group of 768,000 claim images found 1,967 duplicates, including one photo used in 44 different claims.  These duplicate claim images could be linked to 1,475 separate claims for which approximately $5.3 million in indemnity payments were made.“The ubiquity of mobile devices, photo editing software and claims filing applications is making it easier than ever to submit fraudulent images of damages to insurers,” said Shane Riedman, vice president and general manager of anti-fraud analytics for Verisk Claims Solutions. “The image analytics and alerts we’re adding to ClaimSearch gives insurers the ability to quickly, automatically identify and investigate suspect claims, while simultaneously accelerating meritorious claim resolution for the vast majority of policyholders.”Story continuesInsurers who contribute claims data to ClaimSearch -- currently more than 95 percent of the industry – can submit claims photos and access certain image forensics checks with their current ClaimSearch subscription. To date 315 insurers have signed up to contribute images, and nearly half of the top 20 P&amp;C carriers are accessing the solution today.About Verisk Verisk (Nasdaq: VRSK) is a leading strategic data analytics and technology partner to the global insurance industry.

(NYSE:SCHW) released its monthly trading activity statement on Wednesday, revealing bad news for its investors as evidence suggests it might experience an 11% quarterly drop in revenue when it releases its following report in August.According to Chief Financial Officer Peter Crawford, the catalyst behind the financial services company's earnings drop is ""a temporarily compressed NIM (net interest margin) and a smaller interest-earning asset base, along with softer trading activity.""Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with SCHW. Click here to check it out. SCHW 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of SCHWPeter Lynch Chart of SCHWFor those unaware, Schwab endured a significant financial restructuring during its first quarter. Therefore, its pending results must be considered in a broader context. As such, this discussion is an attempt to articulate the company's current operating status.Latest trading highlightsThe primary features of Charles Schwab's monthly trading report highlighted its asset base, which experienced a $20.07 inflow of existing and new client funds. Moreover, the company's total client assets exceeded $7.65 trillion as of the end of May, increasing 5% year over year.Furthermore, the tracked client cash settled at 11.5% at the end of May, which notched down from the 12% experienced a year ago.Although a face-value observation suggests Charles Schwab has experienced additional progress, a finer look at the details implies otherwise. For instance, observation of growth rates shows net new asset growth dipped by 25% year over year, net new core assets fell 37% and new brokerage accounts declined 3%. Although slower equity markets can justify a decline in brokerage account growth, the company's receding asset base growth is a substantial concern, given the ever-growing funding costs and credit risk within the financial sector, proven by the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and First Republic Bank.Story continuesRecent restructuringAs highlighted previously, Charles Schwab recently triggered a substantial financial restructuring, which investors should consider before drawing conclusions on its outlook.At the turn of the year, the Westlake, Texas-based company shifted a significant portion of its available-for-sale securities to amortized cost status, given the belief that a shift in the business model was necessary. In the process, Schwab recognized an impairment of approximately $188.1 million as many of its previously held-for-sale securities were carrying above their fair values.The significance of the restructuring might come into play in later quarters. By shifting more assets to amortized cost, Charles Schwab's income statement will likely recognize fewer unrealized gains and losses as a proportion of its revenue mix, altering how its quarterly revenue should be measured relative to its past results.TD Ameritrade acquisitionAnother structural break to look out for is the pending synergies that Charles Schwab will realize from its acquisition of TD Ameritrade, which was settled in 2020. Measured at its completion date, the TD Ameritrade deal added $1.60 trillion to Schwab's asset base and bolstered its brokerage segment with 14.5 million accounts.Although the acquisition was completed nearly three years ago, the company's integration is a work in progress. For example, it is forecasted that Charles Schwab will only have fully transferred TD Ameritrade customers to its own platform by the end of 2023. Moreover, Schwab is busy phasing out overlapping and redundant roles resulting from the merger and expects to realize cost-cutting in due course.Lastly, Schwab's new product development, which integrates features from TD Ameritrade, is still within its project pipeline. The company believes it will enhance its client experience by leveraging synergies from the acquisition; however, product launches and enhancements are anticipated to take time.Return prospectsSchwab's stock requires a holistic valuation approach as its underlying entity operates a diverse business model. For example, the company's brokerage services are best valued on a price-sales basis, while its asset base is best judged by observing the stock's price-book ratio.Starting with the price-sales ratio, Charles Schwab is trading at 3.9 times its top line and possesses a multiple that is placed in the 41st percentile of its peer group. In essence, the stock looks priced in from a price-to-sales perspective.Further, the price-book ratio of 3.68 suggests it is overvalued in absolute terms. Charles Schwab's price-book ratio ranks within the 16th percentile of its peer group, implying a poor relative valuation.A forward-looking approach in the form of the discounted cash flow model agrees with the previously mentioned valuation metrics. By assuming a discount rate of 10% and a terminal growth rate of 4%, the DCF model conveys that Charles Schwab's stock is marginally overvalued and provides little scope for investors to achieve alpha.Final wordCharles Schwab's May trading report revealed disappointing numbers, and management has warned of a possible slump in its second-quarter earnings.Fundamental analysis suggests that factors such as softening asset inflows and lower brokerage account business provide severe threats. Moreover, various valuation metrics indicate that Charles Shwab's stock is overvalued.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' So it might be obvious that you need to consider debt, when you think about how risky any given stock is, because too much debt can sink a company. We can see that Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) does use debt in its business. But should shareholders be worried about its use of debt?What Risk Does Debt Bring?Debt assists a business until the business has trouble paying it off, either with new capital or with free cash flow. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more common (but still painful) scenario is that it has to raise new equity capital at a low price, thus permanently diluting shareholders. By replacing dilution, though, debt can be an extremely good tool for businesses that need capital to invest in growth at high rates of return. The first step when considering a company's debt levels is to consider its cash and debt together. Check out our latest analysis for Texas Instruments What Is Texas Instruments's Net Debt?As you can see below, at the end of March 2023, Texas Instruments had US$10.1b of debt, up from US$7.74b a year ago. Click the image for more detail. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$9.55b, its net debt is less, at about US$581.0m.debt-equity-history-analysisA Look At Texas Instruments' LiabilitiesAccording to the last reported balance sheet, Texas Instruments had liabilities of US$2.90b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$11.1b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of US$9.55b as well as receivables valued at US$1.88b due within 12 months. So its liabilities total US$2.56b more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables.This state of affairs indicates that Texas Instruments' balance sheet looks quite solid, as its total liabilities are just about equal to its liquid assets. So it's very unlikely that the US$161.0b company is short on cash, but still worth keeping an eye on the balance sheet. But either way, Texas Instruments has virtually no net debt, so it's fair to say it does not have a heavy debt load!Story continuesIn order to size up a company's debt relative to its earnings, we calculate its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) divided by its interest expense (its interest cover). This way, we consider both the absolute quantum of the debt, as well as the interest rates paid on it.Texas Instruments has very little debt (net of cash), and boasts a debt to EBITDA ratio of 0.056 and EBIT of 40.9 times the interest expense. Indeed relative to its earnings its debt load seems light as a feather. But the other side of the story is that Texas Instruments saw its EBIT decline by 2.3% over the last year. If earnings continue to decline at that rate the company may have increasing difficulty managing its debt load. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Texas Instruments can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.Finally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. During the last three years, Texas Instruments produced sturdy free cash flow equating to 67% of its EBIT, about what we'd expect. This free cash flow puts the company in a good position to pay down debt, when appropriate.Our ViewTexas Instruments's interest cover suggests it can handle its debt as easily as Cristiano Ronaldo could score a goal against an under 14's goalkeeper. But, on a more sombre note, we are a little concerned by its EBIT growth rate. Looking at the bigger picture, we think Texas Instruments's use of debt seems quite reasonable and we're not concerned about it. While debt does bring risk, when used wisely it can also bring a higher return on equity. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. For example, we've discovered 2 warning signs for Texas Instruments (1 shouldn't be ignored!) that you should be aware of before investing here.At the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt.

Earlier this year the Company announced plans to build its first structure production facility in Decatur, Alabama. The new facility will be located adjacent to the Nucor Steel Crawfordsville steel mill and is expected to create 200 full-time jobs.""With this second utility structure production facility, we are expanding our Towers &amp; Structures business and positioning the Company to meet the growing demand for utility infrastructure from renewable energy projects, EV charging network expansion and grid hardening,"" said Leon Topalian, Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer of Nucor Corporation.

Holcomb. ""Nucor has been a great company partner to our state for decades, and this new Towers &amp; Structures operation is a true testament to the Company's commitment to the Montgomery County region and to our Hoosier pro-growth business climate and skilled workforce.""Federal legislation passed in the last few years, including the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the Inflation Reduction Act, provide nearly half a trillion dollars in funding and incentives to build out our nation's clean energy future, creating increasing demand for transmission and other utility structures. Demand is also being driven by infrastructure damage stemming from natural disasters, replacement of aging utility infrastructure and population growth.Last year, Nucor formed its Nucor Towers &amp; Structures business unit when it acquired Summit Utility Structures LLC, a producer of metal poles and other steel structures for utility infrastructure. The Company announced plans at that time to establish a nationwide footprint by building two new utility structure production facilities for a combined investment of $270 million.

But when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.Cash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns.Unum in FocusHeadquartered in Chattanooga, Unum (UNM) is a Finance stock that has seen a price change of 12.09% so far this year. The insurance company is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.33 per share, with a dividend yield of 2.87%. This compares to the Insurance - Accident and Health industry's yield of 2.55% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.72%.In terms of dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $1.32 is up 4.8% from last year. In the past five-year period, Unum has increased its dividend 4 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 5.80%. Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Unum's current payout ratio is 20%, meaning it paid out 20% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.UNM is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $7.46 per share, with earnings expected to increase 20.13% from the year ago period.Bottom LineInvestors like dividends for a variety of different reasons, from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits. However, not all companies offer a quarterly payout.Story continuesFor instance, it's a rare occurrence when a tech start-up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend. It's more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends. During periods of rising interest rates, income investors must be mindful that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle. That said, they can take comfort from the fact that UNM is not only an attractive dividend play, but also represents a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In this regard, guidance from Wall Street’s equity experts, such as those employed at established financial institutions like Wells Fargo, can prove invaluable.Recently, the firm’s analysts have homed in on a pair of stocks they believe are ripe for the picking right now, labeling them both as “too cheap” at current levels. We ran these tickers through the TipRanks database to find out what their Wall Street colleagues make of their chances.PVH Corp. (PVH)Let’s start in the global fashion industry and take a look at the parent company of some of the world’s most famous apparel brands.PVH is a fashion market leader boasting a portfolio of iconic names such as Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, in addition to others on its roster. The New York City-based firm operates through various distribution channels, including retail stores, e-commerce platforms, and wholesale partnerships, with around 27,000 associates active in over 40 countries.This global strutting business dialed in a strong first quarter report with beats both on the top-and bottom-line. Revenue climbed by 2% year-over-year to $2.16 billion, edging ahead of the forecast by $30 million. EPS of $2.14 easily trumped the $1.95 consensus estimate.However, the shares fell consequently and that was down to a disappointing outlook. The company stuck to its FY 2023 guide, projecting revenue will rise by 3% to 4% vs. 2022, but that, at the mid-point, was below consensus, which called for a year-over-year increase of 3.76%. The outlook for Q2 was another letdown for investors, with EPS expected to hit $1.70, some distance below the Street’s expectation of $2.26.Story continuesInvestors might have been disappointed with the forecast but that is no issue for Wells Fargo analyst Ike Boruchow, who calls PVH a “rare name that has managed the tough macro well.” Moreover, Boruchow thinks investors should take advantage of an enticing entry point.“Momentum is evident, multiple remains too cheap. PVH is bucking the trend – with international growth and NA recovery driving results. Better demand trends and improving margins are an outlier today, and it’s clear PVH’s strategies around supply chain, brand elevation and distribution are gaining steam. We remain very bullish on this idiosyncratic turnaround story,” Boruchow opined.These comments form the basis for Boruchow’s Overweight (i.e., Buy) rating on PVH, while his $110 price target suggests the shares have room for 12-month growth of 29%. (To watch Boruchow’s track record, click here)Elsewhere on Wall Street, the stock claims an additional 6 Buys and 7 Holds, all coalescing to a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The average target currently stands at $97.79, indicating the shares will be changing hands for a 14% premium a year from now. (See PVH stock forecast)BJ’s Wholesale Club Holding (BJ)The next stock Wells Fargo thinks is on discount is fittingly BJ’s Wholesale Club Holdings, a prominent American warehouse club retailer that operates a chain of membership-based stores. Since it was founded in 1984, BJ’s Wholesale Club has established itself as a significant player in the industry, offering consumers and businesses a wide range of products, including groceries, electronics, furniture, appliances, and more, at discounted prices. As a membership-based retailer, BJ’s offers exclusive benefits to its customers, such as access to a variety of services, discounts, and personalized offers.The company operates 237 warehouse clubs across 18 states, primarily located on the east coast. In addition to its physical stores, BJ’s has expanded its digital presence, offering online shopping, delivery services, and the requisite mobile app.While its business model is one suited for tough economic times, the company’s most recent quarterly readout was not an all-out success. Revenue increased by 4.9% year-over-year to reach $4.72 billion but fell $90 million shy of the analysts’ forecast. That said, gross profit rose from $790.6 million to $880 million and helped the retailer dial in adj. EPS of $0.85, thereby meeting Street expectations.Shares have mostly been on the backfoot since the report’s release, a development Wells Fargo analsyt Edward Kelly puts down to “growing concerns about forward momentum.”Those issues are understandable, says Kelly, although the analyst believes the stock is simply “too cheap.”“BJ has the same issue as most peers… industry fundamentals are just slowing,” the 5-star analyst went on to say. “Consumer weakness is pressuring gen merch, while the historic pricing cycle in grocery is ending. This clearly creates momentum issues for defensive staples retail names. That said, BJ should be a share-gaining model, has a good self-help story, and trades at a compelling multiple. We remain Overweight as this big picture narrative should eventually win out.”Along with that Overweight (i.e. Buy) rating, Kelly’s $83 price target implies shares will appreciate by 33% over the course of the year. (To watch Kelly’s track record, click here)Most analysts agree with that stance. Of the 14 other reviews made during the past 3 months, 9 join Kelly in the bull-camp, 4 remain on the sidelines while one implores to Sell, all adding up to a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The forecast calls for one-year gains of ~28%, considering the average target stands at $78.87.

Most of the goods are priced between $15 and $50, Denise Incandela, vice president of apparel and private brands, disclosed at a June 6 conference with investors.Walmart historically has marketed mostly its own brand ofclothing: basic George t-shirts, shorts and pants, typicallypriced at $15 or less. But Incandela, a former Saks and Ralph Lauren executive, said Walmart's research showed that 80% of its customers were purchasing higher-priced clothes elsewhere.She told Walmart investors its strategy is to ""democratize fashion"" or convert the company's core, price-conscious shoppers into style-conscious shoppers.""It is a huge transformation on the apparel side,"" she said.Americans shop for clothing, footwear, chairs and lights from millions of mom-and-pop stores, regional chains and onlineplatforms every day, analyst say, giving no one retailer outsized dominance in the highly fragmented markets for home decor and apparel.But smaller retailers have a hard time competing with Walmart because of its scale and size and its well-known history of squeezing suppliers on prices by promising them volume sales.Story continuesWalmart's strategy ""is a risk to the market but not a disproportionately larger risk"" to bigger retailers like Target or Gap, said Dean Rosenblum, senior research analyst for retail at Bernstein.It would probably be the rest of the market that should be worried,"" he said pointing to apparel retailers such as Carhartt.Privately held Carhartt does not disclose revenues. Retailers that do, including Tilly's Inc, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch and Lands End, posted declining revenues in the latest year, according to Refinitiv IBES.Walmart accounts for 4.6% of the $560.4 billion U.S. apparelmarket, followed by TJX, Target and Ross at 4.4%, 4.1% and 2.8%,respectively, according to GlobalData.Bankrupt Bed Bath and Beyond was a leader in the home decor and furnishing industry along with furniture chains Ikea and Wayfair. This U.S. market stood at $169 billion dollars in2019 and is forecast to hit $194.9 billion in 2023, according toStatista.STORES OF THE FUTUREIn its ""Stores of the Future"" drive, Walmart is renovating 700 stores as part of a record $17 billion capital expenditure plan. By year end it will place its new clothing and home decor in snazzier displays in the revamped facilities.Walmart's, celebrity collaboration strategy, which was pioneered by rival Target, features women's clothing designed by Brandon Maxwell of the Bravo show ""Project Runway"" and home organization products developed by Clea Shearer and Joanna Teplin from ""The Home Edit"" series on Netflix.Near the front of one remodeled store, Walmart placed a $79 Beautiful by Drew Barrymore air fryer. Close by was a display of $27.50 Sofia Jeans for women, from its collaboration with Vergara, along with Reebok shorts and pullovers.CFRA research analyst Arun Sundaram said Walmart could pickup sales of home decor following the bankruptcy of Bed Bath andBeyond, and it might gain market share from other clothingchains with inventory gluts.He expects Walmart to spend $5.7 billion renovating its stores this year, up from $5 billion in 2022 and $3.3 billion in 2021.Sundaram added that Walmart's opportunistic move to doubledown on clothing and home goods ""made sense"" when the economy isslowing and not ""when people are buying everything.""Walmart's previous effort to branch into fashion met with failure. In 2017 it challenged online retailer Amazon.com by acquiring upmarket brands Bonobos, ModCloth and Moosejaw, units it sold a few years later at fire sale prices in some cases. In 2005, Walmart's Metro 7 fashion brand tanked and later designer lines with Max Azria and Norma Kamali also withered.The strategy has bombed at some other retailers. J.C. Penney's efforts to attract more affluent shoppers and reduce dependence on coupons alienated its core shoppers and eventually forced the more than a century-old retailer to file for bankruptcy in 2020. The company emerged from bankruptcy a few months later, but as a much smaller entity.(This story has been refiled to add the dropped word 'billion' in paragraph 15)(Reporting by Siddharth Cavale in New York; Editing by Vanessa O'Connell and David Gregorio)]"

Flipkart was valued at more than $40 billion in 2022 and counts itself among India's most valuable startups.Walmart also called PhonePe's performance ""really impressive"" after it hit an annualized payment value of $1 trillion led by the Unified Payments Interface, a highly popular method in India to make instant real-time payments.PhonePe controlled 46% share of the payments market in December, according to National Payments Corporation of India, and has 400 million registered users. In March, Walmart gave that business a boost by pouring an additional $200 million at a pre-money valuation of $12 billion, cementing its position as India's most valuable payments startup.""It is not crazy to think that both those businesses could be $100 billion businesses in the future,"" Walmart's Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey said.(Reporting by Siddharth Cavale in New York; Editing by Lisa Shumaker)]"

The idea is to be able to see clothing on a model that looks like oneself. But there’s always a bit of a cut-and-paste look.Now, Google is betting that it can improve the service with generative AI, which is capable of producing new text and images in response to prompts. On Wednesday (June 14), the company announced a virtual try-on feature that shows you what clothes look like on real models of different shapes and sizes. The simulation looks more realistic than previous try-on technology, as it shows how a clothing item drapes, folds, clings, stretches, and wrinkles, according to Google.Read moreAll the sports that are part of Saudi Arabia's sportswashing planGoogle has officially changed its mind about remote workHow many UBI trials do we need to prove giving away money works?To accomplish this, AI researchers at Google developed a new diffusion model. Diffusion is the process of gradually adding extra pixels, or “noise,” to an image until it becomes unrecognizable, then removing the noise until the original image is reconstructed. The result is an AI-generated image that looks shockingly realistic. You can see the difference in Walmart’s service (the first image) versus Google’s (the second image).Model with brown hair wearing a purple and black design dress.Walmart’s virtual try-on service.Google’s virtual try-on service.Automating fashion photography has been around for some timeClothing brands turned toward using more AI-generated models during the pandemic when getting access to models in-person was difficult, said Ashwini Asokan, CEO of Vue.ai, an AI retail company that offers a range of automation services including fashion photography.There’s been a growing demand for seeing more diverse models, and companies are responding—with varying degrees of success. Levi’s, for instance, said in March it is using AI-generated models as a way to increase the number of diverse models, which led to backlash for the initiative’s failure to advance real diversity.Story continuesWill Google, given its massive reach and generative AI capabilities, be able to fully disrupt the virtual try-on space? Maybe, or maybe not—and in the end, it might not matter for the tech giant. Tech companies have lots of bets that don’t pan out—but they collect a lot of data from these bets, which can be applied to other products in the works, said Asokan. “These bets are not always meant to scale,” she said, adding that the try-on service is also a way for Google, one of the pioneers of generative AI, to show off its AI muscle.Google has put thousands of pieces from hundreds of brands including Everlane, H&amp;M, LOFT, and Anthropologie through its AI model. The virtual try-on service is currently only available in the US and is limited to women’s tops.

23,ba6a3593-1314-3bbd-9691-cc1ae4ed73dc,WMT,2023-06-15,Costco (COST) Rides on Business Model and Pricing Power,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/costco-cost-rides-business-model-154000893.html,1686757200,STORY,"['COST', 'WMT', 'TJX']","[Being a consumer defensive stock, Costco Wholesale Corporation COST has been surviving the market turmoil pretty well. Strategic investments, a customer-centric approach, merchandise initiatives and an emphasis on memberships have been the discount retailer’s primary strengths.A Dominant Warehouse RetailerThis Issaquah, WA-based company continues to be one of the dominant warehouse retailers based on the expanse and quality of merchandise offered. Costco's distinctive membership business model and pricing power set it apart from traditional players. Amid rising prices, low-to-middle-income consumers have preferred discount stores over conventional retailers.Cumulatively, these factors have been aiding Costco in registering decent sales numbers. Costco’s net sales increased 1.2% to $18.45 billion for the retail month of May from $18.23 billion last year. The metric grew 1.9% year over year to $52,604 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2023.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchNo wonder, the company’s total paid members have been rising. Its growing customer base and high renewal rates have been fueling sales. Membership fees increased 6.1% to $1,044 million in the third quarter. The company ended the quarter with 69.1 million paid household members and 124.7 million cardholders.Costco is gradually adopting the omnichannel mantra to provide a seamless shopping experience. Its acquisition of Innovel Solutions, a leading provider of third-party end-to-end logistics solutions — now called Costco Logistics — has boosted its e-commerce capabilities and enabled it to sell ""big and bulky"" items.The company has been gradually expanding its e-commerce capabilities in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Mexico, Korea, Taiwan, Japan and Australia.Costco also remains committed to opening new clubs in the domestic and international markets. In our view, the company’s diversification strategy is a natural hedge against risks that may arise in specific markets. After opening 13, 20 and 23 net new warehouses in fiscal 2020, 2021 and 2022, respectively, Costco plans to open 23 net new units in fiscal 2023. We foresee an improvement in membership fees as new warehouse openings ramp up.Story continuesWrapping UpThe strategy to sell products at discounted prices has helped Costco draw customers who have been seeking both value and convenience. Costco has exhibited a decent run on the bourse so far in the year.Due to its operational initiatives — a customer-centric approach, an emphasis on the membership program and a focus on value offerings — the stock has outpaced the Zacks Retail-Discount industry.

Establishing a dedicated board risk committee can be an effective structure to enable boards to meet their expanding risk oversight responsibilities. However, only 8 percent of Russell 3000 companies have a dedicated board risk committee. WASHINGTON, June 14, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- The National Association of Corporate Directors (NACD), the authority on boardroom practices representing more than 23,000 directors, in partnership with Marsh McLennan, today published their Risk Committee Blueprint as part of the NACD Future of the American Board initiative.The Risk Committee Working Group, a panel of corporate board leaders from NACD-affiliated organizations, as well as senior leaders from Marsh McLennan, developed the Blueprint as both a call to action for boards to elevate their risk oversight and as an assessment tool for boards—with or without risk committees—to help them execute on expanded risk oversight responsibilities.""Enterprises today face an increasingly complex risk environment, a demanding risk agenda, and rising stakeholder expectations,"" said Linda R. Gooden, a Risk Committee Working Group participant; director at GM, Home Depot, ADP, and others; and former Lockheed Martin executive vice president. ""Crises—including the pandemic, supply chain disruptions, geopolitical turmoil, and financial distress—have combined and reinforced each other, stressing the reality that strong risk oversight is now a vital board function at all organizations.""Against this backdrop, the working group recommends that directors consider these four critical areas that will help boards frame and elevate their execution of risk governance and oversight to meet these challenges:Oversight structure. Boards must ensure that there are clear committee charters that define risk oversight responsibilities, roles, and the management structure and processes to support those responsibilities, whether there is a dedicated risk committee or not.Expertise and board composition. Some boards may need to increase board education, the use of external advisors, or a refresh of the board composition to meet an array of risk demands and risk management.Reporting and communications. Improving risk reporting starts with clarity on the board's risk responsibilities, as this guides the necessary content, structure, and cadence of information flow.Calendar and committee agenda. Despite crowded board agendas, directors should ensure that committee calendars and agendas allow time for discussions on emerging and evolving risks and impacts.Story continuesOnly 8 percent of Russell 3000 companies have a dedicated board risk committee. As described in the Blueprint, for some organizations a dedicated risk committee can enable a substantive focus on risk and risk analysis, including emerging and non-defined risks, optimizing risk management and its link to strategy. The risk committee can also serve as an aggregator of risks overseen by the different board committees to help ensure all risks receive thorough oversight.""In our work with clients, we see boards playing an increasingly vital role in helping their organizations maneuver through complexity by enhancing and strengthening their risk oversight,"" said Reid Sawyer, managing director and head of the Emerging Risk Practice at Marsh Advisory, and a member of the Risk Committee Working Group. ""The Blueprint is an invaluable tool for directors to help them assess if their board is ready to execute on their expanded risk oversight responsibilities in this unpredictable environment.""""Our goal with the Blueprint is to help directors develop a deeper and fuller understanding of their companies' risk management, especially as board oversight and responsibilities in this area expand, and be prepared to take action in a crisis,"" said Peter Gleason, president and CEO of NACD. ""Each organization must consider its own maturity, ongoing strategies, and particular pressures, and should use the NACD guidance as a starting point from which to develop a plan that best fits their needs.""A digital version of The Future of the American Board Risk Committee Blueprint is available at NACDonline.org.The Risk Committee Working Group is the fourth Future of the American Board panel to publish a Blueprint guide this year, following the Compensation (March), Audit (April), and Nominating and Governance (May) committee working groups.About NACDThe National Association of Corporate Directors (NACD) is the premier membership organization for board directors who want to expand their knowledge, grow their network, and maximize their potential.As the unmatched authority in corporate governance, NACD sets the standards of excellence through its research and community-driven director education, programming, and publications.

(AP) — Gambling giant MGM Resorts International says it did nothing wrong in its dealings with a New York City man who accuses it of preying on his gambling addiction with repeated cash bonuses intended to keep him gambling.In court papers, MGM says Sam Antar, a twice-jailed “fraudster” who repeatedly victimized friends, relatives and strangers, is engaging in “his latest scheme” by falsely accusing MGM of wrongdoing.MGM is asking a federal judge to dismiss Antar's lawsuit and refer the matter to arbitration, which it says is required by the terms of service to which Antar agreed when he opened an online gambling account with the company.The company also denies it violated any New Jersey laws.“Sam Antar is a convicted felon and repeat fraudster who has pled guilty to defrauding numerous individuals out of hundreds of thousands of dollars in false stock investment schemes,” MGM wrote in its June 9 response to Antar's litigation, filed in U.S. District Court in New Jersey. “Rather than accept accountability for his own actions, Antar blames BetMGM for his crimes, falsely claiming that BetMGM preyed upon his alleged gambling addiction.”The company did not respond to requests for comment beyond what is contained in its court filing.Antar is the nephew of Eddie Antar, who founded the Crazy Eddie electronics stores in the 1970s and 1980s. Eddie Antar defrauded investors out of more than $74 million, and died in 2016.In 2013, Sam Antar was sentenced to 21 months in federal prison for taking $225,000 in a fraudulent investment scheme. He was convicted and jailed last year on theft by deception charges involving nearly $350,000. In April, he admitted committing federal securities fraud for bilking investors including friends stemming from that same case, and was ordered in May to pay restitution.“I would like to publicly apologize to all the people I hurt,” he said in an interview Wednesday.His initial lawsuit, filed last September, accused MGM of plying him with bonus cash to dissuade him from reporting to New Jersey gambling regulators numerous instances in which he was gambling online and was disconnected from the system — often when he had a winning hand.Story continuesHis revised lawsuit, filed in May, drops those allegations and focuses on what his lawyer Matthew Litt calls “what's really important here to society as a whole: the enticement by the casino of a person who was showing signs of being a problem gambler.”Antar, who has homes in New York and in Long Branch, New Jersey, gambled $30 million over 100,000 bets during nine months in 2019, according to his lawsuit, which does not specify how much he actually lost. Litt would not estimate those losses, although a previous lawyer in Antar's case said they totaled “easily hundreds of thousands of dollars.”In its response, MGM says it did not create or worsen a gambling problem in Antar or anyone else.“To be sure, BetMGM takes problem gambling seriously, and has numerous options for persons to self-exclude or limit their play, as well as resources for assistance,"" the company wrote. ""However, New Jersey law does not include a common law duty to protect problem gamblers from their actions.“Despite a heightened sensitivity to problem gaming, New Jersey courts have repeatedly held that casinos have no common law duty to prevent alleged ‘compulsive gamblers’ from gambling,” MGM wrote.The latest version of Antar's lawsuit makes some of the same claims that were raised — and rejected by a judge — in another person's lawsuit targeting Atlantic City casinos. In 2008, a federal judge ruled against New York gambler Arelia Taveras who sued seven casinos that she said had a duty to stop her from gambling. She lost nearly $1 million over two years, including dayslong gambling binges.“She spent money on the bona fide chance that she might win more money,” U.S. District Court Judge Renee Bumb wrote in a 2008 ruling. “In short, she gambled. The mere fact that defendants profited from her misfortune, while lamentable, does not establish a cognizable claim in the law.”MGM cites that case among its numerous defenses to Antar's litigation.___Follow Wayne Parry on Twitter at www.twitter.com/WayneParryAC ]"

34,7a847139-f57b-349a-b61e-6a86f9d69763,MET,2023-06-15,MetLife (MET) Could Be a Great Choice,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/metlife-met-could-great-choice-154511082.html,1686757511,STORY,['MET'],"[Getting big returns from financial portfolios, whether through stocks, bonds, ETFs, other securities, or a combination of all, is an investor's dream. However, when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns.MetLife in FocusHeadquartered in New York, MetLife (MET) is a Finance stock that has seen a price change of -23.77% so far this year. The insurer is paying out a dividend of $0.52 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 3.77% compared to the Insurance - Multi line industry's yield of 2.07% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.72%.Looking at dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $2.08 is up 5.1% from last year. In the past five-year period, MetLife has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 4.28%. Looking ahead, future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Right now, MetLife's payout ratio is 32%, which means it paid out 32% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.MET is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $7.74 per share, representing a year-over-year earnings growth rate of 12.99%.Bottom LineInvestors like dividends for a variety of different reasons, from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits. However, not all companies offer a quarterly payout.Story continuesBig, established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options, but it's fairly uncommon to see high-growth businesses or tech start-ups offer their stockholders a dividend. Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, MET is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

RDN, Old Republic International Corporation ORI, MetLife Inc. MET and Prudential Financial Inc. PRU.5 Dividend-Paying Multiline Insurers That Ensure Stable IncomeInvestors look for returns on their investments in the form of dividends. Amid volatile market conditions, companies that have an impressive dividend history are always investors’ favorites.The Zacks Multiline Insurance industry has lost 12.1% year to date. However, Assurant Inc., Radian Group Inc., Old Republic International Corporation, MetLife Inc. and Prudential Financial Inc., with their impressive dividend history, offer investors a breather.Insurers, backed by strong fundamentals, enjoy a solid capital position that in turn supports effective capital deployment.  Multiline insurers benefit from a diversified portfolio that lowers concentration risk. Increased awareness drives demand for protection products, which benefits sales and premiums of life insurance operations. Continued improvement in pricing is expected to support premium growth of non-life insurance operations. Also, an increase in exposure of intangibles and cyber threats offers room for growth for non-life insurers. Per Deloitte Insights, life insurance premiums are estimated to increase 1.9% in 2023 while non-life premiums are expected to increase 2.2%. The report also stated that trends like commercial lines witnessing growth at a faster pace than personal lines and homeowners’ premiums improving at a better rate than personal auto are likely to continue in 2023.Insurers invest a portion of their premium income. Therefore, higher the rates. better the investment results. Also, the interest rate environment is improving. The Fed has already made three hikes in 2023, taking the tally to 10 since March 2022. Also, investment income is an important component of insurers’ top line. However, concerns related to whether Fed will pause further hikes remain. Thus, all eyes are on the outcome of the two-day Fed meeting concluding this Thursday. These solid fundamentals should help companies to maintain dividend streakStory continuesPlayers are investing heavily in technology to improve scale and efficiencies. While a solid policyholders’ surplus helps the industry absorb losses, a sturdy capital level aids insurers in pursuing strategic mergers and acquisitions, investing in growth initiatives, engaging in share buybacks, and increasing dividends or paying out special dividends.Dividend Stocks for Your PortfolioIn this volatile market, stocks that give regular dividends offer an attractive investment opportunity.

Radian Group maintains a solid balance sheet with sufficient liquidity and strong cash flows. A strong capital position helps this Zacks Rank #2 insurer deploy capital via share repurchases and dividend hikes that enhance shareholders value.Old Republic International, with a market capitalization of $6.4 billion, engages in the insurance underwriting and related services business primarily in the United States and Canada.

(Check Prudential’s dividend history here).PRU is on track to reprice as well as move toward lower-risk and less capital-intensive products. As this Zacks Rank #3 insurer transforms to becoming a higher growth, less market-sensitive business, it expects to double its growth businesses to more than 30% of earnings and the individual annuities business to 10% or less of earnings. PRU remains focused on investing in businesses to expand its addressable market and to continue to improve expense and capital efficiency. Prudential envisions about a 65% free cash flow ratio of earnings and about two times its dividend.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

U.S. diesel futures, meanwhile, rose about 5% to their highest since late April.The oil market drew support from U.S. reports showing retail sales unexpectedly rose in May and higher-than-expected jobless claims last week cut the dollar to a five-week low versus a basket of other currencies.A weaker dollar makes crude cheaper for holders of other currencies, which could boost oil demand.Data on Thursday also showed China's oil refinery throughput rose 15.4% in May from a year earlier, hitting its second highest total on record.Chinese demand for oil is expected to keep climbing at an assured rate during the second half of the year, said Kuwait Petroleum Corp's chief executive.""The Chinese refinery numbers started the oil price rally. Then, of course, you have the macro situation with the (U.S.) dollar being down in part because of the U.S. Federal Reserve pause in raising interest rate, while in Europe they are still hiking rates,"" said Phil Flynn, an analyst at Price Futures Group.The European Central Bank (ECB) raised interest rates to a 22-year high as expected on Thursday. It signaled further policy tightening, as it battles high inflation.""The outlook for economic growth and inflation remains highly uncertain,"" said ECB President Christine Lagarde.On Wednesday, the Fed kept interest rates unchanged but signaled at least a half of a percentage point increase by year end.Higher interest rates ultimately increase borrowing costs for consumers, which could slow economic growth and reduce oil demand.Story continuesOn the supply side, analysts expect voluntary crude output cuts implemented in May by OPEC+, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and allies, and by Saudi Arabia in July, to support prices at a time of strong demand.UBS expects a supply deficit of around 1.5 million barrels per day (bpd) in June and more than 2 million bpd in July.""Once these deficits become visible in on-land oil inventories, we expect oil prices to trend higher,"" the bank said in a note.In Iraq, a Turkish energy delegation will meet Iraqi oil officials in Baghdad on June 19 to discuss the resumption of Iraq's northern oil exports, Iraqi deputy oil minister for upstream affairs, Basim Mohammed, told Reuters.Turkey halted Iraq’s 450,000 bpd of northern exports through the Iraq-Turkey pipeline on March 25 after an arbitration ruling by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC).(Additional reporting by Rowena Edwards in London, Jeslyn Lerh in Singapore and Arathy Somasekhar in Houston; editing by David Gregorio, Kirsten Donovan and Jonathan Oatis)]"

Although, it's not wise to just take the P/S at face value as there may be an explanation why it's as high as it is. View our latest analysis for Perdana Petroleum Berhad ps-multiple-vs-industryWhat Does Perdana Petroleum Berhad's Recent Performance Look Like?Revenue has risen firmly for Perdana Petroleum Berhad recently, which is pleasing to see. It might be that many expect the respectable revenue performance to beat most other companies over the coming period, which has increased investors’ willingness to pay up for the stock. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason.Although there are no analyst estimates available for Perdana Petroleum Berhad, take a look at this free data-rich visualisation to see how the company stacks up on earnings, revenue and cash flow.Is There Enough Revenue Growth Forecasted For Perdana Petroleum Berhad?In order to justify its P/S ratio, Perdana Petroleum Berhad would need to produce impressive growth in excess of the industry.Taking a look back first, we see that the company grew revenue by an impressive 19% last year. Despite this strong recent growth, it's still struggling to catch up as its three-year revenue frustratingly shrank by 28% overall. Accordingly, shareholders would have felt downbeat about the medium-term rates of revenue growth.Weighing that medium-term revenue trajectory against the broader industry's one-year forecast for expansion of 4.1% shows it's an unpleasant look.With this in mind, we find it worrying that Perdana Petroleum Berhad's P/S exceeds that of its industry peers. Apparently many investors in the company are way more bullish than recent times would indicate and aren't willing to let go of their stock at any price. There's a very good chance existing shareholders are setting themselves up for future disappointment if the P/S falls to levels more in line with the recent negative growth rates.Story continuesThe Bottom Line On Perdana Petroleum Berhad's P/SGenerally, our preference is to limit the use of the price-to-sales ratio to establishing what the market thinks about the overall health of a company.We've established that Perdana Petroleum Berhad currently trades on a much higher than expected P/S since its recent revenues have been in decline over the medium-term. Right now we aren't comfortable with the high P/S as this revenue performance is highly unlikely to support such positive sentiment for long. Unless the recent medium-term conditions improve markedly, investors will have a hard time accepting the share price as fair value.It is also worth noting that we have found 2 warning signs for Perdana Petroleum Berhad that you need to take into consideration.If these risks are making you reconsider your opinion on Perdana Petroleum Berhad, explore our interactive list of high quality stocks to get an idea of what else is out there.Have feedback on this article?

This has cast doubts over expectations that oil markets will tighten substantially in 2023, despite recent production cuts by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.In another sign of bloated supply, data showed U.S. crude inventories grew substantially more than expected in the week to June 9, with a rise in gasoline stockpiles raising questions over a summer season recovery in U.S. fuel demand.Fed offers mixed signals, markets left uncertainOil prices also retreated after the Federal Reserve held rates steady on Wednesday, but forecast at least two more rate hikes this year as it moves against high inflation.Story continuesWhile the pause offered some positive signals to crude markets, the prospect of interest rates rising further pointed to more economic headwinds this year, which oil bulls fear could stymie crude demand.The dollar also rallied in Asian trade after the Fed meeting, providing more pressure for oil markets.Related ArticlesOil edges lower as markets weigh China rate cuts, mixed Fed signalsGold prices dip as Fed pauses but flags future hikesUS House Judiciary leader subpoenas documents from climate groups]"

Hence, these are expected to adversely impact top-line growth.Nonetheless, heightened client activity in the trading business is expected to continue as uncertainty-induced volatility is likely to persist in the near term. While technology-related expense might impede bottom-line growth to some extent, it will eventually lead to improved operating efficiency. These factors will likely support industry players like Morgan Stanley MS, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. GS and Evercore Inc. EVR.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Investment Bank industry consists of firms that provide financial products and services that include advisory-based financial transactions to corporations, governments and financial institutions worldwide. These started as partnership firms focused on initial public offerings (IPOs), secondary equity offerings, brokerage and mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;As). Gradually the companies have evolved into providers of various other services, including securities research, proprietary trading and investment management. Therefore, the industry players work mainly through three product segments — investment banking (comprising M&amp;As, advisory services and securities underwriting), asset management and trading and principal investments (consisting of proprietary and brokerage trading).3 Key Themes Shaping the Future of the Investment Bank IndustrySlowdown in Underwriting and Advisory Business: After a blockbuster performance in 2021, IPO, underwriting and deal-making activities have almost come to a grinding halt since the start of 2022. A host of factors, including geopolitical tensions, significant monetary policy tightening worldwide to control raging inflation and the expectations of a slowdown/recession continue to act as headwinds for M&amp;As across the globe.These challenging conditions are also leading to a plunge in stock prices and slowing global economic growth, thereby hampering debt and equity issuance volumes. Though the deal-making pipeline looks healthy, there has been a substantial decline in M&amp;A activity and volumes. Thus, subdued underwriting and advisory businesses are expected to keep weighing on industry players’ revenue growth in 2023.Trading Business to Offer Support: Client activity in the trading business largely depends on the prevalent macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions. Since the beginning of 2022, market volatility has significantly increased on several geopolitical and macroeconomic concerns. Before that, the investment banking industry had witnessed a similar level of volatility from March 2020 up to the first couple of months of 2021 due to the pandemic-induced uncertainty.The current prevalent situation is likely to persist this year as markets are still grappling with looming recession expectations, the Federal Reserve’s aggressive monetary policy and other geopolitical matters. Hence, trading volumes will remain decent, driven by solid client activities in equity and fixed-income businesses, thereby boosting trading income.Technology to Improve Operating Efficiency: Innovative trading platforms, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and investments in technology and advertising are likely to support the operations of investment banks. The industry players are attracting and retaining the best talent for building a leadership team and spending heavily on technology to support clients with infrastructure development and new platforms. While investment banks are likely to face increasing technology-related expenses in the near term, these initiatives are expected to improve operating efficiency over time.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates a Gloomy PictureThe Zacks Investment Bank industry is a 14-stock group within the broader Zacks Finance sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #193, which places it in the bottom 23% of more than 245 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates dismal near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a discouraging earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are losing confidence in this group’s earnings growth potential. Over the past year, the industry’s earnings estimates for the current year have been revised lower by 22.4%.Before we present a few stocks that you may keep a watch on despite industry-wide headwinds, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock market performance and valuation picture.Industry Underperforms Sector and S&amp;P 500The Zacks Investment Bank industry has underperformed its sector and the S&amp;P 500 over the past two years. While stocks in the industry have collectively declined 18.3%, the S&amp;P 500 composite has gained 1.3% and the Zacks Finance sector has fallen 9.4%.Two-Year Price PerformanceIndustry ValuationOne might get a good sense of the industry’s relative valuation by looking at its price-to-tangible book ratio (P/TBV), which is commonly used for valuing investment banks because of large variations in their earnings results from one quarter to the next.The industry currently has a trailing 12-month P/TBV of 4.05X, above the median level of 2.66X, over the past five years. This compares with the highest level of 4.23X and the lowest level of 1.37X over this period. The industry is trading at a huge discount when compared with the market at large as the trailing 12-month P/TBV ratio for the S&amp;P 500 is 10.32X and the median level is 9.95X.Price-to-Tangible Book Ratio (TTM) As finance stocks typically have a lower P/TBV ratio, comparing investment banks with the S&amp;P 500 may not make sense to many investors. However, a comparison of the group’s P/TBV ratio with that of the broader sector ensures that the group is trading at a decent discount. The Zacks Finance sector’s trailing 12-month P/TBV ratio of 4.26X and the median level of 3.93X for the same period are above the Zacks Investment Bank industry’s respective ratios.Price-to-Tangible Book Ratio (TTM)3 Investment Banks Worth Keeping an Eye onMorgan Stanley: This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock operates as an investment banking, securities and investment management company globally. Based in New York, the key source of Morgan Stanley’s earnings stability is its business diversification. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. Morgan Stanley has been undertaking several initiatives to restructure operations with the goal of increasing reliable revenue sources. The company’s strategic expansion efforts, including the buyouts of Eaton Vance, E*Trade Financial and Shareworks, are in sync with its efforts to focus less on a capital markets-driven revenue mix.Though steadily increasing expenses and muted IB performance are headwinds, a strong balance sheet, higher rates and investment-grade long-term ratings from leading credit rating agencies are likely to continue supporting growth. The company’s robust capital deployments reflect a solid liquidity position and will keep enhancing shareholder value.With a market cap of $146 billion, Morgan Stanley is expected to continue benefiting from its scale and business expansion efforts. Its shares have gained 3.8% so far this year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 earnings has remained unchanged at $6.50 over the past week.Price and Consensus: MS Goldman: This Zacks Rank #3 company is a leading global provider of investment banking, securities, investment management and consumer banking services. Based in New York, Goldman has offices in London, Frankfurt, Tokyo, Hong Kong, and other major financial centers globally.Similar to Morgan Stanley, the key to the company’s financial stability is its business diversification efforts. GS has been undertaking efforts to boost asset management and wealth management business (both in the United States and globally) while expanding its digital consumer banking platform. Last year, it acquired robo-advisor NextCapital and Dutch asset manager NN Investment Partners. Through these, the company has positioned itself as one of the top five active asset managers globally.Goldman acquired GreenSky in March 2022 to augment its retail lending capabilities. But the challenging operating backdrop is weighing on its consumer business and now the company is in the middle of a major business restructuring initiative. Hence, it is seeking buyers for GreenSky and reducing its consumer loan portfolio.Though weakness in IB business and rising expenses are major near-term concerns, a solid position in announced and completed M&amp;As globally is likely to aid Goldman's IB revenues marginally. Backed by a solid capital position, the company has consistently enhanced shareholders’ value with steady capital deployment activities.Goldman has a market cap of $112.9 billion. In the year-to-date period, the company’s shares have declined 0.3%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ongoing-year earnings has remained unchanged at $31.57 in the past seven days.Price and Consensus: GS Evercore: This Zacks Rank #3 company is a premier global independent investment banking advisory firm. The company, based in New York, operates from its offices and affiliates in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Asia.EVR generates the majority of revenues from the IB business. Efforts to boost its client base in advisory solutions and geographical expansion initiatives continue to support revenue growth. Though total adjusted net revenues declined in 2019 due to lower advisory fees, the same witnessed a CAGR of 7.6% over the last four years (ended 2022). Despite several near-term headwinds, the company’s strong backlog and business investments will drive the IB business in the upcoming quarters.Though steadily rising operating expenses and negligible revenue generation from the wealth management business are concerns, Evercore maintains a solid balance sheet and liquidity position. Also, the company consistently enhances shareholders’ value with steady capital deployment activities.EVR has a market cap of $4.6 billion. So far this year, shares of the company have rallied 13.8%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ongoing-year earnings has remained unchanged at $9.01 over the past week.Price and Consensus: EVRWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

46,c03cd30d-cc96-39b6-8469-950e482cd7d1,MS,2023-06-15,JPMorgan (JPM) Consumer Deposits to Fall Amid Industry Woes,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jpmorgan-jpm-consumer-deposits-fall-123800550.html,1686746280,STORY,"['JPM', 'MS', 'KEY']","[JPMorgan’s JPM consumer and community banking unit’s co-CEO, Jennifer Piepszak, believes that consumer deposits will be “slightly down from here.” As the Federal Reserve is expected to keep interest rates high and the Treasury Department tries to replenish the treasury general account following the banking crisis, growth in consumer deposits seems challenging.As digital-only banks have started to offer rates that the traditional banks cannot match, the competition for deposits has escalated.Because of the rise in interest rates, consumers are moving their money into money market funds for greater returns, which is now another major problem for regional banks.Notably, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation reported that banks’ overall deposits declined by $472 billion in the first quarter of 2023 (the worst decline in almost 40 years).However, despite the above-mentioned headwinds, Piepszak has expressed confidence in the bank’s ability to “win the war for customers” as JPM added 2 million checking accounts on a net basis across its consumer and business banking in 2022. Moreover, the bank remains on track to complete at least that amount this year.Along with a decline in deposits, JPMorgan expects demand for loans to be low in the near term.The bank’s president and chief operating officer, Daniel Pinto, believes that the demand for loans is declining amid expectations of an economic slowdown/recession.Pinto said, “There is no doubt that regional banks and smaller banks are building up liquidity, building capital, so they are lending a bit less. I don't think that the big banks have really changed their lending standards... there is not a huge amount of loan demand in the first place.”In the first quarter of this year, banks witnessed a rise in their interest incomes and margins, supported by growth in loan balances and higher interest rates. While interest rates are expected to remain high in the near term, loan growth will likely slow down a bit because of lower consumer spending.Over the past six months, shares of JPM have gained 9.2% against the industry’s fall of 3.4%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCurrently, JPMorgan sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Amid the current challenging economic environment, most banks are providing bleak near-term outlook.Recently, at the Morgan Stanley U.S. Financials, Payments &amp; CRE Conference, KeyCorp KEY presented weaker-than-expected net interest income (NII) second-quarter guidance.KEY’s CEO Chris Gorman noted that NII will come much lower than previously expected. NII is anticipated to slide 12% sequentially, which is substantially below the 4-5% fall guided during the first-quarter earnings conference call.While providing the reason behind this dismal view, KeyCorp’s chief financial officer Clark Khayat said, “Clients deposits are staying in place, they are just more expensive, and they are going to continue to be expensive as long as rates sort of sit where they are.”Morgan Stanley’s MS trading and investment banking (“IB”) outlook looks bleak for the near term.Per Morgan Stanley’s co-president, Andy Saperstein, the firm expects a year-over-year decline in its trading and IB revenues in the second quarter of 2023.Saperstein believes that because of a more challenging economic environment, Morgan Stanley’s sales and trading “results will be notably down year over year versus a strong second quarter last year,” while “investment banking is also very challenged.”JPM has also warned that its IB business will be negatively impacted this year because of the economic slowdown and uncertain outlook.At its Investor Day last month, JPM provided guidance for IB and markets revenues, which are expected to be down 15% in the first half of 2023.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But we don't see that in the aggregate productivity number. Productivity growth in the US has been barely 1%, slightly lower. In 10 years, are we going to see a significant increase in productivity? I'm quite optimistic. I'm a productivity optimist and a technology optimist,"" Roubini told Yahoo Finance Live (video above).This week alone brought two examples of generative AI's potential for economic output.First, a new McKinsey study identified 63 generative AI use cases spanning 16 business functions that could unleash $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion in economic benefits annually.The same study found that generative AI could perform each of more than 2,100 detailed work activities such as communicating with others about operational plans.""Generative AI has the potential to change the anatomy of work, augmenting the capabilities of individual workers by automating some of their individual activities. Current generative AI and other technologies have the potential to automate work activities that absorb 60 to 70 percent of employees’ time today,"" McKinsey's researchers noted.UNITED STATES - OCTOBER 11: Dr. Nouriel Roubini of New York University Stern School of Business, testifies during a Senate Banking Committee hearing.

Salesforce says its AI Cloud product will allow marketers to auto-generate personalized content for customers and developers to auto-generate code, among other use cases.Salesforce employees also showed off coming AI functions in the workplace collaboration platform Slack.

And the idea there will be a surge in economic growth in the next two or three years because of AI and technology to me seems to be sort of farfetched,"" Roubini said. ""In the medium long term, technology is going to be deflationary. But we might be facing a decade of stagflation before we see the bright light of technology and AI increasing growth and reducing inflation.""Goldman Sachs estimated recently that generative AI could expose the equivalent of 300 million jobs globally to automation over the next decade. That's a nice way of saying a person may lose their job to a robot.But to Roubini's point, Goldman notes US labor productivity will grow by 1.5% over a 10-year period following the widespread adoption of generative AI.

Conducted in the Spring of 2023, the report is based on a MoneyLive survey of 430 senior executives from across the global banking and lending sector, revealing key insights into the industry's strategic approach to digital technology investment and customer engagement.The study found a discrepancy among the respondents, with 37% seeking to limit technology spending due to the uncertain future, while 63% are committed to sustained investment in new digital technologies to capitalize on future opportunities.“Despite rising interest rates and market volatility, the majority of banks and lenders are recognizing the importance of investing in digital solutions that deliver hyper-personalized customer experiences and build trust,” said Karen Oakland, VP of Financial Services Marketing at Smart Communications. “At the same time, they are doubling down on investments in automation to accelerate turnaround time, eliminate errors, and reduce the burden on contact centers, advisors and other customer-facing employees.”Digital tools and automation will help banks regain customer trust and address skill shortagesAccording to the study, 88% of respondents agreed that the current era of uncertainty presents the best opportunity for banks and lenders to regain customer trust since 2008’s financial crisis. To meet these goals as well as address skill shortages, banks and lenders need digital solutions and better connectivity to new data sets to better understand changing customer needs, ultimately enabling human agents to focus where they can make the biggest difference. The overwhelming majority believe self-service automation and personalized, automated outbound communications, designed to preempt customer contact, will be of major importance in reducing demand for human agents while protecting CX standards. Approximately 90% of survey respondents believe the ability to rapidly scale automated processes when the volume of customer inquiries rises – without increasing fixed costs – will be critical to their success over the next three years.Story continues“The future of customer service in the banking and lending sector lies in hyper-personalization which can only be achieved at scale through digital transformation,” said Anna Bratton, Head of Banking at Salesforce. “Our research shows that 95% of respondents agree that low-friction customer experience (CX) will become a hygiene factor, and the competitive advantage will lie in personalized services that make customers' lives easier.”Digital forms ranks as a top investmentConsumers now expect banks and lenders to provide AI-prompted conversations that guide them through important decisions. The survey also revealed, however, that many organizations have yet to optimize these capabilities across their enterprise. In fact, 92% of respondents agreed that offering “value-added convenience” financial management services will require a level of hyper-personalized, automated digital self-service maturity that many institutions have yet to achieve. Some 77% of respondents reported they are likely to invest in automating digital forms that adapt in response to customer’s answers to create a more conversational experience. Indeed this capability ranked as one of the top investments required for “value-added convenience” financial management services.The future is cloud technology but transformation is slow Smart Communications’ study also showcases the industry's move toward cloud technology is judged to be of great importance for success in the era of uncertainty. However, two-thirds (65%) of surveyed banks and lenders think their organizations face an investment gap when it comes to developing a systems architecture based on cloud, microservices and APIs. Progress is slow with only 4% of respondents reporting that they have crossed the 50% threshold for hosting their applications in the cloud, despite 27% intending to do so within two years.The report concludes with a stark warning: 92% of respondents agree that for a bank or lender to put digital and CX investment on hold during a crisis is to plan to fail when the recovery comes. This survey shows the urgent need for banks and lenders to invest in digital transformation and customer experience initiatives.For more information and to download the report, How Can Banks and Lenders Thrive in the Era of Uncertainty?, can be found here.Join Smart Communications and Salesforce for the MoneyLive webinar, Surviving Seismic Shocks: Strategies to Triumph in a New Banking Era on June 15, 2023 at 3pm BST / 10:00am EDT where attendees can gain additional insights.

The upside can be linked to the company’s focus on pricing and cross-selling actions, and growth initiatives, among other factors. Handsome rewards to shareholders are also expected to have driven the stock higher.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhat’s Aiding AIT?Applied Industrial is gaining from strength across its Service Center Based Distribution and Engineered Solutions segments. The Service Center Based Distribution segment is benefiting from sales process initiatives and favorable pricing actions. Robust technical and engineering capabilities, and solid backlog levels, are aiding the Engineered Solutions segment. Focus on pricing and cross-selling actions and growth initiatives augur well for the company.Applied Industrial’s focus on improving its product line, value-added services and initiatives to drive operational excellence and cost-saving efforts are fueling its growth. Investments to expand automation, the Industrial Internet of Things, digital offerings and customer development initiatives augur well for the company.Applied Industrial’s efforts to reward its shareholders through dividends and share buybacks hold promise. In the first nine months of fiscal 2023, it paid out dividends worth $39.8 million, up 3.2% on a year-over-year basis. The company hiked its quarterly dividend rate by 2.9% in January 2023. In August 2022, the company’s board of directors authorized a new share buyback program to repurchase up to 1.5 million shares of its common stock.Applied Industrial’s measures to expand operations through asset additions support its top-line growth. In April, the company acquired Advanced Motion Systems Inc., expanding its footprint in the upper Northeast region of the United States. The November 2022 acquisition of Automation, Inc. expanded AIT’s footprint across key verticals and geographies while supplementing its value-added services and cross-selling efforts. In third-quarter fiscal 2023, buyouts had a positive impact of nearly 1% on the company's total sales.Story continuesWill the Uptrend in Shares Continue?Softness in the fluid power technology business due to ongoing inbound component delays has been a drag on Applied Industrial’s performance. With the economy reeling under the effects of higher interest rates and tight credit conditions, a slowdown in the broader market activity might weigh on AIT’s performance.Despite adversities, Applied Industrial’s performance is expected to hold up well on strength across its core end markets and improving supply chains. The company’s upbeat guidance highlights the buoyancy surrounding its operations. For fiscal 2023, AIT expects total revenues to increase 14-15% year over year (13-15% increase expected earlier).

But according to Brian Frank, Frank Funds CIO and Frank Value Fund Portfolio Manager, they may be names investors across the U.S. should get to know too. Frank tells Yahoo Finance Live why these two companies are some of his best investing ideas right now.Video TranscriptBRAD SMITH: Welcome back, everyone. Let's talk about another stock we're tracking this morning, Jack in the Box. It's not moving too much at the opening bell right now, but doing well year to date. It's up 35%. And our guest has Jack in the Box as one of his top picks. Let's bring back in Brian Frank, Frank Funds CIO and Frank Value Fund portfolio manager.All right. Why Jack in the Box? Among all the names that are out there in all the king's land, why Jack in the Box?BRIAN FRANK: Well, it's been working for us this year because as you said, it is up over 30%. And most value stocks haven't moved that much. So that's put us towards the top of our category in the Frank Value Fund. Why do we like it? Because they got killed by inflation like everybody else. And the market punished it last year.So we look at stocks that go down and we look at why they're going down. And the determination from our research on Jack in the Box was this inflation pain is temporary. This company will be able to raise their prices and get on top of their costs and get their profit margins back to where they were before the inflation environment.DIANE KING HALL: But who's going to Jack in the Box? I've never been to one before. So where is the demand here?BRIAN FRANK: Coming from the northeast, it's difficult to find a Jack in the Box there, primarily in California, the west and the south. But a lot of people are going. They actually have more sales per store than Burger King. So this is a big established brand with room for expansion. They definitely could expand to the northeast.They just bought another chain called Del Taco, which is in the southeast and the south. They could bring that throughout the United States. There's a lot of room for growth here, both in the margins and the revenue.Story continuesBRAD SMITH: OK. So Jack in the Box, one of the top picks. Where else are you looking and kind of prioritizing, or perhaps even making some new plays as well?BRIAN FRANK: We like defense still, as I mentioned.BRAD SMITH: So like defense-- yeah.BRIAN FRANK: So one of our top plays would be PG&amp;E, which is an electrical company in north in California.BRAD SMITH: Yeah.BRIAN FRANK: Definitely has a rough track record with causing a lot of the wildfires. But they went Chapter 11. They got rid of the entire executive team and they brought in Patti Poppe, who is the first female CEO of two different Fortune 500 companies. And she is spectacular. They've completely reduced wildfires to almost zero.BRAD SMITH: Has sentiment changed on the company?BRIAN FRANK: Sentiment is changing. Yeah. So that's the great thing about value investing is you go in there when everybody hates it. And then you get to see the sentiment kind of build over the years. So it got added to the S&amp;P 500 last year. It was one of our top performers. My fund was up last year when the market was down, thanks to PCG.BRAD SMITH: Does that make crypto a value investment play?DIANE KING HALL: Oh, come on. Sorry, go ahead.BRIAN FRANK: Crypto doesn't pay me a dividend if we're not going to talk about staking.BRAD SMITH: Smart.BRIAN FRANK: So I--DIANE KING HALL: We're not going to talk about Bruno.BRIAN FRANK: And speaking of dividends, PCG, in terms of riding that chain higher, they're going to initiate a dividend this year, which all utility stocks must have. And that'll bring more investors to the fold and perhaps they get added to the XLU.DIANE KING HALL: All right. We handled that wild card about crypto well. Thank you. All right. Our thanks to Brian Frank, Frank Funds CIO and Frank Value Fund portfolio manager.]"
60,b8024382-eb15-38a6-9782-694d40873a4b,MRO,2023-06-15,Top 20 Most Profitable Energy Companies in the World,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-20-most-profitable-energy-135825840.html,1686751105,STORY,"['EOG', 'XOM', 'PSX', 'CVX', 'EC', 'MPC', 'COP', 'VLO', 'OXY', 'LUKOY', 'MRO']","[In this piece, we will take a look at the top twenty most profitable energy companies in the world. To skip our detailed analysis of the energy industry, head on over to Top 5 Most Profitable Energy Companies in the World. Energy is one of the most important - and one of the most controversial - industries in the modern world. The industry has contributed the most to human development by vast amounts of cheap energy to run airplanes, cars, factories, and homes. At the same time, the costs of generating this power have taken their toll on the environment.For instance, our study of the most polluting companies in the world shows that the top three firms that have emitted the most carbon dioxide between 1751 and 2018 are oil companies. These firms are Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), and Saudi Arabian Oil Company (TADAWUL:2222.SR) - which are also coincidentally among some of the biggest oil companies in the world.At the same time, the energy industry saw renewed investor attention and demand last year as the Russian invasion of Ukraine took place. This led to a disruption of the global oil industry and made the Western world in particular focus on non Russian oil sources. In terms of market value, the oil industry is one of the most valuable in the world. For instance, according to research from The Business Research Company, the crude oil market was worth $2.7 trillion in 2022 and will be worth $2.9 trillion in 2023. From this year until 2027 the second is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.6% to sit at $3.4 trillion by the end of the forecast period. The firm believes that this growth will primarily come from the developing world, particularly due to the fast growing economies of India and China. And, 'coincidentally'. once again, India and China are also two of the three countries with the most carbon dioxide emissions.Additionally, even though the crude oil industry is worth trillions of dollars, the renewable energy industry is quite lucrative as well. Precedence Research believes that the global renewable energy market was worth $1 trillion in 2022 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 8.6% until 2030 to be worth an estimated $1.9 trillion by then. Looking at the industry sector wise, the data shows that the solar energy segment will outpace the broader market's growth through a 13.5% CAGR. These figures are quite telling, as despite being a relatively young industry in terms of global interest, the renewable energy industry is still quite large and is catching up to at least crude oil in terms of market value. Within the industry, there are countless renewable energy stocks that have caught hedge fund attention. The selection depends on different factors, such as cheap, profitable, and overall best renewable energy stocks. Some top cheap renewable energy stocks include Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Enphase Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH) and NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE). If you're interested to learn about most profitable renewable energy stocks then the top names are Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), and Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL), and overall, here are the best renewable energy stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors.Story continuesGetting into the nitty gritty of the renewable energy industry, not only did the coronavirus pandemic nearly upend the global oil supply chain, but the post war shocks also impacted solar and wind power supply chains. According to McKinsey, materials such as polysilicon used to make solar panels and others such as aluminum, steel, and copper often have unpredictable supply chains. Most polysilicon supply originates from China, making it vulnerable to natural disasters and factory incidents - which led to the prices of this crucial raw material growing by a whopping 350% between 2020 and 2022. It adds that the wind turbine industry faced high costs after the Russian invasion of Ukraine since the wind turbine companies did not hedge their material prices. However, despite these constraints, McKinsey also estimates that between 2021 and 2030, planned power generation from solar and wind power projects is slated to grow from 125 gigawatts to 459 gigawatts. Out of these, the bulk will be generated from solar photovoltaic projects (or solar panels as they're commonly known) and most of the remainder will come from on shore wind projects.Digging deeper into the countless energy stocks trading on the market, notable cheap energy stocks are PDC Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:PDCE), Coterra Energy Inc. (NYSE:CTRA), and Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE:MRO). Interested in dividends? Well, we've identified 11 best energy dividend stocks as well, and some best energy stocks overall are Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE:VLO), EOG Resources, Inc. (NYSE:EOG), and ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP).However, as the market estimates show, traditional energy is here to stay, and taking a current look at the industry, here's what the management of Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) had to say during the firm's latest earnings call:First quarter oil equivalent production was down about 80,000 barrels per day from last year due to the expiration of a contract in Thailand and the sale of our Eagle Ford asset.This was partially offset by growth in the Permian. We expect 2023 production growth in the Permian to be back-end loaded as wells put on production, POPs increase across both operated and non-operated areas. We expect our royalty production to be roughly flat. As discussed during our Investor Day, we’re increasing activity in New Mexico. All four company-operated rigs added this year, one each quarter, will be in New Mexico, leading to more POPs expected in the second half of the year and into 2024. We also continue to be active in Texas. Last year, about half of our company-operated production was in the Delaware Basin in Texas with the remainder split about evenly between the Midland Basin and New Mexico. More than half of our non-operated production is with five major operators in large, contiguous positions in core areas with multiyear development programs, where we have visibility to capex and execution schedules and a royalty benefit compared to the operator.With these details in mind, let's take a look at some of the most profitable energy companies in the world. Some top names are  Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Saudi Arabian Oil Company (TADAWUL:2222.SR), and Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL).Top 20 Most Profitable Energy Companies in the WorldPhoto by Robin Sommer on UnsplashOur Methodology To compile our list of the most profitable oil companies, we sifted out energy companies with the highest net profits.Top 20 Most Profitable Energy Companies in the World20.

But we don't see that in the aggregate productivity number. Productivity growth in the US has been barely 1%, slightly lower. In 10 years, are we going to see a significant increase in productivity? I'm quite optimistic. I'm a productivity optimist and a technology optimist,"" Roubini told Yahoo Finance Live (video above).This week alone brought two examples of generative AI's potential for economic output.First, a new McKinsey study identified 63 generative AI use cases spanning 16 business functions that could unleash $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion in economic benefits annually.The same study found that generative AI could perform each of more than 2,100 detailed work activities such as communicating with others about operational plans.""Generative AI has the potential to change the anatomy of work, augmenting the capabilities of individual workers by automating some of their individual activities. Current generative AI and other technologies have the potential to automate work activities that absorb 60 to 70 percent of employees’ time today,"" McKinsey's researchers noted.UNITED STATES - OCTOBER 11: Dr. Nouriel Roubini of New York University Stern School of Business, testifies during a Senate Banking Committee hearing. (Photo By Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call) (Tom Williams via Getty Images)Meanwhile, software giant Salesforce (CRM) took the wraps off its new GPT enterprise products designed to boost worker productivity.The company introduced ""AI Cloud"" at a New York City investor day. Salesforce says its AI Cloud product will allow marketers to auto-generate personalized content for customers and developers to auto-generate code, among other use cases.Salesforce employees also showed off coming AI functions in the workplace collaboration platform Slack. Most of Salesforce's new AI suite will begin rolling out in the coming months.Story continues""We've seen a lot of exciting waves of technology in our industry — the cloud, social, mobile — but this AI wave is going be the biggest that anyone has ever seen,"" Salesforce co-founder, chairman, and CEO Marc Benioff told Yahoo Finance Live.Despite AI's promising positive impact on the economy, Roubini and other experts do warn about the drawbacks.""I think there are meaningful lags [on AI's impact]. And the idea there will be a surge in economic growth in the next two or three years because of AI and technology to me seems to be sort of farfetched,"" Roubini said. ""In the medium long term, technology is going to be deflationary. But we might be facing a decade of stagflation before we see the bright light of technology and AI increasing growth and reducing inflation.""Goldman Sachs estimated recently that generative AI could expose the equivalent of 300 million jobs globally to automation over the next decade. That's a nice way of saying a person may lose their job to a robot.But to Roubini's point, Goldman notes US labor productivity will grow by 1.5% over a 10-year period following the widespread adoption of generative AI.

Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley and Alexis Keenan explain what EU is alleging and how Google is responding. They also explain a judge's decision to temporarily block Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard.Video Transcript[AUDIO LOGO]JULIE HYMAN: European regulators are suggesting that Google calm its concerns over unfair competition by selling part of its ad business. The regulator is issuing a report saying that Alphabet, Google's parent company, appears to be breaching antitrust rules. Google now faces regulatory challenges on both sides of the Atlantic.With more on this is Yahoo Finance's Alexis Keenan and Dan Howley is back with us. Alexis, first of all, what does this EU report mean exactly? What are the implications?ALEXIS KEENAN: Yes. So this is a preliminary report by the EU's antitrust regulator, the European Commission. And what they're doing is they're putting Google on notice to say, we don't like your ad tech business. We think it violates European antitrust. Laws and we would like you to divest some of the businesses that you have in that market.They say that Google is using its dominance in that market to unfairly participate in the place where publishers and advertisers converge to buy and sell advertising online.They also-- I want to note that the US is also charging Google with a very similar violation of antitrust laws. So the company is facing this problem on both sides of the Atlantic. Now, Google, of course, not liking this measure. It's a huge revenue stream for the company. It responded by saying that the EC's investigation focuses on a narrow aspect of its business, and that it's not new.The company spokesperson went on to say that the company will oppose any measure that the EU takes to try to make it divest any of these businesses, and it would push back in that regard. Now, the EC report for the actual words on the paper there, they go like this, they say that the EU's preliminary view is that only mandatory divestment by Google of part of its services would address its competition concerns.Story continuesAnd it says that this alleged self-preferencing that they say that the company is engaging in is possibly harmed Google's competitors, also publishers, as well as driving up advertising costs. So those are the main concerns there. But this is a preliminary step, possibly one to start opening up negotiations with the company if it will do so so.AKIKO FUJITA: It's a preliminary step. But, Dan, we know the EU has been the most aggressive, especially on regulating big tech, specifically American tech. What does this mean in terms of the pressure Google faces back home here in the US and ultimately, to Alexis' point, it is the big revenue driver for the company?DAN HOWLEY: Yeah, I mean, in their statement, the European Commission basically said that they're working with the US, the DOJ, in particular. So obviously, there's a close relationship. And then they went on to mention some of the member countries that they've worked with to get data on this.For Google itself, the breakdown is astonishing. Google advertising in 2022 accounted for $224.5 billion of their $282.8 billion in total revenue. So it's a massive, massive amount of money that they depend on for their advertising business. The rest is, you know, stuff like Google Cloud, other bets, things here and there. But it's basically pennies compared to what they have as far as the advertising business.If they're forced to break that up, I mean, you can only imagine what that would mean. It also is worth pointing out that Facebook is one of the largest advertising companies in the world as well or platforms that companies use, so could help build up on Facebook's kind of power in this area. I think that's something that's worth mentioning.JULIE HYMAN: I don't really understand what Google is allegedly doing wrong here. Can you explain to us?DAN HOWLEY: Yeah. Yeah. So essentially, what they are is they're saying that they're acting as all three pieces of a kind of buy and sell scheme, right, not scheme is a negative, just how it works, right? So they're saying they're working for the ad buyers, the ad sellers, and then the intermediary, where that buyers and sellers exchange to see where ads get placed.And so because they're able to do this, they say that they were self-preferencing themselves, able to offer better bids than they would get publishers would see otherwise or advertisers see otherwise. And so because of that, they're saying that's really where the issues arise and why they shouldn't be able to continue to operate in this manner.So, you know, it's interesting when you see it laid out in the chart the European Commission had sent one out and you look at it, you're like, oh, whoa, that? Yeah, that doesn't look right. So I mean-- and then they go into discussion about how Google is able to change things here and there and make it look maybe kind of not necessarily obfuscate, but make it look better than it otherwise would be presented.So yeah, when you see it laid out like that, it's kind of stunning to see.AKIKO FUJITA: Well, you have to wonder to your point Facebook, Meta, Amazon, I mean, they're all watching this closely to see what this means for their operations in the EU.Let's talk about what's happening here in the US. There's another company that could be dealt a huge blow here. And we're talking about this acquisition of Activision Blizzard by Microsoft. What's the very latest there? And what does it mean, ultimately, for how this could all be resolved?DAN HOWLEY: Yeah. So a federal judge has basically said that the idea here is Microsoft wants to buy Activision Blizzard. There was worry at the FTC that they would go ahead and do that, complete the acquisition prior to the FTC being able to work out their lawsuit against Microsoft. Trying to block the deal, right?So they went ahead, FTC, and talked to a federal judge. Got filed their suit. Said, look, we want to be able to block Microsoft from being able to complete this acquisition before we have our own set. And so this basically means that Microsoft is on hold until then. And we'll see whether or not they can go ahead and complete the acquisition or not prior to the FTC when the case is taken up later this month.But, you know, for Microsoft, it would be their largest acquisition, $70 billion, would mean that they would get the whole of Activision Blizzard's IP. And it would make them the third largest video game company in the world by revenue. So a lot goes into this. You know, the EU is OK with it. The UK is not. Other countries are OK with it. So it seems like it's dividing a lot of opinion.ALEXIS KEENAN: So the big thing here to watch, though, is next week and that is on the 22nd and the 23rd of the month. The judge in this case is going to hold a hearing to decide whether a more permanent injunction-- it's called a preliminary injunction. But should an injunction block this deal from going forward while the FTC figures out what it wants to do on an administrative level, that's outside of the court that's being handled by an administrative law judge.So that is the date if the judge decides after that hearing that this deal is going to be blocked during the pendency of that review, then the lawyers that I have talked to in this space, they say, then you should better expect that maybe this deal is now off the table. So we'll be watching for that.JULIE HYMAN: Interesting. All right, mark your calendars, June 22, 23. Thank you so much, Alexis and Dan. Appreciate it.]"

Walgreens will combine its national footprint, patient insights, compliant recruitment technology and local infrastructure to engage diverse patient populations in Freenome’s multi-cancer research program.This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230615952368/en/""At Walgreens, our aim is to help every community we serve see clinical research as a viable care option,"" said Ramita Tandon, chief clinical trials officer, Walgreens. ""Through our nationwide presence and trusted pharmacists, we can reach and engage previously underserved patient populations for clinical trials. Supporting the identification of cancers when they are most treatable is one more way we are helping to improve health outcomes of our communities and patients while advancing research in oncology.""Working together with technology provider Curebase, Walgreens will initially recruit patients across diverse populations for Freenome’s Sanderson Study, which aims to evaluate blood-based early detection tests for multiple cancers. Using Curebase’s platform, Walgreens will deliver targeted outreach to potentially eligible patients and caregivers of all backgrounds via text, email or in-person consultation at the pharmacy. After completing a pre-screen, eligible patients are invited to enroll in the study. Walgreens healthcare providers will then perform a single blood draw at one of the company’s clinical trial locations and conduct a telehealth patient follow-up one year after their participation.""Freenome’s goal is to make early cancer screening more convenient for everyone, and our clinical research should reflect that availability and accessibility. With community reach, study conduct capabilities, national presence and real-world data generation resources, Walgreens is a natural partner to help deliver on that goal,"" said Lance Baldo, chief medical officer, Freenome. ""This collaboration is an important step in advancing early cancer detection.""Story continuesThe Sanderson Study will enroll approximately 8,000 participants through its clinical study partner network, which includes Walgreens.

The collaboration between Walgreens and Freenome aligns with the National Cancer Plan’s goals of detecting cancer early and eliminating inequities. Cancer claims nearly 2,000 lives daily in the United States, but proactive screening tests can help find cancer at an early stage even before symptoms appear1. Additionally, Black individuals of all ages have higher mortality rates than any other racial or ethnic groups for many cancer types2.Walgreens and Freenome will also work together on building risk-prediction models and population health software. The aim is to help close existing care gaps and identify people who are eligible and stand to benefit from standard-of-care cancer detection testing. Real-world data collected by Walgreens as part of this collaboration will inform the development of new products and services in Freenome’s multi-cancer detection research, including the company’s blood-based colorectal cancer screening test.Since launching in June 2022, Walgreens clinical trials business has directly addressed industrywide access, experience and diversity challenges via its three service lines focused on patient recruitment, decentralized clinical trials and real-world evidence. Built on a fully compliant regulatory framework, the central focus of the Walgreens clinical trials experience remains patient choice.

Those proposals include at least a dozen measures that would bolster residential real estate and consumer spending.Stimulus programs in China, unlike those in the United States, don’t typically involve sending payments to individual households. Instead, the programs are geared toward accelerating commercial activity by lowering interest rates and easing loan costs, which frees up more money for banks to lend.On Tuesday, the People’s Bank of China “unexpectedly” cut a series of short-term interest rates, Bloomberg reported. That move is expected to pave the way for a key longer-term policy rate reduction.So what does all this mean for Americans?As CNBC reported this week on its Investing Club site, China has been taking “consistent and steady action” to accelerate its economic rebound — something that could be a “positive sign” for consumer spending, even amid ongoing economic uncertainty.“Based on recent retail sales data coming out of China, there’s clearly pent-up consumer demand, signaling to investors … that there’s more upside ahead for companies doing business there,” CNBC noted.Those companies include Estee Lauder, Starbucks and Wynn Resorts.Last month Wynn posted strong first-quarter results thanks to a recovery in the Asian gambling hub of Macao — a signal that “robust consumer spending on travel and experiences” will continue in coming quarters, according to CNBC. Because of a recent slump in shares, Wynn might provide a buying opportunity for investors.Story continuesSimilarly, Starbucks in May delivered good numbers for its fiscal second quarter even amid a slowdown in its shares, which provides another buying opportunity.Take Our Poll: Are You Planning To Buy or Sell a House This Year?Estee Lauder’s latest results, for its fiscal third quarter, were more mixed, leading the beauty company to issue “terrible guidance” that led to a major sell-off in shares.

(AP) — Jurors in federal court have awarded $25.6 million to a former Starbucks regional manager who alleged that she and other white employees were unfairly punished after the high-profile arrests of two Black men at a Philadelphia location in 2018.Shannon Phillips won $600,000 in compensatory damages and $25 million in punitive damages on Monday after a jury in New Jersey found that race was a determinative factor in Phillips' firing, in violation of federal and state anti-discrimination.In April 2018, a Philadelphia store manager called police on two Black men who were sitting in the coffee shop without ordering anything. Phillips, then regional manager of operations in Philadelphia, southern New Jersey, and elsewhere, was not involved with arrests. However, she said she was ordered to put a white manager who also wasn't involved on administrative leave for reasons she knew were false, according to her lawsuit.Phillips said she was fired less than a month later after objecting to the manager being placed on leave amid the uproar, according to her lawsuit.The company's rationale for suspending the district manager, who was not responsible for the store where the arrests took place, was an allegation that Black store managers were being paid less than white managers, according to the lawsuit. Phillips said that argument made no sense since district managers had no input on employee salaries.The lawsuit alleged Starbucks was instead taking steps to “punish white employees” who worked in the area “in an effort to convince the community that it had properly responded to the incident.”During closing arguments on Friday, Phillips' lawyer Laura Mattiacci told jurors that the company was looking for a “sacrificial lamb” to calm the outrage and show that it was taking action, Law360 reported. Picking a Black employee for such a purpose “would have blown up in their faces,” she said.Starbucks denied Phillips' allegations, saying the company needed someone with a track record of “strength and resolution” during a crisis and replaced her with a regional manager who had such experience, including navigating the aftermath of the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings, Law360 reported.Story continuesPhillips' attorney, however, cited earlier testimony from a Black district manager, who was responsible for the store where the arrests took place, who described Phillips as someone beloved by her peers and who worked around the clock after the arrests.In an email to The Associated Press, Mattiacci confirmed the award amount and said the judge will consider awarding back pay and future pay, as well as attorney’s fees. Mattiacci told the New Jersey Law Journal that she will seek about $3 million for lost pay, and roughly $1 million on her fee application. Starbucks declined comment Tuesday.In the April 2018 incident, Rashon Nelson and Donte Robinson were arrested in a Starbucks coffee shop near tony Rittenhouse Square in Philadelphia shortly after the manager called police to report that two men were refusing to either make a purchase or leave the premises. They were later released without charges.Video of the arrest prompted national outcry and led the current CEO of Starbucks to personally apologize to the men. The company later reached a settlement with both men for an undisclosed sum and an offer of free college education. The company also changed store policies and closed locations across the country for an afternoon for racial-bias training.The two men also reached a deal with the city of Philadelphia for a symbolic $1 each and a promise from officials to set up a $200,000 program for young entrepreneurs. The Philadelphia Police Department adopted a new policy on how to deal with people accused of trespassing on private property — warning businesses against misusing the authority of police officers.]"

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this agribusiness giant have returned +1.5% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +6.1% change. The Zacks Agriculture - Operations industry, to which ADM belongs, has gained 0.9% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, ADM is expected to post earnings of $1.54 per share, indicating a change of -28.4% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -2.5% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.84 points to a change of -12.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.2%.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.17 indicates a change of -9.9% from what ADM is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.2%.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for ADM.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of ADM, the consensus sales estimate of $24.94 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -8.6%. The $97.8 billion and $97.99 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -4% and +0.2%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryADM reported revenues of $24.07 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +1.8%. EPS of $2.09 for the same period compares with $1.90 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $23.48 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.52%. The EPS surprise was +22.22%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.ADM is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about ADM. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

At the psychological level, a certain pioneering appeal exists about discovering the next big thing before the crowd arrives.Certainly, getting in before the masses may yield blistering rewards. Contextually, market participants today may be much more incentivized to consider the top undervalued stocks for investment. Sure, the latest jobs report suggests that anyone who wants to find employment can get it. However, with the length of time people spend looking for work likely increasing, not all is well with the economy. Thus, buying overheated securities presents significant risks. Plus, let’s face reality: no one wants to end up holding the bag. In fairness, going the discount route doesn’t guarantee anything. But you may be able to improve your odds with high potential undervalued stocks.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAvis Budget (CAR)assortment of cars in a parking lot representing GETR stock.Source: ShutterstockPerhaps an oddball idea for the most undervalued stocks to buy, Avis Budget (NASDAQ:CAR) might seem risky given economic challenges. A leading global provider of mobility solutions through its Avis and Budget brands, the company depends on strong travel sentiment. Fortunately, the revenge travel phenomenon that started following the initial relaxing of Covid-19 protocols continues to be relevant today. Notably, CAR stock gained almost 17% since the Jan. opener.Moving onto data provided by investment resource Gurufocus, the market prices CAR at a forward multiple of 11.44. As a discount to projected earnings, Avis ranks better than 71.52% of companies listed in the business services sector. Also, CAR trades at 0.66-times trailing sales, ranking better than 65.49% of its rivals.However, these aren’t fluff statistics. In particular, Avis’ three-year revenue growth rate (on a per-share basis) clocks in at 30%, above 92.3% of sector players. Also, its EBITDA growth rate during the same period impresses at 42.7%. Finally, Wall Street analysts peg CAR as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target lands at $226.25, implying nearly 18% upside potential. Thus, it might be one of the top undervalued stocks for investment.Story continuesPhillips 66 (PSX)Person holding the glowing world in their hands with icons with different types of energy. Top energy stocks for high returnsSource: PopTika / ShutterstockOn the surface, downstream hydrocarbon energy specialist Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) might seem an irrelevant idea for most undervalued stocks to buy. With more people making the transition to electric vehicles, fewer people will need to use gasoline stations. While true, the integration of EVs is nowhere near the scale of combustion cars on the road today. So, people will need downstream specialists today, tomorrow and maybe even decades from now.Another factor that makes PSX stand among the high potential undervalued stocks are the attractive financial metrics. First, the market prices PSX at a trailing multiple of 3.91. As a discount to earnings, Phillips 66 ranks better than 75.7% of the competition. Also, PSX trades at 0.28-times trailing sales, well below the sector median stat of 0.89 times.However, on the top line, Phillips 66’s three-year revenue growth rate clocks in at 14.9%, above 60.52% of peers in the oil and gas industry. Also, its EBITDA growth rate is 39.3%, above 77.56%. Lastly, analysts peg PSX as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target hits $119.89, implying nearly 19% upside potential.Albemarle (ALB)Lithium element on the periodic table. Undervalued Lithium StocksSource: tunasalmon / ShutterstockHeadquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina, Albemarle (NYSE:ALB) is a global specialty chemicals company with leading positions in lithium, bromine and refining catalysts. Per its corporate ethos, Albemarle empowers the potential of companies in critical industries such as energy, electronics and transportation. Usually, analysts cite ALB as a lithium provider. It also happens to be one of the most undervalued stocks to buy. That’s the case even with shares soaring nearly 18% in the trailing one-month period. Specifically, the market prices ALB at a forward multiple of 11.53. As a discount to projected earnings, Albemarle ranks better than 66.45% of companies listed in the chemicals industry.In addition, the company delivers strong stats in the operational realm. Its three-year revenue growth rate pings at 22.6%, outflanking 81% of sector rivals. Also, its EBITDA growth rate during the same period stands at 45.7%, above 89.19% of industry players. To close, analysts peg ALB as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target comes in at $261.88, implying nearly 20% upside potential. Thus, it’s a worthy idea for best undervalued stocks for high returns.Archer Daniels Midland (ADM)man's hand holding wads of cash. stocks to buy. Stocks With 1000% UpsideSource: Vova Shevchuk / Shutterstock.comComing in as a top name among the most undervalued stocks to buy, Archer Daniels Midland (NYSE:ADM) should rate highly thanks to its permanently relevant business. A global leader in human and animal nutrition and the world’s premier agricultural origination and processing company per its public profile, investors enjoy long-term confidence with ADM. However, since the beginning of the year, shares slipped over 18%.While the red ink might look bad, the main argument is that we’re talking about a solid enterprise succumbing to rough circumstances. Therefore, Gurufocus labels ADM a legitimately undervalued trade. Presently, the market prices share at a forward multiple of 10.57. As a discount to projected earnings, Archer Daniels ranks better than 80.53% of the competition.In addition, the company benefits from strong operational stats. Its three-year revenue growth rate clocks in at 16.4%, ranked above 77.43% of sector peers. Also, its EBITDA growth rate during the same period is 30.8%, above 80.88%. Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg ADM as a moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $95.29, implying nearly 30% upside potential.Ovintiv (OVV)Man holding stacks of money. Top millionaire-maker stocks to buySource: Epic Cure / ShutterstockAn enticing idea among the most undervalued stocks to buy, Ovintiv (NYSE:OVV) is a hydrocarbon exploration and production company. While the political narrative presently centers on clean and renewable energy sources, the vast majority of society depends on fossil fuels. Thanks to their incredible energy density, hydrocarbons will be difficult to give up. That’s just reality. That’s just science.Cynically, then, Ovintiv presents a powerful case if you want to buy undervalued stocks now. As Gurufocus pointed out, OVV represents a significant discount. By the numbers, OVV trades at a forward multiple of 4.78. As a discount to projected earnings, Ovintiv ranks better than 80.36% of the competition. Also, shares trade at 4.29-times FCF, ranked better than 71.24% of its peers.Operationally, Ovintiv’s three-year revenue growth rate clocks in at 23.3%, above 75.79% of sector players. Also, its EBITDA growth rate hits 22.9%, above 61.1%. Looking to the Street, analysts peg OVV as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target lands at $49.73, implying over 30% upside potential.Nutrien (NTR)An image of a street sign post with directions labeled ""Buy"", ""Hold"", and ""Sell""Source: PX Media / ShutterstockA Canadian fertilizer company, Nutrien (NYSE:NTR) symbolizes a pertinent idea for most undervalued stocks to buy. Per its corporate profile, Nutrien is the world’s largest provider of crop inputs and services, playing a critical role in helping growers increase food production in a sustainable manner. Specifically, the company produces and distributes 27 million tons of potash, nitrogen and phosphate products worldwide.However, the market has a dim view of NTR, seeing it slide down over 17% since the Jan. opener. And that’s where the true contrarian comes out. If you’re interested in top undervalued stocks for investment, Nutrien appears quite tempting. Specifically, the market prices NTR at a trailing multiple of only 4.66. As a discount to earnings, the company ranks better than 90.61% of the agriculture industry. Operationally, Nutrien also delivers the goods. Its three-year revenue growth rate hits 28.1%, above 76.64% of sector rivals. Plus, its EBITDA growth rate during the same frame impresses at 57.8%. Lastly, analysts peg NTR as a moderate buy. Their average price target comes in at $79.13, implying over 33% upside potential.Stellantis (STLA)A flag with the logo for Stellantis waves outside a building with the logos for some of its car brands, including Abarth, Lancia, Fiat, Alfa Romeo and Jeep.Source: Antonello Marangi / Shutterstock.comOne of the world’s leading automakers, Stellantis (NYSE:STLA) might not be a household name. However, many of its automotive brands – such as Alfa Romeo, Chrysler, Dodge, Fiat and Jeep – very much are. Fundamentally, the beauty of Stellantis is that it can electrify several popular combustion-based models. For example, Dodge will launch an electric muscle car, with all the noise that such a platform implies.Just speaking on my behalf, I can’t wait – an EV with a personality! Aside from individual biases, STLA legitimately rates as one of the most undervalued stocks to buy. In particular, the market prices STLA at a forward multiple of 3.33. As a discount to projected earnings, Stellantis ranks better than 97.11% of the competition. Also, it trades a lowly FCF multiple of 4.4.On the operational front, Stellantis’ three-year revenue growth rate pings at 14.6%, ranked above 75.79% of rivals. Also, its EBITDA growth rate during the same period comes in at 32.2%, above 84.72%. On a final note, analysts peg STLA as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target lands at $22.35, implying over 39% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

(NYSE:LUV) Before Its Ex-Dividend?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/income-investors-look-southwest-airlines-100516865.html,1686823516,STORY,['LUV'],"[Some investors rely on dividends for growing their wealth, and if you're one of those dividend sleuths, you might be intrigued to know that Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE:LUV) is about to go ex-dividend in just four days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important because any transaction on a stock needs to have been settled before the record date in order to be eligible for a dividend. Thus, you can purchase Southwest Airlines' shares before the 20th of June in order to receive the dividend, which the company will pay on the 12th of July.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.18 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$0.72 per share. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Southwest Airlines stock has a trailing yield of around 2.1% on the current share price of $33.57. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether Southwest Airlines's dividend is reliable and sustainable. So we need to investigate whether Southwest Airlines can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow. View our latest analysis for Southwest Airlines Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. That's why it's good to see Southwest Airlines paying out a modest 32% of its earnings. A useful secondary check can be to evaluate whether Southwest Airlines generated enough free cash flow to afford its dividend.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with shrinking earnings are tricky from a dividend perspective. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. Southwest Airlines's earnings per share have fallen at approximately 28% a year over the previous five years. Such a sharp decline casts doubt on the future sustainability of the dividend.Story continuesThe main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. In the past 10 years, Southwest Airlines has increased its dividend at approximately 34% a year on average.To Sum It UpIs Southwest Airlines worth buying for its dividend? Southwest Airlines's earnings per share have fallen noticeably and, although it paid out less than half its profit as dividends last year, it paid out a disconcertingly high percentage of its cashflow, which is not a great combination. Bottom line: Southwest Airlines has some unfortunate characteristics that we think could lead to sub-optimal outcomes for dividend investors.With that in mind though, if the poor dividend characteristics of Southwest Airlines don't faze you, it's worth being mindful of the risks involved with this business. For example, Southwest Airlines has 2 warning signs (and 1 which is potentially serious) we think you should know about.A common investing mistake is buying the first interesting stock you see.

The move is likely to draw more shoppers to SPG’s shopping centers, fortifying its place in the retail real estate market.The brand has been offering top-shelf gaming and streaming equipment, ranging from laptops and desktops to keyboards, headphones and more, to hundreds of millions of its fans globally for more than 16 years.SPG’s King of Prussia — in the greater Philadelphia region, Roosevelt Field on Long Island, The Florida Mall in Orlando, Dadeland Mall in Miami and The Domain in Austin are set to house the new RazerStore shops, providing shoppers a chance to explore their products.With five exclusive zones dedicated to pro-gaming setups, streamers, console gamers, digital creators and apparel and a demo station where people can unbox and share videos of their latest purchase with friends, RazerStore is likely to offer a thrilling experience to shoppers.The brand also plans to offer regular esports and gaming events with local collegiate organizations, which is expected to bolster shoppers’ enthusiasm further.Per Zach Beloff, vice president of Leasing at Simon Property, “We are excited to work with Razer to bring their cutting-edge computers and gaming hardware to new and existing shoppers. The properties selected will expose Razer to tens of millions of customers annually and position them next to best-in-class global brands.”This retail real estate investment trust (REIT) behemoth’s successful tie-ups with premium retailers have paid off well in recent years. Also, exploring the mixed-use development option, which has gained immense popularity in recent years, has enabled it to capture the attention of people who prefer to live, work and play in the same area.This May, Simon Property extended its already successful partnership with The Webster, a luxury multi-branded retailer, to introduce three new boutiques at the former’s shopping centers — The Shops at Riverside (New Jersey) in early October of 2023, Lenox Square (Atlanta) in late summer 2024 and The Domain (Austin) in early fall 2024.In the same month, SPG also expanded its collaboration with Five Below, Inc.

Five Below will offer a variety of products for tweens, teens and beyond at seven or more Premium Outlets locations.Moreover, staying abreast with industry trends and consumer preferences, SPG recently kick-started the construction of a new Residence Inn by Marriott MAR, set to offer 167 rooms upon completion in 2025 at Northgate Station. This landmark venture represents the first hotel within the Northgate Station complex. The development of Residence Inn by Marriott will continue in stages throughout 2023, with a new recreational area scheduled to open in the summer.The renewed enthusiasm in consumers’ preference for an in-person shopping experience following the pandemic downtime has driven the recovery in the retail real estate industry. Retailers continue to rent out more physical store spaces to meet this growing demand, which has been aiding leasing activity at SPG’s properties lately.Also, this retail REIT’s focus on omni-channel retailing and premium acquisitions and transformative redevelopments backed by a solid balance sheet position bode well for long-term growth.Nonetheless, growing e-commerce adoption and limited consumers’ willingness to spend amid macroeconomic uncertainty and high interest rates remain key concerns for the company.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have lost 5.5% in the year-to-date period against the industry’s growth of 2.5%.Story continuesYou can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchNote: Anything related to earnings presented in this write-up represent funds from operations (FFO) — a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

They could book a business trip to see one client and expense pricey meals. Now senior managers are needed to sign off on expenditures and travel requires seeing multiple clients, the sources said.If revenues don't bounce back alongside the aggressive cost-cutting measures, more employees can expect to be laid off this year, one of the sources said. The bank has let go of 3,700 employees since September.Managing directors will also be given goals for budget reductions and be held responsible for delivering them, one of the sources said.""We have repeatedly emphasized our focus on expense management in this environment, and are delivering on the $1 billion plan we laid out at investor day to drive efficiencies and deliver for shareholders,"" a Goldman Sachs spokesperson said in a statement.The latest round of penny-pinching comes as Goldman Sachs management grew more pessimistic about an economic recovery and dealmaking this year. Investment banking revenue for the industry is so far down nearly 46% in the second quarter from same quarter a year earlier, preliminary data from Dealogic shows for the period April 1 to June 6.Goldman Sachs investment banking revenue is down 52% in that same period, the Dealogic data showed. Goldman declined to comment on the data.Goldman's trading revenue, which recorded its second-best year in 2022 at $25.67 billion due to market volatility, is also shrinking.Story continuesBut it is the firm's ill-fated foray into retail banking that has captivated the industry because it is a rare, and public, flop for the bank.When Silicon Valley and Signature banks failed in March, Goldman staff joked that the turmoil was a blessing in disguise for CEO David Solomon because it drew attention away from the company's travails, three sources familiar with the situation said.Now, the bank is preparing to lay off just under 250 people, including partners and managing directors in its most senior ranks. The cuts have already begun, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. Since the dismissals affect fewer than 250 employees globally, Goldman Sachs does not have to issue an advance notice to employees of layoff plans under U.S. law, one of the sources said.Goldman Sachs said in February it aims to reduce payroll expenses by $600 million, a figure that President John Waldron said earlier in June it could exceed by the end of the year.John Waldron, president and Chief Operating Officer of Goldman Sachs, speaks during the Goldman Sachs Investor Day at Goldman Sachs Headquarters in New York City, U.S., February 28, 2023. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid (Brendan McDermid / reuters)Goldman is not alone in curbing costs. Morgan Stanley is cutting 3,000 staff this quarter, Lazard Ltd plans to reduce 10% of its workforce, and Citigroup Inc also intends to pare down. But Goldman's January layoffs were its biggest since 2008, and it is seen as a bellwether for Wall Street's fortunes because it often occupies top rankings in banking and trading.The bank's financial woes have put a dent in its valuation. Goldman Sachs trades at 0.97 times its book value, lagging rivals Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co which trade at 1.45 times and 1.33 times, respectively, according to Refintiv data.Investors are assessing whether Goldman's strategy — to expand asset management alongside its traditional mainstay of trading — will bear fruit.""Goldman does have a very cyclical business,"" said UBS analyst Brennan Hawken. ""There's no denying the headwinds they're facing. It's a clear realization that this is not temporary.""The headcount reductions and cost cutting do not solve Goldman's fundamental challenges: its reliance on investment banking and trading.That compares with Morgan Stanley, where profits from wealth management have provided a cushion against weakness in dealmaking.""It feels pretty difficult out there right now, and challenging,"" Waldron told investors at a conference on June 1. ""We're more cautious. We're running the firm tighter.""(Reporting by Saeed Azhar, Lananh Nguyen and Tatiana Bautzer; additional reporting by Andrea Januta in New York and Niket Nishant in Bengaluru; Editing by Anna Driver)]"

A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price.

The investment bank is paying out a dividend of $2.5 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 2.92% compared to the Financial - Investment Bank industry's yield of 0.51% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.72%.In terms of dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $10 is up 11.1% from last year. Goldman Sachs has increased its dividend 4 times on a year-over-year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 29.89%. Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company's payout ratio; a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Right now, Goldman's payout ratio is 36%, which means it paid out 36% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.GS is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $31.57 per share, representing a year-over-year earnings growth rate of 5.02%.Bottom LineInvestors like dividends for many reasons; they greatly improve stock investing profits, decrease overall portfolio risk, and carry tax advantages, among others. It's important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout.Story continuesHigh-growth firms or tech start-ups, for example, rarely provide their shareholders a dividend, while larger, more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options. Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, GS is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

89,fc837097-f44b-3870-8650-a9b5f582bbbe,GS,2023-06-15,Goldman's (GS) GreenSky Gets Buyout Offers From Investment Firms,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/goldmans-gs-greensky-gets-buyout-134600935.html,1686750360,STORY,"['GSBD', 'CFG']","[The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.’s GS consumer lending platform GreenSky has received buyout offers from investment firms Apollo Global Management, Sixth Street and Warburg Pincus. The news was reported by Semafor that cited people familiar with the matter.Some bids are for GreenSky’s loan-writing operations, while others are for legacy loans on Goldman’s books. The bids value GreenSky at “mid-nine figures”, per the report. Notably, in March 2022, Goldman completed its purchase of GreenSky in an all-stock transaction valued at around $2.24 billion.GS had acquired GreenSky, a pre-eminent fintech platform that offers home-improvement consumer loans, to augment its retail lending footprint. However, this April, the company disclosed its intention to sell GreenSky, with management declaring that the business was not in line with the bank’s “current strategic priorities.”Also, at an industry conference earlier this month, management noted that the company may recognize an impairment of $500 million of goodwill related to the sale.Goldman has undertaken a major business restructuring initiative to refocus its business on its core strengths of investment banking and trading while reducing its retail footprint. Hence, the sale is an apt fit with this strategic overhaul.Last year, Goldman stopped lending out of Marcus, its digital consumer lending platform and sold $1 billion of legacy loans from this platform.Consumer lending woes aside, the challenging macroeconomic backdrop is also affecting GS’ trading revenues. President and chief operating officer, John Waldron, revealed that the firm expected trading revenues to decline 25% year over year in second-quarter 2023 due to sluggish capital market activity, muted equities and fixed-income activity levels compared with the year-ago period.Tougher comps from the prior year are also expected to weigh on the company’s year-over-year performance in the Global Banking and Markets segment in second-quarter 2023. Rising interest rates and a rise in commodities business due to volatile energy markets due to the Ukraine war drove higher market activity levels in second-quarter 2022. This propelled revenues in market-oriented businesses.Story continuesOver the past six months, shares of GS have lost 4.9% compared with the industry’s decline of 10.1%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCurrently, GS carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Per a Bloomberg report, citing people with knowledge of the matter, BCS is seeking to sell €5 billion ($5.3 billion) of its mortgage loans in the country.Per the people with knowledge of the matter, BCS has started the divestiture process for a portfolio of mainly performing loans to individuals, while the package also includes non-performing mortgages and high-risk loans in Swiss francs.Citizens Financial Group, Inc. CFG announced that it will stop originating indirect auto loans, effective from Jul 1, 2023. The decision was taken as part of CFG’s strategy to optimize its balance sheet and concentrate on relationship-based lending.CFG began to reduce the number of active dealer relationships and de-emphasize its auto loan origination volume in third-quarter 2022. Nonetheless, the existing auto loans on its balance sheet will be retained and serviced by CFG.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Wall Street Analysts Think 49.5%,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/much-upside-left-perrigo-prgo-135506086.html,1686750906,STORY,"['PRGO', 'TGT']","[Shares of Perrigo (PRGO) have gained 0.8% over the past four weeks to close the last trading session at $33.11, but there could still be a solid upside left in the stock if short-term price targets of Wall Street analysts are any indication. Going by the price targets, the mean estimate of $49.50 indicates a potential upside of 49.5%.The average comprises four short-term price targets ranging from a low of $45 to a high of $54, with a standard deviation of $3.70. While the lowest estimate indicates an increase of 35.9% from the current price level, the most optimistic estimate points to a 63.1% upside. More than the range, one should note the standard deviation here, as it helps understand the variability of the estimates. The smaller the standard deviation, the greater the agreement among analysts.While the consensus price target is highly sought after by investors, the ability and unbiasedness of analysts in setting price targets have long been questionable. And investors making investment decisions solely based on this tool would arguably do themselves a disservice.But, for PRGO, an impressive average price target is not the only indicator of a potential upside. Strong agreement among analysts about the company's ability to report better earnings than they predicted earlier strengthens this view. While a positive trend in earnings estimate revisions doesn't gauge how much a stock could gain, it has proven to be powerful in predicting an upside.Here's What You May Not Know About Analysts' Price TargetsAccording to researchers at several universities across the globe, a price target is one of many pieces of information about a stock that misleads investors far more often than it guides. In fact, empirical research shows that price targets set by several analysts, irrespective of the extent of agreement, rarely indicate where the price of a stock could actually be heading.While Wall Street analysts have deep knowledge of a company's fundamentals and the sensitivity of its business to economic and industry issues, many of them tend to set overly optimistic price targets. Are you wondering why?Story continuesThey usually do that to drum up interest in shares of companies that their firms either have existing business relationships with or are looking to be associated with. In other words, business incentives of firms covering a stock often result in inflated price targets set by analysts.However, a tight clustering of price targets, which is represented by a low standard deviation, indicates that analysts have a high degree of agreement about the direction and magnitude of a stock's price movement. While that doesn't necessarily mean the stock will hit the average price target, it could be a good starting point for further research aimed at identifying the potential fundamental driving forces.That said, while investors should not entirely ignore price targets, making an investment decision solely based on them could lead to disappointing ROI. So, price targets should always be treated with a high degree of skepticism.Why PRGO Could Witness a Solid UpsideAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason to expect an upside in the stock. That's because empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.2%, as one estimate has moved higher compared to no negative revision.Moreover, PRGO currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on four factors related to earnings estimates. Given an impressive externally-audited track record, this is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential upside in the near term. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, while the consensus price target may not be a reliable indicator of how much PRGO could gain, the direction of price movement it implies does appear to be a good guide.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

QGEN recently announced that its software for interpreting and reporting variants, QIAGEN Clinical Insight (QCI Interpret), is being used in Denmark as part of a government initiative to provide sequencing-based treatments for cancer patients. The QCI Interpret solution was selected by Danish National Genome Center for variant interpretation in oncology genome sequencing.This latest development is expected to significantly expand QIAGEN’s market share for sequencing, thus strengthening its global foothold.More on QCI InterpretUsing a variety of next-generation sequencing devices at distributed testing sites around the nation, QCI Interpret offers evidence-based variant interpretation and reporting, and upholds the highest standards for data security and privacy. It also gives testing sites flexibility. Users can quickly move from variation calls to final reports using the platform's agnostic solution, which is easily integrated with any pipeline.Danish National Genome Centre selected the QCI Interpret solution to enable interpretation of oncology results derived from whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data. The project is a component of a bigger personalized medicine plan that seeks to make WGS the norm of care for pertinent patient populations across Denmark.It is worth mentioning that, Denmark is among the first countries to use QCI Interpret to support the national drive and establish WGS as the global standard-of-care for oncology. With more accurate cancer diagnosis and treatment options, the nation hopes to collect enough genetic data to fully harness the power of genomics in personalized medicine.Significance of QCI DeploymentIn order to improve population-specific knowledge and reference sets for citizens of the nation, Denmark is pursuing a forward-thinking approach to aggregate genetic data and fusing it with clinical data on cancer patients. For many years to come, this will act as the basis for efficient precision medicine capabilities. This collaboration highlights QIAGEN's capacity to provide infrastructural and technological assistance for national precision medicine programs.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe main obstacles to apply WGS at a large scale are test analysis and interpretation. For the purpose of streamlining and accelerating the interpretation and reporting process, Danish National Genome Centre deployed QCI Interpret.QCI Interpret dynamically calculates pathogenicity and actionability based on professional criteria for every variant in more than 31,000 cancer types when connected to the QIAGEN Knowledge Base.

ILMN is well poised for growth in the coming quarters, owing to solid long-term growth potential in the oncology space. The company ended the first quarter of 2023 with better-than-expected results. GRAIL continues to have strong demand from consumers, physicians, health systems and payers. However, expensive valuation and stiff competition raise apprehension.In the past year, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has gained 6.8% compared with the 2.2% rise of the industry and the 16.5% rise of the S&amp;P 500.The renowned life sciences company, which provides tools and integrated systems for the analysis of genetic variation and function, has a market capitalization of $32.70 billion. Its first-quarter 2023 earnings per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 300%.The company’s long-term expected growth rate of 22.2% exceeds the industry’s long-term growth expectation of 18.8%.Let’s delve deeperFactors at playQ1 Upsides:  Illumina delivered better-than-expected earnings and revenues in first-quarter 2023. Consolidated revenues were up 1% from fourth-quarter 2022 levels, exceeding the high end of the company’s guidance. Building on strong global interests, the company executed robust shipments of NovaSeq X instruments, exceeding its first-quarter guidance of 40-50 shipments. Core Illumina sequencing consumables revenues were up 1% sequentially. Total sequencing activity on the company’s connected high- and mid-throughput instruments rose 6% sequentially and 3% year over year. Research &amp; Applied increased 7% sequentially. Clinical sequencing activity growth remained robust, up 7% from fourth-quarter 2022 levels and 15% year over year.GRAIL continues to have strong demand from consumers, physicians, health systems and payers. GRAIL generated revenues of $20 million in the first quarter, up 100% year over year. The upside was primarily driven by the accelerated adoption of Galleri.Solid Long-Term Growth Potential in Oncology Space: In the oncology business — another area of focus in its market expansion — the company developed multiple pharma partnerships to bring custom panel tests to market.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn the first quarter, more than 80% of NovaSeq 6000 shipments were made to clinical customers and approximately 25% of shipments to oncology testing. Oncology testing increased 21% sequentially, driven by growing clinical testing volumes and increased product development in areas like liquid biopsy and MRD. Revenues from Illumina’s market-leading TruSight Oncology assay, TSO 500, were up 26% year over year across more than 540 accounts, driven by the increased utilization and pull-through, particularly in Europe. The company also talked about its expansion of partnership with Myriad Genetics to broaden access to homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) testing.Upbeat Guidance: Illumina expects fiscal 2023 consolidated revenue growth in the range of 7-10% year over year (in line with the prior guidance). The adjusted earnings per share for 2023 is expected in the range of $1.25-$1.50 (unchanged).Core Illumina revenue growth is expected in the range of 6-9% year over year.

For the second quarter of 2023, Illumina anticipates consolidated revenues between $1.15 and $1.17 billion and an adjusted earnings per share of 1 cent.DownsidesExpensive Valuation: Illumina’s P/S (F12M) ratio is expensive compared with the broader industry. The company is currently trading at a forward P/S (F12M) ratio of 6.3 for one year, whereas the current P/S (F12M) for the industry it belongs to is 1.9.Tough Competition: Illumina faces significant competition in the sequencing, SNP genotyping, gene expression and molecular diagnostics markets with several large players already enjoying significant market share, intellectual property portfolios and regulatory expertise. Such companies include the likes of Agilent Technologies, Pacific Biosciences of California, BGI, QIAGEN N.V., Roche Holding A.G. and Thermo Fisher Scientific, among others.Estimate TrendsIn the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Illumina’s 2023 earnings has been constant at $1.40.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 revenues is pegged at $4.94 billion, suggesting a 7.71% rise from the year-ago reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

In the first quarter, the company introduced Total30 for astigmatism. Core gross margin expansion in the quarter is encouraging. However, escalated costs and a tough competitive space do not bode well for Alcon.In the past year, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has increased 19.7% compared with the 16.4% growth of the industry and a 19.1% rise of the S&amp;P 500 composite.The renowned pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturer has a market capitalization of $38.58 billion. Alcon projects a long-term estimated earnings growth rate of 14.9% compared with 15.2% of the industry. ALC’s earnings surpassed estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and matched the same in one, delivering an average surprise of 8.85%.Let’s delve deeper.UpsidesStrong Prospects for Vision Care: In the first quarter of 2023, Vision Care reported double-digit growth, backed by the performance of both contact lenses and ocular health. In contact lenses, Alcon gained from its expanded product portfolio, which now includes sphere, toric and multifocal options for value, mainstream and premium customers in daily and reusable categories. ALC witnessed share gains, driven by the new toric product launches, including Precision1, Total30 and Dailies Total1.Ocular health grew 15% compared to the prior-year quarter. Growth was primarily driven by the portfolio of eye drops, including acquired ophthalmic pharmaceutical products and price increases.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSurgical Business Drives Growth: Total Surgical (consisting of Implantables, Consumables and Equipment/Other) recorded sales growth of 8% at CER. In Implantables, the company continued with its ATIOL (Advanced Technology Intraocular Lens) market leadership for another quarter, with nearly half of the global market and two-thirds of the market in the United States despite increasing competitive activity.Story continuesIn Consumables, first-quarter sales were driven by favorable market conditions and pricing. In equipment, sales increased year over year on the continued strong demand for cataract and Vitreoretinal devices, particularly in international markets as the company upgraded and expanded its installed base. In Equipment, Alcon continued to expand its installed base with the CENTURION and LEGION devices.In terms of end markets in Surgical, global cataract procedures were up in the mid-single digits in the first quarter. This growth varied significantly by region.New Products to Add Value: In Presbyopia-correcting Intraocular Lens (PCIOLs), Alcon currently leads the market with more than 60% of the global share and more than 80% share in the United States. In Surgical, the company maintained a strong market share in PCIOLs, driven by the solid demand for products like PanOptix and Vivity despite new market entrants.The company currently sees meaningful share gains driven by its new toric product launches, including Precision1, Total30 and Dailies Total1. Initial customer response for the newest Total30 — the first water gradient, reusable lens for astigmatic wearers — has been exceptional.Total30 toric is currently available in the United States and parts of Europe, with possible availability across additional markets throughout 2023.In ocular health, ALC continues to integrate Aerie (acquired in November 2022) into the Alcon family. Its U.S. eye drop sales force has already added Rocklatan and Rhopressa to the promotional program, which contributed well to its Vision Care growth in the first quarter. ALC is simultaneously witnessing growth in its over-the-counter portfolio, mainly driven by favorable pricing and the sustained family of products.DownsidesQ1 Headwinds: Alcon’s growth in net sales across all segments continued to be marred by unfavorable currency impacts. During the quarter, the company’s operating margin was impacted by legal settlement costs, rising inflationary costs, acquisition and integration-related expenses and increased R&amp;D investments, post the acquisition of Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc.A Tough Competitive Landscape: With the ophthalmology industry being highly competitive, Alcon faces intense competition in the Surgical and Vision Care businesses. In the Surgical business, the mixture of competitors ranges from large manufacturers with multiple business lines to small manufacturers that offer a limited selection of specialized products. ALC also faces competition from the providers of alternative medical therapies such as pharmaceutical companies that have the potential to disrupt the core elements of its business.Estimate TrendAlcon has been witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for 2023. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 earnings per share has moved up from $2.63 to $2.64 in the past 30 days.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 revenues is pegged at $9.35 billion.

102,b8024382-eb15-38a6-9782-694d40873a4b,PSX,2023-06-15,Top 20 Most Profitable Energy Companies in the World,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-20-most-profitable-energy-135825840.html,1686751105,STORY,"['EOG', 'XOM', 'PSX', 'CVX', 'EC', 'MPC', 'COP', 'VLO', 'OXY', 'LUKOY', 'MRO']","[In this piece, we will take a look at the top twenty most profitable energy companies in the world. To skip our detailed analysis of the energy industry, head on over to Top 5 Most Profitable Energy Companies in the World. Energy is one of the most important - and one of the most controversial - industries in the modern world. The industry has contributed the most to human development by vast amounts of cheap energy to run airplanes, cars, factories, and homes. At the same time, the costs of generating this power have taken their toll on the environment.For instance, our study of the most polluting companies in the world shows that the top three firms that have emitted the most carbon dioxide between 1751 and 2018 are oil companies. These firms are Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), and Saudi Arabian Oil Company (TADAWUL:2222.SR) - which are also coincidentally among some of the biggest oil companies in the world.At the same time, the energy industry saw renewed investor attention and demand last year as the Russian invasion of Ukraine took place. This led to a disruption of the global oil industry and made the Western world in particular focus on non Russian oil sources. In terms of market value, the oil industry is one of the most valuable in the world. For instance, according to research from The Business Research Company, the crude oil market was worth $2.7 trillion in 2022 and will be worth $2.9 trillion in 2023. From this year until 2027 the second is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.6% to sit at $3.4 trillion by the end of the forecast period. The firm believes that this growth will primarily come from the developing world, particularly due to the fast growing economies of India and China. And, 'coincidentally'. once again, India and China are also two of the three countries with the most carbon dioxide emissions.Additionally, even though the crude oil industry is worth trillions of dollars, the renewable energy industry is quite lucrative as well. Precedence Research believes that the global renewable energy market was worth $1 trillion in 2022 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 8.6% until 2030 to be worth an estimated $1.9 trillion by then. Looking at the industry sector wise, the data shows that the solar energy segment will outpace the broader market's growth through a 13.5% CAGR. These figures are quite telling, as despite being a relatively young industry in terms of global interest, the renewable energy industry is still quite large and is catching up to at least crude oil in terms of market value. Within the industry, there are countless renewable energy stocks that have caught hedge fund attention. The selection depends on different factors, such as cheap, profitable, and overall best renewable energy stocks. Some top cheap renewable energy stocks include Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Enphase Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH) and NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE). If you're interested to learn about most profitable renewable energy stocks then the top names are Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), and Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL), and overall, here are the best renewable energy stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors.Story continuesGetting into the nitty gritty of the renewable energy industry, not only did the coronavirus pandemic nearly upend the global oil supply chain, but the post war shocks also impacted solar and wind power supply chains. According to McKinsey, materials such as polysilicon used to make solar panels and others such as aluminum, steel, and copper often have unpredictable supply chains. Most polysilicon supply originates from China, making it vulnerable to natural disasters and factory incidents - which led to the prices of this crucial raw material growing by a whopping 350% between 2020 and 2022. It adds that the wind turbine industry faced high costs after the Russian invasion of Ukraine since the wind turbine companies did not hedge their material prices. However, despite these constraints, McKinsey also estimates that between 2021 and 2030, planned power generation from solar and wind power projects is slated to grow from 125 gigawatts to 459 gigawatts. Out of these, the bulk will be generated from solar photovoltaic projects (or solar panels as they're commonly known) and most of the remainder will come from on shore wind projects.Digging deeper into the countless energy stocks trading on the market, notable cheap energy stocks are PDC Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:PDCE), Coterra Energy Inc. (NYSE:CTRA), and Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE:MRO). Interested in dividends? Well, we've identified 11 best energy dividend stocks as well, and some best energy stocks overall are Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE:VLO), EOG Resources, Inc. (NYSE:EOG), and ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP).However, as the market estimates show, traditional energy is here to stay, and taking a current look at the industry, here's what the management of Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) had to say during the firm's latest earnings call:First quarter oil equivalent production was down about 80,000 barrels per day from last year due to the expiration of a contract in Thailand and the sale of our Eagle Ford asset.This was partially offset by growth in the Permian. We expect 2023 production growth in the Permian to be back-end loaded as wells put on production, POPs increase across both operated and non-operated areas. We expect our royalty production to be roughly flat. As discussed during our Investor Day, we’re increasing activity in New Mexico. All four company-operated rigs added this year, one each quarter, will be in New Mexico, leading to more POPs expected in the second half of the year and into 2024. We also continue to be active in Texas. Last year, about half of our company-operated production was in the Delaware Basin in Texas with the remainder split about evenly between the Midland Basin and New Mexico. More than half of our non-operated production is with five major operators in large, contiguous positions in core areas with multiyear development programs, where we have visibility to capex and execution schedules and a royalty benefit compared to the operator.With these details in mind, let's take a look at some of the most profitable energy companies in the world. Some top names are  Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Saudi Arabian Oil Company (TADAWUL:2222.SR), and Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL).Top 20 Most Profitable Energy Companies in the WorldPhoto by Robin Sommer on UnsplashOur Methodology To compile our list of the most profitable oil companies, we sifted out energy companies with the highest net profits.Top 20 Most Profitable Energy Companies in the World20.

At the psychological level, a certain pioneering appeal exists about discovering the next big thing before the crowd arrives.Certainly, getting in before the masses may yield blistering rewards. Contextually, market participants today may be much more incentivized to consider the top undervalued stocks for investment. Sure, the latest jobs report suggests that anyone who wants to find employment can get it. However, with the length of time people spend looking for work likely increasing, not all is well with the economy. Thus, buying overheated securities presents significant risks. Plus, let’s face reality: no one wants to end up holding the bag. In fairness, going the discount route doesn’t guarantee anything. But you may be able to improve your odds with high potential undervalued stocks.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAvis Budget (CAR)assortment of cars in a parking lot representing GETR stock.Source: ShutterstockPerhaps an oddball idea for the most undervalued stocks to buy, Avis Budget (NASDAQ:CAR) might seem risky given economic challenges. A leading global provider of mobility solutions through its Avis and Budget brands, the company depends on strong travel sentiment. Fortunately, the revenge travel phenomenon that started following the initial relaxing of Covid-19 protocols continues to be relevant today. Notably, CAR stock gained almost 17% since the Jan. opener.Moving onto data provided by investment resource Gurufocus, the market prices CAR at a forward multiple of 11.44. As a discount to projected earnings, Avis ranks better than 71.52% of companies listed in the business services sector. Also, CAR trades at 0.66-times trailing sales, ranking better than 65.49% of its rivals.However, these aren’t fluff statistics. In particular, Avis’ three-year revenue growth rate (on a per-share basis) clocks in at 30%, above 92.3% of sector players. Also, its EBITDA growth rate during the same period impresses at 42.7%. Finally, Wall Street analysts peg CAR as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target lands at $226.25, implying nearly 18% upside potential. Thus, it might be one of the top undervalued stocks for investment.Story continuesPhillips 66 (PSX)Person holding the glowing world in their hands with icons with different types of energy. Top energy stocks for high returnsSource: PopTika / ShutterstockOn the surface, downstream hydrocarbon energy specialist Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) might seem an irrelevant idea for most undervalued stocks to buy. With more people making the transition to electric vehicles, fewer people will need to use gasoline stations. While true, the integration of EVs is nowhere near the scale of combustion cars on the road today. So, people will need downstream specialists today, tomorrow and maybe even decades from now.Another factor that makes PSX stand among the high potential undervalued stocks are the attractive financial metrics.

Per its corporate ethos, Albemarle empowers the potential of companies in critical industries such as energy, electronics and transportation. Usually, analysts cite ALB as a lithium provider. It also happens to be one of the most undervalued stocks to buy. That’s the case even with shares soaring nearly 18% in the trailing one-month period. Specifically, the market prices ALB at a forward multiple of 11.53. As a discount to projected earnings, Albemarle ranks better than 66.45% of companies listed in the chemicals industry.In addition, the company delivers strong stats in the operational realm.

Stocks With 1000% UpsideSource: Vova Shevchuk / Shutterstock.comComing in as a top name among the most undervalued stocks to buy, Archer Daniels Midland (NYSE:ADM) should rate highly thanks to its permanently relevant business. A global leader in human and animal nutrition and the world’s premier agricultural origination and processing company per its public profile, investors enjoy long-term confidence with ADM. However, since the beginning of the year, shares slipped over 18%.While the red ink might look bad, the main argument is that we’re talking about a solid enterprise succumbing to rough circumstances. Therefore, Gurufocus labels ADM a legitimately undervalued trade. Presently, the market prices share at a forward multiple of 10.57. As a discount to projected earnings, Archer Daniels ranks better than 80.53% of the competition.In addition, the company benefits from strong operational stats. Its three-year revenue growth rate clocks in at 16.4%, ranked above 77.43% of sector peers. Also, its EBITDA growth rate during the same period is 30.8%, above 80.88%. Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg ADM as a moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $95.29, implying nearly 30% upside potential.Ovintiv (OVV)Man holding stacks of money. Top millionaire-maker stocks to buySource: Epic Cure / ShutterstockAn enticing idea among the most undervalued stocks to buy, Ovintiv (NYSE:OVV) is a hydrocarbon exploration and production company. While the political narrative presently centers on clean and renewable energy sources, the vast majority of society depends on fossil fuels. Thanks to their incredible energy density, hydrocarbons will be difficult to give up. That’s just reality. That’s just science.Cynically, then, Ovintiv presents a powerful case if you want to buy undervalued stocks now. As Gurufocus pointed out, OVV represents a significant discount. By the numbers, OVV trades at a forward multiple of 4.78. As a discount to projected earnings, Ovintiv ranks better than 80.36% of the competition. Also, shares trade at 4.29-times FCF, ranked better than 71.24% of its peers.Operationally, Ovintiv’s three-year revenue growth rate clocks in at 23.3%, above 75.79% of sector players. Also, its EBITDA growth rate hits 22.9%, above 61.1%. Looking to the Street, analysts peg OVV as a consensus moderate buy.

Per its corporate profile, Nutrien is the world’s largest provider of crop inputs and services, playing a critical role in helping growers increase food production in a sustainable manner. Specifically, the company produces and distributes 27 million tons of potash, nitrogen and phosphate products worldwide.However, the market has a dim view of NTR, seeing it slide down over 17% since the Jan. opener. And that’s where the true contrarian comes out. If you’re interested in top undervalued stocks for investment, Nutrien appears quite tempting. Specifically, the market prices NTR at a trailing multiple of only 4.66. As a discount to earnings, the company ranks better than 90.61% of the agriculture industry. Operationally, Nutrien also delivers the goods. Its three-year revenue growth rate hits 28.1%, above 76.64% of sector rivals. Plus, its EBITDA growth rate during the same frame impresses at 57.8%. Lastly, analysts peg NTR as a moderate buy. Their average price target comes in at $79.13, implying over 33% upside potential.Stellantis (STLA)A flag with the logo for Stellantis waves outside a building with the logos for some of its car brands, including Abarth, Lancia, Fiat, Alfa Romeo and Jeep.Source: Antonello Marangi / Shutterstock.comOne of the world’s leading automakers, Stellantis (NYSE:STLA) might not be a household name. However, many of its automotive brands – such as Alfa Romeo, Chrysler, Dodge, Fiat and Jeep – very much are. Fundamentally, the beauty of Stellantis is that it can electrify several popular combustion-based models. For example, Dodge will launch an electric muscle car, with all the noise that such a platform implies.Just speaking on my behalf, I can’t wait – an EV with a personality! Aside from individual biases, STLA legitimately rates as one of the most undervalued stocks to buy. In particular, the market prices STLA at a forward multiple of 3.33. As a discount to projected earnings, Stellantis ranks better than 97.11% of the competition. Also, it trades a lowly FCF multiple of 4.4.On the operational front, Stellantis’ three-year revenue growth rate pings at 14.6%, ranked above 75.79% of rivals. Also, its EBITDA growth rate during the same period comes in at 32.2%, above 84.72%. On a final note, analysts peg STLA as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target lands at $22.35, implying over 39% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Strategic investments, a customer-centric approach, merchandise initiatives and an emphasis on memberships have been the discount retailer’s primary strengths.A Dominant Warehouse RetailerThis Issaquah, WA-based company continues to be one of the dominant warehouse retailers based on the expanse and quality of merchandise offered. Costco's distinctive membership business model and pricing power set it apart from traditional players. Amid rising prices, low-to-middle-income consumers have preferred discount stores over conventional retailers.Cumulatively, these factors have been aiding Costco in registering decent sales numbers. Costco’s net sales increased 1.2% to $18.45 billion for the retail month of May from $18.23 billion last year. The metric grew 1.9% year over year to $52,604 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2023.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchNo wonder, the company’s total paid members have been rising. Its growing customer base and high renewal rates have been fueling sales. Membership fees increased 6.1% to $1,044 million in the third quarter. The company ended the quarter with 69.1 million paid household members and 124.7 million cardholders.Costco is gradually adopting the omnichannel mantra to provide a seamless shopping experience. Its acquisition of Innovel Solutions, a leading provider of third-party end-to-end logistics solutions — now called Costco Logistics — has boosted its e-commerce capabilities and enabled it to sell ""big and bulky"" items.The company has been gradually expanding its e-commerce capabilities in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Mexico, Korea, Taiwan, Japan and Australia.Costco also remains committed to opening new clubs in the domestic and international markets. In our view, the company’s diversification strategy is a natural hedge against risks that may arise in specific markets. After opening 13, 20 and 23 net new warehouses in fiscal 2020, 2021 and 2022, respectively, Costco plans to open 23 net new units in fiscal 2023. We foresee an improvement in membership fees as new warehouse openings ramp up.Story continuesWrapping UpThe strategy to sell products at discounted prices has helped Costco draw customers who have been seeking both value and convenience. Costco has exhibited a decent run on the bourse so far in the year.Due to its operational initiatives — a customer-centric approach, an emphasis on the membership program and a focus on value offerings — the stock has outpaced the Zacks Retail-Discount industry. In the said period, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have increased about 14.4% against the industry’s decline of 1%.3 Stocks Looking Red HotHere we have highlighted three better-ranked stocks, namely Kroger KR, The TJX Companies TJX and Walmart WMT.Kroger, a supermarket operator, currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

(NYSE:TJX)",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/calculating-intrinsic-value-tjx-companies-140021273.html,1686751221,STORY,['TJX'],"[Key InsightsUsing the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, TJX Companies fair value estimate is US$71.34Current share price of US$81.03 suggests TJX Companies is potentially trading close to its fair valueOur fair value estimate is 18% lower than TJX Companies' analyst price target of US$87.45In this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of The TJX Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TJX) by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for TJX Companies The ModelWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.11bUS$3.56bUS$3.84bUS$4.40bUS$4.31bUS$5.46bUS$5.90bUS$6.27bUS$6.59bUS$6.86bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x6Analyst x6Analyst x6Analyst x4Analyst x3Analyst x2Est @ 8.08%Est @ 6.29%Est @ 5.03%Est @ 4.16% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.3% US$1.9kUS$3.0kUS$3.0kUS$3.2kUS$2.9kUS$3.4kUS$3.4kUS$3.3kUS$3.2kUS$3.1k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$31bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.3%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$6.9b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (8.3%– 2.1%) = US$114bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$114b÷ ( 1 + 8.3%)10= US$51bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$82b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$81.0, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at TJX Companies as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.036. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for TJX CompaniesStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is not viewed as a risk.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Specialty Retail market.Expensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

Those proposals include at least a dozen measures that would bolster residential real estate and consumer spending.Stimulus programs in China, unlike those in the United States, don’t typically involve sending payments to individual households. Instead, the programs are geared toward accelerating commercial activity by lowering interest rates and easing loan costs, which frees up more money for banks to lend.On Tuesday, the People’s Bank of China “unexpectedly” cut a series of short-term interest rates, Bloomberg reported. That move is expected to pave the way for a key longer-term policy rate reduction.So what does all this mean for Americans?As CNBC reported this week on its Investing Club site, China has been taking “consistent and steady action” to accelerate its economic rebound — something that could be a “positive sign” for consumer spending, even amid ongoing economic uncertainty.“Based on recent retail sales data coming out of China, there’s clearly pent-up consumer demand, signaling to investors … that there’s more upside ahead for companies doing business there,” CNBC noted.Those companies include Estee Lauder, Starbucks and Wynn Resorts.Last month Wynn posted strong first-quarter results thanks to a recovery in the Asian gambling hub of Macao — a signal that “robust consumer spending on travel and experiences” will continue in coming quarters, according to CNBC. Because of a recent slump in shares, Wynn might provide a buying opportunity for investors.Story continuesSimilarly, Starbucks in May delivered good numbers for its fiscal second quarter even amid a slowdown in its shares, which provides another buying opportunity.Take Our Poll: Are You Planning To Buy or Sell a House This Year?Estee Lauder’s latest results, for its fiscal third quarter, were more mixed, leading the beauty company to issue “terrible guidance” that led to a major sell-off in shares.

The Index also includes environmental and social data as well as details on how Zoetis supports the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosure (TCFD) and its commitment to disclosing progress aligned with TCFD recommendations.""In our third year of reporting to our Driven to Care aspirations and targets, we continue to make significant progress in our journey toward building a healthier future for our communities, animals and the planet,"" said Jeannette Ferran Astorga, Executive Vice President, Corporate Affairs, Communications and Chief Sustainability Officer at Zoetis and President of the Zoetis Foundation. ""The progress we’ve made toward our sustainability commitments would not be possible without the dedication, creativity and innovation of our colleagues who champion our purpose by contributing to a better future for us all.""Story continuesCommunities – Care and CollaborationZoetis invested $7.4 million in communities through corporate giving in 2022, with approximately $2.2 million in monetary and in-kind contributions to support approximately 186,000 pet owners in need and approximately $1.7 million in monetary and product contributions to help more than 560,000 animals impacted by disaster. The Zoetis Foundation also distributed $5.7 million in grants supporting 25 initiatives across 20 countries in 2022, significantly increasing grant funding to advance farmer and veterinary education, livelihoods, and well-being. Specifically, the Zoetis Foundation provided grants of $2.5 million in scholarships to veterinary students to support more than 500 students. In its commitment to advancing an inclusive veterinary profession, the Zoetis Foundation is the Founding Sponsor of the It Takes a Village Foundation's ""Vet for a Day"" program, helping advance diversity and inclusion in the veterinary field. In 2022, the ""Vet for a Day"" program reached approximately 300 students, enabling kids from diverse backgrounds to learn about veterinary medicine.The report also highlights progress made since 2020 toward the company’s diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&amp;I) aspirations for 2025, including:Increased representation of women at the director level and above globally from 32% to 37%, aspiring to reach 40% by 2025Increased representation of Black colleagues in the U.S. from 4.0% to 4.8%, aspiring to reach 5% by 2025Increased representation of people of color at all levels in the U.S. from 21.0% to 24.6%, aspiring to reach 25% by 2025Increased representation of Latinx colleagues from 5.0% to 6.4%, exceeding our aspiration of reaching 6% by 2025The Zoetis executive team is now 60% women and 40% from racially or ethnically diverse backgrounds, including Asian, Black and Hispanic/Latinx.As part of ongoing efforts to support colleagues, Zoetis signed on to PrideVMC’s Gender Identity Bill of Rights (GIBOR), a document that affirms the rights of transgender, non-binary, and gender non-conforming persons, and provides guidance on how workplaces can support their employees by identifying and eliminating discriminatory practices. Zoetis engaged with 1,236 global active members across eight Colleague Resource Groups and launched Cultural Explorer training in eight languages to encourage respectful curiosity and open conversation about differences to deepen mutual understanding and value for colleagues’ unique contributions to the workplace.Animals - Innovation in Animal HealthWith the world’s population approaching the United Nations projected 10 billion people by 2050, some of our greatest challenges are emerging at the intersection of human, animal, environmental and economic health. By enhancing the health of livestock, innovative solutions can help contribute to the economic and environmental well-being of farmers and communities as well as support global food security.In 2022, Zoetis received approval for several livestock vaccines in additional markets, which support the Health for Animals Roadmap to Reducing the Need for Antibiotics. This includes recombinant vector vaccines in Brazil, India, Mexico, and the U.S. that can positively impact welfare and productivity of poultry, as well as expanded regulatory approval for a vaccine to help protect cattle against Mycoplasma bovis. Additional new products support cattle producers’ health and productivity goals as well as pork producers’ animal welfare and productivity goals, all to improve their sustainability. Zoetis also announced a research collaboration with scientists in New Zealand to explore mechanisms that may inhibit methane emissions from grazing ruminants and, in turn, reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Furthermore, the company invested in research to support understanding how genetic testing and genomic predictions can help improve dairy cattle health outcomes by reducing disease incidence and antibiotic use while also improving productivity.Zoetis reported progress on five years of its African Livestock Productivity and Health Advancement (A.L.P.H.A.) initiative with the aim to help improve livestock health and positively impact farmers’ livelihoods in Sub-Saharan Africa. At the completion of the initiative, Zoetis trained over 30,000 farmers, veterinary professionals, distributors and lab personnel – 30% were women – and treated 9.7 million cows and 196 million chickens in the region. With continued support from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, Zoetis launched A.L.P.H.A. Plus - a new five-year initiative that will scale up the initial efforts with expansion into seven additional countries in Africa and aquaculture in addition to cattle and poultry. The success of the A.L.P.H.A. initiative is further supported by Zoetis’ inclusion in Fortune’s 2022 Change the World list, underscoring the initiative’s impact to grow access to veterinary care in emerging markets and to help achieve the UN SDGs for No Poverty, Zero Hunger and Gender Equality, among others.Planet – the Drive to Protect our PlanetTo reduce GHG emissions throughout the company’s operations and manage climate risks, Zoetis set a goal in 2022 to achieve carbon neutrality in its own operations by 2030, with a focus on Scope 1 and 2 emissions from its manufacturing and R&amp;D operations, office locations and fleet vehicles. Aligned with its RE100 commitment, Zoetis reported 14.7% renewable electricity sourced to date and installed four photovoltaic solar arrays at three manufacturing sites and one R&amp;D site. To date, 31% of the company’s manufacturing sites operate with 100% renewable electricity. Zoetis exceeded and retired its target to reduce energy intensity by 5% at its manufacturing and R&amp;D sites, with a 13.5% reduction. In 2022, the company developed a roadmap to achieve its carbon neutrality target that includes short-, medium- and long-term initiatives, including capital expense planning. Specifically, Zoetis conducted energy and carbon assessments at 10 of its largest energy consuming sites, accounting for approximately 90% of the company’s energy footprint, which helped identify more than 100 energy efficiency projects. Minimizing fleet emissions also are part of the company’s journey to carbon neutrality in its own operations, and in 2022, electric vehicles represented 1.2% of Zoetis’ total fleet, while hybrids accounted for 10%.The company continued to take meaningful steps to reduce its environmental footprint and improve its products’ environmental impact throughout their life cycle in markets around the world. The report highlights initiatives in Japan, Canada and the U.S. that help streamline Zoetis’ process, reduce packaging and divert packaging from landfills, including by transitioning prescription labeling to QR codes, and removing cotton from product packaging. Zoetis also created a sustainable packaging guidance document for suppliers to provide packaging specification guidelines for all products delivered to Zoetis.For more detailed disclosure on the company’s ESG programs, practices and policies, please see zoetis.com/sustainability or download Zoetis’ 2022 Sustainability Report.

The Florida Public Service Commission approved FPL's appeal to reduce their projected 2023 fuel costs by $256 million. This approval marks the company’s third reduction in the fuel portion for 2023.Based on FPL's forecasted fuel costs for its generating plants, the Public Service Commission approves a fuel charge on consumer bills. FPL works hard to run its power plants as fuel-efficiently as possible while not making a return on fuel. Natural gas prices have declined since FPL predicted its fuel costs for 2023 last year. For the fuel charges in 2023, FPL has already made downward adjustments totaling almost $1.4 billion, which went into effect in April and May.FPL’s Customer InitiativesCustomers of FPL will start to notice some relief on their monthly electricity bills just as the summer heat increases electricity usage. After the recent approval, an average 1,000 kWh residential customer bill will now be more than $8 less in July than in April. A 1,000 kWh home bill in Northwest Florida will cost less in July 2023 than last year. Depending on the rate class, business client bills will fall 2-5% in July from the present rates.In order to further reduce customer bills, FPL advises their customers to utilize the free tools provided by them. Customers can also activate the free FPL Energy Manager tool to monitor how their home is using energy and identify ways to save the same.Since the utilities do not make any profits on fuel prices, the downward revision in fuel prices is completely passed on to customers. The rate reduction is a welcome break for customers during the summer season when demand generally increases the monthly utility bills.Price PerformanceOver the past year, shares of NEE have gained 0.2% against the industry’s 7.4% decline.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank &amp; Key PicksNextEra currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

For the 12-months ending in March 2023, dividends set a record $573.7 billion payment, up 9.3% on an aggregate basis from March 2022's $524.9 billion.Total shareholders return of buybacks and dividends increased to $362.3 billion in Q1 2023, up 1.4% from Q4 2022's $357.3 billion and down 13.4% from Q1 2022's $418.6 billion.

If Financials had not returned to the buyback market, the 2.1% expenditure increase would have been a 10.6% decline, as 8 of the 11 sectors pulled back. While the year-to-date S&amp;P 500 price increase was top-heavy, the Q1 2023 buyback market was Financial heavy. The EPS impact, due to share count reduction, also declined, as 18.5% of the issues increased their Q1 2023 EPS year-over-year by at least 4% compared to 19.4% last quarter,"" said Howard Silverblatt, Senior Index Analyst at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices. ""Going forward and given the recent banking issues and the current regulatory reviews, banks may again pull back on buybacks to protect their dividends for what is expected to be a more difficult Fed stress test due to stricter and more extensive regulations.""1% Buyback Excise Tax for 2023:On a proforma basis, the new 1% excise tax on net buybacks reduced Q1 2023 operating earnings by 0.45%, down from proforma 0.46% for Q4 2022 and the proforma 2022 0.51%, with as reported GAAP earnings being reduced by 0.49%, down from the proforma 0.58% for Q4 2022 and the proforma 2022 0.58%.Silverblatt added: ""The 1% tax is an additional cost, but it is still not significant enough to impact the overall buybacks at this point. In his proposed fiscal 2024 budget, President Biden quantified increasing the tax to 4%, but no changes were incorporated into the recently passed Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 (debt ceiling deal). Given the initial 1% buyback tax had bipartisan support, there is an expectation that some increase and/or potentially a change to the type of buybacks that are taxed to be discussed later this year for fiscal 2024. An increase to the 2.5% area could start to impact buybacks and the EPS impact of share-count-reduction due to some of the expenditures shifting from buybacks to dividends. Any shift however would not be on a-dollar-for-dollar basis, as dividends remain a long-term pure cash-flow item which must be incorporated into corporate budgets.""Q1 2022 GICS® Sector Analysis:Financials, as expected, returned to the buyback market in 2023, after pulling back in Q2, Q3 and Q4 2022. For Q1 2023, Financials spent $46.9 billion on buybacks, accounting for 21.8% of all S&amp;P 500 buybacks. This was up 108% from their Q4 2022 $22.5 billion expenditure, which represented 10.7% of buybacks, but were still down 14.3% from their Q1 2022 $54.7 billion in buybacks, which represented 19.5% of buybacks. Financials spent the most of any sector in Q1 2023, overtaking Information Technology for the first time since Q3 2017 (Information Technology had held the lead since Q4 2017). For the 12-month March 2023 period, Financials spent $113.6 billion, down from $209.9 billion for the 12-month June 2022 period. Given the recent banking events and current regulatory review, there is some discussion if the sector will again pull back on buybacks, partially to protect their dividends during stress tests.Information Technology pulled back 20.3% on buybacks for the quarter, spending $45.9 billion in Q1 2023, representing 21.3% of all buybacks. This was down from the Q4 2022 $57.7 billion, which accounted for 27.3% of the buybacks and down from the Q1 2022 expenditure of $71.6 billion (25.5% of the buybacks). For the 12-month March period the sector spent $236.3 billion, down 14.2% from the prior period's $275.3 billion.Energy decreased their buybacks by 2.7% for the quarter to $19.3 billion, representing 9.0% of the buybacks compared to the prior quarter's $19.8 billion, as the Q1 2023 quarter was an increase of 126% over Q1 2022's $8.6 billion level. For the 12-month period ending in March 2023, Energy spent $74.5 billion on buybacks, up 259% from the prior period's $20.8 billion.Health Care buybacks decreased 4.9% for the quarter, spending $23.2 billion in Q1 2023, representing 10.8% of all buybacks. This was down from the Q4 2022 $24.4 billion and Q1 2022's $41.1 billion. For the 12-month March period, the sector spent $84.8 billion, down 12.3% from prior 12-month period's $96.9 billion.Issues:The five issues with the highest total buybacks for Q1 2023 are:Apple (AAPL): continued to be the poster child for buybacks as it once again spent the most of any issue, with its Q1 2023 expenditure ranking as the fifteenth highest in S&amp;P 500 history. For the quarter, the company spent $20.0 billion, down from Q4 2022's $21.8 billion (the eleventh largest in index history). Apple holds 18 of the top 20 record quarters (Meta Platforms holds #12 and QUALCOMM holds #13). For the 12 months ending in March 2023, Apple spent $91.1 billion on buybacks, down from the prior 12-month period's $92.4 billion.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the meat industry and consumption trends, go directly to the Top 5 Countries with the Highest Meat Consumption.As reported in one of our articles earlier, the global meat products market is expected to witness significant growth during the forecast period of 2022 to 2029. The market is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.7% to reach a total value of $1,345.9 billion. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations (UN) forecasted global annual meat production of 361 million tons in 2022. This translated into an average meat consumption per person per day of 118.6 grams. The FAO has forecasted an increase of 14% in global meat consumption by 2030. Considering the projected global population surpassing 9 billion by the middle of this century, it is expected that global meat consumption will rise to 570 million tons by 2050.Overall, global meat consumption has been increasing steadily over the past few decades. According to Our World in Data, Hong Kong and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines are the countries in which meat consumption per capita is increasing at the fastest rate. Factors such as population growth, urbanization, and rising incomes in developing countries have contributed to this trend. As more people move out of poverty, they often seek to include more meat in their diets. Meat consumption varies significantly across different regions of the world. Spain, Italy, and France are among the leading consumers of meat in Europe. Developed countries tend to have higher meat consumption per capita compared to developing countries. While India has a significant level of annual meat supply, the country’s per capita meat consumption stands at only 4.58 kg. This makes India the country that eats the least meat on a per-person basis on our list. On the other hand, countries like Germany, the United States, and Japan rank among the top 10 countries with the highest meat consumption. These nations have well-established meat industries and a cultural preference for meat-based diets.Story continuesKey Players in the Industry As of 2023, 72%, or $963.20 billion, of the global meat industry revenue, is dependent on fresh meat and 26.2%, or $347 billion, comes from processed meat. Meanwhile, the remaining 1.8% or $12.74 billion, is contributed by meat substitutes. The patterns of red meat consumption per capita by country play a significant role in shaping the global meat industry landscape. Some of the leading companies capitalizing on the expanding meat industry include Hormel Foods Corporation (NYSE:HRL), Beyond Meat, Inc. (NASDAQ:BYND), and The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR).

Cargill Meat Solutions had an annual revenue of $165 billion in 2022, with a headcount of 165,000 employees. Another significant provider of meat products in the US is Springdale, Arkansas-based Tyson Foods, Inc. (NYSE:TSN). The company had an annual revenue of $53.3 billion as of 2022. Tyson Foods, Inc. (NYSE:TSN) has a presence in 45 states and employs 140,000 people. Furthermore, quick service restaurants (QSR) like the Chicago, Illinois-based McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) also play an important role in the meat industry. McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) alone purchases 0.861 million tons of beef annually to serve billions of burgers across the world through its 38,000 locations.With this context in mind, let’s take a look at our meat consumption by country rankings.Top 20 Countries with the Highest Meat ConsumptionCopyright: andreadonetti / 123RF Stock PhotoOur MethodologyWe obtained the annual meat consumption data for all the countries from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).

It's only natural to consider a company's balance sheet when you examine how risky it is, since debt is often involved when a business collapses. We note that Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) does have debt on its balance sheet. But is this debt a concern to shareholders?When Is Debt A Problem?Debt assists a business until the business has trouble paying it off, either with new capital or with free cash flow. In the worst case scenario, a company can go bankrupt if it cannot pay its creditors. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. When we think about a company's use of debt, we first look at cash and debt together. See our latest analysis for Lockheed Martin What Is Lockheed Martin's Net Debt?You can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that as of March 2023 Lockheed Martin had US$15.6b of debt, an increase on US$11.6b, over one year. On the flip side, it has US$2.44b in cash leading to net debt of about US$13.2b.debt-equity-history-analysisA Look At Lockheed Martin's LiabilitiesThe latest balance sheet data shows that Lockheed Martin had liabilities of US$17.0b due within a year, and liabilities of US$28.0b falling due after that. On the other hand, it had cash of US$2.44b and US$15.8b worth of receivables due within a year. So its liabilities total US$26.8b more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables.Lockheed Martin has a very large market capitalization of US$114.6b, so it could very likely raise cash to ameliorate its balance sheet, if the need arose. But we definitely want to keep our eyes open to indications that its debt is bringing too much risk.Story continuesWe use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). This way, we consider both the absolute quantum of the debt, as well as the interest rates paid on it.Lockheed Martin's net debt to EBITDA ratio of about 1.5 suggests only moderate use of debt. And its strong interest cover of 10.9 times, makes us even more comfortable. Lockheed Martin's EBIT was pretty flat over the last year, but that shouldn't be an issue given the it doesn't have a lot of debt. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Lockheed Martin can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.Finally, a company can only pay off debt with cold hard cash, not accounting profits. So the logical step is to look at the proportion of that EBIT that is matched by actual free cash flow. Over the last three years, Lockheed Martin recorded free cash flow worth a fulsome 81% of its EBIT, which is stronger than we'd usually expect. That positions it well to pay down debt if desirable to do so.Our ViewThe good news is that Lockheed Martin's demonstrated ability to convert EBIT to free cash flow delights us like a fluffy puppy does a toddler. And the good news does not stop there, as its interest cover also supports that impression! When we consider the range of factors above, it looks like Lockheed Martin is pretty sensible with its use of debt. That means they are taking on a bit more risk, in the hope of boosting shareholder returns. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. For instance, we've identified   2 warning signs for Lockheed Martin  that you should be aware of.At the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt.

Since the market usually pay for a company’s long-term financial health, we decided to study the company’s fundamentals to see if they could be influencing the market. In this article, we decided to focus on Johnson &amp; Johnson's  ROE.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. Check out our latest analysis for Johnson &amp; Johnson How To Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Johnson &amp; Johnson is:18% = US$13b ÷ US$71b (Based on the trailing twelve months to April 2023).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.18 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.Johnson &amp; Johnson's Earnings Growth And 18% ROEAt first glance, Johnson &amp; Johnson seems to have a decent ROE. And on comparing with the industry, we found that the the average industry ROE is similar at 18%. Consequently, this likely laid the ground for the decent growth of 18% seen over the past five years by Johnson &amp; Johnson.Story continuesNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Johnson &amp; Johnson's growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 15% in the same period, which is great to see.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. What is JNJ worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether JNJ is currently mispriced by the market.Is Johnson &amp; Johnson Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?The high three-year median payout ratio of 61% (or a retention ratio of 39%) for Johnson &amp; Johnson suggests that the company's growth wasn't really hampered despite it returning most of its income to its shareholders.Moreover, Johnson &amp; Johnson is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Existing analyst estimates suggest that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 46% over the next three years. As a result, the expected drop in Johnson &amp; Johnson's payout ratio explains the anticipated rise in the company's future ROE to 34%, over the same period.ConclusionOverall, we are quite pleased with Johnson &amp; Johnson's performance. In particular, its high ROE is quite noteworthy and also the probable explanation behind its considerable earnings growth. Yet, the company is retaining a small portion of its profits. Which means that the company has been able to grow its earnings in spite of it, so that's not too bad. Having said that, the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down, as forecasted in the current analyst estimates. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

But in three years the returns have been great. The share price marched upwards over that time, and is now 166% higher than it was. It's not uncommon to see a share price retrace a bit, after a big gain. The fundamental business performance will ultimately dictate whether the top is in, or if this is a stellar buying opportunity.On the back of a solid 7-day performance, let's check what role the company's fundamentals have played in driving long term shareholder returns. View our latest analysis for Mosaic To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Mosaic became profitable within the last three years. That kind of transition can be an inflection point that justifies a strong share price gain, just as we have seen here.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Mosaic has improved its bottom line over the last three years, but what does the future have in store? If you are thinking of buying or selling Mosaic stock, you should check out this FREE detailed report on its balance sheet.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Mosaic, it has a TSR of 176% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveMosaic shareholders are down 30% for the year (even including dividends), but the market itself is up 17%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 6% per year over half a decade. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. For instance, we've identified   2 warning signs for Mosaic (1 is potentially serious)  that you should be aware of.For those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

Against this backdrop, consumer tastes and preferences for fish products are also changing-desiring not only optimal taste, but also more ethical and sustainable means of production.To capture this change in consumer demand, Nova Scotia-based salmon farm Sustainable Blue has pioneered a new method of farming that optimizes the quality and sustainability of the breeding and nurturing process. With the assistance of Rockwell Automation (NYSE: ROK) and its system integrator, Fairfield Control Systems, and Blue Tech Systems, Sustainable Blue has integrated an advanced control solution to improve the water treatment and purity across its network of farms.The focus for Rockwell and Fairfield Control Systems was on developing a standardized control system able to handle extreme situations in an easily maintainable control environment.The control solution processes more than 5,000 tons of water every hour, using a recirculation aquaculture system (RAS), where water is recycled and reused after filtration to minimize water use.The Rockwell process control system provides closed-loop control of environmental variables for each system, such as the temperature, pH levels, oxygen levels, and water pressure, and provides alarms to ensure issues receive prompt response.According to Dr. Jeremy Lee, who serves as both technical director of Blue Tech and CTO of Sustainable Blue, the solution is ""a big benefit for us in terms of morale as our team is passionate about sustainability. It helps us attract customers who care about the welfare of the fish and the impact on the environment.""Learn more about the Rockwell control systems are helping Sustainable Blue operate on a self-sustaining basis-a unique feature in the industry.Story continuesRockwell Automation, Wednesday, June 14, 2023, Press release pictureTo meet global demand for fish products in a sustainable way, new thinking is essential.

An insider's optimism about the company's prospects is a positive sign.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. View our latest analysis for Boeing Boeing Insider Transactions Over The Last YearThe President David Calhoun made the biggest insider purchase in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$4.0m worth of shares at a price of US$160 each. Although we like to see insider buying, we note that this large purchase was at significantly below the recent price of US$217. Because it occurred at a lower valuation, it doesn't tell us much about whether insiders might find today's price attractive.Happily, we note that in the last year insiders paid US$4.2m for 26.29k shares. But they sold 412.00 shares for US$84k. In total, Boeing insiders bought more than they sold over the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeBoeing is not the only stock that insiders are buying. For those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Insiders At Boeing Have Sold Stock RecentlyThe last three months saw significant insider selling at Boeing. In total, insider Howard McKenzie dumped US$84k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Insider OwnershipLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Boeing insiders own about US$78m worth of shares. That equates to 0.06% of the company. This level of insider ownership is good but just short of being particularly stand-out. It certainly does suggest a reasonable degree of alignment.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About Boeing Insiders?An insider sold Boeing shares recently, but they didn't buy any. On the other hand, the insider transactions over the last year are encouraging. It's good to see insiders are shareholders. So we're happy enough to look past some selling. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. Case in point: We've spotted 1 warning sign for Boeing you should be aware of.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

In their court filings, proponents of the acquisition argued that the FTC had exceeded its authority by attempting to reverse a merger finalized nearly two years ago.""In one of the briefs, attorneys general from 12 states expressed, 'Unaccountable federal agency power undermines liberty, and overzealous, unfair agency enforcement impedes technological advancements benefitting citizens' wellbeing.'""Furthermore, 34 Republican lawmakers highlighted the value of Grail's early screening test, which can detect over 50 types of cancers through a single blood draw.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the DNA market, head over to 5 DNA Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up On. Genomics is the study of a complete set of DNA within an organism. The global genomics market was worth $28.39 billion in 2022, and it is expected to reach $98.7 billion by 2030, exhibiting a compound annual growth rate of 16.85% during the forecast period from 2022 to 2030. The growth in the global genomics market will primarily be driven by greater strides in gene targeted therapy and precision medicine. In addition to that, higher government subsidies and funding in the microbiology and genetics sector will also support growth. The cost of sequencing human genomes at present is below $1,000, which is remarkably less than a decade ago. This cost was estimated to be $1 million in 2007. This has now led to new market entrants and startups in the genomics space, propelling further innovation and growth. The amalgamation of genomics with artificial intelligence and machine learning is projected to fasten discoveries in the sector. The field of genomics is gaining traction all over the world. For example, India’s most famous billionaire and business magnate, Mukesh Ambani, is foraying into genetic mapping. Ambani plans to make genetic mapping more affordable and mainstream it throughout India’s rapidly growing consumer landscape. He took inspiration from American startups like 23andMe Holding Co. (NASDAQ:ME). Ambani’s goal is to make a genome sequencing test available for $145 in India. This test will be 86% less expensive as compared to the other alternatives locally available in India. The genome sequencing test indicates an individual’s inclination towards cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and neurodegenerative disorders, in addition to hereditary genetic ailments. Don't Miss: 12 Gene Editing Stocks With the Best Long-Term PotentialAnne Wojcicki, the co-founder and CEO of 23andMe Holding Co. (NASDAQ:ME), was in conversation with Fortune on April 25, 2023. She pointed out a recent study by The Lancet, a peer-reviewed medical journal, which indicated that negative reactions to medications can be cut by 30% if only medications were genetically tailored to the patients. Wojcicki also noted that millions of individuals have bought and performed DNA tests, which confirms robust consumer demand. 23andMe Holding Co. (NASDAQ:ME), along with Medscape, performed a survey which concluded that two-thirds of doctors are of the opinion that genetic testing could result in improved outcomes for patients, and more than 90% of the respondents agreed that genetic testing is a crucial component in understanding one's health status completely. Story continuesThe genomics market is rapidly growing and that leads to several attractive buying opportunities. Billionaires, never backing down from potentially profitable opportunities, are loading up on DNA stocks like Illumina, Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN), Invitae Corporation (NYSE:NVTA), and Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ:VRTX) to benefit from the boom in the genomics industry. Investors can also check out 11 Most Promising Gene Editing Stocks and 12 Biggest Genomics Companies in the World. Our Methodology Insider Monkey tracks billionaire-owned stocks and in this article, we selected the DNA stocks that attracted the highest number of billionaire investors during the first quarter of 2023.

ILMN is well poised for growth in the coming quarters, owing to solid long-term growth potential in the oncology space. The company ended the first quarter of 2023 with better-than-expected results. GRAIL continues to have strong demand from consumers, physicians, health systems and payers. However, expensive valuation and stiff competition raise apprehension.In the past year, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has gained 6.8% compared with the 2.2% rise of the industry and the 16.5% rise of the S&amp;P 500.The renowned life sciences company, which provides tools and integrated systems for the analysis of genetic variation and function, has a market capitalization of $32.70 billion. Its first-quarter 2023 earnings per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 300%.The company’s long-term expected growth rate of 22.2% exceeds the industry’s long-term growth expectation of 18.8%.Let’s delve deeperFactors at playQ1 Upsides:  Illumina delivered better-than-expected earnings and revenues in first-quarter 2023. Consolidated revenues were up 1% from fourth-quarter 2022 levels, exceeding the high end of the company’s guidance. Building on strong global interests, the company executed robust shipments of NovaSeq X instruments, exceeding its first-quarter guidance of 40-50 shipments.

146,1b7c3ed3-7833-3716-878a-7f17d2b035c5,CI,2023-06-15,Cigna Group (CI) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cigna-group-ci-attracting-investor-130006616.html,1686747606,STORY,['CI'],"[Cigna (CI) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this health insurer have returned +6.6%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +6.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Insurance - Multi line industry, which Cigna falls in, has gained 6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Cigna is expected to post earnings of $6.03 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -3.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.5%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $24.81 points to a change of +6.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.1%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $28.27 indicates a change of +13.9% from what Cigna is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Cigna.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Cigna, the consensus sales estimate of $47.13 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +3.7%. The $188.88 billion and $225.48 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +4.6% and +19.4%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryCigna reported revenues of $46.48 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +5.4%. EPS of $5.41 for the same period compares with $6.01 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $45.52 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.11%. The EPS surprise was +3.44%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Cigna is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Cigna. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The company is a leading developer of engineering simulation software and services widely used by engineers, designers, researchers across a broad spectrum of industries and academia.The increase in share price is driven by robust demand for its solutions across various verticals especially aerospace and defense, high-tech and automotive.In the automotive sector, higher demand for electric vehicles and advanced driver assistance systems solutions led to double-digit revenue growth in the last reported quarter. ANSS is likely to benefit from rapid growth in the high-tech industry led by ongoing development in artificial intelligence and machine learning. Solid momentum in the aerospace and defense sector owing to government-led programs and digital transformation bodes well.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIncreased demand for high-performance computing and 5G wireless systems in the semiconductor space are added positives. ANSYS’ solutions are also witnessing healthy uptake in the healthcare segment. Strong channel distribution, go-to-market momentum and a healthy pipeline are expected to contribute to the annual contract value.Aggressive acquisition strategy has played a pivotal part in developing the company’s business in the last few years. In May 2023, management announced the acquisition of Diakopto, a provider of Electronic Design Automation solutions for integrated circuit development. Diakopto focuses on addressing critical issues arising from layout parasitics, which have become increasingly complex in modern semiconductor designs employing advanced process node technologies.In January 2023, ANSYS announced the acquisition of Engineering Simulation and Scientific Software’s subsidiary - Rocky DEM.

Three officials see rates rising closer to 6%.""Inflation pressures continue to run high,"" Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said at a Wednesday press conference. Getting inflation down to the Fed's target ""has a long way to go.""Next year, officials see interest rates falling by 100 basis points to around 4.6%, higher than the 4.3% forecast in March.The pause announced Wednesday, Powell said, shouldn't be called a ""skip."" What it does do, he added, is give the economy more time to adapt to prior hikes while letting Fed officials see the ""full consequences"" of the banking turmoil that roiled the financial system in the spring.""We are trying to get this right,"" Powell said.Stocks closed mixed Wednesday. The S&amp;P 500 (^GSPC) was roughly flat, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) fell 0.68%, or more than 200 points. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rallied off lows to gain 0.39%.Many regional banks that struggled following the failures of several sizable lenders fell again Wednesday. PacWest (PACW) ended the day down 6.5%, Western Alliance (WAL) fell 5.8%, and Zions (ZION) was down 5.7%. Banks are highly sensitive to rate increases.The Fed had raised rates at 10 straight policy meetings through May, bringing its target range from 0%-0.25% to 5%-5.25%, the highest since 2007, in just 14 months. Wednesday's decision to hold rates steady was unanimous.Story continuesSince peaking at 9.1% in June 2022, inflation has come down, with headline inflation rising just 4.1% in May according to data released on Tuesday. On a ""core"" basis — which strips out volatile food and energy prices — inflation clocked in at 5.3% for May. That compares with 5.5% seen in April.Both readings are still well above the Fed's 2% target.Updated economic projections released Wednesday, said Renaissance macro economist Neil Dutta, allowed the Fed to have it both ways — pause rate hikes and also be more aggressive in signaling future action.""This is what the Fed had to do,"" Dutta wrote in an email.The Fed in its statement did leave itself room to raise rates again this year, keeping language that said, ""In determining the extent to which additional policy firming may be appropriate … the Committee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments.""Powell said at a press conference that the subject of what to do in July ""came up"" at the central bank's Federal Open Market Committee meeting Wednesday but the Fed didn't make a decision about what to do next month.Powell also brought back language made popular by former Fed Chair Janet Yellen ahead of the Fed's rate hiking cycle that began in 2015 — ""live"" meetings.Asked directly about July's meeting, Powell said — ""One, [a] decision hasn't been made. Two, I do expect that it will be a live meeting.""Powell also emphasized that inflation isn't coming down as quickly as the central bank had hoped.""We want to see it moving down decisively,"" he said. ""That's all. Of course, we are going to get inflation down to 2% over time. We want to do that with the minimum damage we can to the economy, of course. But we have to get inflation down to 2%, and we will.""Along with its policy decision on Wednesday, the Fed released an updated Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), which outlined officials’ expectations for growth, inflation, rates, and the labor market over the balance of this year and the next two.Fed officials see inflation finishing the year close to 4% now, compared with 3.6% prior. Unemployment is only seen rising to 4.1% from 4.5% previously. Officials now see stronger economic growth this year of 1% versus 0.4% previously.Officials again noted that tighter credit conditions for households and businesses are likely to weigh on the economy, hiring and inflation and the degree of impact is uncertain.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

HOME will address multifaceted challenges Latinos face in trying to buy a home by expanding market opportunities and providing potential homeowners with the resources they need to navigate the home-buying process.Wells Fargo is the first anchor funder of the HOME initiative as part of a larger, $25 million philanthropic investment in UnidosUS community-focused programs and nonprofit Affiliate partners to advance Latino homeownership. Of the $25 million in grant funding, $10 million will support the development of the HOME initiative, matching a $10 million investment from UnidosUS and kick-starting a robust $100 million fundraising effort to best undergird the program's goals over the next seven years.UnidosUS has long been committed to helping mortgage-ready Latinos and aspiring homeowners create pathways to build their credit, afford a down payment, overcome language barriers, avoid predatory lending and get approved for a sustainable mortgage. The HOME initiative is a cross-sector partnership that will accelerate and expand the possibilities for Latino homeownership opportunities in the U.S.""Homeownership has long provided the most effective pathway for families to build generational wealth in America. While Latinos continue to face barriers in becoming homeowners, they also have the greatest opportunity for homeownership growth in the U.S. To maximize this opportunity, we are launching the HOME initiative to help create four million new Latino homeowners by 2030,"" said Janet Murguía, President and CEO of UnidosUS. ""Our comprehensive strategy will help shape needed policy reforms while providing tools and resources Latinos need to successfully navigate the homebuying process.

""We will continue to expand our programs to reach more customers in underserved communities by leveraging our strong partnerships with UnidosUS and other non-profit organizations to break down the systemic barriers that make homeownership more difficult to attain and help make the dream of homeownership accessible to all Americans.""""Latino households are poised to drive most net new homeownership in the United States through at least 2040.

""We will support the development of evidence-based practices, track progress in meaningful ways and work to bridge knowledge gaps to move toward a more equitable state of homeownership in America.""The UnidosUS HOME initiative will support homebuyer readiness, expand credit access, increase housing supply and preserve homeownership. Specifically, the UnidosUS HOME agenda will:Create access to credit by modernizing lending rules, supporting ITIN holders and self-employed borrowers, diversifying language access and enhancing credit access for innovative housing solutionsIncrease housing supply by supporting increased density through zoning reforms, leveraging federal tax policy to boost supply for first-time homebuyers and supporting construction labor forcePreserve homeownership by leveraging interagency appraisal task force, enhancing accessibility of home renovation loans and supporting policies facilitating inter-generational wealth transferActivate select UnidosUS's community-based Affiliate organizations to provide consumer education and housing counseling that help prospective Latino homeowners make informed decisions in their homebuying journeyBolster the representation of Latino leadership, among other mechanisms, to empower leaders with lived experiences in the housing industryTo power various elements of the HOME initiative, UnidosUS will launch the first cohort of cities slated to receive targeted investments through the HOMEownership Solutions Network. The HOME initiative's first cohort includes Chicago, Illinois; Phoenix, Arizona; Stockton, California; Orlando, Florida; and Houston, Texas, communities with large Latino populations and tremendous housing opportunities for prospective Latino homebuyers and builders. The initiative will continue to expand into other states across the country through future cohorts.The HOMEownership Solutions Network will support versatile approaches to sub grant investments, local data analytics, communications, policy reform and serve more families by investing in the Wealth and Housing Alliance, UnidosUS Counseling Connecting, and Financial Empowerment Network; and train more housing counselors and financial coaches through the UnidosUS Learning Alliance. Additionally, the network will create innovative market opportunity pilots around topics like mortgages for ITIN holders and estate planning.UnidosUS has more than 25 years of experience building solutions that advocate for and enable access to affordable homeownership and economic mobility for Latinos. The organization operates one of the largest HUD-certified housing counseling networks with nearly 50 housing counseling agencies in 27 states and a nationwide call center. Undergirding those efforts is the Raza Development Fund, the largest Latino-serving Community Development Financial Institution (CDFI) in the country. Through the Raza Development Fund, UnidosUS has supported Affiliate organizations serving Latino families in 38 states with technical assistance and financing for major housing development projects. Building on this track record, UnidosUS will leverage its network of nearly 300 community-based Affiliate organizations that directly serve the Latino population across the country to strengthen its commitment to open doors for more Latinos to participate in our economy and transform their financial well-being.As the largest bank lender to Black and Hispanic families for the last decade, Wells Fargo remains deeply committed to advancing racial equity in homeownership. We are encouraged by the impact of our recent efforts and are committed to maintaining and sharpening our strategic focus on serving minority customers. Real-world results observed to date demonstrate that the steps taken by lenders like Wells Fargo to enhance service delivered to minorities can make a difference. Even amid such results, it will take time and consistent effort to have a meaningful impact. While individual actions are foundational, the causes of disparities in homeownership are systemic, and so the path to lasting progress depends on collaboration across the industry. Wells Fargo looks forward to continuing to play a leading role in the crucial, industry-wide effort to advance racial equity in homeownership.For more information about the HOME initiative, please visit https://unidosus.org/homeownership.About UnidosUSUnidosUS is a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization that serves as the nation's largest Hispanic civil rights and advocacy organization.

XBB and its offshoots, which now account for most U.S. infections, are descendents of the Omicron variant that caused COVID cases to surge to record levels early last year.U.S. regulators are looking to bring the next COVID-19 shots more closely in line with the circulating virus.The next generation shots should select a single XBB-related target, the FDA's staff reviewers suggested. A so-called monovalent vaccine would be a divergence from the most recent bivalent COVID boosters that targeted both the original strain of the coronavirus and Omicron.The expert panel meeting comes after an advisory group to the World Health Organization (WHO) last month recommended the next wave of COVID-19 booster shots be updated to target XBB subvariants. Europe's medicine regulators backed that recommendation.The FDA will take recommendations from its outside experts into consideration before making a final decision on composition of the shots.The panel will discuss, but not vote on, exactly which subvariant it believes the vaccines should target, with XBB.1.5, XBB.1.16 and XBB.2.3 among the candidates.COVID vaccine makers Pfizer/BioNtech, Moderna and Novavax are already developing versions of their respective vaccines targeting XBB.1.5 and other currently circulating subvariants.Only about 17% of the U.S. population - some 56.5 million people - received a COVID booster during the 2022-2023 vaccination season, according to government data through early May. Older Americans were boosted at a higher rate than the general population.Story continues""The highest risk people are really older adults as well as people with significant comorbidities,"" said Dr. Paul Sax from Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. ""That's the primary group to target.""Between Moderna and Pfizer, Morningstar analyst Karen Andersen expects 75 million doses to be sold in the United States during the 2023-2024 campaign.Moderna last month said it continues to expect the U.S. annual COVID-19 market to be 100 million doses, largely in line with Pfizer's view of 102 million.COVID deaths and hospitalizations have declined in 2023, and the U.S. government in May ended its COVID Public Health Emergency that had allowed millions of Americans receive vaccines, tests and treatments at no cost.""The good news is that we haven't had any surges in some time,"" Sax said. ""The less good news is that there's still COVID circulating and people still get it sort of year-round.""(Reporting by Bhanvi Satija and Sriparna Roy in Bengaluru; Editing by Michael Erman and Bill Berkrot)]"

Being able to model these is a crucial step towards the ability to tackle challenges such as designing more efficient fertilizers, building better batteries, and creating new medicines. But today's quantum systems are inherently noisy and they produce a significant number of errors that hamper performance. This is due to the fragile nature of quantum bits or qubits and disturbances from their environment.In their experiment, the IBM team demonstrates that it is possible for a quantum computer to outperform leading classical simulations by learning and mitigating errors in the system. The team used the IBM Quantum 'Eagle' quantum processor composed of 127 superconducting qubits on a chip to generate large, entangled states that simulate the dynamics of spins in a model of material and accurately predict properties such as its magnetization.To verify the accuracy of this modeling, a team of scientists at UC Berkeley simultaneously performed these simulations on advanced classical computers located at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab's National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC) and Purdue University. As the scale of the model increased, the quantum computer continued to turn out accurate results with the help of advanced error mitigation techniques, even while the classical computing methods eventually faltered and did not match the IBM Quantum system.Story continues""This is the first time we have seen quantum computers accurately model a physical system in nature beyond leading classical approaches,"" said Darío Gil, Senior Vice President and Director of IBM Research. ""To us, this milestone is a significant step in proving that today's quantum computers are capable, scientific tools that can be used to model problems that are extremely difficult – and perhaps impossible – for classical systems, signaling that we are now entering a new era of utility for quantum computing.""To learn more about the details of the demonstration and the results, read the IBM Research blog.IBM Commits to Utility-Scale Processors Across IBM Quantum SystemsFollowing this groundbreaking work, IBM is also announcing that its IBM Quantum systems running both on the cloud and on-site at partner locations will be powered by a minimum of 127 qubits, to be completed over the course of the next year.These processors provide access to computational power large enough to surpass classical methods for certain applications and will offer improved coherence times as well as lower error rates over previous IBM quantum systems. Such capabilities can be combined with continuously advancing error mitigation techniques to enable IBM Quantum systems to meet a new threshold for the industry, which IBM has termed 'utility-scale,' a point at which quantum computers could serve as scientific tools to explore a new scale of problems that classical systems may never be able to solve.""As we progress our mission to bring useful quantum computing to the world, we have solid evidence of the cornerstones needed to explore an entirely new class of computational problems,"" said Jay Gambetta, IBM Fellow and Vice President, IBM Quantum. ""By equipping our IBM Quantum systems with processors capable of utility scale, we are inviting our clients, partners and collaborators to bring their hardest problems to explore the limits of today's quantum systems and to begin extracting real value.""All IBM Quantum users will be able to run problems on utility-scale processors larger than 100 qubits. The over 2,000 participants in the IBM Quantum Spring Challenge had access to these utility-scale processors as they explored dynamic circuits, a technology that makes it easier to run more-advanced quantum algorithms.Global Researchers and Industry Leaders Pursue Value with IBM QuantumAs IBM expands its quantum technology stack, research institutions and private-sector leaders are mobilizing across industries for which quantum holds immediate potential. Equipped with more powerful quantum technology, including advanced hardware and tools to explore how error mitigation can enable accuracy today, pioneering organizations and universities are working with IBM to advance the value of quantum computing.These working groups that are exploring the potential value quantum computing offers include:Healthcare and Life Sciences: led by organizations such as Cleveland Clinic and Moderna, are exploring applications of quantum chemistry and quantum machine learning to challenges such as accelerated molecular discovery and patient risk prediction models.High Energy Physics: comprised of research institutions such as CERN and DESY, are working to identify the best suited quantum calculations, for areas such as fusion modeling.Materials: spearheaded by the teams at Boeing, Bosch, The University of Chicago, Oak Ridge National Lab, ExxonMobil and RIKEN, aim to explore the best methods to build workflows for materials simulation.Optimization: aimed at establishing collaboration across global institutions such as E.ON, Wells Fargo and others to explore key questions that progress the identification of optimization problems best suited for quantum advantage in sustainability and finance.About IBMIBM is a leading provider of global hybrid cloud and AI, and consulting expertise.

165,cfaaa67a-b030-3f79-8839-85a1b3bd9e08,IBM,2023-06-15,"A.I. researchers: ‘If we want A.I. to be good, we must nurture it like we would a child’",Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/researchers-want-good-must-nurture-103418461.html,1686738858,STORY,['IBM'],"[For years now, even before ChatGPT placed artificial intelligence firmly at the forefront of the public imagination, A.I. has been slowly taking hold across industries from medicine to aerospace. However, the technology hasn’t quite lived up to its potential. Not even close.A recent study found that only 11% of firms using A.I. have gained financial benefits. Even technology giants have struggled. IBM’s $20 billion diagnostic A.I. system Watson Health diagnosed cancer more accurately than doctors in laboratory experiments but flopped in the field. It became a commercial and reputational disaster for the storied American company.The failure could hardly be blamed on a lack of technical expertise. IBM had tasked an army of engineers to work on Watson. Our extensive research on the challenges of developing A.I. in various commercial settings points to a surprising cause: Watson was developed and brought to market in a way that works well for traditional I.T.–but not A.I.. This is due to a fundamental difference between conventional software and A.I.: While the former processes data, A.I. continually learns from the data and becomes better over time, transcending even its intended capabilities if nurtured properly.Practices analogous to the best parenting styles can accelerate A.I. development. We prescribe an A.I. development approach that is based on nurturing and learning and has been implemented in more than 200 A.I. projects for industrial and other customers.Let it learn from mistakesChildren do not learn to cycle by watching an educational video but by clambering onto a bike and stepping on the pedals, learning valuable lessons from each painful fall–before long, the magic happens.The same logic applies to A.I. Many companies like IBM think they should collect vast amounts of data to perfect the algorithms before deployment. This is misguided. Putting A.I. to work in the real world, rather than sequestering it in controlled environments, helps generate more data that in turn feeds back into the development process.Story continuesAlthough early deployment is inherently riskier, it also initiates a continuous feedback loop through which the algorithm is enriched by new data. Further, it is important that the data stems from both standard and difficult or atypical situations that, taken together, support comprehensive A.I. development.ChatGPT is a great example. The chatbot was released to the public by OpenAI last November while still wet behind the ears, albeit more for reasons concerned with getting ahead of the competition. In any case, the gamble worked: Not only has ChatGPT become a worldwide phenomenon, leaving the likes of Google’s Bard scrambling, but its early launch also garnered millions of users and generated vast amounts of data for OpenAI to push out GPT-4, an improved version of the bot, only months later.Another example is Grammarly, whose finessing of its writing assistance system with the help of user feedback showcases the power of continuous A.I. improvement and adaptation, particularly in the complex and context-sensitive realm of languages.Similarly, Apodigi, a frontrunner in the digitalization of the pharmacy business, launched in June 2020 an A.I.-assisted pharmacy app that can be described as learning on the job. Called Treet, the app proposes medication based on doctors’ prescriptions which a pharmacist then reviews and tweaks. The pharmacist’s responses coalesce into a stream of continuous feedback which finetunes the algorithm and contributes to better recommendations that address the complexities of each patient’s needs and preferences.By comparison, IBM developed and tested Watson Health extensively in the laboratory and pushed out the diagnostic tool to market without incorporating continuous learning from real-world data. This traditional build-test-deploy process proved inadequate for training A.I.Keep it safeSafety mechanisms that protect consumers and safeguard reputations are essential in A.I. development. For example, Tesla runs new versions of its self-driving software in the background while a human drives the car. Decisions made by the software, say turning the steering wheel, are compared to the driver’s. Any significant deviation or unusual decisions are analyzed, and the A.I. is retrained if required. Simulator environments such as AILiveSIM allow for full-scale AI systems to be safely and comprehensively tested before their deployment in the real world.A.I. developed for creative applications arguably needs stronger guardrails. Analogous to children mixing with bad company and learning undesirable habits, A.I. could be exposed to training data that are riddled with biases and discriminatory content.To preempt this, OpenAI, for one, employs an approach called adversarial training to train its A.I. model to not be fooled by rogue inputs from attackers. This method involves exposing chatbots to adversarial content that threatens to overcome the bot’s standard constraints, enabling it to recognize rogue content and avoid falling for them in the future.Capture behaviorIn the ideal A.I. development cycle, developers log all user reactions and behavior to feed further development of the algorithm without questioning the accuracy or value of a recommendation or prediction. The Netflix A.I. content recommender, for example, simply notes whether a user watches the recommended content and the viewing duration. The algorithm learns from each response to make a better recommendation next time.The developers of Watson Health could have achieved better outcomes if they had subscribed to this principle. Rather than programming the algorithm to solicit doctors’ evaluation of the A.I.-generated recommendation, they could have trained the system to simply record doctors’ prescriptions. Integrating Watson Health into patient information systems would also have immersed it in a feedback loop for continuous training based on actual cases and patient outcomes.User feedback provides excellent training data for vertical applications with a specific focus.But rather than relying on humans to label data, developers should think of ways to automate the process. For example, connecting a vehicle’s front camera feed with the steering wheel can automatically create labels for winding roads and feed into AI models learning to drive a car on complicated routes.In fact, developers should deploy many automated data collectors and design explicit feedback loops for learning at scale. In the above example of driving assistance development, many vehicles can cover a wider variety of situations than just a few. A vehicle cutting in front of a Tesla triggers a video upload from the previous few seconds preceding the event. The system feeds the footage into Tesla’s deep neural network that learns the various signals, such as a gradual movement towards the lane divider, that predict the cut-in and take appropriate action like slowing down. In contrast, traditional car companies are often mired in a fixed mindset, developing and deploying driving assistance software with little automated feedback collection or data updating.Continuous learningJust as children do not stay in kindergarten forever; the training methodology for A.I. should be continuously upgraded. But too often, A.I. developers focus on the latest developments in A.I. algorithms and individual use cases rather than engineering the system to cover a large number of use cases and data streams.Going one step further, companies can develop a simulation environment that generates synthetic data and allows for faster development cycles. For example, Tesla captures data from its fleet of cars to feed a simulator that simulates complex traffic environments, resulting in new synthetic training data.Tero Ojanpera, Ph.D., has been a professor of practice on intelligent platforms at Aalto University since 2021.

To skip our detailed analysis of the energy industry, head on over to Top 5 Most Profitable Energy Companies in the World. Energy is one of the most important - and one of the most controversial - industries in the modern world. The industry has contributed the most to human development by vast amounts of cheap energy to run airplanes, cars, factories, and homes. At the same time, the costs of generating this power have taken their toll on the environment.For instance, our study of the most polluting companies in the world shows that the top three firms that have emitted the most carbon dioxide between 1751 and 2018 are oil companies. These firms are Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), and Saudi Arabian Oil Company (TADAWUL:2222.SR) - which are also coincidentally among some of the biggest oil companies in the world.At the same time, the energy industry saw renewed investor attention and demand last year as the Russian invasion of Ukraine took place. This led to a disruption of the global oil industry and made the Western world in particular focus on non Russian oil sources. In terms of market value, the oil industry is one of the most valuable in the world. For instance, according to research from The Business Research Company, the crude oil market was worth $2.7 trillion in 2022 and will be worth $2.9 trillion in 2023. From this year until 2027 the second is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.6% to sit at $3.4 trillion by the end of the forecast period. The firm believes that this growth will primarily come from the developing world, particularly due to the fast growing economies of India and China. And, 'coincidentally'. once again, India and China are also two of the three countries with the most carbon dioxide emissions.Additionally, even though the crude oil industry is worth trillions of dollars, the renewable energy industry is quite lucrative as well. Precedence Research believes that the global renewable energy market was worth $1 trillion in 2022 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 8.6% until 2030 to be worth an estimated $1.9 trillion by then. Looking at the industry sector wise, the data shows that the solar energy segment will outpace the broader market's growth through a 13.5% CAGR. These figures are quite telling, as despite being a relatively young industry in terms of global interest, the renewable energy industry is still quite large and is catching up to at least crude oil in terms of market value. Within the industry, there are countless renewable energy stocks that have caught hedge fund attention. The selection depends on different factors, such as cheap, profitable, and overall best renewable energy stocks. Some top cheap renewable energy stocks include Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Enphase Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH) and NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE). If you're interested to learn about most profitable renewable energy stocks then the top names are Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), and Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL), and overall, here are the best renewable energy stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors.Story continuesGetting into the nitty gritty of the renewable energy industry, not only did the coronavirus pandemic nearly upend the global oil supply chain, but the post war shocks also impacted solar and wind power supply chains. According to McKinsey, materials such as polysilicon used to make solar panels and others such as aluminum, steel, and copper often have unpredictable supply chains. Most polysilicon supply originates from China, making it vulnerable to natural disasters and factory incidents - which led to the prices of this crucial raw material growing by a whopping 350% between 2020 and 2022. It adds that the wind turbine industry faced high costs after the Russian invasion of Ukraine since the wind turbine companies did not hedge their material prices. However, despite these constraints, McKinsey also estimates that between 2021 and 2030, planned power generation from solar and wind power projects is slated to grow from 125 gigawatts to 459 gigawatts. Out of these, the bulk will be generated from solar photovoltaic projects (or solar panels as they're commonly known) and most of the remainder will come from on shore wind projects.Digging deeper into the countless energy stocks trading on the market, notable cheap energy stocks are PDC Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:PDCE), Coterra Energy Inc. (NYSE:CTRA), and Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE:MRO). Interested in dividends? Well, we've identified 11 best energy dividend stocks as well, and some best energy stocks overall are Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE:VLO), EOG Resources, Inc. (NYSE:EOG), and ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP).However, as the market estimates show, traditional energy is here to stay, and taking a current look at the industry, here's what the management of Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) had to say during the firm's latest earnings call:First quarter oil equivalent production was down about 80,000 barrels per day from last year due to the expiration of a contract in Thailand and the sale of our Eagle Ford asset.This was partially offset by growth in the Permian. We expect 2023 production growth in the Permian to be back-end loaded as wells put on production, POPs increase across both operated and non-operated areas. We expect our royalty production to be roughly flat. As discussed during our Investor Day, we’re increasing activity in New Mexico. All four company-operated rigs added this year, one each quarter, will be in New Mexico, leading to more POPs expected in the second half of the year and into 2024. We also continue to be active in Texas. Last year, about half of our company-operated production was in the Delaware Basin in Texas with the remainder split about evenly between the Midland Basin and New Mexico. More than half of our non-operated production is with five major operators in large, contiguous positions in core areas with multiyear development programs, where we have visibility to capex and execution schedules and a royalty benefit compared to the operator.With these details in mind, let's take a look at some of the most profitable energy companies in the world. Some top names are  Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Saudi Arabian Oil Company (TADAWUL:2222.SR), and Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL).Top 20 Most Profitable Energy Companies in the WorldPhoto by Robin Sommer on UnsplashOur Methodology To compile our list of the most profitable oil companies, we sifted out energy companies with the highest net profits.Top 20 Most Profitable Energy Companies in the World20.

DUK recently signed an agreement to sell its Commercial Renewables business to Brookfield Renewable (BEP) for $2.8 billion. The deal is subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approval. The transaction is expected to reach completion by the end of 2023.Rationale Behind the DealCommercial Renewables is an unregulated utility-scale business of Duke Energy that boasts assets of 3,400 megawatts-alternating current in the realm of utility-scale solar, wind and battery storage across the United States. As Duke Energy locks in the deal with Brookfield Renewable, it aims to become a pure regulated company with an increased focus on grid enhancement and gradual expansion into the regulated renewable energy business.Pursuant to the sale of the business, Duke Energy will receive net proceeds of $1.1 billion. The company aims to use the sale proceeds to strengthen its balance sheet and steer clear of raising any further debt liabilities, thus providing financial flexibility to achieve business goals.Duke Energy’s Renewable TargetDuke Energy aims to expand its regulated renewable asset base by more than 30,000 megawatts (MW) by 2035 and plans to phase out carbon emissions from electric generation by 2050. It also adopted an interim goal of reducing Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions by 50% below the 2021 levels by 2035.To attain this goal, it plans to invest $40 billion in zero-carbon generation, such as solar, wind and battery storage resources, and extend the life of its nuclear fleet and approximately $5 billion in hydrogen-enabled natural gas technologies. The proceeds from the aforementioned transaction are likely to contribute to its long-term goal in the renewable space.Such efforts by  Duke Energy in renewables will assist the company in achieving its target and expanding in the renewable energy space.Utilities’ Focus on RenewablesUtilities in the United States are diversifying their energy mix with an increased focus on next-generation energy to tackle climate change. Apart from DUK, utilities that are expanding their renewable base are as follows:Story continuesEntergy Corporation’s ETR arm, Entergy Louisiana, filed a request in March 2023 with the Louisiana Public Service Commission seeking consent for the construction of two solar projects with a combined production capacity of 225 MW. The company aims to expand its renewable energy portfolio with these projects.Entergy’s long-term earnings growth rate is 5.7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ETR’s 2023 earnings suggests a growth rate of 3.9% from the prior-year reported figure.CMS Energy’s CMS arm, Consumers Energy, announced the commencement of the operations of the Covert Generating Station in Southwest Michigan's Van Buren County in June 2023. This station is an important part of its industry-leading Clean Energy Plan to meet Michigan's energy needs this summer and for years to come.CMS Energy has a long-term earnings growth rate of 7.5%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CMS’ 2023 sales suggests a growth rate of 3.1% from the prior-year reported figure.The AES Corporation AES announced in June 2023 that the first phase of its Chevelon Butte wind farm has commenced commercial operation. The first phase, which brings in 238 MW of clean energy to AES Corp. customers, enables the company to take a step forward in meeting its green energy goal.AES Corp. has a long-term earnings growth rate of 8.8%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for AES’ 2023 sales implies a growth rate of 2.3% from the prior-year reported figure.Price MovementIn the past year, Duke Energy’s shares have decreased 9.4% compared with the industry’s 7.5% decline.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks RankDuke Energy currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.Currently, General Motors Company has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), while Tesla has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). This means that GM's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics, including the tried-and-true P/E ratio, the P/S ratio, earnings yield, and cash flow per share, as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use.GM currently has a forward P/E ratio of 5.50, while TSLA has a forward P/E of 72.65. We also note that GM has a PEG ratio of 0.56. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. TSLA currently has a PEG ratio of 2.95.Another notable valuation metric for GM is its P/B ratio of 0.71. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, TSLA has a P/B of 16.79.These metrics, and several others, help GM earn a Value grade of A, while TSLA has been given a Value grade of D.Story continuesGM stands above TSLA thanks to its solid earnings outlook, and based on these valuation figures, we also feel that GM is the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

172,af410c6e-1ee2-3f28-abe7-a2eb0b6d0a78,GM,2023-06-15,General Motors Company (GM) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/general-motors-company-gm-trending-130011669.html,1686747611,STORY,['GM'],"[General Motors Company (GM) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this company have returned +19.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +6.1% change. The Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry, to which General Motors Company belongs, has gained 44% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, General Motors Company is expected to post earnings of $1.64 per share, indicating a change of +43.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $6.84 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -9.9%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.51 indicates a change of -4.9% from what General Motors Company is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for General Motors Company.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For General Motors Company, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $41.7 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +16.6%. For the current and next fiscal years, $163.85 billion and $165.96 billion estimates indicate +4.5% and +1.3% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryGeneral Motors Company reported revenues of $39.99 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +11.1%. EPS of $2.21 for the same period compares with $2.09 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $38.68 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +3.38%. The EPS surprise was +34.76%.Over the last four quarters, General Motors Company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.General Motors Company is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about General Motors Company. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

173,5839bdfe-156e-3b69-bfd1-0b5f1002fbb6,MKC,2023-06-15,Altria (MO) Gains on Pricing Power Amid Low Cigarette Volumes,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/altria-mo-gains-pricing-power-122200932.html,1686745320,STORY,"['MO', 'MKC-V']","[Altria Group, Inc. MO looks well-positioned due to the strength of its Oral Tobacco Products segment. Solid pricing power has also been working well for the company amid low cigarette volumes. These upsides were witnessed in the first quarter of 2023.After considering the buyout of NJOY Holdings, Inc. (concluded on Jun 1, 2023), Altria envisions the full-year 2023 adjusted EPS in the band of $4.89-$5.03, calling for 1-4% growth from the year-ago period’s adjusted EPS of $4.84.Key UpsidesAltria has been responding to the changing market scenario by offering several oral tobacco, e-vapor and heated tobacco products. The company (through its subsidiary Helix Innovations) has full global ownership of on! — a popular tobacco-derived nicotine (TDN) pouch product. on! is a worthwhile addition to Altria’s smokeless portfolio as oral TDN products are gaining popularity in the United States due to their low-risk claims.Management continues to expand the manufacturing capacity and the commercial availability of the product. Net revenues in the Oral Tobacco Products segment rose 2.4% from the year-ago quarter’s level to $628 million in the first quarter of 2023. The upside can be attributed to improved pricing. In the first quarter, on! reported shipment volumes grew 38% to 25.2 million cans. on! saw its share of the total oral tobacco category increase by 2.4 share points to 6.5% in the first quarter.Altria is committed to responsibly speeding up the U.S. adoption of NJOY ACE, which is presently the only pod-based e-vapor product with FDA’s marketing approval. The company’s strategic deal with JT Group, which includes a joint venture for the U.S. commercialization of heated tobacco stick products, is noteworthy. Moreover, MO is undertaking efforts to expand in the cannabis industry. This is evident from the acquisition of the stakes of the Canadian cannabis company, Cronos Group.Moving on, Altria has been benefiting from its strong pricing power. Though higher pricing might lead to a possible decline in cigarette consumption, it is seen that smokers tend to absorb price increases due to the addictive quality of cigarettes. In the first quarter of 2023, higher pricing offered respite to revenues across the Smokeable Products and Oral Tobacco categories, which were otherwise hurt by lower volumes. Higher pricing aided the adjusted operating companies income (OCI) in both segments.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchVolume ConcernsIn the first quarter of 2023, Altria’s net revenues fell 2.9% year over year to $5,719 million. The decline was mainly due to reduced net revenues in the Smokeable Products unit.In the Smokeable Products segment, net revenues dropped 3.3% year over year to $5,090 million due to the reduced shipment volume and increased promotional investments, partly compensated by greater pricing.  Domestic cigarette shipment volumes decreased 11.4%, mainly due to the industry’s decline rate, retail share losses and trade inventory movements, partly countered by calendar differences.The industry’s decline and retail share losses were a result of macroeconomic pressure on Adult Tobacco Consumers’ (ATCs) disposable income. On its first-quarter earnings call, management stated that consumers’ discretionary income remained pressurized due to a rise in overall inflation.Increased inflation has been causing consumers to alter their buying patterns, which has been weighing on cigarette industry volumes since the second quarter of 2022. These factors lingered in the first quarter of 2023, and the company plans to continue assessing these aspects and their impacts on tobacco consumers throughout this year.Apart from this, management’s bottom-line view for 2023 considers planned investments associated with costs to improve the digital consumer engagement system, enhanced smoke-free product research, development and marketplace activities to support the company’s smoke-free products. The view also considers the reduced expected net periodic benefit income.Nonetheless, robust pricing actions and Oral Tobacco Products’ strength are likely to keep working well for Altria amid the abovementioned headwinds.Shares of the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have climbed 0.1% year to date against the industry’s drop of 10.3%.Solid Staple StocksSome better-ranked consumer staple stocks are The Kraft Heinz Company KHC, McCormick &amp; Company, Incorporated MKC and Conagra Brands CAG.The Kraft Heinz Company, a food and beverage product company, currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

The company expects adjusted EBITDA in the band of $65-$80 million for the second quarter. The adjusted EBITDA margin is likely to be 7.9-9.4% in the quarter, calling for a 130-280 bps improvement.In the first half of fiscal 2023, TreeHouse Foods anticipates revenues in the range of $1.705-$1.735 billion, suggesting 7.7-9.6% growth from the year-ago period.For fiscal 2023, TreeHouse Foods expects net sales growth of 6-8% year over year to the $3.66-$3.73 billion band.  Adjusted EBITDA is likely to be in the $355-$370 million range, up nearly 26% year over year at the midpoint. Adjusted EBITDA was earlier expected in the range of $345-$365 million, suggesting around 24% growth at the midpoint.Story continuesWhat’s More?As a repositioned company, THS is a stronger and more focused entity, which is solidifying its position in the high-growth, high-margin categories.

In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Carnival CCL and Carnival rival Royal Caribbean RCL.Here is a synopsis of all four stocks:Bull of the Day:NVR is a homebuilder operating in 32 US metropolitan markets that is experiencing strong stock appreciation thanks to earnings upgrades, superior business economics, and housing supply tailwinds.NVR utilizes a unique lot acquisition strategy, which limits risk in the cyclical housing market and improves Return on Equity (ROE). Additionally, the structural undersupply of housing in the US provides for an environment where NVR’s homes are a scarce product and thus in very high demand.To the surprise of most analysts, homebuilder stocks have been on a tear this year and the Building Products – Home Builders industry currently sits in the top 2% of the Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 10 years NVR stock has far outperformed the broad market, compounding at an annual rate of 20%.NVR is up 29% YTD and still has bullish catalysts on the horizon. With strong earnings revisions, and a convincing technical chart pattern, NVR makes for a compelling investment.Earnings RevisionsNVR boasts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), indicating upward trending earnings revisions. Although current quarter earnings estimates have been mixed, all other timeframes have seen significant upgrades. FY23 earnings have been boosted by 4% over the last two months, and FY24 earnings have been revised higher by 10%.Lot Acquisition StrategyIn contrast to many other homebuilders, NVR specializes in selling and constructing high-quality homes through a unique approach. Instead of owning and developing land, NVR focuses on acquiring finished building lots from third-party land developers at market prices.This strategy minimizes the company's financial obligations and risks, as the legal obligation and potential economic loss are limited to the deposit amount in the event of failure. By avoiding direct land ownership and development, NVR gains operational efficiencies and a competitive advantage over its peers, enabling the company to deliver quality homes while mitigating the uncertainties associated with the cyclical nature of the industry.Story continuesThis strategy decreases the capital intensity of the business and thus increases the Return on Equity. NVR’s ROE currently stands at 49%, which is much higher than the industry average of 21.3%.Secular Trends in HousingAmidst a dramatic surge in interest and mortgage rates in the past 18 months, initial expectations pointed towards a potential crash in the housing market. Surprisingly, the correction in housing prices remained modest, with only the most overheated markets experiencing notable markdowns.The underlying reason for this resilience lies in the significant shortage of new housing supply. Even with a notable decrease in demand, the scarcity of available homes prevented a substantial correction in housing prices. The haunting memories of the early 2000s housing bubble have left a lasting impact on home developers, restraining the growth of new housing supply. While this scarcity poses challenges for homebuyers, it presents a promising opportunity for homebuilders like NVR and others in the industry, as their products are in high demand.Technical SetupThe price action in NVR is very encouraging for the bulls. After finding support at pre-Covid highs late last year, the stock has rallied considerably. Over the last two months, NVR has built out a convincing bull flag, which it is in the midst of breaking out from.Above the $5,900 level and the stock is going to be gunning for new all-time highs. Above that and there is no upside resistance. If the price reverses back below $5,900 then the pattern may need more time to develop, however below $5,600 and investors should be weary as the pattern will be invalidated.ValuationNVR is trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 14.3, which is below the market average of 20x, and below its 10-year median of 16x. The company also enjoys a stable balance sheet with a huge cash position of $2.8 billion, limiting the downside risk in the stock.Bottom LineNVR currently demonstrates several promising factors that make it an attractive investment option. From a technical trade setup to a strong earnings revisions trend, investors can confidently consider NVR as a viable trade.Moreover, NVR prioritizes its investors by actively returning cash. Over the past two decades, the company has demonstrated its commitment to shareholder value by reducing shares outstanding through significant share buybacks, amounting to a 66% reduction.Adding to its appeal, with the Federal Reserve nearing the completion of its interest rate hiking cycle, prospective homebuyers can anticipate a downward trend in interest rates. This favorable development will effectively lower the cost of obtaining a mortgage and ultimately make homeownership more affordable.Bear of the Day:United States Cellular is the fourth largest full-service wireless carrier in the US. However, USM is being edged out by its larger rivals, who can out-compete with aggressive pricing for their service plans. Additionally, USM suffers from a high debt burden, downward trending earnings revisions, and stagnant market share in the industry.United States Cellular has been a poor performing stock over the last decade, declining by -50% over that time. Unfortunately for USM, it doesn’t look like things are improving anytime soon, and thus the stock should be avoided by investors for now.DowngradesEarnings revisions have been trending consistently lower for the last year, reflected by USM’s Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). Current quarter earnings have been revised lower by -52% and are expected to decline by -50% YoY. FY23 earnings have been downgraded by -78% and are projected to decline by -69% YoY.Annual sales have been stagnant for the last 15 years, stuck at $4 billion. This isn’t expected to change as current quarter sales are projected to shrink by -2.6%, and FY23 sales are expected to decline by -2.7%.ValuationUnited States Cellular is trading at a one-year forward sales multiple of 0.35x, which is a significant discount to the indsutry average of 1.5x, and below its 10-year median of 0.8x. Yet, there are few if any upside catalyst on the horizon to improve the outlook.Bottom LineWith declining sales, earnings, and market share, USM is clearly struggling. The cellular network industry is highly competitive, and even the larger incumbents have struggled in recent years.Even after increasing investment into network advancement in an effort to improve efficiency through cost optimization, market penetration remains around 15%, and sales growth is sputtering. Additionally, with just $154 million in cash and $3.3 billion in debt, the mounting loan obligations are quickly limiting prospects.Without the involvement of a brilliant activist investor, a major technological breakthrough, or business overhaul, USM is likely to continue to struggle and investors should steer clear of the stock.Additional content:Cruise Stocks Climb Amid Strong Booking Demand, Analyst UpgradesMomentum has begun to swarm in cruise stocks, as pent-up demand following the pandemic has now evolved into sustainable growth. Wall Street analysts have recently turned bullish on the sector, with one stock in particular benefitting from a flurry of upgrades.With the tide smoothing over for cruise liners, is it time to hop aboard?The Zacks RundownThe Zacks Leisure and Recreation Services industry group currently ranks in the top 28% out of more than 250 Zacks Ranked Industries.Because this group is ranked in the top half of all industries, we expect it to continue to outperform the market over the next 3 to 6 months, just as it has year-to-date with a 25.3% return:Historical research studies suggest that approximately half of a stock’s price appreciation is due to its industry grouping. In fact, the top 50% of Zacks Ranked Industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.It’s no secret that investing in stocks that are part of leading industry groups can give us a leg up relative to the market. By focusing on leading stocks within the top 50% of Zacks Ranked Industries, we can dramatically improve our stock-picking success.Carnival Spikes After Analyst UpgradesCarnival operates a fleet of more than 90 ships that visit approximately 700 ports. The company provides destination services under recognized brand names such as AIDA, Carnival, Costa, Princess, and Seabourn. Carnival sells its cruises primarily through travel agents, tour operators, vacation planners, and websites.CCL shares surged more than 12% on Monday and were up another 2% early Tuesday morning, trading near a 13-month high following two separate analyst upgrades. Bank of America Securities analyst Andrew Didora raised his rating on Carnival stock to buy, while JPMorgan’s Matthew Boss turned his stance to overweight.Didora noted that demand is trending higher, even surpassing pre-pandemic levels in certain areas. Improved booking trends, bundled package offerings, and increased advertising activities added to the positive sentiment. Both analysts raised their respective price targets.CCL is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. Carnival appears to have turned the corner as it has now surpassed earnings estimates in each of the past two quarters. The company has seen its shares rise more than 80% this year.The fundamentals are backing up the price movement. Revenues this year are expected to climb 72.2% to $20.95 billion. While Carnival is still expected to show a loss, earnings estimates are on the rise for FY 2024, with analysts bumping up their estimates by 2.7% in the past 60 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is now $0.76/share, translating to a 355.83% increase relative to fiscal 2023 projections.What the Zacks Model UnveilsThe Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) seeks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that this recent information can serve as a more accurate predictor of the future, which can give investors a leg up during earnings season.The technique has proven to be quite useful in finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better with a positive Earnings ESP, stocks delivered a positive surprise 70% of the time according to our 10-year back test.CCL is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and boasts a +2.86% Earnings ESP. Another beat may be in the cards when the company reports its fiscal Q2 results on June 23rd (estimated announcement date).Carnival rival Royal Caribbean advanced 2.57% on Monday and edged higher early Tuesday. The Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock has witnessed its share price rocket nearly 90% higher since the start of the year. RCL has exceeded earnings estimates in each of the past four quarters, sporting an average 26.4% beat during that timeframe.Analysts covering Royal Caribbean have increased their 2023 earnings estimates by 45.82% in the past 60 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at $4.71/share, reflecting potential growth of 162.8% relative to last year.RCL also received a recent price target hike from Bank of America. Make sure to keep an eye on these cruise stocks as the waters appear calm.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

(NYSE:V) insiders ditched their stock over the past year, which may be of interest to the company's shareholders. When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for Visa The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At VisaThe Vice Chair, Kelly Tullier, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$6.1m worth of shares at a price of US$233 each. So what is clear is that an insider saw fit to sell at around the current price of US$223. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. Given that the sale took place at around current prices, it makes us a little cautious but is hardly a major concern.In the last year Visa insiders didn't buy any company stock. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Visa Insiders Are Selling The StockThe last quarter saw substantial insider selling of Visa shares. In total, insiders dumped US$13m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Insider Ownership Of VisaFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Visa insiders own 0.05% of the company, currently worth about US$229m based on the recent share price. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Visa Tell Us?Insiders haven't bought Visa stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. But since Visa is profitable and growing, we're not too worried by this. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. You'd be interested to know, that we found 1 warning sign for Visa and we suggest you have a look.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

That makes Africa, home to more than 1.4 billion people — about a third of whom don’t have access to financial infrastructure — a growth market for Visa and Mastercard Inc. Visa expects fintechs to help it access as many as 50 million merchants that don’t use digital payments.“This is how we’re going to reach” the 1.4 billion consumers that are out there, Torre said in an interview on Wednesday. “We’re really interested in enabling these fintechs to be able to go into these markets and work with our existing ecosystem.”In a report published in August, McKinsey estimated that Africa’s financial services market could grow at about 10% a year to top $230 billion in revenue by 2025. Visa, which increased its employee strength in Africa by 50% in the past two years, plans to open a new office in Tanzania. It already has 10 offices on the continent.Africa’s median age of about 20 years is the world’s lowest, according to McKinsey.

And we've seen some truly amazing gains over the years. For example, the KLA Corporation (NASDAQ:KLAC) share price is up a whopping 336% in the last half decade, a handsome return for long term holders. And this is just one example of the epic gains achieved by some long term investors. Also pleasing for shareholders was the 24% gain in the last three months. But this could be related to the strong market, which is up 11% in the last three months.With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. Check out our latest analysis for KLA While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Over half a decade, KLA managed to grow its earnings per share at 41% a year. This EPS growth is higher than the 34% average annual increase in the share price. So it seems the market isn't so enthusiastic about the stock these days.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that KLA has improved its bottom line over the last three years, but what does the future have in store? If you are thinking of buying or selling KLA stock, you should check out this FREE detailed report on its balance sheet.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for KLA the TSR over the last 5 years was 376%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that KLA shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 57% over the last year. That's including the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 37% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand KLA better, we need to consider many other factors. Take risks, for example - KLA has   1 warning sign   we think you should be aware of.Of course KLA may not be the best stock to buy.

Additionally, customers in Pine Ridge, Aberdeen, and Parkston will be able to experience Verizon’s lightning fast 5G service for the first time, while engineers continue to expand coverage throughout Sioux Falls. Verizon’s 5G Ultra Wideband brings power and performance comparable to a wired broadband internet connection to customers’ pockets.Verizon's 5G Ultra Wideband enables people to do things on their mobile device that many could only do before when connected to their home internet service. This includes everything from downloading huge documents and streaming movies in HD audio and video, to playing console quality games and conducting video chats, video conferencing and FaceTime calls with clear sound and video.“Verizon’s expansion into more markets across South Dakota will bring enhanced connectivity across our state,” said Majority Leader Senator Casey Crabtree of South Dakota. “This technology will not only bring faster speeds and more reliable connectivity, but expanding 5G service into more areas of South Dakota will fuel tourism in our state and unlock new opportunities for innovation and economic growth.”“Verizon is widely known for having an exceptionally reliable 5G network experience, and it’s exciting to see the positive impact our work has had in South Dakota,” said Dean Brauer, Vice President of Engineering and Operations for Verizon. “Our network engineers work tirelessly to provide unmatched connectivity to our customers across South Dakota, and we will not slow down.”Story continuesNetwork enhancements in South Dakota These deployments use Verizon’s recently acquired C-band spectrum. Verizon will deploy 5G Ultra Wideband using up to 100 MHz of C-Band spectrum in multiple South Dakota markets, and will add even more bandwidth once all of its licensed spectrum is made available. This additional bandwidth, which will be available at the end of this year, will provide exceptional speed and capacity.Lastly, the addition of 5G service in South Dakota will result in exponential increases in data carried into and out of the cell sites serving the community, which requires upgraded fiber optic cable links. Verizon has increased the capacity on the fiber connections in many cell sites so they can carry 10 times the amount of data.Get the most of our 5G Ultra WidebandFor customers in South Dakota, the additional coverage and capacity means more customers now have access not only to reliable, fast mobile service, but also Verizon Home Internet service, a different kind of home internet with no data caps.

The Deforestation-Free Call to Action for Leather is a cross-sector initiative aimed at galvanizing action from brands to end the deforestation and conversion of natural ecosystems linked to leather sourcing. In doing so, it looks to protect wildlife habitat and biodiversity, preserve carbon stocks, and protect human rights.Cattle rearing is considered to be one of the most significant drivers of deforestation. It is also a major contributor to the conversion of natural ecosystems such as grasslands and savannahs. While beef production is the primary reason for cattle farming, the leather industry has an important opportunity to drive change. Currently, the industry is at varying stages of tackling deforestation and conversion.Leather is a key material in many of Tapestry's brands' iconic styles and designs - it's undeniably an important part of the company's business. Because of the importance of leather to Coach, kate spade and Stuart Weitzman, Tapestry is committed to supporting verified deforestation and conversion-free leather supply chains. The Textile Exchange's Call to Action for Leather initiative advances the critical industry transformation that results in traceable deforestation and conversion-free hides becoming the market standard for the leather industry. Furthermore, this commitment aligns with work already underway at Tapestry, with likeminded brands and leading nonprofits, to support initiatives that minimize leather's impact on natural resources.Tapestry is already working towards this by aiming to achieve 95% traceability and mapping of raw materials to ensure a transparent and responsible supply chain by 2025.Story continuesTapestry's commitment to the Call to Action is complementary to the company's existing approaches, goals, and workstreams related to responsible leather supply chains. Tapestry is proud to join other brands publicly committing to develop and adopt solutions to ensure that leather is not contributing to deforestation and land conversion. This collective action has the potential to spur industry transformation by aligning brands and the leather industry on a common roadmap for achieving this goal.The initiative sets meaningful expectations for brands and provides tools and guidance to support them. The guidance was created in consultation with WWF, the National Wildlife Federation (NWF), and the Accountability Framework initiative (AFi).The Deforestation-Free Call to Action for Leather is now open for brands to join. Early signatories making the commitment include adidas, American Eagle Outfitters, Inc. (AEO), AllSaints, Arezzo&amp;Co, BMW Group, Capri Holdings, H&amp;M Group, Icebug, Kering, Mango, Marks &amp; Spencer, PUMA, Range Revolution, Reformation, Roots, R.M. Williams and Tapestry.Cattle farming practices cannot be transformed overnight. Collaboration and alignment among the many stakeholders in the leather and beef industries are critical to driving change on the ground and delivering the outcomes of the Deforestation-Free Call to Action for Leather.Tapestry encourages companies to learn more.

But we don't see that in the aggregate productivity number. Productivity growth in the US has been barely 1%, slightly lower. In 10 years, are we going to see a significant increase in productivity? I'm quite optimistic. I'm a productivity optimist and a technology optimist,"" Roubini told Yahoo Finance Live (video above).This week alone brought two examples of generative AI's potential for economic output.First, a new McKinsey study identified 63 generative AI use cases spanning 16 business functions that could unleash $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion in economic benefits annually.The same study found that generative AI could perform each of more than 2,100 detailed work activities such as communicating with others about operational plans.""Generative AI has the potential to change the anatomy of work, augmenting the capabilities of individual workers by automating some of their individual activities. Current generative AI and other technologies have the potential to automate work activities that absorb 60 to 70 percent of employees’ time today,"" McKinsey's researchers noted.UNITED STATES - OCTOBER 11: Dr. Nouriel Roubini of New York University Stern School of Business, testifies during a Senate Banking Committee hearing. (Photo By Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call) (Tom Williams via Getty Images)Meanwhile, software giant Salesforce (CRM) took the wraps off its new GPT enterprise products designed to boost worker productivity.The company introduced ""AI Cloud"" at a New York City investor day. Salesforce says its AI Cloud product will allow marketers to auto-generate personalized content for customers and developers to auto-generate code, among other use cases.Salesforce employees also showed off coming AI functions in the workplace collaboration platform Slack. Most of Salesforce's new AI suite will begin rolling out in the coming months.Story continues""We've seen a lot of exciting waves of technology in our industry — the cloud, social, mobile — but this AI wave is going be the biggest that anyone has ever seen,"" Salesforce co-founder, chairman, and CEO Marc Benioff told Yahoo Finance Live.Despite AI's promising positive impact on the economy, Roubini and other experts do warn about the drawbacks.""I think there are meaningful lags [on AI's impact]. And the idea there will be a surge in economic growth in the next two or three years because of AI and technology to me seems to be sort of farfetched,"" Roubini said. ""In the medium long term, technology is going to be deflationary. But we might be facing a decade of stagflation before we see the bright light of technology and AI increasing growth and reducing inflation.""Goldman Sachs estimated recently that generative AI could expose the equivalent of 300 million jobs globally to automation over the next decade. That's a nice way of saying a person may lose their job to a robot.But to Roubini's point, Goldman notes US labor productivity will grow by 1.5% over a 10-year period following the widespread adoption of generative AI. AI could also eventually increase the annual global Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 7%.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor. Follow Sozzi on Twitter @BrianSozzi and on LinkedIn.

This involves the supply of two new LNG process trains that will contribute to the existing four trains for the North Field East (NFE) LNG project.The AP-X liquefaction technology provided by Air Products is known for its efficiency and capability to facilitate higher LNG production. With the addition of these two new LNG process trains, each with a production capacity of eight million tons per annum, the overall production capacity of the NFS Project will be significantly enhanced.Air Products has been a significant contributor to the development of Qatar's LNG industry in Ras Laffan. It has supplied crucial equipment and technology for each of Qatar's existing LNG trains. Starting from the initial units that began production in 1996, which utilized Air Products' AP-C3MR LNG Process technology, the company has been playing a key role in the expansion and advancement of Qatar's LNG facilities.

(NYSE: CMI) announced a new line of Onan RV and Commercial Mobile generators compliant with California Air Resource Board (CARB) Small Off-Road Engines (SORE) 2024 standards. The current spark-ignited product portfolio will be certified to the new regulations. The Onan Quiet Gas portfolio has undergone some mechanical changes and engine calibration adjustments to reach the significant emissions reductions targets. Cummins is also introducing an entirely new generator platform to the Quiet Gas series called Onan QG 4000i.The Onan QG 4000i replaces the current QG 4000 and features electronic fuel injection, a permanent magnet alternator and inverter technology to provide quieter operation, more fuel efficiency, and over 50% reduction in hydrocarbon (HC) + nitrogen oxide (NOx) and carbon dioxide (CO) emissions. The QG 4000i features a closed loop fuel system which utilizes an oxygen sensor to provide critical operating feedback to the engine. This feedback from the oxygen sensor allows the engine to optimize the system for maximum fuel efficiency and minimum exhaust emissions, a feature never before available on an Onan generator. The Onan QG 4000i will be available for sale in California in April 2024.The recently confirmed CARB amendments to the Small Off-Road Engine (SORE) emissions regulation will impact engines powered by gasoline and liquid propane vapor (LP) used in RV generators. The reduction in emissions required to meet the new regulation starting in January 2024 is significant. The SORE regulation measures HC+NOx as well as CO across what is called an emissions durability period. Not only have the emissions limits been reduced on this change, but the emissions durability period has also been extended. The regulation does not measure all engines the same, instead they are categorized based on engine size. Two engine size categories, below 225cc and 225-825cc, represent the majority of spark-ignited RV generators available on the market today between 2.5kW and 7kW.Story continuesThe Onan QG 3600 LP, QG 5500 LP, and QG 6500 LP operate on liquid propane vapor which is a cleaner burning fuel than gasoline; therefore, it will meet the emissions regulation with no mechanical changes. The entire portfolio of LP generators will be available in California beginning January 1, 2024.The Onan QG 2500i LP and QG 2800i were introduced in 2020 featuring a variable speed electronic fuel injection engine and inverter technology. With a few more mechanical enhancements and new engine calibration, this generator will be available in California in February 2024.The Onan QG 5500 and QG 7000 generators have EFI variants available today and are undergoing electronic calibration and certification development to reach the new targets. There are no expected hardware changes on this product platform. Only the EFI variants will be available for sale in California beginning in April 2024.While these emissions reductions are very challenging, Cummins is prepared to achieve them with modern engine technology such as electronic fuel injection and exhaust aftertreatment. Cummins innovates technology and products to meet government regulations related to the emissions of their products. Cummins understands that sustainability should be everyone’s goal because strong communities and vibrant economies depend on a healthier planet. The company has a rich history of providing the RV industry with reliable power generation, and this is no exception. OEMs and RV dealers will get a first look at the new product portfolio beginning in June as Cummins kicks off the Onan Unplugged Tour. Cummins RV experts are visiting several cities across the country this summer and fall to demonstrate the new products.About Cummins Inc.Cummins Inc., a global power leader, is a corporation of complementary business segments that design, manufacture, distribute and service a broad portfolio of power solutions.

PRU.5 Dividend-Paying Multiline Insurers That Ensure Stable IncomeInvestors look for returns on their investments in the form of dividends. Amid volatile market conditions, companies that have an impressive dividend history are always investors’ favorites.The Zacks Multiline Insurance industry has lost 12.1% year to date. However, Assurant Inc., Radian Group Inc., Old Republic International Corporation, MetLife Inc. and Prudential Financial Inc., with their impressive dividend history, offer investors a breather.Insurers, backed by strong fundamentals, enjoy a solid capital position that in turn supports effective capital deployment.  Multiline insurers benefit from a diversified portfolio that lowers concentration risk. Increased awareness drives demand for protection products, which benefits sales and premiums of life insurance operations. Continued improvement in pricing is expected to support premium growth of non-life insurance operations. Also, an increase in exposure of intangibles and cyber threats offers room for growth for non-life insurers. Per Deloitte Insights, life insurance premiums are estimated to increase 1.9% in 2023 while non-life premiums are expected to increase 2.2%. The report also stated that trends like commercial lines witnessing growth at a faster pace than personal lines and homeowners’ premiums improving at a better rate than personal auto are likely to continue in 2023.Insurers invest a portion of their premium income. Therefore, higher the rates. better the investment results. Also, the interest rate environment is improving. The Fed has already made three hikes in 2023, taking the tally to 10 since March 2022. Also, investment income is an important component of insurers’ top line. However, concerns related to whether Fed will pause further hikes remain. Thus, all eyes are on the outcome of the two-day Fed meeting concluding this Thursday. These solid fundamentals should help companies to maintain dividend streakStory continuesPlayers are investing heavily in technology to improve scale and efficiencies. While a solid policyholders’ surplus helps the industry absorb losses, a sturdy capital level aids insurers in pursuing strategic mergers and acquisitions, investing in growth initiatives, engaging in share buybacks, and increasing dividends or paying out special dividends.Dividend Stocks for Your PortfolioIn this volatile market, stocks that give regular dividends offer an attractive investment opportunity. Regular dividend hikes reflect a company’s confidence in operational strength, which, in turn, fuels earnings power.With the help of the Zacks Stock Screener, we have selected five multiline insurers that have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold), a dividend yield of more than 2% as well as a five-year historical dividend growth rate of more than 2%. These stocks have a payout ratio of less than 60, reflecting enough room for future dividend increases.

The insurer sports a Zacks Rank #1.The insurer has increased dividends for 18 straight years since its initial public offering in 2004. The insurer’s payout ratio is 26, with a five-year dividend growth rate of 4.6%.

226,6a5759e5-d346-3888-b0c0-e7b7b528df35,DVN,2023-06-15,Is Devon Energy Corporation's (NYSE:DVN) Latest Stock Performance A Reflection Of Its Financial Health?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/devon-energy-corporations-nyse-dvn-110027534.html,1686826827,STORY,['DVN'],"[Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN) has had a great run on the share market with its stock up by a significant 6.1% over the last month. Since the market usually pay for a company’s long-term fundamentals, we decided to study the company’s key performance indicators to see if they could be influencing the market. In this article, we decided to focus on Devon Energy's  ROE.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. See our latest analysis for Devon Energy How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Devon Energy is:54% = US$6.0b ÷ US$11b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.54 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.Devon Energy's Earnings Growth And 54% ROEFirst thing first, we like that Devon Energy has an impressive ROE. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 32% the company's ROE is quite impressive. Under the circumstances, Devon Energy's considerable five year net income growth of 57% was to be expected.As a next step, we compared Devon Energy's net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 22%.Story continuespast-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. What is DVN worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether DVN is currently mispriced by the market.Is Devon Energy Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?Devon Energy's three-year median payout ratio is a pretty moderate 47%, meaning the company retains 53% of its income. This suggests that its dividend is well covered, and given the high growth we discussed above, it looks like Devon Energy is reinvesting its earnings efficiently.Besides, Devon Energy has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company is expected to drop to 35% over the next three years. Still forecasts suggest that Devon Energy's future ROE will drop to 21% even though the the company's payout ratio is expected to decrease. This suggests that there could be other factors could driving the anticipated decline in the company's ROE.ConclusionOn the whole, we feel that Devon Energy's performance has been quite good. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. Having said that, on studying current analyst estimates, we were concerned to see that while the company has grown its earnings in the past, analysts expect its earnings to shrink in the future. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

Although it is significantly behind its cloud peers, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), the software vendor seems to be on track as it fights for its place under the sun, which in this scenario, is actually, its majesty, the cloud.Key Fiscal Fourth Quarter FiguresFor the quarter ended on May 31st, Oracle generated $13.84 billion in revenue that grew 17% YoY, topping Refinitiv’s expectations of $13.74 billion and earned $1.67 in adjusted earnings per share, also topping Refinitiv’s expectation of $1.58 per share. Net income rose from last year’s comparable quarter and reached $3.32 billion, or $1.19 per share.SegmentationOracle’s main source of revenue, cloud services and license support, made a 23% progress to $9.37 billion. However, revenue from cloud licenses and on-premises actually dropped 15% as it amounted to $2.15 billion. Revenue from cloud infrastructure expanded 76% and accelerated from 55% growth in the previous quarter, as it amounted to $1.4 billion. Although Oracle is much smaller than its rivals such as Amazon, Microsoft and Google, it is growing faster than both Microsoft and Google on this front. CEO Safra Catz stated the unit’s gross margin is expected to continue expanding.Cloud Is The Star Of The ShowAmid the broader rally in technology stocks, shares of Oracle have outperformed the market and the S&amp;P 500 index. Excluding the after-hours trading, Oracle’s shares rose about 43% year to date, while the S&amp;P 500 index rose only about 13%. Over the past year, Oracle has risen more than 50%, far outpacing the 4% rise in the S&amp;P 500 index. Although this performance is a result of several factors, it is largely owed to positive prospects of the company’s cloud ambitions. Oracle’s primary offering in this segment is called the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) and it gives corporations various cloud computing services such as storage and networking, while promising security, reliability and scalability. Although it is lagging behind Amazon, Google and Microsoft. Oracle is doing a good job at positioning itself in a market that is forecasted to grow to $947.3 billion by 2026. All in all, Oracle, known for its database technology, is undergoing a successful business model transformation as it focuses on cloud subscriptions, and the cloud is certainly the right place to be at the moment. During the reported quarter, Oracle revealed that more of its cloud services were approved for use by U.S. defense and intelligence agencies.Story continuesFiscal First Quarter GuidanceWith revenue growing in the range between 8% and 10% revenue growth, adjusted earnings are expected in the range between $1.12 and $1.16 per share.New AI ServiceFollowing Microsoft’s footsteps, the software giant has followed with its own AI bet. Oracle partnered with start-up Cohere to bring in generative artificial intelligence to the cloud service. Cohere has agreed to use Oracle’s cloud infrastructure. Oracle has started to use the tool, Cohere AI cloud service, internally. After confirming the partnership, Oracle’s founder and chief technology officer, Larry Ellison stated that such specialized large language models will be essential to highly trained professionals to make efficient use of their precious time. Still far behind Microsoft, as well as Amazon Web Services who unveiled its Bedrock generative AI services and Google who updated its services and models at the most recent conference, Oracle is certainly going in the right direction - towards the cloud.DISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

233,720b64f8-f9e1-3eda-b363-f5504bc884e4,MU,2023-06-15,MU Stock Alert: Micron Announces Wind Power Partnership With Terra-Gen,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mu-stock-alert-micron-announces-183701408.html,1686249421,STORY,['MU'],"[Computer memory and data storage specialist Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) generated headlines on Thursday morning when it announced a partnership with Terra-Gen, a leading developer of renewable energy. On paper, the agreement will help undergird Micron’s renewable energy integration ambitions. However, MU stock dipped around 3% in the afternoon hours, likely due to feasibility concerns associated with go-green initiatives, along with an overheated artificial intelligence (AI) market.According to the accompanying press release, Micron signed a 15-year virtual power purchase agreement for its U.S. operations with Terra-Gen. Under the terms of the deal, Micron will receive about 178 megawatts (MW) of wind electricity capacity. As well, it will receive associated renewable energy certificates annually. Specifically, this contract will aid Micron’s U.S.-focused target to hit 100% renewable energy incorporate by the end of 2025.Further, this agreement represents the latest milestone in Micron’s ambitions to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsMicron Executive Vice President of Global Operations Manish Bhatia emphasized the company’s progress toward fully integrating renewable energy sources. “Terra-Gen’s proven track record of building and operating efficient facilities, as well as the maturity of this particular wind project enables Micron to diversify our energy portfolio and to effectively manage our long-term energy costs in the U.S.,” added Bhatia.MU Stock Possibly Hit with Feasibility and AI Hype ConcernsAlthough the recent disclosure should be a net positive for society, investors had other ideas. Not only did MU stock slip on Thursday, for the trailing five sessions, it’s down about 7%. At least some of the headwinds may be due to concerns that the AI-adjacent economy may be getting overheated. Additionally, feasibility regarding renewable energy initiatives may be clouding Micron.Story continuesFor the latter, not everyone is buying the holistic benefits of fully sustainable energy ambitions. Yes, federal government data indicates that wind power specifically carries significant advantages, such as cost-effectiveness and job creation. At the same time, rising competition, installation challenges and wildlife impact stand among the disadvantages.Moreover, even arguably left-leaning thinktanks like Brookings Institution question the substance behind the good intentions of “net zero” pledges. Essentially, the summary of the position is that, at best, go-green initiatives may be largely ineffective or inadequate. At worst, they may disadvantage poorer nations or create false impressions of positive environmental impact.As for the red ink in MU stock, investors could be taking profits off the table as the AI hype machine soared over the past few months. Micron represents a powerful cog within the AI-adjacent economy, providing high-capacity memory and multi-chip packages to undergird various smart digitalization applications.Since the start of the year, MU stock gained an impressive 29% of equity value.Why It MattersAccording to TipRanks, MU stock carries a consensus view of moderate buy. Against 24 total ratings within the past three months, 18 represent buys, suggesting broad optimism. However, some doubts have also crept in, with four holds and two sells. Overall, the experts’ average price target stands at $71.33, implying nearly 10% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

234,8decb83e-604d-3b4b-bc76-72d0505688df,HAS,2023-06-15,Hasbro (NASDAQ:HAS) Has Announced A Dividend Of $0.70,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hasbro-nasdaq-announced-dividend-0-190839623.html,1686769719,STORY,['HAS'],"[Hasbro, Inc. (NASDAQ:HAS) has announced that it will pay a dividend of $0.70 per share on the 15th of August. Based on this payment, the dividend yield on the company's stock will be 4.5%, which is an attractive boost to shareholder returns.While the dividend yield is important for income investors, it is also important to consider any large share price moves, as this will generally outweigh any gains from distributions. Investors will be pleased to see that Hasbro's stock price has increased by 33% in the last 3 months, which is good for shareholders and can also explain a decrease in the dividend yield. See our latest analysis for Hasbro Hasbro's Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageImpressive dividend yields are good, but this doesn't matter much if the payments can't be sustained. Prior to this announcement, the company was paying out 323% of what it was earning. Without profits and cash flows increasing, it would be difficult for the company to continue paying the dividend at this level.According to analysts, EPS should be several times higher next year. If recent patterns in the dividend continue, we could see the payout ratio reaching 47% which is fairly sustainable.historic-dividendHasbro Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $1.44 in 2013, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $2.80. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 6.9% over that duration. The growth of the dividend has been pretty reliable, so we think this can offer investors some nice additional income in their portfolio.The Dividend Has Limited Growth PotentialSome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. However, initial appearances might be deceiving. Hasbro's EPS has fallen by approximately 13% per year during the past five years. Such rapid declines definitely have the potential to constrain dividend payments if the trend continues into the future. It's not all bad news though, as the earnings are predicted to rise over the next 12 months - we would just be a bit cautious until this becomes a long term trend.Story continuesThe Dividend Could Prove To Be UnreliableIn summary, while it's good to see that the dividend hasn't been cut, we are a bit cautious about Hasbro's payments, as there could be some issues with sustaining them into the future. We can't deny that the payments have been very stable, but we are a little bit worried about the very high payout ratio. Overall, we don't think this company has the makings of a good income stock.Market movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock. For example, we've identified 4 warning signs for Hasbro (2 make us uncomfortable!) that you should be aware of before investing. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

It’s easy to see why, given the rapid pace of developments that we’ve seen in fields such as chat bots and AI-powered image generation.However, many AI stocks have already run up sharply, making them less of a bargain today. Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) is a leading AI stock play that is still selling at a reasonable price.Investors associate QCOM stock with the smartphone market, and rightly so. The firm built its business on top of innovations in mobile telecom standards such as patents for 3G and 4G networking solutions. With smartphone sales slumping lately, QCOM stock fell with it.But Qualcomm is much more than just smartphones today. Its Snapdragon platform has powered several leading consumer electronic products.Qualcomm continues to innovate on the cutting-edge of chip technology, including in AI.In a recent presentation, for example, Qualcomm explains how it is “making AI ubiquitous” by putting artificial intelligence into mobile, autos, tablets, connected appliances and more.Qualcomm isn’t just theorizing. It has leading AI chip designs including some models which have outperformed Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) units in some performance tests.Story continuesEndava (DAVA)Illustration of phone with dollar sign and other graphics symbolizing fintech displayed on and around it, with a blue background. Overvalued tech stocksSource: shutterstock.com/ZinetroNEndava (NYSE:DAVA) is an information technology company. It essentially functions as a consulting shop, offering IT solutions to large enterprises that are looking to outsource much of their internal computing infrastructure.Endava’s business model follows that of industry pioneer EPAM Systems (NYSE:EPAM). EPAM pioneered the idea of hiring IT professionals in lower-cost countries, such as in Eastern Europe, while charging full price for its IT services.This sort of labor arbitrage has proven highly profitable, with EPAM stock rising more than 1,000% since its IPO 11 years ago. Endava has refined the idea while focusing on verticals, such as IT solutions for banks, insurance, and payments technologies.DAVA stock has lost more than half its value since the 2021 peak as investors have shunned anything related to banks and payments. The selling accelerated this week as a guidance cut from EPAM sent the whole sector tumbling.With Endava’s latest drop, it is now going for less than 19 times forward earnings. That’s a huge bargain for a company that has quadrupled both its revenues and earnings per share since 2017 and should return to rapid growth next year.Fidelity National Information Services (FIS)Close up of FIS ground sign in Tampa, Fl, USA.

In recent years, it has diversified.Fidelity National Information is now a leader in payment processing thanks to its 2019 purchase of Worldpay. It also entered the market for record-keeping for custodians, asset managers and traders with its Sungard acquisition.However, like other companies tied to the payments industry, FIS stock has gotten smashed over the past year. With the tailwind from rising e-commerce sales gone, and the potential for a recession, payments stocks are wildly out of favor today.As a result, FIS stock is down a shocking 48% over the past year. That puts the company at less than 10 times forward earnings, even as analysts project that the firm will return to 10% annualized earnings growth in 2024. Morningstar’s Brett Horn believes FIS stock is worth $83, whereas it trades around $55 today.On the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in EPAM, DAVA, and QCOM stock.

Now, he considers himself ""truly blessed"" for the opportunity to work cross-functionally with people throughout the McDonald's system on a daily basis.""I love how we all work together to make the customer experience the best it can be,"" he says.The Journey to a Job at McDonald'sAbiman was born in India and emigrated with his family to the United States at age 2. As a kid, his family moved around the Midwest a few times before settling in Michigan. ""I think moving so much made me much more social and adaptable to change,"" Abiman explains.As it happens, Abiman was a big fan of legal television dramas growing up. ""I wanted to be a lawyer back when I was 5 or 6 years old,"" he laughs. After college - where he met his now wife - Abiman did end up enrolling in law school, where he discovered his passion for employment law during a summer internship.""I enjoyed how much employment law touches on peoples' issues, and how you can see the impact of your work right away,"" he says.In 2014, Abiman interviewed for a role on his current team but didn't get the job. He enjoyed the process and hoped he would have another opportunity down the road. In 2017, Abiman unexpectedly received an email from Rafael Medina, an attorney who had met him during the 2014 process, asking if he was still interested in joining McDonald's global labor and employment team. The answer was an unequivocal ""yes.""Since joining McDonald's, Abiman has ascended to the role of General Counsel for McDonald's Operating Company (McOpCo) - the company-owned restaurants in the United States. Every day, his north star is helping ensure McDonald's guests receive a fabulous customer experience when they interact with our restaurants.Story continues""In order to give customers the best experience, we have to give employees the best experience,"" he says. ""After all, they're the touch point for McDonald's billions served.""Making a Difference Beyond McDonald'sAbiman's passions extend beyond his legal work impacting McDonald's business. During his first year at McDonald's, Abiman joined McDonald's Asia Pacific Middle East Network (APMEN). By 2019, he'd been named Co-Chair for the McDonald's Headquarters (MHQ) chapter, and in December 2022, he was appointed Vice Chair for the global APMEN network.""I take my role with APMEN very seriously,"" Abiman says. ""I know I and our members find support and inspiration in the network, and it's important to me that everyone feels included.""Abiman is also active on the legal department's Pro Bono Committee as well as its Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Committee, and sits on the boards of local nonprofits. ""I'm passionate about giving people chances and opportunities that they might otherwise not get,"" he says.One thing he loves and appreciates is that, ""everyone has a McDonald's story.""""I vividly remember being so excited to get my Chicken McNuggets growing up,"" he says. ""It's so cool to be here 30+ years later and create those same moments and opportunities for other people around the world.""View original content hereMcDonald's Corporation, Thursday, June 15, 2023, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from McDonald's Corporation on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: McDonald's CorporationWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/mcdonalds-corporationEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: McDonald's CorporationView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/761493/This-Legal-Superstar-Aims-To-Make-a-Difference-at-McDonalds-Every-Day]"

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the meat industry and consumption trends, go directly to the Top 5 Countries with the Highest Meat Consumption.As reported in one of our articles earlier, the global meat products market is expected to witness significant growth during the forecast period of 2022 to 2029. The market is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.7% to reach a total value of $1,345.9 billion. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations (UN) forecasted global annual meat production of 361 million tons in 2022. This translated into an average meat consumption per person per day of 118.6 grams. The FAO has forecasted an increase of 14% in global meat consumption by 2030. Considering the projected global population surpassing 9 billion by the middle of this century, it is expected that global meat consumption will rise to 570 million tons by 2050.Overall, global meat consumption has been increasing steadily over the past few decades. According to Our World in Data, Hong Kong and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines are the countries in which meat consumption per capita is increasing at the fastest rate. Factors such as population growth, urbanization, and rising incomes in developing countries have contributed to this trend. As more people move out of poverty, they often seek to include more meat in their diets. Meat consumption varies significantly across different regions of the world. Spain, Italy, and France are among the leading consumers of meat in Europe. Developed countries tend to have higher meat consumption per capita compared to developing countries. While India has a significant level of annual meat supply, the country’s per capita meat consumption stands at only 4.58 kg. This makes India the country that eats the least meat on a per-person basis on our list. On the other hand, countries like Germany, the United States, and Japan rank among the top 10 countries with the highest meat consumption. These nations have well-established meat industries and a cultural preference for meat-based diets.Story continuesKey Players in the Industry As of 2023, 72%, or $963.20 billion, of the global meat industry revenue, is dependent on fresh meat and 26.2%, or $347 billion, comes from processed meat. Meanwhile, the remaining 1.8% or $12.74 billion, is contributed by meat substitutes. The patterns of red meat consumption per capita by country play a significant role in shaping the global meat industry landscape. Some of the leading companies capitalizing on the expanding meat industry include Hormel Foods Corporation (NYSE:HRL), Beyond Meat, Inc. (NASDAQ:BYND), and The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR). You can also read about the 10 Best Beef Stocks to Buy Now here.In the United States, the biggest meat company in terms of revenue is Kansas-based Cargill Meat Solutions, a subsidiary of the privately held company Cargill Incorporated. Cargill Meat Solutions had an annual revenue of $165 billion in 2022, with a headcount of 165,000 employees. Another significant provider of meat products in the US is Springdale, Arkansas-based Tyson Foods, Inc. (NYSE:TSN). The company had an annual revenue of $53.3 billion as of 2022. Tyson Foods, Inc. (NYSE:TSN) has a presence in 45 states and employs 140,000 people. Furthermore, quick service restaurants (QSR) like the Chicago, Illinois-based McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) also play an important role in the meat industry. McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) alone purchases 0.861 million tons of beef annually to serve billions of burgers across the world through its 38,000 locations.With this context in mind, let’s take a look at our meat consumption by country rankings.Top 20 Countries with the Highest Meat ConsumptionCopyright: andreadonetti / 123RF Stock PhotoOur MethodologyWe obtained the annual meat consumption data for all the countries from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).

But in any diversified portfolio of stocks, you'll see some that fall short of the average. For example, the Seagate Technology Holdings plc (NASDAQ:STX) share price return of 25% over three years lags the market return in the same period. Zooming in, the stock is actually down 14% in the last year.Since the stock has added US$1.3b to its market cap in the past week alone, let's see if underlying performance has been driving long-term returns. See our latest analysis for Seagate Technology Holdings To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During the three years of share price growth, Seagate Technology Holdings actually saw its earnings per share (EPS) drop 9.5% per year.So we doubt that the market is looking to EPS for its main judge of the company's value. Therefore, we think it's worth considering other metrics as well.Interestingly, the dividend has increased over time; so that may have given the share price a boost. It could be that the company is reaching maturity and dividend investors are buying for the yield.You can see below how earnings and revenue have changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-and-revenue-growthSeagate Technology Holdings is a well known stock, with plenty of analyst coverage, suggesting some visibility into future growth. If you are thinking of buying or selling Seagate Technology Holdings stock, you should check out this free report showing analyst consensus estimates for future profits.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for Seagate Technology Holdings the TSR over the last 3 years was 41%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveInvestors in Seagate Technology Holdings had a tough year, with a total loss of 10% (including dividends), against a market gain of about 17%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 7% per year over half a decade. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider risks, for instance.

One is the company’s product lineup, which includes Rubbermaid containers and Sharpie markers.Perhaps during times of elevated inflation and recession worries, however, cost-conscious shoppers are likely to turn to cheaper brands than Rubbermaid and Sharpie. (Feel free to visit your local dollar store to see some of the similar off-brand offerings.)The other main reason to consider investing in Newell Brands is the dividend – but we’ll discuss that issue momentarily. For now, let’s take a closer look at Newell Brands’ financials, which are less than stellar.Newell Brands flipped from normalized diluted EPS of 16 cents in 2022’s fourth quarter, to an EPS loss of 6 cents in 2023’s first quarter. Newell Brands also reported year-over-year core sales and net sales declines in both Q4 2022 and Q1 2023.Finally, here’s a jaw-dropper. According to the company, “At the end of the first quarter [of 2023], Newell Brands had cash and cash equivalents of $271 million and net debt outstanding of $5.4 billion.” That’s a startling imbalance, wouldn’t you agree?Story continuesThe NWL Stock Dividend Could Be in JeopardyGiven Newell Brands’ awful financials, it’s going to be challenging for the company to continue paying a dividend. Indeed, there’s already evidence that Newell Brands has had difficulty maintaining its dividend yield.Last month, Newell Brands disclosed it had reduced its quarterly dividend to 7 cents. What Newell Brands didn’t mention in the press release (probably because it’s embarrassing) is that the quarterly dividend has been much higher, at 23 cents.That’s a bad sign, if there ever was one. Moreover, Newell Brands’ trailing 12-month dividend payout ratio is rather high at 63.33%. Here’s a rule of thumb to put this into perspective.When a company is paying out more than 50% of its EPS in dividend distributions, it’s definitely possible that the dividend is unsustainable.Newell Doesn’t Deserve Your Attention or MoneyNewell Brands stock has been “dead money” for a while, as it’s far below its 1998 and 2017 peaks. The dividend payouts might provide a small consolation prize, but those payments might end at some point.Besides, having some well-known products isn’t enough. Newell Brands is clearly failing to leverage those brand names into per-share profits. Therefore, there’s no need for anyone to rush out and buy NWL stock. It gets an “F” rating and could continue to be “dead money” for the foreseeable future.On the date of publication, neither Louis Navellier nor the InvestorPlace Research Staff member primarily responsible for this article held (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.Louis Navellier, who has been called “one of the most important money managers of our time,” has broken the silence in this shocking “tell all” video… exposing one of the most shocking events in our country’s history… and the one move every American needs to make today.More From InvestorPlaceBuy This $5 Stock BEFORE This Apple Project Goes LiveWall Street Titan: Here’s My #1 Stock for 2023The $1 Investment You MUST Take Advantage of Right NowIt doesn’t matter if you have $500 or $5 million.

For example, the American Express Platinum Card offers a number of money-saving benefits to travelers.“The Platinum Card offers annual hotel and airline credits, a CLEAR credit and access to the best airport lounge network,” said Anthony Cirri, executive vice president of U.S. consumer product management and lending at American Express.Story continuesIf you’re loyal to a particular airline, you may consider using an airline credit card, such as the Delta SkyMiles American Express cards, to book your trip.“The Delta SkyMiles American Express cards help card members get the most out of Delta’s SkyMiles program, like status upgrades and extra SkyMiles points on Delta purchases,” Cirri said.Other money-saving benefits you should look out for when choosing a credit card include no foreign transaction fees, travel insurance, free checked bags, and discounts on hotels and rental cars.57% Use Credit Card Points To Book TripsCredit cards often offer multiple ways to redeem points for trips. It’s worth comparing the different point conversions to find what’s actually the best deal.For example, American Express allows card members to redeem points in a variety of ways. “Membership Rewards Points can be redeemed [by] using Pay with Points to pay for a trip, or they can redeem points with one of our 20 airline and hotel partners to redeem for things like airfare and hotel stays,” Cirri said.Watson said that you will typically get the best deals if you book directly through the credit card provider. However, not every travel pro agrees.“The best way to use credit card points is to transfer them to a hotel or airline,” said Adam Sterling, founder of The Sterling Traveler. “The value of the points can be worth much more when transferring than when using the points via the credit card provider’s portal. This does depend on the hotel or airline’s loyalty program, but this is a good rule of thumb.”Before booking, see what your points will be worth across multiple redemption options, and then choose based on the best value.54% Use Wi-Fi Over Roaming When Traveling InternationallyRoaming charges can be significant, so opting to use Wi-Fi instead can save travelers big time.“Depending on the country, travelers can save up to 80% on their data usage by using Wi-Fi,” Watson said.More From GOBankingRatesIn Less Than a Decade, You Won't Be Able To Afford a Home in These CitiesPlanning To Buy a Home?Take_Our_Poll3 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000Experts: 4 Safest Places To Keep Your InvestmentsThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: 85% of Millennials and Gen Z Use Travel Hacks To Save Big: These Are Their Top 4]"

(NYSE:MLM) as an investment opportunity by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Martin Marietta Materials Step By Step Through The CalculationWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$713.6mUS$888.8mUS$1.14bUS$1.17bUS$1.21bUS$1.24bUS$1.27bUS$1.30bUS$1.33bUS$1.36bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x6Analyst x6Analyst x3Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 2.64%Est @ 2.48%Est @ 2.37%Est @ 2.29%Est @ 2.24% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.6% US$663US$768US$918US$873US$838US$799US$761US$725US$689US$655(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$7.7bThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.6%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.4b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (7.6%– 2.1%) = US$25bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$25b÷ ( 1 + 7.6%)10= US$12bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$20b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$427, the company appears reasonably expensive at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Martin Marietta Materials as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.6%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.918. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Martin Marietta MaterialsStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is well covered by earnings.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Basic Materials market.Expensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.OpportunityAnnual revenue is forecast to grow faster than the American market.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Why is the intrinsic value lower than the current share price?

After the recent approval, an average 1,000 kWh residential customer bill will now be more than $8 less in July than in April. A 1,000 kWh home bill in Northwest Florida will cost less in July 2023 than last year. Depending on the rate class, business client bills will fall 2-5% in July from the present rates.In order to further reduce customer bills, FPL advises their customers to utilize the free tools provided by them. Customers can also activate the free FPL Energy Manager tool to monitor how their home is using energy and identify ways to save the same.Since the utilities do not make any profits on fuel prices, the downward revision in fuel prices is completely passed on to customers. The rate reduction is a welcome break for customers during the summer season when demand generally increases the monthly utility bills.Price PerformanceOver the past year, shares of NEE have gained 0.2% against the industry’s 7.4% decline.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank &amp; Key PicksNextEra currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

In the first quarter, the company introduced Total30 for astigmatism. Core gross margin expansion in the quarter is encouraging. However, escalated costs and a tough competitive space do not bode well for Alcon.In the past year, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has increased 19.7% compared with the 16.4% growth of the industry and a 19.1% rise of the S&amp;P 500 composite.The renowned pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturer has a market capitalization of $38.58 billion. Alcon projects a long-term estimated earnings growth rate of 14.9% compared with 15.2% of the industry. ALC’s earnings surpassed estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and matched the same in one, delivering an average surprise of 8.85%.Let’s delve deeper.UpsidesStrong Prospects for Vision Care: In the first quarter of 2023, Vision Care reported double-digit growth, backed by the performance of both contact lenses and ocular health. In contact lenses, Alcon gained from its expanded product portfolio, which now includes sphere, toric and multifocal options for value, mainstream and premium customers in daily and reusable categories. ALC witnessed share gains, driven by the new toric product launches, including Precision1, Total30 and Dailies Total1.Ocular health grew 15% compared to the prior-year quarter. Growth was primarily driven by the portfolio of eye drops, including acquired ophthalmic pharmaceutical products and price increases.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSurgical Business Drives Growth: Total Surgical (consisting of Implantables, Consumables and Equipment/Other) recorded sales growth of 8% at CER. In Implantables, the company continued with its ATIOL (Advanced Technology Intraocular Lens) market leadership for another quarter, with nearly half of the global market and two-thirds of the market in the United States despite increasing competitive activity.Story continuesIn Consumables, first-quarter sales were driven by favorable market conditions and pricing. In equipment, sales increased year over year on the continued strong demand for cataract and Vitreoretinal devices, particularly in international markets as the company upgraded and expanded its installed base. In Equipment, Alcon continued to expand its installed base with the CENTURION and LEGION devices.In terms of end markets in Surgical, global cataract procedures were up in the mid-single digits in the first quarter. This growth varied significantly by region.New Products to Add Value: In Presbyopia-correcting Intraocular Lens (PCIOLs), Alcon currently leads the market with more than 60% of the global share and more than 80% share in the United States. In Surgical, the company maintained a strong market share in PCIOLs, driven by the solid demand for products like PanOptix and Vivity despite new market entrants.The company currently sees meaningful share gains driven by its new toric product launches, including Precision1, Total30 and Dailies Total1. Initial customer response for the newest Total30 — the first water gradient, reusable lens for astigmatic wearers — has been exceptional.Total30 toric is currently available in the United States and parts of Europe, with possible availability across additional markets throughout 2023.In ocular health, ALC continues to integrate Aerie (acquired in November 2022) into the Alcon family. Its U.S. eye drop sales force has already added Rocklatan and Rhopressa to the promotional program, which contributed well to its Vision Care growth in the first quarter. ALC is simultaneously witnessing growth in its over-the-counter portfolio, mainly driven by favorable pricing and the sustained family of products.DownsidesQ1 Headwinds: Alcon’s growth in net sales across all segments continued to be marred by unfavorable currency impacts. During the quarter, the company’s operating margin was impacted by legal settlement costs, rising inflationary costs, acquisition and integration-related expenses and increased R&amp;D investments, post the acquisition of Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc.A Tough Competitive Landscape: With the ophthalmology industry being highly competitive, Alcon faces intense competition in the Surgical and Vision Care businesses. In the Surgical business, the mixture of competitors ranges from large manufacturers with multiple business lines to small manufacturers that offer a limited selection of specialized products. ALC also faces competition from the providers of alternative medical therapies such as pharmaceutical companies that have the potential to disrupt the core elements of its business.Estimate TrendAlcon has been witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for 2023. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 earnings per share has moved up from $2.63 to $2.64 in the past 30 days.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 revenues is pegged at $9.35 billion.

256,b8024382-eb15-38a6-9782-694d40873a4b,OXY,2023-06-15,Top 20 Most Profitable Energy Companies in the World,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-20-most-profitable-energy-135825840.html,1686751105,STORY,"['EOG', 'XOM', 'PSX', 'CVX', 'EC', 'MPC', 'COP', 'VLO', 'OXY', 'LUKOY', 'MRO']","[In this piece, we will take a look at the top twenty most profitable energy companies in the world. To skip our detailed analysis of the energy industry, head on over to Top 5 Most Profitable Energy Companies in the World. Energy is one of the most important - and one of the most controversial - industries in the modern world. The industry has contributed the most to human development by vast amounts of cheap energy to run airplanes, cars, factories, and homes. At the same time, the costs of generating this power have taken their toll on the environment.For instance, our study of the most polluting companies in the world shows that the top three firms that have emitted the most carbon dioxide between 1751 and 2018 are oil companies. These firms are Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), and Saudi Arabian Oil Company (TADAWUL:2222.SR) - which are also coincidentally among some of the biggest oil companies in the world.At the same time, the energy industry saw renewed investor attention and demand last year as the Russian invasion of Ukraine took place. This led to a disruption of the global oil industry and made the Western world in particular focus on non Russian oil sources. In terms of market value, the oil industry is one of the most valuable in the world. For instance, according to research from The Business Research Company, the crude oil market was worth $2.7 trillion in 2022 and will be worth $2.9 trillion in 2023. From this year until 2027 the second is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.6% to sit at $3.4 trillion by the end of the forecast period. The firm believes that this growth will primarily come from the developing world, particularly due to the fast growing economies of India and China. And, 'coincidentally'. once again, India and China are also two of the three countries with the most carbon dioxide emissions.Additionally, even though the crude oil industry is worth trillions of dollars, the renewable energy industry is quite lucrative as well. Precedence Research believes that the global renewable energy market was worth $1 trillion in 2022 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 8.6% until 2030 to be worth an estimated $1.9 trillion by then. Looking at the industry sector wise, the data shows that the solar energy segment will outpace the broader market's growth through a 13.5% CAGR. These figures are quite telling, as despite being a relatively young industry in terms of global interest, the renewable energy industry is still quite large and is catching up to at least crude oil in terms of market value. Within the industry, there are countless renewable energy stocks that have caught hedge fund attention. The selection depends on different factors, such as cheap, profitable, and overall best renewable energy stocks. Some top cheap renewable energy stocks include Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Enphase Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH) and NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE). If you're interested to learn about most profitable renewable energy stocks then the top names are Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), and Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL), and overall, here are the best renewable energy stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors.Story continuesGetting into the nitty gritty of the renewable energy industry, not only did the coronavirus pandemic nearly upend the global oil supply chain, but the post war shocks also impacted solar and wind power supply chains. According to McKinsey, materials such as polysilicon used to make solar panels and others such as aluminum, steel, and copper often have unpredictable supply chains. Most polysilicon supply originates from China, making it vulnerable to natural disasters and factory incidents - which led to the prices of this crucial raw material growing by a whopping 350% between 2020 and 2022. It adds that the wind turbine industry faced high costs after the Russian invasion of Ukraine since the wind turbine companies did not hedge their material prices. However, despite these constraints, McKinsey also estimates that between 2021 and 2030, planned power generation from solar and wind power projects is slated to grow from 125 gigawatts to 459 gigawatts. Out of these, the bulk will be generated from solar photovoltaic projects (or solar panels as they're commonly known) and most of the remainder will come from on shore wind projects.Digging deeper into the countless energy stocks trading on the market, notable cheap energy stocks are PDC Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:PDCE), Coterra Energy Inc. (NYSE:CTRA), and Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE:MRO). Interested in dividends? Well, we've identified 11 best energy dividend stocks as well, and some best energy stocks overall are Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE:VLO), EOG Resources, Inc. (NYSE:EOG), and ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP).However, as the market estimates show, traditional energy is here to stay, and taking a current look at the industry, here's what the management of Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) had to say during the firm's latest earnings call:First quarter oil equivalent production was down about 80,000 barrels per day from last year due to the expiration of a contract in Thailand and the sale of our Eagle Ford asset.This was partially offset by growth in the Permian. We expect 2023 production growth in the Permian to be back-end loaded as wells put on production, POPs increase across both operated and non-operated areas. We expect our royalty production to be roughly flat. As discussed during our Investor Day, we’re increasing activity in New Mexico. All four company-operated rigs added this year, one each quarter, will be in New Mexico, leading to more POPs expected in the second half of the year and into 2024. We also continue to be active in Texas. Last year, about half of our company-operated production was in the Delaware Basin in Texas with the remainder split about evenly between the Midland Basin and New Mexico. More than half of our non-operated production is with five major operators in large, contiguous positions in core areas with multiyear development programs, where we have visibility to capex and execution schedules and a royalty benefit compared to the operator.With these details in mind, let's take a look at some of the most profitable energy companies in the world. Some top names are  Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Saudi Arabian Oil Company (TADAWUL:2222.SR), and Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL).Top 20 Most Profitable Energy Companies in the WorldPhoto by Robin Sommer on UnsplashOur Methodology To compile our list of the most profitable oil companies, we sifted out energy companies with the highest net profits.Top 20 Most Profitable Energy Companies in the World20.

259,c5806cb1-b2b3-36f7-803f-cfe52bb12e6e,BSX,2023-06-15,Centene (CNC) Divests Apixio to Boost Its Core Business,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/centene-cnc-divests-apixio-boost-163700486.html,1686760620,STORY,"['CNC', 'BSX']","[Centene Corporation CNC recently closed the divestiture of the well-established artificial intelligence platform, Apixio, which CNC had acquired back in December 2020 in a bid to enhance its data analytics suite.Plans of selling off the healthcare analytics company to the investment firm, New Mountain Capital, were disclosed by Centene in May 2023. The deal was completed within slightly more than a month of the announcement. The divestiture is likely to be neutral to CNC's adjusted earnings per share of 2023.The latest move bears testament to Centene’s intensified focus on growing its Managed Care business, which positions the health insurer well for long-term growth and profitability. The business witnessed year-over-year membership growth of 8.5% as of Mar 31, 2023. Efforts to boost the unit bode well since it remains the most significant contributor to the top line of the health insurer.Also, pursuant to the Value Creation Plan, Centene makes sure that it identifies strategic alternatives for shedding non-core assets and subsequently optimizes its portfolio. CNC looks to divest its businesses to companies that would support its growth prospects. The same has been the case with Apixio as the divestiture is likely to boost its footprint as an artificial intelligence platform that facilitates value-based care programs across the United States.Sell-offs are often a means for Centene to sustain its share buyback record, thereby reinforcing investors’ confidence in the stock. The same is also pursued to bring down the mounting debt burden and associated interest expenses. As of Mar 31, 2023, long-term debt increased 1.6% from the 2022-end level. Interest expenses escalated 12.5% year over year in the first quarter of 2023. As debts are repaid using proceeds from sell-offs, cash reserves of the health insurer can be directed to pursue growth-related initiatives.Centene has been quite active on the divestiture front for quite some time. Last year, it sold PANTHERx, Magellan Rx as well as its Spanish and Central European businesses. In January 2023, the divestiture of Magellan Specialty Health was completed to Evolent Health.Story continuesShares of Centene have gained 9.7% in the past three months, compared with the industry’s 7.1% growth.

ILMN is well poised for growth in the coming quarters, owing to solid long-term growth potential in the oncology space. The company ended the first quarter of 2023 with better-than-expected results. GRAIL continues to have strong demand from consumers, physicians, health systems and payers. However, expensive valuation and stiff competition raise apprehension.In the past year, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has gained 6.8% compared with the 2.2% rise of the industry and the 16.5% rise of the S&amp;P 500.The renowned life sciences company, which provides tools and integrated systems for the analysis of genetic variation and function, has a market capitalization of $32.70 billion. Its first-quarter 2023 earnings per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 300%.The company’s long-term expected growth rate of 22.2% exceeds the industry’s long-term growth expectation of 18.8%.Let’s delve deeperFactors at playQ1 Upsides:  Illumina delivered better-than-expected earnings and revenues in first-quarter 2023. Consolidated revenues were up 1% from fourth-quarter 2022 levels, exceeding the high end of the company’s guidance. Building on strong global interests, the company executed robust shipments of NovaSeq X instruments, exceeding its first-quarter guidance of 40-50 shipments. Core Illumina sequencing consumables revenues were up 1% sequentially. Total sequencing activity on the company’s connected high- and mid-throughput instruments rose 6% sequentially and 3% year over year. Research &amp; Applied increased 7% sequentially. Clinical sequencing activity growth remained robust, up 7% from fourth-quarter 2022 levels and 15% year over year.GRAIL continues to have strong demand from consumers, physicians, health systems and payers. GRAIL generated revenues of $20 million in the first quarter, up 100% year over year. The upside was primarily driven by the accelerated adoption of Galleri.Solid Long-Term Growth Potential in Oncology Space: In the oncology business — another area of focus in its market expansion — the company developed multiple pharma partnerships to bring custom panel tests to market.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn the first quarter, more than 80% of NovaSeq 6000 shipments were made to clinical customers and approximately 25% of shipments to oncology testing. Oncology testing increased 21% sequentially, driven by growing clinical testing volumes and increased product development in areas like liquid biopsy and MRD. Revenues from Illumina’s market-leading TruSight Oncology assay, TSO 500, were up 26% year over year across more than 540 accounts, driven by the increased utilization and pull-through, particularly in Europe. The company also talked about its expansion of partnership with Myriad Genetics to broaden access to homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) testing.Upbeat Guidance: Illumina expects fiscal 2023 consolidated revenue growth in the range of 7-10% year over year (in line with the prior guidance). The adjusted earnings per share for 2023 is expected in the range of $1.25-$1.50 (unchanged).Core Illumina revenue growth is expected in the range of 6-9% year over year. GRAIL revenues are anticipated between $90 million and $110 million. For the second quarter of 2023, Illumina anticipates consolidated revenues between $1.15 and $1.17 billion and an adjusted earnings per share of 1 cent.DownsidesExpensive Valuation: Illumina’s P/S (F12M) ratio is expensive compared with the broader industry. The company is currently trading at a forward P/S (F12M) ratio of 6.3 for one year, whereas the current P/S (F12M) for the industry it belongs to is 1.9.Tough Competition: Illumina faces significant competition in the sequencing, SNP genotyping, gene expression and molecular diagnostics markets with several large players already enjoying significant market share, intellectual property portfolios and regulatory expertise. Such companies include the likes of Agilent Technologies, Pacific Biosciences of California, BGI, QIAGEN N.V., Roche Holding A.G. and Thermo Fisher Scientific, among others.Estimate TrendsIn the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Illumina’s 2023 earnings has been constant at $1.40.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 revenues is pegged at $4.94 billion, suggesting a 7.71% rise from the year-ago reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

262,960bd751-5d02-3a44-87bf-fda94b12df38,BSX,2023-06-15,Boston Scientific: Giving Voice to the LGBTQ+ Community,ACCESSWIRE,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/boston-scientific-giving-voice-lgbtq-123000057.html,1686745800,STORY,['BSX'],"[NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / June 14, 2023 / At Boston Scientific, we encourage everyone to bring their full selves to work, knowing they'll be accepted, heard and valued.For Pride Month, three employees from around the globe share what having a supportive and inclusive culture means to them, and how their involvement in the Promoting Respect, Inclusion, Diversity and Equality (PRIDE) employee resource group has helped them speak up and out on behalf of their LGBTQ+ colleagues.Finding courage, strength and acceptanceGrowing up in Piauí, Brazil, Cadu was bright, energetic and fascinated by culture, leading him to learn four languages and eventually build a successful career in international relations. But for years, Cadu kept part of himself hidden: ""I thought my parents would be angry when they found out I was gay,"" he says. ""In my mind, I tried to compensate by aiming to be the best in school, the best at everything.""Though this drive helped Cadu excel in many aspects of his life, finding the courage and acceptance to embrace his authentic self would prove to be a long road.When he was 16, Cadu moved to Brasília to study International Relations. For the first time, he met others who identified as gay, which played a major role in his eventual decision to tell his friends and family. ""Despite my initial fear of telling my parents, they immediately supported me. In fact, as soon as Brazil started allowing same-sex marriages, my mother became one of the first judges in my state to perform them.""As he began his career, Cadu chose to remain discreet about his sexuality. But soon after he joined the team at Boston Scientific as a Government Affairs specialist, a simple act by his manager changed his mind: ""We were entering a building that required us to show our credentials,"" he says. ""A guard at the door asked if we were ‘together, but in a good way.' My manager responded, ‘Is there a bad way for us to be together?' The guard immediately looked ashamed. In that moment, I knew I could count on my manager to be supportive.""Story continuesA few weeks later, Cadu decided to come out to his manager and colleagues. He also joined the PRIDE ERG. Today he lives with his fiancé Caio, whom he'll marry next year.""Boston Scientific is the first company where I feel truly comfortable being honest and open about my sexuality and celebrated for who I am,"" he says. ""Through PRIDE and other platforms, I'm able to speak up for others like me and help inspire them to embrace who they are, without fear.""""I can't imagine not having that time with my daughter""For Michael, a senior marketing specialist supporting the company's WATCHMANTM business and global communications lead for the PRIDE ERG, helping people live healthier, better lives has always been a passion - it's what drew him to Boston Scientific almost five years ago. For him, living life to the fullest meant starting a family with his husband, Matt.Michael began the adoption process a few months after joining the company, in 2020. ""I don't think many people realize how challenging and lengthy the process can be,"" he says, reflecting on the multi-year experience. ""But having support from the company made such a difference for us, from a benefits standpoint and also in the outpouring of encouragement we received from so many across the organization."" He recalls a baby shower his colleagues held for him, and what that meant to his growing family.Michael and Matt finalized the adoption of their daughter, Mila, in 2022. ""We were there for Mila's birth, and since it was an open adoption, we remain close with her birth mother,"" says Michael. He and Matt also had the chance to bond with Mila over the first few months of her life as part of the company's global parental leave benefits. ""I can't imagine not having that time with my daughter,"" Michael says. ""Without it, I think it would have been a very different experience.""A pioneer for changeFifteen years ago, Anna joined Boston Scientific in Sydney, Australia, not long after she married her wife, Yasmin. The wedding took place in Canada, because same-sex marriage was not yet legal in Australia.Anna came out to her manager during her first week at the company. Since then, she has not been afraid to speak up about who she is or when she's felt a need for change. For instance, when her wife was expecting their first child, there were only two types of leave available at Boston Scientific in Australia: maternity or paternity. ""I felt uncomfortable, because I wasn't taking either of these,"" she says. She approached Human Resources with this concern, which eventually led to changing the name of the policy to ""parental leave"" for all employees in Australia and New Zealand.Anna's unwavering commitment to championing diversity and inclusivity was likely what influenced company leaders to select her to launch the Asia-Pacific PRIDE ERG in 2020. ""It was hard, because it's a region where LGBTQ+ is not often spoken about,"" she says. ""But we got so much accomplished that first year, spreading education and awareness across our region where there was nothing before. It's just grown ever since.""Anna says that leading the Asia-Pacific chapter of PRIDE has been a highlight of her career. ""For me, it's so important for others to see people who are out and proud and able to thrive in a career at Boston Scientific,"" she says. ""I know I'm part of something bigger than myself, my team, even my country.""Boston Scientific is committed to fostering a diverse, equitable and inclusive workplace where all of our employees can bring their authentic selves to work and thrive personally and professionally.

263,2c8729c9-5a00-3417-b348-5fbd67aea338,ULTA,2023-06-15,Ulta Beauty Inc. (ULTA) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ulta-beauty-inc-ulta-attracting-130007635.html,1686747607,STORY,['ULTA'],"[Ulta Beauty (ULTA) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this beauty products retailer have returned -11.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +6.1% change. The Zacks Retail - Miscellaneous industry, to which Ulta belongs, has lost 4.9% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Ulta is expected to post earnings of $5.81 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +1.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -3.7%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $25.05 points to a change of +4.3% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.8%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $26.89 indicates a change of +7.4% from what Ulta is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.3%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Ulta is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Ulta, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $2.49 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +8.3%. For the current and next fiscal years, $11.08 billion and $11.67 billion estimates indicate +8.5% and +5.3% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryUlta reported revenues of $2.63 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +12.3%. EPS of $6.88 for the same period compares with $6.30 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.62 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.61%. The EPS surprise was +0.88%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Ulta is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Ulta. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

264,58a4f942-afdb-3090-b31e-36b943644746,ULTA,2023-06-15,3 Stocks to Snap Up on Their Recent Q1 Earnings Dip,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-stocks-snap-recent-q1-125229971.html,1686228749,STORY,"['ULTA', 'ONON', 'SBUX']","[Earnings can make or break a stock in the short term. Impressive earnings can vault shares to new highs. Disappointing earnings — or more often, guidance — can crush a stock price. Sometimes though, the pullbacks are opportunities. Put another way, these are stocks to buy after earnings dips sent them lower.At times, investors overreact to a company’s quarterly results. After all, there is a lot to sift through. There are the headline results, the press release and then the conference call. Afterwards, analysts provide their opinion on the quarter.It doesn’t help that there are now algos and high-frequency trading programs that can exacerbate some of these earnings moves.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsLook at Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW) for instance. This is a growth name we have liked in the past, but Wall Street did not initially like its results. Shares fell more than 16% in a single session, but are now up almost 30% and the stock is above where it was trading when it reported earnings.So what are some of the other stocks to buy after an earnings dip?Stocks With Q1 Earnings Pullback: Ulta Beauty (ULTA)ULTA stock Ulta Beauty store front sign located at Laurel Town Centre in Laurel, Maryland.Source: Ryan P Stephans / Shutterstock.comComing into earnings, Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) was down almost 13% from the all-time high. Keep in mind that the stock had rallied about 20% year to date to get to that high and more than 40% over the prior 12 months.After stumbling into earnings, Ulta fell another 13% in the first session after earnings and declined in four straight sessions. Ultimately, shares fell 17% after earnings and were down almost 28% from the high.All that comes after Ulta beat on earnings and grew sales 11% year-over-year to $2.6 billion, but missed expectations by $20 million.Management increased its full-year revenue guidance from a range of $10.95 billion to $11.05 billion (a midpoint of $11 billion) up to a new range of $11 billion to $11.1 billion (or a midpoint of $11.05 billion).Story continuesStill, that was short of consensus expectations at $11.09 billion, while management also gave a slight trim to its operating margin outlook (down from a range of 14.7% to 15% to a new range of 14.5% to 14.8%). Its earnings and comp-store sales outlook was unchanged.In all, it wasn’t a perfect quarter, but down almost 30% should have investors thinking about an opportunity for a great retailer.Stocks to Buy After Earnings Dip: On Holding (ONON)A photograph of a person running along the side of a road.Source: It for you / Shutterstock.comThe selloff in On Holding (NYSE:ONON) was interesting, given that the quarter was pretty solid. The Swiss shoemaker has stormed onto the scene for consumers and despite a pretty strong result, investors buried this name.When it reported earnings on May 16, ONON shares were down slightly from the 52-week high it hit on May 5. However, after the report shares fell in six of the next seven sessions and lost more than 23% of its value in that span.The company delivered record revenue in its most recent quarter as sales surged 78% year over year. Direct-to-consumer sales jumped 60% while margins widened. Management spoke of strong demand and even raised its full-year sales outlook up to 1.74 billion Swiss franc (ahead of consensus expectations of 1.73 billion Swiss franc).It was a classic case of the stock having a massive run — up about 95% in 2023 ahead of earnings — and not delivering enough to satisfy investors. If management is right though, this dip should be bought.Best Stocks With Recent Earnings Dip: Starbucks (SBUX)Learnin' From Luckin, Starbucks Stock Heats Up a StrategySource: monticello / Shutterstock.comStarbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) had put together a pretty tasty run with its stock price, as shares bottomed early in the bear market in May 2022. From there, it ran about more than 67% into its earnings report on May 2.The company delivered a top- and bottom-line beat with sales growing more than 14% year-over-year.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the DNA market, head over to 5 DNA Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up On. Genomics is the study of a complete set of DNA within an organism. The global genomics market was worth $28.39 billion in 2022, and it is expected to reach $98.7 billion by 2030, exhibiting a compound annual growth rate of 16.85% during the forecast period from 2022 to 2030. The growth in the global genomics market will primarily be driven by greater strides in gene targeted therapy and precision medicine. In addition to that, higher government subsidies and funding in the microbiology and genetics sector will also support growth. The cost of sequencing human genomes at present is below $1,000, which is remarkably less than a decade ago. This cost was estimated to be $1 million in 2007. This has now led to new market entrants and startups in the genomics space, propelling further innovation and growth. The amalgamation of genomics with artificial intelligence and machine learning is projected to fasten discoveries in the sector. The field of genomics is gaining traction all over the world. For example, India’s most famous billionaire and business magnate, Mukesh Ambani, is foraying into genetic mapping. Ambani plans to make genetic mapping more affordable and mainstream it throughout India’s rapidly growing consumer landscape. He took inspiration from American startups like 23andMe Holding Co. (NASDAQ:ME). Ambani’s goal is to make a genome sequencing test available for $145 in India. This test will be 86% less expensive as compared to the other alternatives locally available in India. The genome sequencing test indicates an individual’s inclination towards cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and neurodegenerative disorders, in addition to hereditary genetic ailments. Don't Miss: 12 Gene Editing Stocks With the Best Long-Term PotentialAnne Wojcicki, the co-founder and CEO of 23andMe Holding Co. (NASDAQ:ME), was in conversation with Fortune on April 25, 2023. She pointed out a recent study by The Lancet, a peer-reviewed medical journal, which indicated that negative reactions to medications can be cut by 30% if only medications were genetically tailored to the patients. Wojcicki also noted that millions of individuals have bought and performed DNA tests, which confirms robust consumer demand. 23andMe Holding Co. (NASDAQ:ME), along with Medscape, performed a survey which concluded that two-thirds of doctors are of the opinion that genetic testing could result in improved outcomes for patients, and more than 90% of the respondents agreed that genetic testing is a crucial component in understanding one's health status completely. Story continuesThe genomics market is rapidly growing and that leads to several attractive buying opportunities. Billionaires, never backing down from potentially profitable opportunities, are loading up on DNA stocks like Illumina, Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN), Invitae Corporation (NYSE:NVTA), and Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ:VRTX) to benefit from the boom in the genomics industry. Investors can also check out 11 Most Promising Gene Editing Stocks and 12 Biggest Genomics Companies in the World. Our Methodology Insider Monkey tracks billionaire-owned stocks and in this article, we selected the DNA stocks that attracted the highest number of billionaire investors during the first quarter of 2023.

But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like Coca-Cola Europacific Partners (AMS:CCEP). Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide Coca-Cola Europacific Partners with the means to add long-term value to shareholders. See our latest analysis for Coca-Cola Europacific Partners How Fast Is Coca-Cola Europacific Partners Growing?Generally, companies experiencing growth in earnings per share (EPS) should see similar trends in share price.

But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. As a matter of fact, their holding is valued at €35m. That shows significant buy-in, and may indicate conviction in the business strategy. While their ownership only accounts for 0.1%, this is still a considerable amount at stake to encourage the business to maintain a strategy that will deliver value to shareholders.Should You Add Coca-Cola Europacific Partners To Your Watchlist?As previously touched on, Coca-Cola Europacific Partners is a growing business, which is encouraging.

270,53523405-651c-3462-b024-18992a0a3047,KO,2023-06-15,The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is a favorite amongst institutional investors who own 62%,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coca-cola-company-nyse-ko-140013924.html,1686751213,STORY,['KO'],"[Key InsightsSignificantly high institutional ownership implies Coca-Cola's stock price is sensitive to their trading actionsThe top 25 shareholders own 47% of the company Recent sales by insiders Every investor in The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. With 62% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Coca-Cola. View our latest analysis for Coca-Cola ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Coca-Cola?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that Coca-Cola does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Coca-Cola's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Coca-Cola. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is Berkshire Hathaway Inc. with 9.2% of shares outstanding. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 8.6% of common stock, and BlackRock, Inc. holds about 7.2% of the company stock.Story continuesA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Coca-ColaThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of The Coca-Cola Company in their own names. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$1.7b of stock. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 28% stake in Coca-Cola. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Public Company OwnershipPublic companies currently own 9.2% of Coca-Cola stock. This may be a strategic interest and the two companies may have related business interests. It could be that they have de-merged. This holding is probably worth investigating further.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for Coca-Cola   you should know about.If you would prefer discover what analysts are predicting in terms of future growth, do not miss this free report on analyst forecasts.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

271,a3821267-a7c4-3c88-b494-83b9f66b75c7,KO,2023-06-15,CocaCola Company (The) (KO) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cocacola-company-ko-attracting-investor-130011487.html,1686747611,STORY,"['KO', '^GSPC']","[Coca-Cola (KO) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this world's largest beverage maker have returned -4.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +6.1% change. The Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry, to which Coke belongs, has lost 4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Coke is expected to post earnings of $0.71 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +1.4%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.61 points to a change of +5.2% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.80 indicates a change of +7.5% from what Coke is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.2%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Coke is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for KO _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Coke, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $11.69 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +3.3%. For the current and next fiscal years, $45.02 billion and $47.36 billion estimates indicate +4.7% and +5.2% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryCoke reported revenues of $10.98 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +4.7%. EPS of $0.68 for the same period compares with $0.64 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10.87 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1%. The EPS surprise was +4.62%.Over the last four quarters, Coke surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Coke is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Coke. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

274,f4158ccb-6b3a-35a2-8f64-d19a164b82af,INTU,2023-06-15,Here's How Much You'd Have If You Invested $1000 in Intuit a Decade Ago,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-much-youd-invested-1000-123004559.html,1686745804,STORY,['INTU'],"[For most investors, how much a stock's price changes over time is important. This factor can impact your investment portfolio as well as help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.The fear of missing out, or FOMO, also plays a factor in investing, especially with particular tech giants, as well as popular consumer-facing stocks.What if you'd invested in Intuit (INTU) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to INTU for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?Intuit's Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at Intuit's main business drivers.Headquartered in Mountain View, CA, Intuit Inc. is a business and financial software company that develops and sells financial, accounting and tax preparation software and related services for small businesses, consumers and accounting professionals globally. The company has offices in the United States, Canada, India, the United Kingdom, Singapore, Australia, and other locations.In fiscal 2022, Intuit generated total revenues of $12.73 billion. The company has four reportable segments: Small Business and Self-Employed Group, Consumer and Strategic Partner, ProConnect and Credit Karma.Small Business and Self-Employed Group (50.8% of fiscal 2022 revenues) segment serves small businesses and self-employed people around the world, and the accounting professionals who serve and advise them. Intuit’s offerings include QuickBooks financial and business-management online services and desktop software, payroll solutions, merchant payment-processing solutions, and financing for small businesses.Consumer (30.8% of fiscal 2022 revenues) segment offers DIY and assisted TurboTax income-tax preparation products and services. These solutions are sold in the United States and Canada. Intuit’s Mint and Turbo offerings serve consumers and help them understand and improve their financial lives by offering a view of their financial health.ProConnect (4.3% of fiscal 2022 revenues) serves professional accountants in the United States and Canada, who are essential to both small businesses’ success and tax preparation and filing. Intuit’s professional tax offerings include Lacerte, ProSeries, ProFile, and ProConnect Tax Online.Credit Karma (14.2% of fiscal 2022 revenues) segment offers personal finance services including credit cards, personal loans, home and auto loans and insurance.In the Small Business and Self-Employed segment, Intuit competes with companies such as The Sage Group. In payroll, it competes with Automatic Data Processing and Paychex, among others. In the area of merchant services, the company’s rivals are financial institutions like Wells Fargo, JP Morgan Chase and Bank of America. In the Consumer Segment, Intuit faces intense competition from tax preparation service provider H&amp;R Block.Story continuesBottom LinePutting together a successful investment portfolio takes a combination of research, patience, and a little bit of risk. For Intuit, if you bought shares a decade ago, you're likely feeling really good about your investment today.A $1000 investment made in June 2013 would be worth $7,720.37, or a gain of 672.04%, as of June 14, 2023, according to our calculations. This return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.Compare this to the S&amp;P 500's rally of 167% and gold's return of 34.30% over the same time frame.Going forward, analysts are expecting more upside for INTU.Intuit is benefiting from strong momentum in online ecosystem revenues and solid professional tax revenues. The TurboTax Live offering is also driving growth in the Consumer tax business. Solid momentum in the company’s lending product, QuickBooks Capital, remains a positive. Moreover, the company’s strategy of shifting its business to cloud-based subscription model will help generate stable revenues over the long run. We expect Intuit’s revenues to grow at a CAGR of 12.2% through fiscal 2023-2025. Nonetheless, macroeconomic and geopolitical headwinds might significantly hurt small businesses operations, thereby posing risks for Intuit’s top-line growth. Additionally, higher costs and expenses due to increased investments in marketing and engineering teams are likely to continue impacting bottom-line results in the near term.The stock has jumped 6.20% over the past four weeks. Additionally, no earnings estimate has gone lower in the past two months, compared to 10 higher, for fiscal 2023; the consensus estimate has moved up as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

277,1c4e1b80-e194-3bc2-a073-75f9a6abf46f,DVA,2023-06-15,4 Stocks to Hold in a Challenging Outpatient Home Health Industry,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-stocks-hold-challenging-outpatient-135300814.html,1686750780,STORY,"['ADUS', 'AMED', 'CHE', '^GSPC', 'DVA']","[The pandemic altered the nature and dynamics of the healthcare industry. The Zacks Medical - Outpatient and Home Healthcare industry, after struggling with lower outpatient clinic visits and inability to provide quality home healthcare, has gradually shifted to digital healthcare treatment. In the past few years, there has been a significant rise in demand for telemedicine-focused online medical and artificial intelligence (AI)-powered technology services. During the pandemic, many healthcare companies that were traditionally not technology-based transformed to survive in the market. Another factor prompting these MedTech players to embrace digital healthcare is the persistent staffing shortages. Per a February 2023 report by Research and Markets, WHO estimates that there will be a shortage of 10 million health workers in low- and lower-middle-income countries by 2030.On a positive note, rising dependence on telehealth and AI is likely to help the industry thrive in the near term. DaVita Inc. DVA, Chemed Corporation CHE, Amedisys, Inc. AMED and Addus HomeCare Corporation ADUS are likely to gain from the prospects.Industry DescriptionThe industry comprises companies that offer ambulatory care in an outpatient setting or at home. They use advanced medical technologies for diagnosis, treatment and rehabilitation services. The industry players include operators of HMO medical centers, kidney dialysis centers and other outpatient care centers. Though the period between 2020 and 2021 were challenging for payers and providers, innovation and growth continued unabated in services. This buoys optimism about prospects over the next few years, although persistent inflation in consumer prices could dent the outlook. The potential for scaling up innovation, prompted by pandemic’s pressure on the healthcare system, is an added plus. Also, acceleration of value-based care models and increasing application of technology across the healthcare industry are likely to continue in the long run.Story continuesMajor Trends Shaping the Future of the Outpatient and Home Healthcare IndustryCost Effectiveness: The primary advantage of outpatient clinics is cost-effectiveness. Outpatient medical care clinics do not retain patients for long hours (overnight) or charge exorbitantly. Modern-day outpatient clinics offer a broad spectrum of treatment and diagnostic options and even minor surgical procedures. Financial incentives like health plans and government program payment policies supporting services in lower-cost care settings have also been driving outpatient care.Participating in APM: It only seems reasonable for outpatient clinics to shift from fee-for-service (“FFS”) to alternative payment models (“APM”), with shared savings, risk, bundled payments or population-based payments. With value-based models of care steadily emerging as the future of healthcare, the shift is an ongoing parallel trend. FFS will be crucial to care organizations as a benchmark through which providers can assess APM.AI’s Dominant Role: AI has been a roaring success in healthcare. It is no wonder that it has taken the outpatient and home healthcare space by storm. Outpatient companies prefer bots and automated techniques for managing health information. With the help of AI, hospitals have been achieving better outcomes, with patients receiving more efficient and personalized care. The outpatient industry has been generating huge profits from Electronic Health Records and ePrescriptions.The most visible area where AI can make a significant difference is in mental healthcare at home. Addressing the most prevalent mental health conditions among home care patients —depression, anxiety and dementia — is essential to improve overall patient well-being. In recent years, complex machine learning algorithms have become capable of analyzing large datasets of patient information, including clinical and social diagnoses. These systems can alert caregivers regarding potential triggers or warning signs of mental health deterioration.Dependence on Telehealth: The pandemic caused a decline in outpatient clinic visits. Home healthcare providers struggled to offer quality care due to the risk of exposure to the virus. Though the impact of the pandemic has been far-reaching, it has accelerated healthcare innovation. Home healthcare can gain from the benefits provided by Medicare (and several other payers) that comprises a broad range of services that can be delivered in a patient’s home, including post-operative and chronic wound care. Home healthcare has seen a surge in the utilization of the telehealth platform in response to the pandemic. With the rise in elderly population and the increasing costs of in-person health care, the demand for home-based health care will emerge. People with chronic illnesses and disabilities also require home-based care.Remote Patient Monitoring: Remote patient monitoring (RPM) has been gradually gaining ground since the pandemic. Even with the return to normalcy, patients are preferring to be monitored from their homes via RPM devices, boosting home healthcare services as vulnerable patients can be safely and adequately cared from the home setting instead of hospital settings, where the risk of infections persists.The rising demand for RPM has considerably driven the demand for wearable technology to monitor patient’s health. Although wearables have been popular for several years, in recent times their integration with AI has increased their popularity immensely and have become a powerful home healthcare tool. AI technology-powered RPM enables healthcare firms to provide consistent patient care without occupying space in their hospitals and facilities, thus reducing overcrowding.Staffing Shortages: The U.S. healthcare industry has been experiencing a severe shortage of workers at every level, worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic. Among support personnel, there is a laxity of home health aides. The increasing international migration of health workers may aggravate health workforce shortfalls, especially in low- and lower-middle income countries. Another reason for the acute staffing shortage is high burnout due to physical, emotional and mental exhaustion. Thus, these overworked employees are leaving the profession at an accelerating rate.Healthcare staffing shortages lead to poor patient outcomes that can include hospital-acquired infections, patient falls and increased probabilities of death. With lesser number of staff available in hospital settings for patient care, there has been a gradual shift toward home healthcare for non-critical patients who can be monitored remotely.Zacks Industry RankThe Zacks Medical - Outpatient and Home Healthcare industry falls within the broader Zacks Medical sector.

Recognizing the importance of supporting employees who might be struggling with their mental well-being, throughout the first quarter of 2023 at all Whirlpool Corporation US manufacturing sites, Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) training was offered to emergency responders, salaried leaders, onsite clinics, health coaches and HR teams. This initiative has gained tremendous momentum, with over 20 classes conducted and more than 400 team members receiving MHFA training.This new company-wide training was started when two operations managers at Whirlpool Corp.'s Findlay, Ohio manufacturing facility embarked on a journey to learn new skills to help their team members. With assistance from their local NAMI (National Alliance on Mental Illness) chapter, Kegan Wise and Amy Doroff turned to Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) training. This comprehensive program equips individuals with the tools to support and de-escalate those facing mental health issues.Kegan and Amy enrolled in an 8-hour MHFA training course that gave them a better understanding of common mental health conditions, including depression, anxiety disorders, substance abuse, and psychosis. They learned practical strategies to approach individuals in crisis, offer initial help, and guide them to appropriate professional resources.I recently had a discussion with one of our team members about mental health. They had been struggling and needed someone to talk to,"" said Wise. ""The Mental Health First Aid training that Whirlpool provides taught me to Assess, Listen, Give support and information, Encourage professional help, and Encourage other support, (ALGEE).""Impressed by the impact of MHFA training on their own abilities, Wise and Doroff brought the initiative to the attention of Findlay plant lead Kristin Day and Senior EH&amp;S Manager Jeff Linstedt. Recognizing the value of prioritizing mental health in the workplace, the plant leadership embraced the initiative wholeheartedly. By the end of 2022, Findlay had successfully trained their emergency responders, salaried superintendents, and onsite clinics.Story continuesThe success in Findlay didn't stop there. Manufacturing leadership, led by Dale Laws and Monica Brown, recognized the potential of MHFA training and brought the initiative to the corporate benefits team. This team, led by Corp. Benefits Senior Manager, Liz Fahner partnered with leaders with Monica and Dale and adopted MHFA training under the umbrella of Whirlpool Corp.'s Be*well program and coordinated MHFA training at all other sites across the United States.""Mental health is an important focus for how we can support employees,"" said Tonya Finley-Gaskill. ""Our aim is to provide comprehensive tools and support for our employees, with a particular emphasis on mental health, and the inclusion of unique perspectives of our employee resource groups (ERGs) helps raise awareness, reduce the stigma surrounding mental health, and identify signs for timely employee support.""Whirlpool Corp. sites are experiencing the impact of the training. Leaders like Jeff Jones in Cleveland, TN have shared inspiring stories of how they applied what they learned during the training to support an employee and prevent a potentially more severe outcome. These anecdotes highlight the power of MHFA training in creating a supportive and empathetic work environment.""Helping someone through a mental health crisis requires patience, empathy, and an open mind,"" said Jones. ""It's about reminding them that they are not alone, that it's okay to ask for help, and that they are heard and valued.""The expansion of MHFA training to all the company's US sites demonstrates the commitment Whirlpool Corp. has made to prioritizing employee well-being. Whirlpool's Be*well initiatives take a proactive approach to addressing mental health concerns, and in turn, contribute to a healthier workforce.View original content hereWhirlpool Corporation, Wednesday, June 14, 2023, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Whirlpool Corporation on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Whirlpool CorporationWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/whirlpool-corporationEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Whirlpool CorporationView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/761278/Whirlpool-Corporation-Empowering-Support-and-De-Escalation-Through-Mental-Health-First-Aid-Training]"

(SoCalGas) is announcing the results of a machine learning project that helped an industrial customer achieve $150,000 in annual, recurring energy savings and nearly 1,000 metric tons of annual CO2 reductions, all through an initial setup cost of just $100,000. Thanks to this technology, The Gill Corporation has cut its yearly utility bill by 6 percent, while also reducing CO2 – equivalent to avoiding 112,524 gallons of gasoline consumed annually.SoCalGas Logo (PRNewsfoto/San Diego Gas &amp; Electric,Southern California Gas Company)The project, a collaboration with the METRON company, set out to find ways to use machine learning and digitization to help optimize industrial processes for cost and energy savings, along with reducing their emissions. In 2020, SoCalGas and METRON selected The Gill Corporation, a leading manufacturer of high-performance composite materials and products for the aerospace, transportation, and other industries, for deployment of this technology.""Energy efficiency continues to be one of the most cost-effective ways we can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote energy reliability now as we continue to develop additional tools to achieve our company's and California's efforts to achieve net zero,"" said Neil Navin, SoCalGas Chief Clean Fuels Officer.

We are looking forward to rolling out the METRON platform at a wider scale in California to support other SoCalGas industrial customers with energy consumption and carbon reduction through energy efficiency,"" said Vincent Sciandra, CEO of METRON.Story continuesThe technology behind METRON used machine learning to determine where in the industrial processes resources were needed or where data was lacking and additional sensors would be required to fill information gaps. The project allowed a fully centralized digitization of The Gill Corporation's operations and identified significant ways to reduce both energy use and carbon emissions.The METRON project is among dozens of research, development and demonstration projects that SoCalGas is funding to help achieve its aim to have net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2045. In 2022 alone, SoCalGas' Research Development &amp; Demonstration (RD&amp;D) program invested more than $13 million in hundreds of energy technology and clean fuels projects—from technology that converts carbon dioxide from industrial sources into consumer products to fuel-flexible power generators or innovative hydrogen fuel cell yard trucks for demanding port operations. The program, along with its partners, will be supporting approximately $400 million in decarbonization research through 2025.More information about SoCalGas' RD&amp;D projects can be found in SoCalGas' recently released RD&amp;D Annual Report.About SoCalGas Headquartered in Los Angeles, SoCalGas® is the largest gas distribution utility in the United States.

Performance of the Personal Lines segment is likely to be driven by the planned expansion of high-net-worth business produced by the agencies, higher renewal written premiums and the extended use of pricing precision tools.The Commercial Lines business is expected to gain from solid premiums earned, reflecting renewal written premium growth that continued to include higher average pricing and improved level of insured exposures.Investment income should continue to rise because of the surge in equity portfolio dividends and interest income. Moreover, cash flow from operating activities consistently helps the company boost investment income.The property and casualty insurer is focused on earning new business through appointment of new agencies from a combination of quality service and expansion of insurance products for clients of those agencies. Agencies, appointed since the beginning of 2022, contributed 5% of total new business written premiums. So far in 2023, the insurer has appointed 66 agencies, including 23 that market only personal lines products.Cincinnati Financial has a solid balance sheet with high liquidity and low leverage. Cash flow, a contributor to investment income and interest income, remains strong.Cincinnati Financial has returned capital to shareholders through regular cash dividends as well as special dividends.

So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in General Electric. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see General Electric's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. General Electric is not owned by hedge funds. Capital Research and Management Company is currently the company's largest shareholder with 15% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 8.1% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 6.2% by the third-largest shareholder.Story continuesOn further inspection, we found that more than half the company's shares are owned by the top 9 shareholders, suggesting that the interests of the larger shareholders are balanced out to an extent by the smaller ones.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of General ElectricThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of General Electric Company in their own names. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$288m of stock. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 23% stake in General Electric. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Case in point: We've spotted   2 warning signs for General Electric  you should be aware of, and 1 of them is a bit concerning.Ultimately the future is most important.

To skip our detailed analysis of the energy industry, head on over to Top 5 Most Profitable Energy Companies in the World. Energy is one of the most important - and one of the most controversial - industries in the modern world. The industry has contributed the most to human development by vast amounts of cheap energy to run airplanes, cars, factories, and homes. At the same time, the costs of generating this power have taken their toll on the environment.For instance, our study of the most polluting companies in the world shows that the top three firms that have emitted the most carbon dioxide between 1751 and 2018 are oil companies. These firms are Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), and Saudi Arabian Oil Company (TADAWUL:2222.SR) - which are also coincidentally among some of the biggest oil companies in the world.At the same time, the energy industry saw renewed investor attention and demand last year as the Russian invasion of Ukraine took place. This led to a disruption of the global oil industry and made the Western world in particular focus on non Russian oil sources. In terms of market value, the oil industry is one of the most valuable in the world. For instance, according to research from The Business Research Company, the crude oil market was worth $2.7 trillion in 2022 and will be worth $2.9 trillion in 2023. From this year until 2027 the second is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.6% to sit at $3.4 trillion by the end of the forecast period. The firm believes that this growth will primarily come from the developing world, particularly due to the fast growing economies of India and China. And, 'coincidentally'. once again, India and China are also two of the three countries with the most carbon dioxide emissions.Additionally, even though the crude oil industry is worth trillions of dollars, the renewable energy industry is quite lucrative as well. Precedence Research believes that the global renewable energy market was worth $1 trillion in 2022 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 8.6% until 2030 to be worth an estimated $1.9 trillion by then. Looking at the industry sector wise, the data shows that the solar energy segment will outpace the broader market's growth through a 13.5% CAGR. These figures are quite telling, as despite being a relatively young industry in terms of global interest, the renewable energy industry is still quite large and is catching up to at least crude oil in terms of market value. Within the industry, there are countless renewable energy stocks that have caught hedge fund attention. The selection depends on different factors, such as cheap, profitable, and overall best renewable energy stocks. Some top cheap renewable energy stocks include Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Enphase Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH) and NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE). If you're interested to learn about most profitable renewable energy stocks then the top names are Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), and Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL), and overall, here are the best renewable energy stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors.Story continuesGetting into the nitty gritty of the renewable energy industry, not only did the coronavirus pandemic nearly upend the global oil supply chain, but the post war shocks also impacted solar and wind power supply chains. According to McKinsey, materials such as polysilicon used to make solar panels and others such as aluminum, steel, and copper often have unpredictable supply chains. Most polysilicon supply originates from China, making it vulnerable to natural disasters and factory incidents - which led to the prices of this crucial raw material growing by a whopping 350% between 2020 and 2022. It adds that the wind turbine industry faced high costs after the Russian invasion of Ukraine since the wind turbine companies did not hedge their material prices. However, despite these constraints, McKinsey also estimates that between 2021 and 2030, planned power generation from solar and wind power projects is slated to grow from 125 gigawatts to 459 gigawatts. Out of these, the bulk will be generated from solar photovoltaic projects (or solar panels as they're commonly known) and most of the remainder will come from on shore wind projects.Digging deeper into the countless energy stocks trading on the market, notable cheap energy stocks are PDC Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:PDCE), Coterra Energy Inc. (NYSE:CTRA), and Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE:MRO). Interested in dividends? Well, we've identified 11 best energy dividend stocks as well, and some best energy stocks overall are Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE:VLO), EOG Resources, Inc. (NYSE:EOG), and ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP).However, as the market estimates show, traditional energy is here to stay, and taking a current look at the industry, here's what the management of Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) had to say during the firm's latest earnings call:First quarter oil equivalent production was down about 80,000 barrels per day from last year due to the expiration of a contract in Thailand and the sale of our Eagle Ford asset.This was partially offset by growth in the Permian. We expect 2023 production growth in the Permian to be back-end loaded as wells put on production, POPs increase across both operated and non-operated areas. We expect our royalty production to be roughly flat. As discussed during our Investor Day, we’re increasing activity in New Mexico. All four company-operated rigs added this year, one each quarter, will be in New Mexico, leading to more POPs expected in the second half of the year and into 2024. We also continue to be active in Texas. Last year, about half of our company-operated production was in the Delaware Basin in Texas with the remainder split about evenly between the Midland Basin and New Mexico. More than half of our non-operated production is with five major operators in large, contiguous positions in core areas with multiyear development programs, where we have visibility to capex and execution schedules and a royalty benefit compared to the operator.With these details in mind, let's take a look at some of the most profitable energy companies in the world. Some top names are  Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Saudi Arabian Oil Company (TADAWUL:2222.SR), and Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL).Top 20 Most Profitable Energy Companies in the WorldPhoto by Robin Sommer on UnsplashOur Methodology To compile our list of the most profitable oil companies, we sifted out energy companies with the highest net profits.Top 20 Most Profitable Energy Companies in the World20.

Those proposals include at least a dozen measures that would bolster residential real estate and consumer spending.Stimulus programs in China, unlike those in the United States, don’t typically involve sending payments to individual households. Instead, the programs are geared toward accelerating commercial activity by lowering interest rates and easing loan costs, which frees up more money for banks to lend.On Tuesday, the People’s Bank of China “unexpectedly” cut a series of short-term interest rates, Bloomberg reported. That move is expected to pave the way for a key longer-term policy rate reduction.So what does all this mean for Americans?As CNBC reported this week on its Investing Club site, China has been taking “consistent and steady action” to accelerate its economic rebound — something that could be a “positive sign” for consumer spending, even amid ongoing economic uncertainty.“Based on recent retail sales data coming out of China, there’s clearly pent-up consumer demand, signaling to investors … that there’s more upside ahead for companies doing business there,” CNBC noted.Those companies include Estee Lauder, Starbucks and Wynn Resorts.Last month Wynn posted strong first-quarter results thanks to a recovery in the Asian gambling hub of Macao — a signal that “robust consumer spending on travel and experiences” will continue in coming quarters, according to CNBC. Because of a recent slump in shares, Wynn might provide a buying opportunity for investors.Story continuesSimilarly, Starbucks in May delivered good numbers for its fiscal second quarter even amid a slowdown in its shares, which provides another buying opportunity.Take Our Poll: Are You Planning To Buy or Sell a House This Year?Estee Lauder’s latest results, for its fiscal third quarter, were more mixed, leading the beauty company to issue “terrible guidance” that led to a major sell-off in shares.

Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Procter &amp; Gamble (PG).P&amp;G currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.59, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 16 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.59 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 16 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 10 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 62.5% and 12.5% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for PGBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for PGCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for P&amp;G here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying P&amp;G, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.Is PG Worth Investing In?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for P&amp;G, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0% over the past month to $5.86.Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for P&amp;G. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for P&amp;G may serve as a useful guide for investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

299,39285a7f-a6ef-3814-92ae-fa73bed3744a,SLG,2023-06-15,Is Work From Home The Death Of Office REITs? Don't Tell That To Surging REIT Prices,Benzinga,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/home-death-office-reits-dont-161757893.html,1686759477.0,STORY,['SLG'],"[It was early March 2020 and a new virus called COVID-19 was about to take the U.S. by storm, changing almost everything about the way people worked, played and related to others.In New York and other large cities across the U.S., mandated lockdowns forced companies to permit employees to work from home rather than risk spreading COVID from person to person. Frightened workers were happy to comply and keep their jobs.The effect on stocks, and particularly real estate investment trusts (REITs) that invest in office buildings, was brutal. Leading New York City landlord SL Green Realty Corp. (NYSE: SLG) fell from $75 to $30 in a month. Another industry stalwart, Boston Properties Inc. (NYSE: BXP) fell from $125 to $66.After finally bottoming in October, office REITs began an extended rise that brought them close to their prepandemic prices by March 2022. But in April, rising inflation led to 10 consecutive interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve, once again crushing the share prices of office REITs. Interest rate hikes make it more difficult for REITs to borrow the money needed to finance new buildings and more expensive to pay off any adjustable loans that were already in effect.Don't miss:Outperforming Buffett: How These Accredited Investors Achieved Superior ReturnsElon Musk Is Bullish On Austin. Here's How To Invest In The City's Growth Before He Floods It With New Tech WorkersCompanies also discovered that it was less expensive to have employees working from home. They could downsize their office space and pay less for rent and utilities. Workers also loved being at home, as they could save money on commuting costs, clothing and not eating in expensive city restaurants. Parents with small children were also able to cut down on day care costs. Even as the presence of COVID-19 began to abate, nobody wanted to return to the office.Wall Street analysts began to predict the demise of office buildings and downgraded office REITs while slashing price targets as well. Analysts from Scotiabank, BMO Capital Markets, Citigroup and Barclays all downgraded SL Green between December 2022 and March 2023. Others maintained their ratings but slashed price targets. In March, Citigroup maintained a Sell rating on SL Green and slashed its price target from $35 to $17.Story continuesLast winter, analyst downgrades and price cuts told a similar story for Boston Properties and several other office REITs. Share prices of these REITs were down 40% and 50% from their peaks.In February 2022, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Vice Chairman Charlie Munger said that nobody is going back to the office five days a week. Munger sent office REITs reeling 14 months later when he stated on CNBC, “A lot of real estate isn’t so good anymore. We have a lot of troubled office buildings.”But this spring, things are changing. Large companies such as Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc., Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Google, Salesforce Inc., The Walt Disney Co., J.P. Morgan and others have mandated that employees return to the office. Companies are discovering that despite the savings, employees are less productive when working from home. Companies also feel that communication and bonding between employees have been suffering.Some companies have gone as far as to track office attendance or threaten to terminate workers who don’t comply with office mandates. IBM CEO Arvind Krishna told workers that he won’t mandate them to return to the office, but employees who work from home may have difficulty getting promotions.In May 2023, Tesla Inc. CEO Elon Musk criticized employees who work from home, saying it was “morally wrong” to do so while other employees are forced to work from offices and job sites.Kastle Systems, a Falls Church, Virginia-based company that tracks workplace occupancy, found its 10-city average occupancy rate, which was 47.6% at the end of May, has risen to 50.3%. New York City has seen the biggest change, rising 4.2% between May 31 and June 7. If this still sounds low, keep in mind that in March 2020, occupancy percentages were in the single digits. Reports of subway ridership in New York City are also increasing from a year ago.So it should come as no surprise that office REITs are gaining steam and have been one of the leading REIT subsectors since the middle of May. The chart below shows the surging total returns of several office REITs since May 13.OFFICE REITSYMBOL30-DAY TOTAL RETURNPeakstone Realty TrustNYSE: PKST43.02%Office Properties Income TrustNASDAQ: OPI30.79%City Office REIT Inc.NYSE: CIO25.87%Brandywine Realty TrustNYSE: BDN23.74%SL Green Realty Corp.NYSE: SLG21.76%Vornado Realty TrustNYSE: VNO20.14%Douglas Emmett Inc.NYSE: DEI17.47%Orion Office REIT Inc.NYSE: ONL17.03%Many of these REITs were oversold in May, yet this rally seems like more than just a “dead cat bounce” off the bottom. Rumors of the death of office buildings were perhaps a bit too hasty. The pajama-clad commute from the bedroom to the dining room table may be on the wane, despite a great deal of social media opposition coming from younger workers.In April, SL Green received an analyst upgrade from BMO Capital, from Market Perform to Outperform, with a $30 price target. Things are looking up in the office REIT subsector.Should investors rush to buy office REITs now? Given that many are still down well over 50% from their highs, it might seem logical. Many of them now have high dividend yields. The dividend yields of the REITs on the chart above range from 6% to 17%. Keep in mind that many of these REITs are still far below their 200-day moving averages and seem a bit overbought short-term, so waiting for a pullback might be prudent. But office REITs are clearly surging and could continue to do so over the long term as the workforce gets back to prepandemic normalcy.Over the past five years, private market real estate investments have outperformed the publicly traded REIT market by about 50%.

Each parcel is now wholly owned and controlled by Macerich.The five properties where these Sears boxes are located, all high-performing Regional Town Centers in the Macerich portfolio, include Danbury Fair (CT), Los Cerritos Center (CA), Washington Square (OR), Chandler Fashion Center (AZ) and Freehold Raceway Mall (NJ). Total GLA of the five former Sears boxes is approximately 819k sf.“Macerich is pleased to gain full ownership and control of these former Sears boxes at five of our top Regional Town Centers – all located in terrific suburban U.S. markets,” said Dave Short, Executive Vice President, Asset Management, Macerich. “Building on the prior leasing and activation of several of these boxes, this transaction allows us to continue to pursue redevelopment of these properties in any number of ways – from adding mixed-use and greater density, which is a hallmark of Macerich’s Regional Town Center strategy, to bringing in highly productive retail performers.”Leasing and redevelopment activity for each of the former Sears boxes at the five properties is as follows:Danbury Fair – The former Sears space is already leased to in-demand retailers Target and Primark. Primark is open and operating, while Target is under construction and set to open in spring 2024. The combined sales volume of the two uses will represent a dramatic increase over the prior Sears use.Los Cerritos Center and Washington Square – Both of these properties are either in the process or are fully entitled to undergo redevelopments that will create value by adding density and diverse uses. To maximize these opportunities, Macerich will draw on its successful, copious experience in replacing former department store anchor pads with new uses, including fitness, residential, hotel, office, medical uses and more, at its properties across the country.Chandler Fashion Center and Freehold Raceway Mall – Similar to Danbury Fair, for these two properties, Macerich will replace the prior use with multiple, high-traffic-generating retail/entertainment/restaurant uses that are a great fit for each of their communities. In fact, Primark already is open and performing well in part of the former Sears space at Freehold Raceway Mall.Story continuesAbout MacerichMacerich is a fully integrated, self-managed and self-administered real estate investment trust (REIT).

Its long-term growth potential is intriguing at the moment.Based in Columbus, GA, Aflac is one of the leading health and life insurance providers in the United States. It also has operations in Japan. It has a market cap of $41.5 billion. In the past year, the company’s shares have outperformed the 14.6% growth in the S&amp;P 500 Index and the 6.2% rise of the finance sector.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCan it Retain Momentum?The answer is yes and before we get into the details, let us show you where its estimates for the full-year 2023 stand.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Aflac’s 2023 earnings is pegged at $5.81 per share, indicating a 9% increase from the 2022 level. The company beat earnings estimates in all the last four quarters, with an average of 8.2%.The consensus estimate for 2023 revenues stands at $18.3 billion, indicating a 6.2% decline from the 2022 level. Rising profits despite lower revenues indicate growing margins and efficiency in operations.Now let’s delve into what might drive this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.The company’s cost-saving initiatives are helping it to reduce expenses. Our estimate for total benefits and expenses in 2023 indicates a 7% year-over-year decrease. This is likely to boost its margins. As the high inflation environment makes out-of-pocket expenses more costly, people are depending more on products provided by companies like Aflac.The growing demand for supplemental health and life insurance products is beneficial for the company. Its supplemental health products can reduce its bottom-line sensitivity to interest rate changes. This will provide the company with stability despite the ongoing economic volatility.AFL is expected to leverage its product portfolio and multichannel distribution to capture more market share. The improving sales figures are major positives. In the first quarter, Aflac’s U.S. sales of $315 million grew 5.3% year over year. Also, new annualized premium sales in Japan of $100 million improved 10.8% year over year in the March quarter.Story continuesAflac’s investments in technology and innovations are likely to boost its digital footprint, which will present a massive growth opportunity, drive efficiency and position it for long-term growth. Its confidence in the stability of the base business enables it to take shareholder-value boosting efforts. In the first quarter alone, AFL bought back 10.3 million shares worth $700 million. It had 106.3 million shares left for buyback at the first-quarter end.RisksDespite the upside potential, there are a few factors that investors should keep an eye on. Its free cash flow declined 14.2% in the trailing 12-month period. If this continues, AFL’s future operations will be affected. Also, its trailing 12-month price-to-book ratio of 2.12X is higher than the industry average of 1.7X, marking it overvalued. Nevertheless, we believe that a systematic and strategic plan of action will drive the company’s long-term growth.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader finance space are AMERISAFE, Inc.

This move can be attributable to notable volume with a higher number of shares being traded than in a typical session. This compares to the stock's 4.9% gain over the past four weeks.Shares of Universal Health primarily jumped after Tim Noel, healthcare juggernaut UnitedHealth Group’s chief executive officer for Medicare and Retirement, shared promising views for hospital stocks at the Goldman Sachs Global Healthcare Conference. He noted that seniors are now undergoing elective surgeries that were delayed due to pandemic-related constraints. The pent-up demand for such surgeries is expected to boost UHS’ patient admissions and patient days, further increasing its revenues.This hospital and health facility operator is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.48 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +12.7%. Revenues are expected to be $3.5 billion, up 5.4% from the year-ago quarter.Earnings and revenue growth expectations certainly give a good sense of the potential strength in a stock, but empirical research shows that trends in earnings estimate revisions are strongly correlated with near-term stock price movements.For Universal Health Services, the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised marginally higher over the last 30 days to the current level. And a positive trend in earnings estimate revision usually translates into price appreciation. So, make sure to keep an eye on UHS going forward to see if this recent jump can turn into more strength down the road.The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. However, after briefly looking over the numbers, we don't think Universal Health Services (NYSE:UHS) has the makings of a multi-bagger going forward, but let's have a look at why that may be.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Universal Health Services:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.095 = US$1.1b ÷ (US$14b - US$1.9b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).So, Universal Health Services has an ROCE of 9.5%.  Even though it's in line with the industry average of 9.5%, it's still a low return by itself. See our latest analysis for Universal Health Services roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Universal Health Services compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Universal Health Services here  for free.How Are Returns Trending?On the surface, the trend of ROCE at Universal Health Services doesn't inspire confidence. Over the last five years, returns on capital have decreased to 9.5% from 13% five years ago. On the other hand, the company has been employing more capital without a corresponding improvement in sales in the last year, which could suggest these investments are longer term plays. It may take some time before the company starts to see any change in earnings from these investments.Story continuesWhat We Can Learn From Universal Health Services' ROCEIn summary, Universal Health Services is reinvesting funds back into the business for growth but unfortunately it looks like sales haven't increased much just yet. And with the stock having returned a mere 25% in the last five years to shareholders, you could argue that they're aware of these lackluster trends. Therefore, if you're looking for a multi-bagger, we'd propose looking at other options.On a final note, we found  3 warning signs for Universal Health Services (1 is a bit concerning)  you should be aware of.While Universal Health Services isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

Per the ASCE report, nearly 6 billion gallons of treated water is lost each day in the United States due to water main breaks every two minutes. This wastage of potable water is no doubt increasing the cost of operation for water utilities.With a major portion of 2.2 million miles of underground pipes nearing the end of effective service life, the Environmental Protection Agency has identified that the United States needs over $744 billion for water, wastewater, and stormwater system enhancement and restoration over the next 20 years.Undoubtedly, this massive expenditure will require proper planning and systematic expenditure. The most important question is whether the utilities and federal government are spending enough to meet the requirements.  Federal government expenditure on water infrastructure has decreased significantly from 1977 levels. However, the Inflation Reduction Act will change this scenario to some extent. The bill includes $4 billion in drought resilience funding and $550 million for domestic water programs.One of the major drawbacks of the United States water industry is that it has too many small operators providing services. Per the ASCE, more than 50,000 community water systems and 16,000 community wastewater systems currently provide water solutions to customers. The lack of financial ability of the small operators is creating a bottleneck in timely repairs and upgrades.Large water utilities are acquiring the smaller ones to provide better services and upgrade essential infrastructure. However, the pace of mergers and acquisitions in the water industry is rather slow.Despite the drawback, water utilities like American Water Works AWK, Essential Utilities WTRG, California Water Service Group CWT and Middlesex Water MSEX, among others, have well-chalked-out capital investment plans to strengthen their infrastructure.American Water Works currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and plans to invest in the range of $14-$15 billion in the 2023-2027 period and $30-$34 billion from 2023-2032. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Essential Utilities plans to invest $1.1 billion in 2023 and $3.3 billion through 2025 to improve water and natural gas systems and better serve customers using improved information technology. California Water Service has more than $725 million in capital expenditure plans through 2024. Middlesex Water plans to invest $266 million from 2023-2025 to strengthen its water and wastewater infrastructure and provide safe, reliable and efficient services.Story continuesPrice performance (Three Months)Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhen compared to the total requirement of the water and wastewater industry, the above investments from the investor-owned utilities might look negligible. Clearly, the federal government and water utilities have taken notice of the deteriorating water industry infrastructure and are taking essential measures.

(FCX) is a Trending Stock,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-freeport-mcmoran-130007882.html,1686747607,STORY,['FCX'],"[Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this mining company have returned +13% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +6.1% change. The Zacks Mining - Non Ferrous industry, to which Freeport-McMoRan belongs, has gained 9.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Freeport-McMoRan is expected to post earnings of $0.42 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -27.6%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -16.5%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $1.92 points to a change of -21.3% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -5.4%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.29 indicates a change of +19.7% from what Freeport-McMoRan is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.4%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Freeport-McMoRan is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for FCX _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Freeport-McMoRan, the consensus sales estimate of $6 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +10.7%. The $23.98 billion and $24.19 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +5.3% and +0.9%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryFreeport-McMoRan reported revenues of $5.39 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -18.4%. EPS of $0.52 for the same period compares with $1.07 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.45 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -1.07%. The EPS surprise was +10.64%.Over the last four quarters, Freeport-McMoRan surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Freeport-McMoRan is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Freeport-McMoRan. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Breaking the numbers down even further, four are up more than 500%, another nine are up between 200% and 500%, and the remaining 38 are up between 100% and 200%.It should come as no surprise that the four that are up more than 500% over the past year are biotechnology companies. Five of the nine, between 200% and 500%, are biotech stocks. So, it stands to reason that one of my trio should be a biotech stock. While I won’t select a second biotech, the performance makes sense. Biotechs tend to skyrocket or fizzle out. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsOf the remaining 38, there is a real mix of companies. My three stocks with high potential are from three different sectors and industries. Who knows if any of them will double over the next 12 months? Wish me luck. Morphic Holding (MORF)A close-up concept image of a tiny glass vial with a strand of DNA in it.Source: ShutterstockI don’t cover biotech stocks too often, so I can confidently say I’ve never heard of this company. However, Morphic Holding (NASDAQ:MORF)  has an exciting business. “Morphic Therapeutic is leading the development of a new generation of oral integrin drugs, informed by decades of world-leading expertise and a unique integrin discovery platform,” states its investor relations website. I must have missed the science class in high school covering integrin proteins. I haven’t a clue what they do. As best I can tell, they are a type of protein that helps cells attach to other cells. They are an important part of cell growth and movement and are particularly important for wound healing. In late April, Morphic announced positive results from its phase 2a trial with ulcerative colitis (UC) patients for its MORF-057 drug in development to treat UC. Its twice-daily oral pill could provide competition for Takeda Pharmaceutical’s (NYSE:TAK) Entyvio, which is estimated to be a $5 billion-a-year drug.Story continuesUp 151% over the past year, I’m betting it doubles again over the next year. Miniso Group Holding (MNSO)red Miniso (MNSO) sign glowing at nightSource: shutterstock.com/Hendrick WuMiniso Group Holding’s (NYSE:MNSO) stock is on quite a run this year. It’s up 62% year-to-date and 153% over the past year. That said, many investors can’t overlook that it remains below its October 2020 IPO price of $20 more than 32 months later. I can remember when the local Miniso closed in September 2021 for arrears in rent. This was not a good look for the company less than a year after it went public. However, it seems to have bounced back.   On May 19, the retailer known for affordable toys, collectibles, electronics, and many other products, opened a flagship location at 5 Times Square in New York City. Selling over 2,500 products in the flagship, it generated nearly $80,000 in sales on its opening day. It now has over 70 stores in the U.S., one of its top international markets. It hopes to have 100 by the end of this year. Worldwide, it has 5,514 stores in 106 markets. Miniso reported Q3 2023 results in mid-May. They included revenue of $430.2 million, 26.2% higher than a year ago and 18.4% higher than Q2 2023. On the bottom line, it delivered an adjusted net profit of $70.3 million, 336.3% higher year-over-year and 29.5% above the second quarter. Approximately 97% of its stores are run by third-party franchisees. However, the inventory in those stores remains Miniso’s property until sold by the franchisee. Miniso receives an agreed-upon percentage of the sales and earns a fee for overall store management, etc. These fees account for nearly 10% of the holding group’s overall revenue. It’s an interesting model for both franchisees and the company. It’s not quite asset-light, but close.Celsius Holdings (CELH)CELH stock: A view of several cases of Celsius energy drinks, on display at a local big box grocery store.Source: The Image Party / ShutterstockCelsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH) is up 37% YTD, 100% over the past year, and a whopping 2,740% over the past five years. The functional energy drink maker has been on my radar for some time. I recommended it and six other micro-cap stocks to buy and hold for the next 10 years in November 2020. Its shares have grown 306% since. However, its best days are likely still ahead of it, given its relationship with PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) which distributes its products throughout the U.S. and will eventually take over worldwide. In addition, PepsiCo owns convertible preferred shares accounting for 8.5% of its stock.    At this point, with PepsiCo doubling its U.S. sales in the latest quarter, there is no question it will seriously consider buying out the business. But it will cost it a pretty penny. CELH stock trades at 13.5x sales, about 45% higher than Monster Beverage (NASDAQ:MNST) and 377% higher than PepsiCo.  There’s a reason 10 out of 10 analysts rate Celsius a Buy. On the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. As with many other companies Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN) makes use of debt. But the more important question is: how much risk is that debt creating?When Is Debt Dangerous?Debt is a tool to help businesses grow, but if a business is incapable of paying off its lenders, then it exists at their mercy. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Having said that, the most common situation is where a company manages its debt reasonably well - and to its own advantage. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together. Check out our latest analysis for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals How Much Debt Does Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Carry?The chart below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that Regeneron Pharmaceuticals had US$1.98b in debt in March 2023; about the same as the year before. But on the other hand it also has US$8.96b in cash, leading to a US$6.98b net cash position.debt-equity-history-analysisHow Healthy Is Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' Balance Sheet?The latest balance sheet data shows that Regeneron Pharmaceuticals had liabilities of US$3.10b due within a year, and liabilities of US$3.46b falling due after that. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of US$8.96b as well as receivables valued at US$5.12b due within 12 months. So it can boast US$7.51b more liquid assets than total liabilities.Story continuesThis short term liquidity is a sign that Regeneron Pharmaceuticals could probably pay off its debt with ease, as its balance sheet is far from stretched. Simply put, the fact that Regeneron Pharmaceuticals has more cash than debt is arguably a good indication that it can manage its debt safely.The modesty of its debt load may become crucial for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals if management cannot prevent a repeat of the 49% cut to EBIT over the last year. When a company sees its earnings tank, it can sometimes find its relationships with its lenders turn sour. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Regeneron Pharmaceuticals can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.Finally, while the tax-man may adore accounting profits, lenders only accept cold hard cash. While Regeneron Pharmaceuticals has net cash on its balance sheet, it's still worth taking a look at its ability to convert earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow, to help us understand how quickly it is building (or eroding) that cash balance. During the last three years, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals produced sturdy free cash flow equating to 70% of its EBIT, about what we'd expect. This free cash flow puts the company in a good position to pay down debt, when appropriate.Summing UpWhile it is always sensible to investigate a company's debt, in this case Regeneron Pharmaceuticals has US$6.98b in net cash and a decent-looking balance sheet. And it impressed us with free cash flow of US$2.5b, being 70% of its EBIT. So we don't have any problem with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals's use of debt. Of course, we wouldn't say no to the extra confidence that we'd gain if we knew that Regeneron Pharmaceuticals insiders have been buying shares: if you're on the same wavelength,  you can find out if insiders are buying by clicking this link.If you're interested in investing in businesses that can grow profits without the burden of debt, then check out this free list of growing businesses that have net cash on the balance sheet.Have feedback on this article?

In the annual syndicated survey, respondents rate their financial services providers in various areas on a scale of 0 (not at all satisfied) to 10 (extremely satisfied). The annual 2022 Investor Quantitative™ Database was fielded August 15 - September 15, 2022, to 5,993 respondents in 36 quota cells (age, asset groups and gender) and weighted to national based on age and assets using 144 cells drawn from the most recent Federal Reserve Survey of Consumer Finances and Hearts &amp; Wallets analysis. The report designates Top Performers in areas where customer ratings are ""distinctively higher than customer ratings of other providers"" ─ meaning one or more providers achieved customer satisfaction higher than other providers at a statistically significant level. For each area, there may be multiple Top Performers or none. The analysis does not rank Top Performers. It is not indicative of future performance or representative of any one client’s experience. This is also the fifth time Ameriprise has earned a Top Performer recognition in ""Understands me and shares my values"" based on data from 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2022.

Sustainability 101 is a blog series that you can turn to for information about different environmental sustainability terms that may come up at work, during discussions with friends, and even at your annual holiday gathering.NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / June 14, 2023 / Have you heard the phrase ""Smart Building"" in recent meetings or in the news and wondered what it meant? This blog will explain the ins and outs of smart buildings and how Cisco technology fits in.What is a Smart Building?According to a CommScope article hosted through the US Green Business Council (USGBC), a smart building ""collects data from multiple systems and devices and shares that information so that action can be taken to improve business process, operational efficiency, sustainability, health and occupant safety, and user experience."" In essence, a smart building can take the data from its various building systems to make changes in real time.The term intelligent building has been around since the 1980s, when spiking energy prices helped crystalize the need for and development of automated building systems. The internet boom of the 90s and early 2000s saw the transformation of intelligent buildings into smart buildings, thanks in large part due to the connectivity made possible by the internet.According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), ""in 2021, the operation of buildings accounted for 30% of global final energy consumption."" This trend is only continuing to rise as buildings demand increasing amounts of energy. Smart buildings represent one way building owners and operators can systematically reduce the energy and emissions of their portfolios, while improving occupant health and satisfaction.What are the benefits of a Smart Building?The real benefit of a smart building lies in how you use the collected data. Smart buildings can enable:Story continuesLower energy costs. Smart building design can help save money and reduce the emissions of energy-intensive systems like Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) and lighting. How? As one example, buildings with connected HVAC, security, and occupancy systems can modify temperature based on when employees enter and leave the office. This means heating and air conditioning will only be running when necessary.Lower operational costs. A similar scenario plays out when you provide facility management teams with smart building data. Sensors that monitor how often a door is opened can provide valuable information to a janitorial team scaling their operations, for example. Instead of cleaning every conference room and restroom on the floor, teams can focus on only the rooms that need to be cleaned, saving time, money, and resources.Greater flexibility. A well-designed smart building can be future proof. When designed with interoperability in mind, building systems can adjust to future technology evolution and adoptions.How does Cisco influence Smart Buildings?Cisco has an important role to play in the expansion of smart buildings. Cisco is leading the way with technology solutions such as Catalyst 9000, Power over Ethernet (PoE), and Cisco devices and spaces.Catalyst 9000 provides the network upon which building systems and IT services converge.With PoE, devices are able to share data and power connectivity over a single Ethernet cable, helping to streamline infrastructure and simplify operations.Cisco devices such as the Room Navigator provide datapoints that allow HVAC and lighting systems to be modified based on occupancy. And, when connected with sensors and Cisco Spaces, devices allow users the ability to modify a room to their liking.Cisco Spaces provides the visualization of building system data that allows users to make decisions. Employees and visitors are empowered to make decisions on where to work based on how busy or temperate rooms are.Smart buildings play a fundamental role in helping owners and operators better understand and reduce the energy used in spaces, while increasing occupant comfort and satisfaction. Cisco's Collaboration Centers are digitally enabled, efficient workspaces that use Cisco devices and networks to create a comfortable, safe, and inspiring environment for customers and employees to meet. The redesign of our Penn 1 building in New York City uses PoE capabilities and Cisco video endpoints to monitor and measure occupancy, space utilization, indoor air quality, energy usage, and security. This helps to reduce our expenses and energy use, and serves as a model of how smart building technology can be successfully integrated.You can explore the full portfolio of Cisco smart building solutions and associated use cases at Cisco Smart Building Solutions and Cisco portfolio for smart buildings.Willing to learn and engage more on environmental sustainability?
