If you wish to skip our detailed analysis on the ""You Earned It, You Keep It"" Act, you may go to 5 Most Tax-Friendly States for Retirees: Some with No Property Tax.', 'Introduced on January 25, 2024, the “You Earned It, You Keep It” Act H.R. 7084 aims to enhance the financial stability of seniors in America. Proposing to eliminate all federal taxes on Social Security benefits starting in 2025, this move is one of the many long bills that have made efforts to eliminate taxes on Social Security in vain. The tax proposes that the Social Security payroll tax cap should be increased for high-income earners to back the tax elimination. This would make those who earn more contribute more to Social Security funds, ensuring its health and financial stability. An analysis of the act suggests that this would allow Social Security funds to remain solvent through 2054, which are otherwise feared to be depleted by 2033.', ""So who's going to benefit the most from the act? Apparently, its the higher-earning beneficiaries who otherwise currently pay tax on as much as 85% of their Social Security income. Those who earn limited income (less than $25,000) are already not paying taxes on their benefits, so the act doesn't make much difference to them anyway. Nevertheless, the high-earning class is also going to be the one required to pay more taxes during their working years. The potential passage of this act, whether it occurs this year or not, emerges as a potential solution to address the looming depletion of Social Security funds, a concern that has plagued both current and future retirees with apprehension."", 'Mike Townsend—managing director of legislative and regulatory affairs at The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW), discusses several possible fixes that can be implemented. Some of the fixes that Townsend discusses include extending the full retirement age, raising the payroll tax rate, and increasing the amount of income subject to the payroll tax.', '“The closer the government gets to the insolvency deadlines, the less time it has to raise the necessary funds. Congress can continue to kick the can down the road, but the math is only going to get more difficult”.', '- Mike Townsend—managing director of legislative and regulatory affairs at The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW).', ""Nevertheless, retirees looking at the big picture when it comes to retirement will only induce anxiety in themselves. Therefore, the best course of action for those who have already retired or are on their way to retirement is to make the best of the savings that they already have. Hayden Adams, director of tax and financial planning at the The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) Center for Financial Research, notes how the tax implications for each state can be profound. Still, taxes aren't the only factor that one must consider before making a big decision on relocation. Seniors should also be paying careful consideration to factors such as health and climate, aspects that will largely impact them as they become weak and old. Staying close to family, craving relationships, and being in proximity to quality medical facilities becomes an absolute necessity as one becomes older in life."", ""Nevertheless, retirees still pay prime importance to states that don’t tax retirement income, particularly focusing on ones that don’t tax Social Security benefits. Complemented by affordable costs of living, they can be some of the best states to retire on a fixed income. Another one of the biggest concerns for retirees are taxes. You can opt for a cheaper brand, and shop at cheaper stores, but you can't evade taxes. One big tax retirees are often scared of is property tax. These taxes vary depending on where you live, and can even increase alongside home values."", '“This is of particular concern to those on a fixed income. Will you be able to keep up with property taxes as your home value increases? Typically, higher property values mean higher property taxes.""', '-Hayden Adams, director of tax and financial planning at the Schwab Center for Financial Research', 'With that said, some seniors may take a step ahead and see which states are the best when it comes to property taxes.', 'denis-arslanbekov-b-eGDk5_gPo-unsplash', 'To compile the list of the 10 most tax-friendly states for retirees: some with no property tax, we used our list of top tax-friendly states for retirees in 2024.

Value investors who like to invest in profitable companies with high gross margins and net income have made shrewd investments in businesses with a solid track record over these twenty years. For example instead of NVDA, we identified the cheapest AI stock that is trading at less than 5 times market value excluding cash and investments using the value investing approach.', 'The present condition of the stock market is better understood in the context of a recent research report by investment advisory Deutsche Bank.

When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well.

With me today are Tony Will, CEO; Chris Bohn, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Bert Frost, Executive Vice President of Sales, Market Development and Supply Chain. CF Industries reported its results for the first quarter of 2024 yesterday afternoon. On this call, we'll review the results, discuss our outlook, and then host a question-and-answer session. Statements made on this call and in the presentation on our website that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that are difficult to predict."", 'Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or implied in any statements. More detailed information about factors that may affect our performance may be found in our filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. Also, you will find reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP measures in the press release and presentation posted on our website. Now, let me introduce Tony Will, our President and CEO.', 'Tony Will: Thanks, Martin and good morning everyone. Yesterday afternoon, we posted results for the first quarter of 2024 in which we generated adjusted EBITDA of $460 million. Our performance reflects a challenging quarter for our production network plant outages caused by severe cold in January as well as other unplanned downtime, resulted in a significant loss of production and maintenance activity. Even with the production outages and associated expenses, our business generated strong cash flow for the quarter. Net cash from operations from the first quarter was $445 million and free cash flow was approximately $200 million. Longer term, we expect the global energy cost structure to continue to provide a significant margin opportunities for our North American production network and for clean energy to provide a growth platform for the company.', 'As a result, we expect to have significant free cash flow available to both invest in growth and return capital to shareholders. We remain focused on disciplined investments in clean energy that offer returns well above our cost of capital. These include decarbonization projects within our existing network and potential new low-carbon on capacity. We also remain committed to returning capital to shareholders through our dividend and share repurchases. In the first quarter, we returned $445 million, including repurchasing 4.3 million cars. We have approximately $2.2 billion remaining on our current share repurchase authorization, which we intend to complete by the end of next year. With that, let me turn it over to Bert, who will discuss the global nitrogen market conditions in more detail.', 'Bert?', 'Bert Frost: Thanks Tony. The global nitrogen market has experienced rapidly changing dynamics throughout 2024, including in North America. The spring application season began earlier than normal in late February with demand for ammonia applications brought forward from the second quarter into the first or weather at the end of March, subsequently stalled field work and fertilizer purchases with the region now on a normal application and planting pace. Overall, we expect nitrogen demand in North America to be positive with approximately 91 million acres of corn planted. Good soil moisture supports higher application rates than in previous years, and farm economics remain constructive, but weaker than the record highs from previous and recent years.', 'We believe the spring ammonia season will see fewer tons of ammonia applied this year. However, total ammonia application volumes for the fertilizer year, which runs from July 2023 through June 2024, should be comparable to previous years, given the strong fall ammonia season. As the pace of spring application season has normalized, the lineup urea and UAN imports for the region has grown. These tons will be necessary to meet expected demand, given low inventories in the region to start the year and production disruptions in January. Even with the imports, we expect that inventory in the North American nitrogen channel across all products will be low at the end of the season. This activity is occurring as the global nitrogen market supply position has loosened, leading to lower global prices than we saw earlier this year.', ""Lower imports of urea to India, including the impacts of lower volumes taken in the recent tender, lower-than-expected deferred demand in Europe and other countries and good production from the era Gulf in North Africa all played a role. We did not believe demand during the spring season in North America will resolve the length in the global nitrogen market by itself. As North America hits its traditional pricing reset in the summer, Brazil, India, and China will provide the most important signals regarding the state of the market. We project that urea consumption and imports in Brazil will grow in 2024, maintaining that company's status as the world's largest importer of urea. India will remain a major importer urea, though they have lower requirements today, reflecting their commitment to increase domestically produced urea."", ""China continues to prioritize lower fertilizer prices for their farmers with export restrictions playing a significant role in that effort. We expect China sold export approximately 4 million metric tons of urea this year, but actual volumes will depend on the timing and duration of when exports are allowed. Even with these sources of near-term uncertainty, North American producers remain firmly positioned on the low end of the global cost curve. Forward energy curves continue to show spread between North America and Europe, which is home to the industry's marginal high-cost production remaining wider than historical averages. As a result, we expect attractive margin opportunities for our network in the near and longer term. With that, let me turn the call over to Chris."", 'Chris Bohn: Thanks Bert. For the first quarter of 2024, the company reported net earnings attributable to common stockholders of approximately $194 million or $1.03 per diluted share. EBITDA was $488 million, and adjusted EBITDA was approximately $460 million. The production outages that we experienced earlier this year affected our results in two significant ways. Maintenance expenses were approximately $75 million higher in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the first quarter of 2023. Additionally, we had approximately 160,000 fewer tons of ammonia available to upgrade in the quarter compared to the same quarter last year. This equates to approximately 275,000 tons of urea that we would otherwise have been able to produce and sell at higher margins.', 'The production issues were continued through the first quarter, and our network is operating at our typical high utilization rates today. We believe we currently project that growth ammonia production for 2024 will be approximately 9.8 million tons, which reflects normal asset utilization rates moving forward. Our forecast for 2024 capital expenditures remains approximately $550 million. Capital expenditures were higher in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the first quarter of 2023, primarily due to a large planned turnaround event. We are making continued progress on our clean energy initiatives. Commissioning activities for our green ammonia projects are nearing completion. We intend to purchase 45 compliant renewable energy certificates to pair with the startup of the electrolyzer to enable green ammonia production and maximize the value of the hydrogen production tax credit.', 'Additionally, construction of the carbon dioxide hydration and compression unit at Donaldsonville is progressing well. We believe it will be ready for start-up in 2025, at which point our partner, ExxonMobil will be to begin transportation and permanent frustration of up to 2 million tons of CO2 from the facility per year. This will not only significantly reduce our carbon emissions, but also enable low carbon ammonia production and generate substantial 45Q tax codes. Our evaluation of low-carbon ammonia capacity growth continues with potential partners and offtakers. We have made additional progress on our auto re-thermal reforming ammonia plant and flu gas capture FEED studies. These should be complete before the end of the year and will be an important component of our final investment decision.', ""We continue to emphasize a disciplined approach based on the return profile of new capacity, the technologies needed to meet customers' carbon intensity requirements and the global demand outlook. With that, Tony will provide some closing remarks before we open the call to Q&A."", 'Tony Will: Thanks Chris. Before we move on to your questions, I want to thank everyone at CF Industries for their hard work during the difficult first quarter of 2024. In particular, the team did an outstanding job for storing our network to full utilization rates and most importantly, doing so safely. Our 12-month recordable incident rate at the end of the quarter was 0.36 incidents per 200,000 labor hours, significantly better than industry averages. Despite the challenges we faced earlier this year, we believe CF industry is well positioned for the years ahead. In the near-term, the global energy cost structure remains favorable to our North American production network. Longer term disciplined investments in low-carbon ammonia production provide a robust growth platform for the company.', 'Taken together, we expect to drive strong cash generation and continue to create substantial value for long-term shareholders. With that, operator, we will now open the call to your questions.', 'Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session.

(NYSE:XYL) Q1 2024 Earnings Call Transcript May 2, 2024', 'Xylem Inc. beats earnings expectations. Reported EPS is $0.9, expectations were $0.839. Xylem Inc. isn’t one of the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds at the end of the third quarter (see the details here).', ""Operator: Welcome to Xylem's First Quarter 2024 Results Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Andrea van der Berg, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead."", ""Andrea van der Berg: Thank you, operator. Good morning everyone and welcome to Xylem's first quarter 2024 earnings call. With me today are Chief Executive Officer, Matthew Pine; and Chief Financial Officer, Bill Grogan. They will provide their perspective on Xylem's first quarter 2024 results and discuss the second quarter and full year outlook. . Following our prepared remarks, we will address questions related to the information covered on the call. I'll ask that you please keep to one question and a follow-up and then return to the queue. As a reminder, this call and our webcast are accompanied by a slide presentation available in the Investors section of our website. A replay of today's call will be available until midnight May 9th."", ""Additionally the call will be available for playback via the Investors section of our website under the heading Investor Events. Please turn to Slide 2. We will make some forward-looking statements on today's call including references to future events or developments that we anticipate will or may occur in the future. These statements are subject to future risks and uncertainties such as those factors described in Xylem's most recent annual report on Form 10-K and in subsequent reports filed with the SEC. Please note that the company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements publicly to reflect subsequent events or circumstances and actual events or results could differ materially from those anticipated. Please turn to Slide 3."", ""We have provided you with a summary of our key performance metrics including both GAAP and non-GAAP metrics with references to prior year segment metrics being made on a comparative basis reflecting the change in segment as of the beginning of the year. For purposes of today's call, all references will be on an organic and/or adjusted basis unless otherwise indicated. And non-GAAP financials have been reconciled for you and are included in the Appendix section of the presentation. Now, please turn to Slide 4 and I'll turn the call over to our CEO, Matthew Pine."", 'Matthew Pine: Thanks Andrea. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. The Xylem team delivered a very strong first quarter, outperforming expectations on all metrics. The team drove high single-digit organic revenue growth reflecting a healthy balance of both volume and price. And the team also expanded adjusted EBITDA margin, almost 300 basis points. And without outperformance, we delivered EPS growth of 14%. The story is pretty straightforward. We have strong commercial and operational momentum with resilient underlying demand in the majority of our segments in end markets. I want to thank all our teams for doing a great job. But I want to highlight two teams in particular Measurement & Control Solutions and Water Solutions and services.', ""In both segments, focused effort paid off in really outstanding numbers. In MCS organic, revenue grew more than 20% and margins are up over 500 basis points year-over-year. And in its first quarter as a combined segment, WSS stayed focused on serving our customers and deliver both the highest orders growth of all segments and made a significant contribution to Xylem's overall margin mix. In addition to operational and commercial performance, the first quarter also reflected continued momentum on integration synergies with Evoqua. We saw a very solid Q1 run rate on cost capture and we're confident in how we're tracking both on revenue and cost synergies. On the basis of our momentum, the team's disciplined performance and continuing resilient demand, we're raising our full year guidance for both revenue and margin and lifting our EPS guidance $0.08 from the midpoint."", ""As we look forward operationally we're focused on maximizing value from every additional incremental volume we deliver. The team's impressive first quarter margin performance reflects our increasing operational discipline. We're driving simplification across our business, doing the few things that matter most, even more efficiently. To solve water, we have to simplify water, both for our customers and for ourselves. Strategically, our demand outlook continues to be supported by secular trends that are set to continue across economic cycles. As the headlines reflect, we're seeing an increasingly water-challenged world. And just as with energy, the water economy is intertwined with every part of business and life. So as water security becomes pressing, we'll continue to see increasing demand for the solutions that can help make companies and communities more water secure, and Xylem's platform of capabilities is uniquely positioned to meet this demand."", ""We recently announced we'll be hosting our Investor Day on May 30 to take place both virtually and here at our headquarters in Washington. We're looking forward to the opportunity to provide updates on our strategic outlook, long-term growth and financial framework and our 2030 sustainability goals. And with that, I'll hand it over to Bill to cover the quarter's results, our financial position and our outlook in more detail. Bill?"", ""Bill Grogan: Thanks, Matthew. Please turn to slide 5. Q1 was an excellent start to the year, exceeding expectations across revenue, margin and earnings per share. I want to echo Matthew's thanks to all of our teams for remaining focused and turning in an outstanding quarter. We continue to see resilient demand with our backlog increasing 4% to $5.3 billion. Organic orders grew 3% in the quarter with book-to-bill above 1%, supported by strength across developed markets, particularly in WSS. Total revenues grew 40%, and organic revenues rose 7%, exceeding our guidance and a healthy combination of volume and price. Our performance was led by M&CS and WSS and we saw growth in all regions led by double-digit growth in the US. EBITDA margin was 19.2%, up 290 basis points from the prior year with productivity savings, strong volume, price and mix more than offsetting inflation and investments."", 'This reflects incrementals of 26% on a consolidated basis and 57% on an organic basis. Our EPS in the quarter was $0.90, above the high end of our guide by $0.05, up 14% over the prior year. Our balance sheet remains healthy with ample liquidity to support capital deployment. We started the year with free cash flow conversion of 9%. This represents significant improvement versus typical seasonality of negative Q1 free cash flow conversion. This year, we delivered higher net income, offset slightly by increased CapEx. Please turn to slide 6. Measurement & Control Solutions had a great quarter and exceeded our expectations. Orders grew 3% on continued smart metering demand. Backlog rose to $2.2 billion, up 6% organically and book-to-bill came in slightly under one due to greater backlog conversion.', 'M&CS revenue was up 22%, driven by smart metering demand and backlog execution. We finished the quarter with EBITDA margins of 22.7%, up 550 basis points versus the prior year and up 440 basis points sequentially. Margin expansion was driven by productivity, higher volume and price and favorable mix more than offsetting inflation. In Water Infrastructure, orders grew 6% in the quarter, led by robust transport demand. Revenue exceeded our expectations with total growth of 40% and organic growth of 6%, driven by healthy demand across all regions and applications. EBITDA margin for the segment was up 320 basis points driven by productivity, mix, volume and price offsetting inflation. In Applied Water, although orders declined versus a year ago, book-to-bill was greater than one, reflective of a few large project wins.', 'Revenues were down 4%, in line with our expectations against strong growth in the first quarter last year, primarily driven by a decline in developed markets. Segment EBITDA margin declined 380 basis points year-over-year, an unfavorable mix, higher inflation and volume declines, partly offset by productivity savings. Wrapping up with water solutions and services. Orders grew 7% organically led by dewatering and 19% on a pro forma basis with book-to-bill well above one in the quarter, driven by a large order for a 20-year outsourced water contract, but even excluding that large order, pro forma demand increased. Organic revenue was up 6%, while pro forma revenue increased 9%, with healthy growth across most of the businesses. Adjusted EBITDA margin was strong at 22.3%, driven by favorable mix in volume and price and productivity.', ""The outperformance across WSS is a great reflection of our team staying focused on what matters, serving our customers throughout this integration and re-segmentation. Now, let's turn to slide 7 for our updated full year and second quarter guidance. Given our first quarter outperformance and both commercial and operational momentum, we are raising our full year guidance. We are increasing our revenue guide to approximately $8.5 billion. This reflects an additional point of growth versus prior guidance. That will put total revenue growth at 15% to 16% and organic revenue growth at 4% to 6%. We are confident about driving further margin expansion with operational productivity and are raising our EBITDA margin guidance to about 20%. That represents 110 basis points of expansion versus the prior year driven by higher volume, productivity, including cost synergies and price offsetting inflation."", ""Our updated EPS guidance of $4.10 to $4.25 reflects an increase of $0.08 at the midpoint. We continue to expect around $100 million of exit rate cost synergies in 2024. And free cash flow conversion for the year is still expected to be 115% of net income. The full year outlook at the segment levels remain largely unchanged from our comments in February. For the second quarter, we anticipate total revenue growth will be 23% to 25% on a reported basis and 5% to 7% organically. We expect second quarter EBITDA margin to be approximately 20%, up 90 basis points, driven by higher volumes, continued price realization and productivity gains. This yields second quarter EPS of $1 to $1.05. We came into 2024 at a healthy pace, and we've had a strong start to the year, building further momentum."", ""Our diversified portfolio positions us well to address our customers' evolving needs, and we anticipate healthy demand across most end markets and applications. While we are closely monitoring the macro environment, including inflation, higher interest rates for longer, a strengthening dollar and geopolitical uncertainty, our overall outlook for the year remains positive. With that, please turn to Slide 8, and I'll turn the call back over to Matthew for closing comments."", ""Matthew Pine: Thanks, Bill. Two things I want to mention before we close. First, it's been such a privilege in my first 100 days as CEO to spend time with so many Xylem colleagues around the world. You can see they're doing fantastic work, and it's evident in today's results. And our integration progress is a great indicator of how smoothly the Xylem and Evoqua teams have come together. As a combined company, there is so much potential for growth and impact, especially as we pivot to even stronger execution of our strategy. To achieve our potential, we're being very intentional about the culture we're building. Specifically, we're creating a culture centered on behaviors that drive empowerment, accountability and innovation."", ""We call it our high-impact culture, and it's the heart of our how, how we are creating the next phase of Xylem's growth and impact. Of course, culture change takes time, and it starts with myself and the leadership team. So it's incredibly energizing to see the cultural alignment already coming to life in our town halls and business reviews at all levels in the organization. We'll talk a bit more about how we're fostering our high-impact culture when we gather together for Investor Day at the end of May. Lastly, on Investor Day, we'll also be launching our 2023 sustainability report. We're very proud of what we've achieved and even more motivated by the work ahead. In this year's report, we'll be introducing our combined company goals for the first time, setting our ambition for impact through 2030."", ""Given how fundamental sustainability is to Xylem's business model, I invite you to give it as much attention as you give our financial results. And as always, we welcome your feedback. And with that, I'll turn it over to the operator to lead us through Q&A."", 'See also', '30 Most Dangerous Cities in the US and', '15 Best Places to Retire in Montana.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

(NYSE:NCLH) Q1 2024 Earnings Call Transcript May 1, 2024', 'Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. misses on earnings expectations. Reported EPS is $0.04026 EPS, expectations were $0.12. Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. isn’t one of the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds at the end of the third quarter (see the details here).', 'Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. My name is John, and I will be your operator. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, to all participants, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Sarah Inman. Ms. Inman please proceed.', ""Sarah Inman: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us for our first quarter 2024 earnings and business update call. I'm joined today by Harry Sommer, President and CEO of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings; and Mark Kempa, Executive Vice President and CFO. As a reminder, this conference call is being simultaneously webcast on the company's Investor Relations website at www.nclhltd.com/investors. Throughout the call we will refer to a slide presentation that can be found on our Investor Relations website. Both the conference call and the presentation will be available for replay for 30 days following today's call. Before we begin, I would like to cover a few items. Our press release with first quarter 2024 results was issued this morning and is available on our Investor Relations website."", ""This call includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from such statements. These statements should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statement contained in our earnings release. Our comments may also refer to non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and other associated disclosures are contained in our earnings release and presentation. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Harry Sommer. Harry?"", ""Harry Sommer: Thank you, Sarah, and good morning, everyone. Thank you all for joining us today for our first quarter 2024 earnings call. It's such an exciting time for our company with wonderful new product available across all three of our award winning brands, strong demand and some recent noteworthy announcements that have solidified our trajectory for years to come. The demand for cruise vacations continues to be at all-time high, as evidenced by record booking, record book decision and record advanced ticket sales as the continued innovation and service delivery on border ships lead to exceptional guest satisfaction scores. The combined effect is strong financial performance in the quarter, and an even brighter outlook for the year ahead."", ""Today, it's my pleasure to discuss some of our Q1 milestones, including the recent newbuild ship announcement and peer development, our strong performance in the quarter, and the exciting booking trends that are driving our improved guidance for the remainder of 2024. I'll also be diving into the significant progress we've made on our global sustainability program Sale and Sustain. Later in the call, I'll turn it over to Mark, who will provide more color on our first quarter performance and update guidance for 2024. We kicked off the year with impressive momentum carrying forward several positive trends from the end of 2023. As you can see, on Slide 4, we sustained strong demand throughout the quarter achieving record bookings in this period, which led to our most successful wave season ever."", 'As a result, our 12-month forward booked position remains at an all-time high. In terms of financial results, adjusted EBITDA nearly doubled during the first quarter compared to the last year on the back of stronger pricing and higher occupancy levels. Our margins also noticeably improved during the period, with our core costs essentially flat year-over-year, leading to a robust growth and adjusted operational EBITDA margin, which is adjusted EBITDA divided by adjusted gross margin now approaching 33% for the trailing 12 months. As a result, we reduced our leverage by a full turn during the quarter when compared to the end of 2023 and in the first quarter at 6.3x net leverage, marking an important milestone in our journey to strengthen our balance sheet and well on our path for the 1.5 turn improvement in net leverage we guided for the year.', ""These drives will recognize the S&P which upgraded both our issuer credit rating and issue level ratings during the quarter. While we'll get more details later in the call, I can't help but share that we have exceeded essentially all of our guidance metrics for the first quarter of 2024 and consequently raised guidance on our key metrics for the full year, including net yield, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted EPS. Another key milestone during the first quarter was our historic newbuild order, which we shared on our last conference call during Seatrade Cruise Global, encompassing eight new ships across all three of our award winning brands, this is the most transformative newbuild program in our company's history. We also announced the construction of a two ship pier at Great Stirrup Cay, which will enhance our existing infrastructure on the private island, making it an even more attractive destination for our guests."", ""I am thrilled about our future as I know we're paving the way for our continued growth in the next decade and beyond. Our first quarter successes are due to our continued focus on our near-term priorities, which are detailed on Slide 5. We successfully grew capacity 8% compared to 2023, while achieving a record 12-month forward book position, all while increasing price and reducing our net leverage by a full turn and we're seeing strong results across the board. Turning to Slide 6, we have shown you frequently in the past, I want to once again emphasize our long-term strategy of delivering measured capacity growth and optimizing our fleet to drive strong financial returns. Our newbuild pipeline increased from 5 to 13 ships in the quarter, representing a capacity CAGR of 6% from 2023 to 2028 and 4% from 2023 to 2036."", 'Historically, capacity growth has driven outsized revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth and we expect this trend to continue with the incorporation of larger and more efficient state-of-the-art vessels to our fleet. Turning our attention to the current booking environment shown on Slide 7, we are witnessing robust and resilient consumer demand across all three of our brands in all of our markets. As a result during the first quarter of this year, we noted record bookings culminating a record wave season, leading to a continued record book position for the next 12 months extending into 2025. We continue to see healthy demand across all markets, brands and products, including Europe and Alaska, which continue to perform very well and make up the majority of our deployment over the summer.', 'All of this strength is despite the cancellation and rerouting of our itineraries that we announced in the Middle East and Red Sea earlier this year. We also recently announced the cancellation of all Red Sea sailings across all three of our brands for the spring of 2025 and replacement sailings are already on sale. By adjusting these sailings well in advance, we can assure a full sales cycle for the replacement itineraries and no impact to our 2025 deals. Overall, we are encouraged by the strength in our book position for the next 12 months, which remains at all-time highs with commensurate higher pricing. As a result, yield growth is strong. During the first quarter, yield growth exceeded guidance coming in at 16.2% on a constant currency basis, up 70 basis points from the guidance we provided just 2 months ago in late February.', ""2024 is shaping up to be a strong year. And as a result, we are raising our full year yield guidance 100 basis points from 5.4% to approximately 6.4% on a constant currency basis on the back of the strong first quarter and strong demand for the remainder of 2024. Please note that our occupancy guidance remains unchanged, as we are essentially already guiding to full ships, so the entire increase in our guidance is on the back of stronger pricing. Onboard revenue also remains a highlight with strengths seen across the board. This is a positive sign that our target consumer remains healthy and resilient. We continue to absorb strong demand from pre-cruise purchases, which were up 16% compared to 2023. Pre-selling of packages of forward cruise typically leads to a higher overall spending during a guest's cruise journey [ph]."", ""Turning to Slide 8. To continue cementing our leading industry position beyond 2024, I'm excited to announce that this first quarter reached an all-time high in advanced ticket sales. This success was driven by robust pricing, a dynamic deployment mix, coupled with increased presale packages and capacity grow. Our advanced ticket sales balance rose 30% year-on-year reaching a record $3.8 billion. Over the past quarter we have taken considerable strides in our sustainability efforts to our Sale and Sustain program which you can see on Slide 9. We kicked off the year seeking out government grants to support our green initiatives by applying to the EU innovation fund with the goal of accelerating the transition of our six Prima Class vessels from being methanol ready to being fully methanol capable."", ""We continue to be committed to our short and long-term decarbonization goals. We're also proud to announce that 50% of our company-wide fleet is now equipped with shoreside technology, achieving our year-end 2024 target well ahead of schedule. This is key to our journey to minimizing emissions during port stays and contributing to cleaner air in the port communities we visit. Our proactive approach to environmental impacts didn't go unnoticed. CDP Climate gave us a notable B rating in recognition of the steps we've taken to measure and manage our risk and opportunities related to climate change. This acknowledgement endorses our efforts and pushes us to continue enhancing our sustainability initiatives. Our commitment to operating ethically and with integrity also gained us recognition in the equity markets."", ""Just Capital in the Restaurants & Leisure category of America's Most JUST Companies Index named us as a Top 5 company. This recognition is a testament to our dedication to fair and equitable operation and the prioritization of our stakeholders wellbeing. Also, we completed the purchase of 3 million carbon offsets invested in renewable energy products. These offsets not only support our decarbonization journey, but invest in cleaner energy sources and local job creation in the communities where these projects are located. Finally, we were recently honored with being one of Forbes Best Employer for Diversity in 2024. This award is a testament to our dedicated efforts in fostering an inclusive workforce, where diverse backgrounds are represented, engaged and empowered to generate and execute on innovative ideas."", ""I want to express my gratitude to our entire team for their efforts in making our company a welcoming place for all of our talented team members. This recognition motivates us to continue creating a workplace where every individual feels valued and empowered. This progress underscores our unwavering commitment to environmental sustainability, ethical business practices, and the wellbeing of all of our stakeholders. These accomplishments serve as building blocks in our ongoing journey towards a more sustainable and responsible future. I couldn't be more proud of our entire team for all of these impressive accomplishments. With that, I'll turn it over to Mark to walk you through our financial results and outlook. Mr. Kempa?"", ""Mark Kempa: Thank you, Harry, and good morning, everyone. I'm a little under the weather today, so if my voice cracks, I apologize in advance. My commentary today will focus on our strong first quarter 2024 financial results, our improved full year 2024 guidance and our increasingly solid financial position. Unless otherwise noted, my commentary on 2024 net yield and adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel per capacity day metrics are on a constant currency basis, and comparisons are to the same period in 2023. Let's begin with our first quarter results, which are highlighted on Slide 10. We had an exceptional start to the year and we exceeded guidance across the board, beating our already ambitious targets for the first quarter, which we only announced 2 months ago."", 'Starting with the top line, results were impressive with net yield increasing 16.2%, materially exceeding our guidance of 15.5%. As discussed last quarter, several factors contributed to the exceptionally strong top line growth we saw this quarter, including the lapping of lower load factors and a less than optimized itinerary mix in the first quarter of 2023. But more importantly, we experienced unprecedented demand for Caribbean sailings in the first quarter of 2024, which represented approximately 58% of our total deployment in the quarter. Looking at costs, adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel per capacity day came in slightly below guidance at $164. As expected, this number includes approximately $5 from the increased dry-dock days and related costs in the quarter compared to 2023.', ""Excluding the impact of dry-docks, our adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel would have been essentially flat year-over-year, demonstrating our ability to offset the impacts of inflation with our disciplined cost savings initiatives across the organization. Adjusted EBITDA was approximately $464 million, exceeding guidance of $450 million and almost doubling the prior year's results. We return to first quarter profitability with adjusted EPS of $0.16, exceeding guidance of $0.12 in the quarter, and well above the loss of $0.30 in the prior year. Overall, we are incredibly pleased with the results we generated in the first quarter. Strong top line growth, combined with continued progress at reducing costs allowed us to essentially beat all of our guidance metrics in the quarter."", 'We are building on this momentum, and with our revised expectations for 2024 are raising our full year guidance on several metrics, which can be seen on Slide 11. We raised our full year net yield growth a full percentage point from 5.4% to approximately 6.5%. This 100 basis point increase reflects the strength we experienced in the first quarter. But more importantly, our higher expectations through the rest of the year as a result of strong demand and record bookings that we have experienced for the remainder of 2024. Last quarter, we mentioned the impact on our business due to cancellations and redeployment of itineraries in the Middle East and Red Sea. The strength we have seen in the business through wave season, however, has allowed us to almost fully offset this impact.', 'Our full year guidance implies net yield growth for the remainder of the year in the low to mid single-digit range and is exceeding our pre-pandemic growth rate. Adjusted EBITDA guidance for the year increased $50 million to $2.5 billion, building on the first quarter guidance beat a $14 million. Adjusted EPS guidance for the year increased on a net basis of $0.09 to $1.32 made up of our $0.04 beat in the first quarter, a $0.10 raise for the balance of the year due to higher demand and pricing, which was partially offset by higher fuel costs and interest expense of approximately $0.04. These strong numbers and related guidance raise would not be possible without the continued focus and efforts from our entire team, both shoreside and shipboard.', ""Now let's take a look at our guidance for the second quarter. We expect a strong second quarter with net yield growth expected to increase approximately 4.3%, which is slightly above our historical averages. Despite the impacts of the [indiscernible] itineraries and redeployments in the Middle East and Red Sea. Adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel per capacity day, is expected to be approximately $165 or approximately 5.8% above the same quarter last year. As we mentioned last quarter, dry-dock days in 2024 will make comparisons to prior year more challenging. Second quarter '24 has approximately 70 more dry-dock days scheduled than last year. This increase for the quarter results in a $9 or 550 basis point impact on adjusted net cruise cost ex fuel in the quarter."", 'Excluding the dry-dock impact, adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuels are expected to be approximately $156, essentially flat year-over-year, demonstrating once more the continued success of our cost savings initiatives across the organization. As a result, adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter is expected to be approximately $555 million, adjusted net income is expected to be about $160 million and adjusted EPS to be approximately $0.32. Moving to Slide 12, I want to dive a bit deeper into our margin enhancement initiatives. We remain fully committed to boosting margins and reducing costs across the organization. With a meticulous approach supported by our transformation office, we are continuously pinpointing opportunities, irrespective of their scale across every facet of our business.', 'The results of these efforts are clear in the first quarter of 2024 were adjusted net cruise cost ex fuel per capacity day was 165, but was flat -- essentially flat compared to the first quarter and 2023 excluding the dry-dock impact. Our guidance on adjusted net cruise cost ex fuel remains unchanged for the full year 2024 and is expected to be $159, net of the approximately $5 impact from dry-docks in the full year, which are -- ex the dry-dock, which are essentially expected to be flat. For your models, I would remind you that we expect to see about two-thirds of the dry-dock impact during the first half of the year, with the remainder in the fourth quarter. Turning over to Slide 13. I want to focus on an important metric that we track internally, which is our adjusted operational EBITDA margin, which is calculated by dividing adjusted EBITDA by adjusted gross margin.', 'Looking at the last 12 months, you can see the significant improvements we’ve made as we have returned the business to full operations and focused on right sizing our cost basis. In Q1, trailing 12 months adjusted operational EBITDA margin was 32.7%, improving 200 basis points compared to the full year 2023. We expect to see this margin continue to improve throughout the year, ending 2024 at approximately 33.5% based on our updated guidance. As you know, we are striving to improve our margins. And this journey will be fueled by two main drivers. First capitalizing on the strong demand in the market, and converting this into quality and sustainable net yield growth; and second, continued focus on net cruise costs and right sizing our cost base.', ""Shifting to the balance sheet and debt maturity profile on Slide 14. During the quarter, we completed the refinancing of our 650 million backstop commitment from a secured to an unsecured basis. In connection with this refinancing, we repaid $250 million, 9.75% secured notes due in 2028, which was our highest interest rate debt. This refinancing reduces our interest expense and improves leverage, while also releasing all related collateral. Another important step forward in strengthening our balance sheet. Moving to leverage on Slide 15, we have a track record of delivering on net leverage reduction, as we've discussed in many previous earnings calls. And we are currently on a path to do so again. In the first quarter alone, we reduced our net leverage by a full turn from year-end and turn the quarter at 6.3x."", ""This is a significant reduction for one quarter and we expect to continue to improve net leverage over time propelled by our organic cash generation and scheduled debt amortization payments. By the end of 2024, we anticipate reducing our net leverage by approximately 1.5 turns from year-end 2023, ending 2024 in the upper 5x range, with sequential improvements in each quarter. We are currently refining a multiyear plan to further continue the reduction of leverage and derisk our balance sheet to drive shareholder value. I plan to share more on this plan at our Investor Day on May 20. Closing out my section I want to reiterate this has been a fantastic quarter, where we beat guidance on all key metrics. The strong momentum we have seen in the quarter is carrying over to the full year and we've been able to raise our guidance for the full year on a -- on yield, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted EPS."", ""This quarter is a testament to our ability to use strong top line results coupled with efficiencies to enhance margins and drive strong EBITDA and related cash flows, resulting in lower leverage and derisking the balance sheet. We are excited to see how the rest of the year plays out after the strong start. With that, I'll turn it back to Harry for closing remarks."", ""Harry Sommer: Well, thank you Mark, and I wish you a speedy recovery. Moving forward, our entire team will be focused on our most important work as shown on Slide 16. First, we will continue to focus on execution. Capitalizing on the strong demand from our target of skill demographics to drive net yield, while delivering experiences that guests value. Second, we will build upon the progress already made over the last quarters from our ongoing margin enhancement efforts with further improvements in cost reduction and efficiencies throughout the organization. And finally, we will continue to improve our financial stability by further strengthening our balance sheet and continuing to reduce net leverage over time. In a few weeks time, we'll be having the privilege of hosting an Investor Day."", ""We hope you are able to attend either in person at the New York Stock Exchange or virtually through our webcast. It is an occasion that we are eagerly looking forward to as it provides us with a platform to articulate our long-term strategy and financial metrics for the business. This strategic roadmap will offer insight into our ambitions and aspirations for the future of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings. We will outline the key initiatives and measures that will underpin our drive towards providing our guests with the experiences they value, while delivering long-term profitable growth and shareholder value. The future is certainly bright and we are excited to share this journey with you.

Emerging from the dotcom boom and bust without permanent damage, the economy has faced the financial meltdown of 2008, a tech-enabled boom that has resulted in trillion dollar valuations, and the pandemic crisis of 2020 that ground business to almost a complete halt across the globe. From 2003 to 2023, the benchmark S&P 500 has registered double digits annual returns thirteen times.', 'Investors at the stock market have made money from this growth by piling into profitable stocks like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). However, even as these tech stocks become the hottest equities, old-school value investing has yet to lose charm. Value investors who like to invest in profitable companies with high gross margins and net income have made shrewd investments in businesses with a solid track record over these twenty years. For example instead of NVDA, we identified the cheapest AI stock that is trading at less than 5 times market value excluding cash and investments using the value investing approach.', 'The present condition of the stock market is better understood in the context of a recent research report by investment advisory Deutsche Bank. The report underlines that the seven biggest companies in the S&P 500 now have a combined market capitalization that make these firms the second biggest stock market in the world, almost double the size of the Japanese market that is in fourth position. Jim Reid, the head of global economics and thematic research at the advisory, has warned that this makes the US market most concentrated in history.\xa0', 'The fortunes of these firms are set to rise even further as AI hype and rate cut expectations serve to increase interest in growth stocks. Businesses are investing heavily in AI tools to keep pace with industry demand in this regard. Satya Nadella, the CEO of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), recently highlighted the role that he expected AI to play in changing work trends in the coming years and months. He made these comments during the second quarter earnings call at the end of January.\xa0', ""“A growing body of evidence makes clear the role AI will play in transforming work. Our own research, as well as external studies, show as much as 70% improvement in productivity, using generative AI for specific work tasks, and overall early Copilot for Microsoft 365 users were 29% faster in the series of tasks, like searching, writing, and summarizing. Two months in, we have seen faster adoption than either our E3 or E5 suites as enterprises, like Dentsu, Honda, Pfizer, all deploy Copilot to their employees, and we are expanding availability to organizations of all sizes.

(NYSE:CRM). The company's shares received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NYSE over the last few months, increasing to US$317 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$269. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Salesforce's current trading price of US$272 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Salesforce’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change."", ' View our latest analysis for Salesforce ', 'Great news for investors – Salesforce is still trading at a fairly cheap price. Our valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $414.71, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low. What’s more interesting is that, Salesforce’s share price is quite volatile, which gives us more chances to buy since the share price could sink lower (or rise higher) in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.', ""Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations.

It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation."", 'Are you a shareholder? Since CRM is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With a positive outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as financial health to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.', 'Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on CRM for a while, now might be the time to enter the stock. Its buoyant future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy CRM.

But sustainability in the cotton industry starts in the field, where growers consider soil health, water cycling, nutrient management and more as they embrace their role as stewards of the land.', 'Regenerative agriculture—which includes cover cropping, no-till or conservation tillage and crop rotation (more on this later)—is at the heart of the advancements in cotton growing, and it stands as a boon for brands and retailers that want to improve their sustainability goals.', 'More from Sourcing Journal', 'This is Why Denim is Circular-And Why Consumers Trust It', ""How TENCEL and Regenerative Cotton Blends Cater to Denim's Current Trends"", ""Regenerative Farming is Key to Fashion's Sustainable Future"", ""“When we’re thinking about this idea of cotton production, we’re really thinking, ‘How does the soil sustain the crop and sustain the farmer and sustain the economy,'” says the Soil Health Institute’s Dr. Christine Morgan, chief scientific officer. “That’s the concept behind regenerative agriculture. It’s a system of farming principles and practices that seek to rehabilitate and enhance the entire ecosystem of a farm. But it places a premium and an emphasis on soil health."", '“It also pays attention to those roles of biodiversity, socioeconomic health of farmers and their communities,” Morgan continues. “If we perform regenerative agriculture, we’re enhancing the soil or getting back to where it was before we started plowing the soil.”', 'This idea of being eco-conscious literally from the ground level is one that resonates with consumers. Consider that nearly seven in 10 apparel shoppers (69 percent) say they would be bothered if they found out a clothing item they purchased was not environmentally friendly, according to the Cotton Incorporated Lifestyle Monitor™ Survey. And there are repercussions for brands, as about four in 10 shoppers (39 percent) say they would hold the manufacturer responsible.', 'More than half of all consumers (53 percent) say a garment’s environmental impact is important to them, according to the Monitor™ research. And almost half (48 percent) say “environmentally friendly” clothing means apparel that’s not harmful to the environment/is good for the earth/is ethically sourced. Of note, the clear majority (78 percent) of consumers say cotton apparel is the most sustainable. ', 'Researching and improving on an environmentally conscious approach to growing has its rewards. Cotton Incorporated and the U.S. Cotton Trust Protocol won the 2023 Field to Market Collaboration of the Year Award for the U.S. Cotton Trust Protocol: Collaborating for a Smarter Cotton Future project. The project is a cotton production assessment system established by U.S. cotton producers and industry organizations to provide a mechanism by which U.S. cotton growers can assess and verify their current production practices and measure progress toward long-term sustainability goals.', 'The award goes hand-in-hand with regenerative agriculture, some of the practices of which include cover crops, conservation tillage or no-till and crop rotation.', 'Cover crops are grown alongside cotton, and their canopy and roots reduce soil erosion, suppress weeds, enhance water availability, control pests and diseases, increase biodiversity and increase organic matter and carbon sequestration. Cover crops also improve soil structure so growers can cut back on irrigation.', 'Conservation tillage or no-till means growers reduce the number of times they till the soil—or they don’t till it at all—to decrease erosion, increase organic matter in the soil and increase soil carbon accumulation rates. Reduced tillage also significantly reduces fuel usage, benefitting both the environment and the growers’ costs.', 'Crop rotation involves strategically growing different crops in a specific sequence to enhance soil fertility, disrupt pest and disease cycles and improve soil structure. A grower might cycle out cotton with corn, soybeans or peanuts.', 'Since the U.S. Cotton Belt spans 17 states from Virginia to California and a multitude of soil types, ecosystems and climates, the practices that are adopted by one grower might be quite different than those adopted by another. The idea is that each grower implements the practices that work best for their farm.', 'Forward-thinking brands and retailers are already incorporating regenerative agriculture into their programs. For instance, Target says it recognizes “the critical interconnections between climate and nature” and “is continuing to invest in regenerative agriculture.” As part of its efforts, Target is working with the U.S. Cotton Trust Protocol’s Climate Smart Commodities Projects to “build markets for climate-smart cotton and provide technical and financial assistance to over 1,000 U.S. cotton farmers.”', 'A few years ago, the Ralph Lauren Corporate Foundation gave a $5 million grant to the Soil Health Institute to launch the U.S. Regenerative Cotton Fund, an initiative that supports long-term, sustainable cotton production in the U.S.', '“Partnering to scale solutions that build community resilience are powerful ways to positively impact people’s lives, now and for the future,” said Ralph Lauren Corporation’s Roseann Lynch, chief people officer and head of the Ralph Lauren Corporate Foundation, at the time of the program’s launch.', 'Clearly, these companies see the benefits of improved sustainability at the beginning of the supply chain. And that’s appreciated by consumers when they’re shopping for new clothes.', 'Nearly two-fifths of consumers (37 percent) say sustainability or environmental friendliness is important to them when they’re looking at what apparel brands to buy, according to Monitor™ research. And about half (49 percent) say environmental friendliness is an important factor when they’re actually making a clothing purchase.', 'Regenerative agriculture is a holistic approach to meeting the needs of the land, the farmer and the supply chain. The benefits bolster brands’ efforts to improve sustainability within their own supply chain.

Our view on the cycle risk was simple – the long-term growth outlook was tremendous given the proliferation of electronics and software in everyday objects, and the downturn had already begun, and a healthy amount of it was known. We ignored the near-term outlook for profits, assuming they would be down substantially. It turned out that the downturn was more severe than most other investors or industry observers had forecasted.

Good morning and thanks, everybody, for joining today's call. Before I touch on a few key takeaways from our first quarter results. I'm going to start by saying how excited I am joined today by Noemie Heuland, who officially joined Moody's on April 1. And as I mentioned on our last earnings call, Noemie brings almost 25 years of global financial and accounting leadership experience at some very large public companies with a real depth of experience in technology and Software as a Service. And we're really fortunate to have her as our Chief Financial Officer, and I look forward to all of you getting to know her in the coming weeks and months. So, with that, let me turn to our first quarter results."", ""We delivered an impressive 21% revenue growth, capitalizing on a strong issuance environment and continued demand for our leading risk assessment solutions. We delivered strong top line performance and margin expansion in both businesses, and that translated to adjusted diluted EPS of $3.37 for the quarter. Now starting with MIS. Obviously, a great quarter. And over the last several years, you all have heard me talk about the investments that we've been making in analytical talent and technology enablement to ensure that we are the agency of choice for inventors and issuers, and in turn, position us to capitalize on more robust issuance periods. And in the first quarter, we did exactly that, and we showed the tremendous operating leverage in our business with the second highest quarterly revenue on record, up 35% year-over-year and an adjusted operating margin of 64.6%."", ""Meanwhile, MA reported another quarter of 10% ARR growth, growing across all lines of business, including double-digit ARR growth in both Decision Solutions and Data & Information. And during the quarter, we executed on our strategic investment road map across platforming, product innovation and GenAI enablement. And this quarter highlights the unique strength of our business model. We're tracking to our medium-term EPS target of low double-digit growth while we are funding this investment program that will drive future growth, all while we expect to return over $1.6 billion to stockholders this year through share repurchases and dividends. That is the power of the Moody's compounding machine. We're also updating a few of our guidance metrics, and Noemie will give some details on that a little bit later in the call."", ""So, we've got our eye on the ball, we're looking ahead, and we are focused on our mission to be the leading source of insights on exponential risk. So, with that, let's dive in a little bit more on the financial performance of our businesses this quarter and our latest expectations for the full year. And as I've said before, MIS really is one of the world's great business franchises. It's widely recognized as best in the industry with strong global coverage in cross-border and domestic debt markets, and it has a growing range of offerings to support growth areas like private credit and transition finance. And maintaining that leadership position really is critical in order to capitalize on the resurgence and opportunistic issuance that we experienced during the first quarter."", ""And that's what played out during the quarter. MIS delivered, as I said, growth of 35% in the quarter, including 57% growth in transactional revenue. And a key driver of this growth in the quarter was the leveraged finance markets, a real strength for MIS, where revenue was up 144% versus the prior year quarter. That's quite a growth number. And as I explained a few quarters ago, we established a dedicated private credit team in MIS, and that's starting to pay dividends as we're better positioned to service the continued growth of the private credit markets as well as a wave of deals refinancing from the private credit markets into public markets. And while it's early, we're encouraged by interest in our transition finance offerings, and that includes our second-party opinions and our new net-zero assessment."", ""And we already have several major issuers like Électricité de France that have published our net-zero assessment. And with discipline around expenses, MIS delivered an adjusted operating margin of almost 65%, again demonstrating the tremendous operating leverage in this business. Now while the first quarter issuance was very robust, it is still early in the year and there are some uncertainties. So, we're a bit cautious in regards to changes to our full year outlook at this point in the year. Issuance in the first quarter benefited from pull-forward given the favorable market environment and questions about the back end of the year in regards to upcoming U.S. elections, ongoing tensions in the Middle East and uncertainty around U.S. inflation and central bank rate cuts."", ""So consequently, we have not changed our full year issuance and revenue growth guidance targets. However, our updated outlook now centers on the upper end of both ranges. And there are some things that we're watching to determine if we've got some upside to our current outlook. The global economy has certainly demonstrated resilience, and that's also going to be reflected in declining high-yield default rates, which are now projected to range between 3% to 3.5% by year-end. And we see some strong investor demand for riskier assets that's kept spreads tight. Notably, we're starting to see M&A activity pick up. Private equity funds are actively seeking exits and looking to deploy huge pools of capital. So again, there are some things that we're keeping a close eye on, and I'm sure we're going to discuss that a little bit further in the Q&A."", ""So now, turning to Moody's Analytics. As we've seen over the years, MA continues to be a very consistent growth engine for us, achieving 65 consecutive quarters of revenue growth and now six consecutive quarters of double-digit ARR growth. Retention rate has held steady at 94% for the last two years and yet again for the first quarter of 2024. And that's a real testament to the stickiness of our solutions. As we look across our reported lines of business in MA, we can see our land-and-expand strategy in action. So, starting with KYC, which I think you can see on the bottom far left of the webcast slide. About 1/4 of our 18% ARR growth in the first quarter is from new customer acquisitions. So, a lot of new logos adopting our solutions in this space."", ""On the other end of the spectrum, about 90% of our insurance ARR growth of 10% is from really strong execution of our cross-sell strategy across our existing customer base. Clearly, RMS is an important contributor to that, and it continues to deliver against the targets that we set back in 2021. And I think a number of you will remember that at the time of the acquisition, RMS was growing at a low single-digit pace, and it's moved up very nicely as we've made progress on migrating customers to our SaaS platform and really activating our cross-selling strategies. And that includes things like climate models to banks and conversely selling data and analytics and other Moody's solutions to the RMS customer base. So, when we take all of this into account, in 2024, the ARR for RMS, including synergies, is expected to grow at a low double-digit pace."", ""Now switching gears a little bit. Last year at this time, we were just starting to mobilize around GenAI. In fact, we hadn't even deployed our internal Copilot or announced our partnership with Microsoft at that point. And it is interesting to look back because what a difference a year makes. And we now have a framework for our suite of GenAI-enabled solutions that we're rolling out during 2024. It's no longer going to be just about Research Assistant. So, we've categorized our capabilities into three primary buckets that we call navigators, skills and assistance. And really, each of these capabilities deliver increasing levels of value to our customers and are going to have some distinct economics. So navigators leverage an AI-powered natural language user interface to help our customers really get the most out of our products."", ""And I would expect that almost all of our solutions will have some form of AI navigator or chat, what you might think of as a chatbot. And these will be table stakes, I think, for both our offerings as well as competitor offerings, I would assume in the relatively near future. Then we've got skills. Those are specialized GenAI capabilities that connect to Moody's data and content and analytics. And we're designing these skills to deliver automation and provide the tools to drive productivity and insight for our customers. And that includes things like the planned release of our, what we call our Quick Memo, which is our automated credit memo; and our Quick Alert, which is our surveillance and early warning system. And then we're going to have a set of assistance for a number of our major customer personas, which are going to be a combination of skills and prompt engineering that are most relevant to their jobs to be done."", 'So, this go-to-market framework, I think, is going to address the needs of our customers as they move up the spectrum of GenAI adoption in their daily work processes. And while it is still too early to quantify, we now have a pipeline that is coming to market in the coming weeks and months. And we expect that to help drive our value proposition and retention rates and open up opportunities to serve new users. So on that note, I am very happy to hand it over to Noemie to provide a little more color on our results.', ""Noemie Heuland: Thank you, Rob. Let me start by saying that in my previous role as a CFO of a public company, which was also an issuer, I've been in the building a few times over the years, but being here as Moody's CFO is both an honor and a thrill. As we get to know each other, I'd like to take this opportunity to share with you my Moody's thesis that drove my decision to join. Throughout the process, everyone I met has consistently told me what an exciting time it is to join the firm. Moody's has been a trusted source of financial insights through various economic cycles, and every actor in the global capital markets benefits from the value of Moody's products and services. Coming from the enterprise software ecosystem, I can tell you that this network effect, if you will, is one of the hardest competitive advantages to disrupt."", ""Also in my pre-CFO role, I got the chance to interact with Moody's analysts and research teams frequently, and each time I left more impressed by the depth and rigor of their thinking. Moody's ratings is a powerful franchise with sustainable growth prospects, unparalleled reputation and an impressive industry knowledge and expertise. Now in addition to that, Moody's built a great set of assets based on proprietary data that goes back over 100 years. The value of that historical data is unmatched. And it is my strong belief that Moody's is well positioned to leverage GenAI capabilities as a result. Whether it's credit, KYC, climate or many other use cases, Moody's has integrated and innovated with our customers' needs at the core. In truth, I spent the last 15-plus years talking to my peers about having the right data and analytics tools to make smart decisions in support of the business."", ""And so, I can attest the many use cases for Moody's Analytics solution set. As you can tell, I'm really passionate about that. Also, as you would expect as a CFO, I spent some time studying Moody's financial profile before joining. From obvious attributes, this is a very profitable business, which has delivered 13% of adjusted diluted EPS growth in Q1 with a high return on tangible assets and over 100% of free cash flow to net income conversion expected this year. This is an outstanding set of fundamentals, but they are also unique in that they provide flexibility for investing and innovating to fuel growth. Another CFO priority is execution of a disciplined capital allocation plan. I am very impressed with our focus and results. You saw us generate savings from resource redeployment and automation and then redirect investment spending on areas that will enable us to deliver on our medium-term targets."", ""And we are doing that while aiming to return about 80% of free cash flow to our shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks this fiscal year. In my experience, the operating leverage of this business and track record of long-term sustainable growth are simply remarkable. I conclude, before I get to the Q1 results and outlook, that as a CFO of a company that must abide by a large number of regulations and help its customers deal with an increased number of larger, more interconnected risks, I'm very proud to have joined the team that puts risk management at the center of what we do with resilient operations and a fantastic culture. I spent some time with Rob, his leadership team, the Board and many folks in finance and beyond. The culture, warmth and sharp intellect of the people at Moody's and the sense of belonging is very special."", 'And for all these reasons, I could not think of a better place to be. Now turning to the first quarter results. As you heard from Rob, we started the year strong with reported revenue growth of 21% and adjusted EPS growth of 13% over the first quarter last year when, as you may recall, we saw a significant nonrecurring tax benefit. Strong growth and inherent operating leverage while making selected investments in strategic areas led to an adjusted operating margin expansion of 610 basis points at about 51%, which translated into a free cash flow conversion to GAAP net income of over 120%. Our quarterly free cash flow of close to $700 million was the highest on record. Now let me touch on segment results. As Rob said, the issuance rebound led to MIS delivering its second highest quarter on record.', ""We saw a strong start across all lines of business as tightening spreads and investor demand propelled opportunistic issuance. Corporate Finance grew 49% predominantly from issuance by leveraged loan issuers and pull-forward activity. Financial institution issuance was the strongest since the financial crisis with an elevated level of infrequent issuer activity, which then led to revenue growth of 37%. On the margin front, the operating leverage of our ratings business, coupled with our initiatives to drive operating efficiencies, has allowed us to capture the significant rebound in issuance and slow the upside through the bottom line with a 780 basis point expansion of adjusted operating margin year-on-year. Turning to Moody's Analytics. First quarter revenue was up 8%."", 'Growth was driven by strong demand in our Data & Information line of business with revenue growing 13% year-on-year and continued demand for our KYC and compliance solutions with revenue growing 24%. As for Research & Insights, where revenue grew 3%, timing of revenue recognition of our on-premise software subscription and transaction revenue, even though these are a small share of the business of this segment, affected the growth rate a bit this quarter as well as a modest but expected uptick in CreditView attrition from banks and asset managers. If you look at the revenue from hosted software solutions, though, the growth is trending closer to ARR growth. And overall, we expect Research & Insights ARR growth to tick up to the high single-digit range by year-end, particularly with pipeline momentum picking around Research Assistant and unrated coverage expansion in recent months.', ""Speaking of ARR, MA ended the first quarter with annualized recurring revenue of $3.1 billion, up 10% from the prior year. Of note, we saw a sequential acceleration of growth within two of our three lines of business. Decision Solutions ARR grew 12%, up from 11% in Q4 '23; and Data & Information grew 11%, up from 10%, supported by higher retention amongst banks and public sector customers. These two lines of business represent about 71% of total ARR, so we're really pleased to see the growth there accelerating. You heard earlier that our retention rate remains best in class at 94%, demonstrating the stickiness of our solutions. As communicated in February, we are actively balancing strategic investments that we believe will drive future growth, including in our cloud platform and product road map, with operating efficiency initiatives."", ""That said, I'm pleased to report we delivered 29.7% adjusted operating margin in Moody's Analytics segment, an increase of 80 bps year-over-year. Let me now turn to our assumptions around issuance that underpin our fiscal year outlook. As we said in February, our full year issuance outlook of mid- to high single-digit growth accounted for a stronger first half of the year. Indeed, first quarter issuance was strong across all business lines, but mainly from Corporate Finance and financial institutions driven by refinancing activities with a significant proportion of that activity being pull-forward. That said, we are making modest revisions to select asset classes to account for what we saw in the first quarter. Specifically, we now expect big issuance to increase in the low single-digit percent range, up from approximately flat, driven by the elevated infrequent issuer activity in the first quarter that I mentioned earlier, and SFG to grow now in the high single-digit percent range as a combination of jumbo transactions and increased CLO refinancing activity fuel growth."", ""Our guidance for first time mandates in the range of 500 to 600 remains unchanged. I will conclude on issuance by saying it is early in the year. And although we like what we saw in the first quarter, our broader issuance outlook for full year '24 remains largely unchanged. As such, we're maintaining our MIS revenue guidance of high single digit to low double-digit growth for the full year. Our updated outlook incorporates various specific macroeconomic assumptions, which are detailed in our presentation. We are also adjusting our FX assumptions to reflect the appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the euro and the British pound. We now expect the euro to U.S. dollar exchange rate and the euro to GBP exchange rate to be $1.08 and $1.26, respectively, for the remainder of the year."", ""With that background, we are making the following updates to our full year outlook. Moody's Analytics revenue is now expected to increase in the high single-digit percent range, primarily reflecting the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, I just mentioned. That said, our ARR growth expectation in the low double-digit range for fiscal year '24 is unchanged from our prior guidance. Of note, we are maintaining our full year operating margin outlook for Moody's Analytics in the range of 30% to 31% as there is a partial FX natural hedge on our expense pool, coupled with ongoing disciplined expense management. For MIS, we just went through the issuance assumptions, and we're maintaining our full year revenue outlook of high single-digit to low double-digit percent range."", ""And we demonstrated in Q1 that we can capture the increased volume of issuance in MIS and at the same time expand our margins, which gives us confidence to raise MIS adjusted operating margin to a range of 56% to 58%. Last, we told you in February that we would narrow the EPS guidance range with increased visibility, and that is precisely what we're doing. We are narrowing the adjusted diluted EPS range for the year to $10.40 to $11. And that ends our prepared remarks. I'm happy to open the call to questions.

[Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference over to Guy Baber, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.', ""Guy Baber: Thank you very much, Danielle, and thank you as well to everyone for joining us on our call this morning. Yesterday, after the close, we issued a press release, a slide presentation and investor pack that address our first quarter 2024 results. Those documents can be found on our website at marathonoil.com. Joining me on today's call are Lee Tillman, our Chairman, President and CEO; Dane Whitehead, who as of yesterday is now our adviser to the CEO, Dane successor as our EVP and CFO, also effective yesterday; Rob White, welcome Rob; Pat Wagner, Executive VP of Corporate Development and Strategy; and Mike Henderson, our Executive VP of Operations. As a reminder, today's call will contain forward-looking statements subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements."", ""I'll refer everyone to the cautionary language included in the press release and presentation materials as well as to the risk factors described in our SEC filings. We'll also reference certain non-GAAP terms in today's discussion, which have been reconciled and defined in our earnings materials. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Lee and the rest of the team who will provide prepared remarks. After the completion of their remarks, we'll move to a question-and-answer session. And in the interest of time, we have a lot to cover today, so we ask that you all limit yourselves to 1 question and a follow-up. Lee?"", ""Lee Tillman: Thank you, Guy, and good morning to everyone joining us on the call. I want to start by again extending my heartfelt thanks to our employees and contractors. We built a track record of execution excellence that is differentiated in our peer space and the S&P 500. A track record that now spans multiple years through the ups and downs of the commodity cycle. Such execution is only made possible to the hard work and dedication of our talented people, who, through it all, remain committed to our core balances, including safety and environmental excellence. Now turning to first quarter results. We have a lot to cover today. I'll start with 3 key takeaways. First, first quarter was another strong financial and operational quarter."", ""We executed our plan and we've built on our multi-year track record of sustainable free cash flow generation, meaningful return of capital to shareholders and strong capital and operating efficiency. More specifically, we returned 41% or $350 million of our cash flow from operations back to our investors, consistent with our cash flow-driven return of capital framework that provides our investors with the first call on capital. Oil production of 181,000 barrels of oil per day was just above our guidance and free cash flow generation was solid despite not receiving any EG cash distributions from equity affiliates. This is purely due to timing, and we expect to receive a catch-up in EG cash distributions during the second quarter. Importantly, and similar to last year, first quarter marked the trough for both our oil production and free cash flow generation for 2024."", ""Free cash flow momentum should build significantly as the year progresses, starting with the second quarter. This is driven by several factors, including the expected catch-up in EG cash distributions, a significant increase to our oil production, especially into the second and third quarters and a moderating capital spending profile over the second half of the year, consistent with the phasing of our capital program. My second key takeaway this morning. We continue to make important strides to organically enhance our asset base, making Marathon Oil a stronger, more resilient and more sustainable company. Specifically, we're improving our capital efficiency through extended lateral drilling. About 25% of our first quarter wells to sales were 3-mile laterals spread across the Permian, Bakken and Eagle Ford."", ""Execution on this program was excellent, including a record pad in the Permian Basin. We continue to bolster the strength of our asset base through refracs and redevelopment, disclosing approximately 600 opportunities across the Bakken and Eagle Ford. These opportunities are complementary and additive to our company's decade plus of primary development inventory life and have been derisked through multiple years of technical work by our teams and actual results generated in the field. Notably, 30% of these opportunities are concentrated in the acquired inside acreage and upside to our acquisition basis. And we continue to progress the EG Gas Mega Hub a key competitive differentiator for our company. During the first quarter, we realized the long-awaited shift to global LNG pricing for our Alba LNG."", 'We started optimizing our integrated gas operations by diverting a portion of our Alba Gas away from methanol production and towards higher-margin LNG sales. And we sanctioned a high competent low-execution risk Alba infill program that offers risk-adjusted full cycle returns that are competitive with our U.S. onshore portfolio. So not only are we realizing improved financial performance this year on the back of our shift to global LNG price realizations, but we believe this improvement is sustainable, due to all the great work our teams continue to do to advance the EG Mega Hub concept. My third and final key takeaway this morning. We remain fully on track to deliver a 2024 business plan that once again benchmarks at the top of the E&P sector on the metrics that I believe matter most.', ""Free cash flow generation, capital efficiency and shareholder returns. This is demonstrated by the strength of our first quarter execution supporting no changes to our annual guidance. This data is comprehensively summarized on Slides 8 and 9 of our deck and is a compelling endorsement of our value proposition in the marketplace. No peer offers such comprehensive top quartile performance across this powerful combination of metrics. More specifically, we're expecting $2.2 billion of free cash flow generation this year, equivalent to a mid-teens free cash flow yield. We'll stay true to our CFO-driven return of capital framework and expect to again return at least 40% of our CFO back to investors through the combination of our base dividend and material share repurchases, providing visibility to both a double-digit distribution yield and significant growth in future metrics."", ""We'll keep improving our capital efficiency delivering flat year-on-year total oil production with fewer net wells to sales. And perhaps most importantly, we believe all these results are sustainable. That's true for our U.S. multi-basin portfolio, and that's true for our Integrated Gas business in EG. Before I close my introductory remarks, I'd be remiss if I didn't use this time to recognize Dane Whitehead and his contributions to Marathon Oil as our Executive VP and CFO over the last 7 years. Under Dane's watch, we've established a truly differentiated track record of sustainable free cash flow generation and return of capital to our shareholders, underpinned by an investment great balance sheet. Dane's contributions to this success have been invaluable."", ""But more than that, he's led his organization with the post integrity and humility. Dane on behalf of the entire organization, thank you, and you'll be missed."", ""Dane Whitehead: Well, Lee, thank you for those kind words. I really appreciate it. The past 7 years at Marathon Oil has certainly been the highlight in my 40-year career, working with you, our executive leadership team and Board and with all of our talented employees and in forms like this with our analysts and investors. Rob and I have been working very closely together in recent months and that will continue for a while as we ensure a seamless transition. Rob has been with the company for more than 30 years and have all the confidence in the world in his leadership. With that, I'll pass the CFO torch to Rob, who will be handling our prepared commentary today on our financial performance and return of capital initiatives. Rob, welcome to the show."", ""Rob White: Thanks, Dane. As Lee mentioned, under Dane's leadership, our company has built a track record of providing a truly compelling shareholder return proposition while at the same time continuing to enhance our investment-grade balance sheet. You can expect more of the same going forward with continuity in our long-held capital allocation framework and conservative financial policies. I'll now walk through a few key highlights regarding our first quarter performance and reiterate our key financial priorities for this year. First quarter cash flow and free cash flow generation were solid and consistent with our plan, despite not receiving any EG equity affiliate cash distributions in the quarter. As Lee mentioned, this is purely a timing issue."", 'For the full year, we expect total EG Cash distributions to approximate our annual equity earnings, starting with catch-up payments during 2Q. The EG catch-up distributions during the second quarter will contribute to an overall significant improvement in our free cash flow momentum as 2024 progresses. This is driven primarily by a significant production increase, especially in the second and third quarters and a moderation of our capital spending starting in the third quarter given the front half-weighted nature of our capital program. Turning now to our key financial priorities for this year. Priority 1 is clear: continuing to return at least 40% of our cash flow from operations to shareholders consistent with our return of capital framework, which represents 1 of the strongest shareholder return commitments in our peer space and across the entire S&P 500.', 'For 2024, our minimum 40% commitment translates to $1.7 billion of total distributions to shareholders at $80 per barrel WTI price deck, providing our investors visibility to double-digit shareholder distribution yield, a truly compelling shareholder return proposition. During 1Q, we returned $350 million, 41% of CFO to shareholders. We believe our commitment to shareholder returns and the consistency and transparency of our approach have positively differentiated our company. Over the trailing 10 quarters, we now returned $5.8 billion to equity holders, including $5.2 billion of share repurchases, reducing our outstanding share count by 29% and contributing to peer-leading growth in our per share metrics. We continue to see share repurchases as the preferred return vehicle with our stock trading at a free cash flow yield in the mid-teens.', ""Repurchases remain value accretive, are a very efficient means to continue driving per share growth and are highly synergistic with sustainable base dividend growth. Regarding the base dividend, as we've messaged before, our focus remains on competitiveness and sustainability. Given the ongoing benefits of our material share repurchase program as well as the interest expense savings from our gross debt reduction initiatives, we see clear potential for further base dividend growth while protecting the lowest enterprise free cash flow breakeven in the peer group. After meeting our shareholder return commitment, our second priority this year remains continued enhancement of our investment-grade balance sheet through gross debt reduction. Last year, we returned meaningful capital to shareholders and also reduced our gross debt by $500 million."", ""My expectation is that you'll see more of the same amounts in 2024. During first quarter, we strengthened our financial flexibility by completing a $1.2 billion offering of 5- to 10-year bonds. Investor demand was strong at greater than 7x oversubscribed which enabled us to achieve a timely and competitive weighted average interest rate of 5.5%. Proceeds from the offering were used to repay the remaining balance on our variable rate term loan facility in its entirety, which in turn delivers $20 million of annual interest savings. With the term loan facility paid off, our focus now turns to the $400 million of tax-exempt bonds that are due in July. As a reminder, this is a very unique vehicle in our capital structure with advantaged interest rates relative to taxable debt instruments."", ""As such, we will likely remarket those bonds as we've done previously. At the bottom right graphic on Slide 11 of our deck shows, after having paid off terms of the term loan, we have minimal bond maturities over the next 5 years. We do, however, retain the ability to efficiently delever down to our medium-term gross debt objective of $4 billion, which would make our current debt-to-EBITDA of 1x at strip durable down to a more conservative $50 to $60 WTI pricing environment. To be clear, our balance sheet is in great shape and provides us with tremendous financial flexibility, including $2.2 billion of liquidity at quarter end. Our top priority remains consistently meeting our 40% of CFO shareholder return commitment. We are also committed to reducing debt over the medium term down to our $4 billion gross debt objective."", ""We can do both. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike to walk through the operational highlights."", ""Michael Henderson: Thanks, Rob. With strong first quarter execution, consistent with our plan. We've made no changes to our annual guidance and remain fully on track to deliver our 2024 program, but once again benchmarks at the top of our sector on metrics that we believe matter most. The combination of free cash flow generation, capital efficiency and shareholder returns. During the first quarter, oil production of 181,000 barrels of oil per day was slightly better than our guidance, while capital expenditures of $603 million were enlarged. It's been a very strong start to the year for our asset teams. That's especially true in the Eagle Ford is our first quarter drilling rate of penetration was among the best it's been in the last 5 years."", ""First quarter Eagle Ford completion efficiencies also continue to improve. And in the Bakken, despite the challenging winter weather, we held on to the same execution efficiencies on both the drilling on completion site that we were delivering during the second half of last year, a trend, which bodes very well for execution in future quarters. Referencing Slide 14 of our deck. I'd like to highlight the performance of our Permian team. First quarter was another excellent execution quarter, marked by significant production growth. The primary driver of the production increase was our growth while outperformance 3 Upper Wolfcamp wells in core Red Hills at all at 100% working interest are significantly outperforming tight, realizing early well productivity, almost 4x that of the average Delaware Basin well."", ""The business isn't just about 1 pad or 1 quarter performance. Our Permian team has now built up a clear track record of execution success. We're all wells brought online since 2022, our Permian program has delivered among the best results of any Delaware Basin operator for oil productivity per foot. And the team has done so very competitive drilling and completion execution now almost exclusively bringing online 2-mile-plus laterals. Additionally, after taking a 2-year break in the Permian during the 2020 pandemic, we now have 1 of the more likely developed acreage positions in the play, with over 2 decades of high-quality drilling inventory at current activity levels. We're allocating more capital to Permian and the asset will continue to be a growth driver for us."", ""But we'll continue to increase our capital investment at a disciplined pace with an eye on maintaining our execution excellence. With this exceptionally strong start across our U.S. asset bases, our annual guidance midpoints for both production and capital expenditures remain unchanged. And my confidence in delivering on our full year guidance commitment is high. Consistent with our initial outlook, we expect our 2024 capital program to be heavily weighted in the first half of the year, similar to the profile we've seen from us before. Driven by relying execution efficiencies, we're pulling forward some of our activity. This should result in a slight increase to both our expected capital spending and our oil production during second quarter versus our original assumptions."", ""We now expect our capital spending to be just over weighted for the first half of the year. which will drive a significant sequential increase in second quarter oil for production, up to the midpoint of our annual guidance range, 190,000 barrels of oil per day. In addition to delivering on our guidance commitments. We also remain focused on continuing to enhance our capital efficiency and the strength of our underlying asset base through both the application of extended laterals and other organic enhancement initiatives summarized in more detail on Slide 13 of our deck. Extended laterals remain a compelling opportunity to continue enhancing our capital efficiency. At a high level, we're expecting significantly lower total well cost per foot, yet similar EUR per foot."", ""And thus, better returns and higher per well NPV in comparison to shorter laterals. And that's exactly what our initial cohort of 12, 3 milers during first quarter representing 25% of our total well set is delivering. Execution on the cost front is a clear positive as we're consistently realizing well cost savings on a per foot basis of more than 20% versus comparable 2-mile laterals. While early train production in the Bakken and Eagle Ford has been consistent with our expectations. Our first 3-mile pad in the Permian Basin, as previously mentioned, has dramatically outperformed. It's shaping up to be 1 of the strongest pads in Basin history. In addition to the extending laterals, we also continue to further bolster the strength of our asset base through refracs and redevelopment."", ""More specifically, we're disclosing approximately 600 high-quality refrac and redevelopment opportunities across the Bakken and Eagle Ford. Approximately 30% of these opportunities are concentrated in our Ensign acreage in the Eagle Ford, representing upside to our acquisition based. These refrac and redevelopment opportunities are complementary and additive to our decade-plus primary drilling inventory at the total company level. With this derisk through multiple years of tank work numerous trials over the last 5-plus years and a recent track record of very strong bottom line results. Importantly, we progressed this opportunity set with tremendous discipline and intentionality. Redev and refrac testing has been a key part of what we've long described as our organic enhancement program, which typically comprises 5% to 10% of our total capital budget for a given year."", ""This capital dedicated to enhancing the returns and resource recovery of our existing asset base through targeted testing of the best concepts the asset teams bring forward each year. For redevs and refracs, we've specifically identified potentially stranded resource from early advantage completions that we can economically access through integration into our primary plan of development. In total, we brought online over 100 refracs and 50 redevelopment wells across the Bakken and Eagle Ford to date. So we've compiled a rich technical data set and a master deep operational understanding. All 600 of future opportunities we are disclosing are strongly economic and prevailing commodity prices and about half of the 600 we believe, are directly competitive with a Tier 1 primary development inventory industry is drilling today."", ""More recently, we've been bringing on around 20 or so of these opportunities per year. This year, we're expecting to bring online just over 25. Again, this can account for around 10% of our activity in the Bakken and Eagle Ford. In terms of our development approach, for the most part, we aren't doing refracs or redevelopment as part of a separate stand-alone program. Rather, these opportunities are mostly integrated into our primary plan of development, typically directly offsetting our primary activity with the goal of maximizing the capital efficiency financial returns of our overall program. Recent results have been very strong, proving out the economic attractiveness of these opportunities supporting the disclosure we're now providing. In the Bakken, our opportunity set is more heavily weighted to refracs, where we've had good success."", 'Over the last couple of years, our refrac program has delivered 6-month oil productivity per foot that is competitive of the basin average for industry new drills. And we delivered this competitive productivity with a total well cost per foot more than 20% below the industry average for a new drill well. Again, most of our Bakken refracs have not been stand-alone, rather they offset new development wells. This has had the added benefit of improving the productivity of direct off-set Middle Bakken wells by around 10%. In the Eagle Ford, our opportunity set is a bit more balanced, split roughly 55% to refracs and 45% to redevelopment. Over the last couple of years, our refrac and redevelopment productivity has actually even better than the basin average for industry new drills.', ""In fact, it's been closer to top quartile. And with our refracs, we realized the same positive impact to offset wells that we see in the Bakken. To summarize, at approximately 10% of our activity in the Bakken, Eagle Ford, our refrac and redevelopment programs aren't primary drivers of our capital spend in those big basins. But they still represent a very valuable opportunity set that is positively contributing to our bottom line results and extending effective inventory life and they're a great example of our ability to extract the most value possible out of our existing high-quality resource base. I'll now turn the call back to Lee, who will wrap up with an EG update and some closing thoughts."", 'Lee Tillman: Thank you, Mike. Shifting to our EG operations on Slide 15. With the expiration of our legacy Henry Hub-linked LNG contract at the end of last year, first quarter marked the transition to fully realizing global LNG pricing for Alba Gas. Under the new contractual agreements effective this year, we began marketing our own share of Alba LNG directly into the global LNG market. During the first quarter, these LNG sales at $7.21 per Mcf realization drove a significant increase to the international revenue within our consolidated financials. In comparison to previous years, when our EG income was dominated by equity affiliates, a greater share of our EG profitability will accrue to the upstream through our Alba LNG sales and will, therefore, be consolidated in our financial statements.', ""These reporting changes should all result in improved transparency into the underlying operations of our integrated gas business in EG. We see no change to our 2024 guidance as we continue to expect $550 million to $600 million of total EG EBITDAX this year, assuming $10 TTF. That's a significant increase from our actual 2023 EBITDAX generation of $309 million. Importantly, we don't expect this to be a 1-year financial event. For some time, we've been focused on sustaining this improved financial performance by progressing all elements of the EG Gas Mega Hub concept. The 5-year EG EBITDAX outlook we provided last quarter demonstrates the sustainability of our EG cash flow generation. You'll recall the strength of our multi-year outlook is driven by a number of additional factors beyond realizing global LNG pricing."", 'Ongoing methanol volume optimization, which started during first quarter, our Alba infill program, which we just sanctioned and further monetization of third-party gas through the ethane gas cap. A few more details on our just sanctioned Alba infill program. This is a high confidence, low execution risk, shorter cycle project with returns that are competitive with our high-quality U.S. onshore reinvestment opportunities. We successfully contracted a rig within the region and expect a first half of 2025 spud with first gas from both wells expected during the second half of the year. These wells will largely mitigate Alba base decline, contributing to a flat production profile from full year 2024 to full year 2026. Our 2024 capital spending for this program is limited but fully accounted for in the capital spending guidance we provided to the market in February.', ""We expect 2025 capital for the program to be about $100 million. We covered a lot of ground today. All great stuff and all intended to further our more S&P mandates. Consistent with that mandate for the last 3-plus years, we've been in delivering financial performance highly competitive with the most attractive investment alternatives in the market as measured by corporate returns, free cash flow generation and return of capital. I fully expect 2024 to build on this track record, and we're off to a great start. Our compelling investment case is simple. A high-quality multi-basin U.S. portfolio and integrated global gas business that delivers peer-leading free cash flow. A unique and differentiated return of capital framework that provides our shareholders with the first call on cash flow."", ""The output of which is clear visibility to compelling shareholder distributions across a broad range of commodity prices and sector-leading growth in per share metrics and a multiyear track record of consistent execution and proven discipline. And perhaps most importantly, everything we're doing is sustainable with resilience through the commodity cycle. This is due to the quality and depth of our U.S. multi-basin portfolio, where we have over a decade of high return inventory and a disciplined and multifaceted approach to portfolio renewal, including organic enhancement initiatives. It's also due to our differentiated integrated gas business that's now fully realizing global LNG pricing, as we continue to progress all elements of the Regional Gas Mega Hub concept."", 'Rest assured, our commitment to our strategy is unwavering, and is built upon our core values, resilience across the commodity cycle and our long-term track record of success.

Second, our outstanding Q1 performance was broad based in our products and SI segment revenue was up 14% and operating margins increased 590 basis points as we continue to see strong demand for our feature-rich LMR products, including APX NEXT, and our refreshed PCR portfolio, and Software and Services revenue was up 4% inclusive of the Airwave charge control and our exit from the ESN contract, excluding U.K. Home Office revenues, Software and Services revenues, increased double-digits, driven by continued strong demand for our LMR service offerings and our software applications in video security and command center."", ""And finally, based on our strong start to the year and continued robust demand, we're raising both our revenue and earnings guidance for the full year. I'll now turn the call over to Jason."", 'Jason Winkler : Thank you, Greg. Revenue for the quarter grew 10% and was above our guidance with strong growth in all three technologies. GAAP operating earnings were $519 million or 21.7% of sales up from 18.4% in the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $638 million, up 20% from the year ago quarter, and non-GAAP operating margin was 26.7% up 220 basis points. The strong year-over-year increase in both GAAP and non-GAAP operating earnings was driven by higher sales, a favorable mix shift as our customers invest in more feature-rich LMR products and improved operating leverage offset by the U.K., CMA charge control related to Airwave. GAAP earnings per share was a loss of $0.23 and included a $585 million charge resulting in a $3.42 per share, pre-tax, non-operating loss due to the accounting treatment for the settlement of the Silver Lake convertible notes, we settled these notes entirely in cash for approximately $1.59 billion inclusive of the conversion premium, which eliminated potential dilution to our share account and reflected a favorable negotiated settlement price compared to the indenture terms.', 'As a result, we recognized a non-operating loss for the settlement during the quarter. According to the current accounting rules for convertible notes, which were updated in 2022, non-GAAP EPS was $2.81 up 27% from $2.22 last year. The strong growth in EPS was driven by higher sales and margins, lower interest costs, and a lower diluted share count. OpEx in Q1 was $568 million, up $38 million versus last year, primarily due to higher employee incentives and acquisitions. Turning to cash flow, operating cash flow was a Q1 record of $382 million, up $390 million versus last year, and free cash flow was $336 million up $398 million. The strong increase in cash flow was driven by improved working capital and higher earnings net of non-cash charges.', 'Capital allocation for Q1 included $163 million in cash dividends, $46 million of CapEx and $39 million of share repurchases. We also used $593 million of cash to settle the Silver Lake conversion premium, and we closed the acquisition of Silent Sentinel, a provider of specialized long range cameras for $37 million net of cash required. Moving to segment results in products and SI sales were up 14% versus last year driven by continued strong demand combined with improved supply availability and a favorable mix shift in LMR products. Operating earnings were $370 million or 24.8% of sales up from 18.9% in the prior year, driven by higher sales, favorable mix, and improved operating leverage. Some notable Q1 wins and achievements in this segment include a $22 million P25 device order for a large U.S. customer, a $16 million LMR order for an international customer, a $13 million order for the state of Tennessee, and a $13 million mobile video order for North Carolina State Highway Patrol.', 'In Software and Services revenue was up 4% compared to last year. S&S revenues, excluding the U.K. Home Office were up 12% driven by strong growth in all three technologies. Operating earnings in the segment were $268 million or 29.8% of sales down from the 32.9% of sales last year due to the impact of the Airwave charge control, excluding the impact of the U.K. Airwave charge control Software and Services margins increased year over year, driven primarily by higher sales and improved operating leverage. The notable Q1 highlights in this segment include a $25 million LMR services order for Douglas County, Colorado, a $25 million LMR services order for U.K. Department of Health, an $18 million command center order for the city of San Francisco, a $14 million LMR services order for Lithuania, and an $11 million services order for São Paulo State Police in Brazil.', 'Moving next to our regional results, North America Q1 revenue was $1.7 billion, up 13% on strong double-digit growth in both segments. International Q1 revenue was $696 million, up 3% versus last year with growth in video and LMR offset by lower U.K. Home Office revenues related to the U.K. Home Office, Airwave charge control and our exit of ESN. International revenue, excluding the U.K. Home Office impact increased double digits year over year in both segments. Moving to backlog, ending backlog was a record $14.4 billion, up $331 million versus last year, driven primarily by strong demand from multiyear Software and Services contracts in both regions. The year-over-year increase is inclusive of the reduction of $777 million booked in the fourth quarter of 2023 related to the Airwave charge control and revenue recognition for Airwave and ESN over the last year.', 'Additionally, in the first quarter of 2024, we recorded a $748 million of backlog related to the receipt of a three year extension notice from the U.K. Home Office for years 2027 through 2029. Our total backlog, excluding the U.K. Home Office, was up over $500 million compared to last year. Sequentially, backlog was up $138 million driven by the extension notice related to Airwave that I just mentioned. Partially offset by our typical Q4 to Q1 order seasonality in North America and some unfavorable FX. In the products and SI segment ending backlog was down $74 million, primarily due to unfavorable FX. Sequentially backlog was down $354 million due to the Q4 to Q1 North America order seasonality that I mentioned, and then Software and Services backlog was up $404 million compared to last year driven by strong demand for multi-year services and services contracts in both regions.', 'Our S&S backlog excluding the U.K. Home Office, was up almost $600 million compared to last year. Sequentially backlog was up $492 million driven primarily by the extension notice related to Airwave, partially offset by Q4 to Q1 order seasonality. Turning to our outlook, we expect Q2 sales to be up between 7% and 8% with non-GAAP earnings per share between $2.97 and $3.02 per share. This assumes a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 170 million shares and an effective tax rate of approximately 24%. And for the full year, we are increasing both our revenue and EPS guidance. We now expect revenue growth of approximately 7% up from our prior guidance of approximately 6%. And with that, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share between $12.98 and $13.08 per share up from our prior guidance of $12.62 to $12.72 per share.', 'In addition, with the U.S. dollar strengthening since our last call, this full year outlook now assumes an FX headwind of $30 million, primarily in the second half. It also includes a weighted average diluted share count between 170 million and 171 million shares and an effective tax rate of 23% to 24%. And finally, as a result of the debt issuance in Silver Lake settlement, we completed in Q1, we now expect full year interest expense to be approximately $240 million, up $25 million year-over-year. Before turning the call back to Greg, I want to highlight just a couple balance sheet related items. During the quarter, we used $593 million to settle in cash the premium for the Silver Lake notes that I mentioned. We also repurchase $39 million of shares resulting together in a combined total of $632 million targeted, reducing our diluted share account.', ""Also, during the quarter, both S&P and Fitch upgraded our credit ratings to BBB, underlying the strength of our business and the balance sheet. Following the upgrades, we issued $1.3 billion of debt, $900 million of 10 year and $400 million of five year notes further extending our average debt maturity, which is now over eight years, all fixed at an average rate below 4.5%. We use the portions of the proceeds from the new debt issuance to pay off the $1 billion convertible notes and plan to use the remainder to settle the approximately $300 million of debt maturity coming due later this year. I'll now turn the call back to Greg."", ""Greg Brown : Thanks, Jason. And let me just close with a few thoughts. First Q1 was outstanding across the board. We achieved strong revenue growth in all three technologies. We significantly increased operating margins. We generated record Q1 operating backlog, excuse me, operating cash flow and our strong ending backlog positions us well going forward. As a result, we're raising our expectations for both revenue and earnings for the full year. Second, during the quarter, we announced that we mutually agreed with Silver Lake to settle the convertible notes. Silver Lake has been a great partner since their initial investment in 2015, and I'm very pleased that Greg Mondre is remaining on our Board. And finally, as I look forward, I'm exceptionally pleased with how well we're positioned."", ""The investments we've made in our LMR product portfolio are driving meaningful revenue growth and margin expansion. Our recurring revenues are increasing as a result of the continued strong demand for our services. We continue to see accelerated adoption of our cloud offerings, including rave and command center and a vigilant Avigilon Alta and video security and our strong balance sheet positions as well to invest both organically and inorganically for continued growth. We ended with $1.5 billion in cash. Still expect to generate $2.2 billion of operating cash flow for the year. We refinanced and extended a portion of our debt portfolio and we received upgrades from two credit rating agencies during the quarter. All of this provides us with significant continued flexibility in how we deploy capital going forward."", ""I'll now turn the call over to Tim and look forward to your questions."", ""Tim Yocum: Before we begin taking questions, I'd like to remind callers to limit themselves to one question and one follow-up to accommodate as many participants possibly. Operator, would you please remind our callers on the line how to ask a question?"", 'See also', '15 Friendliest Countries in Africa and', '10 Best Long Term Low Risk Stocks to Buy.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

The billionaire investor built his fortune in a fund he founded in 1981, Duquesne Capital Management. Although he closed that fund in 2010, he maintains about $3.4 billion in assets through his Duquesne Family Office LLC.', ""Druckenmiller's top holdings, as shown in the 13-F filing for the fourth quarter of 2023, appear to reflect an interest in leading companies in cutting-edge industries and technologies. Let's review three of them."", ""Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is Druckenmiller's largest investment, accounting for just over 16% of his portfolio. As the leading producer of AI-enabled chips, it has achieved triple-digit revenue growth in recent quarters as companies scramble to buy the needed hardware to capitalize on the AI revolution."", ""Estimates on the degree of Nvidia's dominance vary, though most analysts agree that it controls at least 80% of the AI chip market."", 'Moreover, Nvidia has responded to AI chip competitors by releasing Blackwell. This combines six accelerated computing technologies into one product, offering similar functionality at 25 times less cost and energy consumption than its previous AI chip release.', 'Investors may also notice how Druckenmiller structures his Nvidia investment into two holdings. One is Nvidia stock, which is 9% of the overall portfolio.', ""However, Duquesne invested an additional 7% of the portfolio in Nvidia call options. These are highly leveraged investment products. Since they have an expiration date and can easily fall to $0, they are unsuitable for most investors. Also, the size of that investment may change significantly when the next 13-F release in May shows Druckenmiller's first-quarter 2024 holdings."", 'Nonetheless, the aggressiveness of that options investment implies a strong belief that Nvidia will rise significantly in the near term. That additional factor that could help persuade some investors to add Nvidia shares.', ""Duquesne bought Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) stock in the first quarter of 2014, around the time Satya Nadella became CEO. Although the fund was in and out of the stock over the years, the apparent bet on Nadella's leadership has paid off handsomely for Druckenmiller. The stock has risen by about 11-fold since Nadella became CEO."", ""Nadella transformed Microsoft into a cloud company as changing technologies and rising competition had made the dominance of Windows and Office less relevant. Its Azure platform has emerged as the primary competitor to Amazon's AWS, which spearheaded the cloud industry."", ""Additionally, the emergence of AI has furthered Microsoft's competitive advantage. AI relies heavily on the cloud to run applications, and its relationship with OpenAI has given Alphabet its first serious challenge to Google Search in years as Microsoft's Bing leverages this technology."", ""Today, Microsoft is again the world's largest company, with a market cap of about $3 trillion. That growth is likely a huge factor in it becoming 12% of the Duquesne portfolio. With AI becoming an essential technology, this investment should continue to move higher."", 'Duquesne first bought Coupang (NYSE: CPNG) in the first quarter of 2021, likely around the time of its IPO in March of that year.', 'As the leading e-commerce company in South Korea, it is not as well-known to U.S. investors. However, it has stood out in the country with its end-to-end logistics network that can deliver anywhere in the country within hours. Additionally, it competes in e-commerce in Taiwan and operates a video streaming service.', 'Since the 2021 IPO, revenue has grown by double digits, and Coupang became profitable on an annual basis in 2023. Nonetheless, Druckenmiller may now regret his timing as he bought the stock at around the time of the IPO. Due to the steep declines during the 2022 bear market, the stock is down more than 50% since the IPO. Still, he has steadily added shares since then, and it makes up 11% of his portfolio.', ""The investment could eventually pay off. Analysts forecast 15% earnings growth this year and 110% in 2025. Also, at a $41 billion market capitalization, it is a small fraction of Amazon's $1.9 trillion size. That could give investors a second chance for those who missed the opportunity in Amazon."", 'As Coupang reinforces its dominance in South Korean e-commerce and develops new revenue sources, Druckenmiller could eventually be rewarded for his patience.', 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2024 conference call. Before we begin, we would like to remind you that a copy of our news release, investor supplement and letter to unitholders can be found on our website. We also want to remind you that we may make forward-looking statements on this call. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks, and our future results may differ materially. For more information, you are encouraged to review our regulatory filings available on SEDAR, EDGAR and on our website. On today's call, we will provide a review of our first quarter performance, our role as a key enabler in the growth of digitalization and AI, and our recently announced agreement with Microsoft. And then we will hand it over to Esper Nemi, Senior Vice President on our investment team, to discuss the growth opportunities we are seeing in the current market as well as our asset recycling initiatives. And then lastly, Wyatt will conclude the call by discussing our operating results and financial position. Following our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. We had a strong start to the year, generating record funds from operations in the first quarter, benefiting from our development activities and acquisitions. Our operating business continues to grow and diversify, helping to improve the durability of our results and deliver on our distribution growth target. As the accelerating global trends of cloud computing, digitalization and the adoption of AI continued to drive significant growth in the demand for power, we are fortunate to be a key enabler of one of the most significant growth trends in recent history. The leading global technology companies, who reported results over the past 2 weeks, all highlighted significant increases in their capital budgets to fund cloud and AI infrastructure growth. The role that computer chips play in delivering the compute power behind AI is well understood by the market. But to execute on the number of computations that make AI such a powerful tool, you also need an immense amount of energy. The market is only starting to understand this need and power demand estimates to supply the growth in cloud computing, and the adoption of AI have grown significantly in recent months and quarters. However, existing energy infrastructure is simply not adequate to meet the demand from AI, meaning sourcing sustainable renewable power at scale is now on the critical path to delivering the rollout of AI globally. In this regard, we recently signed a landmark renewable energy framework agreement with Microsoft, where we expect to deliver them over 10.5 gigawatts of new renewable energy capacity in the United States and Europe between 2026 and 2030. Our strategy of building a business with leading platforms across the most important power markets globally, supported by our centralized teams, provides us with a unique development and operating capabilities, whereby we are able to leverage local relationships for permitting and interconnection and our global relationships for procurement and contracting to deliver a volume of capacity that is difficult to match. This first-of-its-kind agreement between us and Microsoft is a natural development in the long-standing and well-established relationships between one of the largest buyers of power and one of the largest renewable power developers and operators globally. The agreement supports Microsoft on a path to achieving their energy procurement needs to support the rapidly growing business in a sustainable manner, while also enhancing our position to achieve or exceed our targeted growth by identifying the key requirements for new capacity, including the location of the capacity and the time line to deliver. Through the agreement, we have identified projects that are in various stages of development that can be offered to Microsoft under a pre-agreed standard form, power purchase agreement. With the well-defined framework that aligns the 2 parties to work together, we are confident in the potential of expanding on this agreement going forward and furthering our position as a key partner to support the growth of Microsoft's business. This agreement already includes provisions to increase its scope to deliver additional renewable energy capacity within the U.S. and Europe and beyond to other regions, including Asia Pac, India and Latin America. The partnership is a testament to our differentiated offering, which is characterized by our access to capital and credibility to deliver scale, clean power solutions from our extensive pipeline of advanced stage projects, which are well positioned from an interconnection and permitting perspective in many key data center markets globally. While this partnership is a first of its kind, given the significant scale of investment required to meet the increase in energy demand, we believe we are uniquely positioned to be a key enabler of growth for the largest technology players through similar arrangements. Our access to scale capital, sizable development pipeline, which is now almost 160 gigawatts, and our ability to commission significant capacity concurrently to meet this demand, altogether differentiate us as a partner. We are also uniquely positioned to provide a tailored solution to help address our customers' needs. Our ability to provide scale 24/7 clean power solutions through the combination of our large portfolio of existing hydro assets, our leading nuclear business and other renewable power capacity from across the technology spectrum also distinguishes our offering. This is translating into favorable contracting opportunities. With that, we would now like to turn the call over to Esper to discuss our robust growth pipeline as well as our asset recycling initiatives."", 'Esper Nemi', ""Thank you, Connor, and good morning, everyone. Our pipeline of attractive growth opportunities is as robust as ever, given our access to scale capital, strong operating business, and market conditions where not all counterparties are necessarily as well situated, creating a favorable environment for new investments. In the foreseeable future, there is a need for greater amounts of capital for renewables than is available. As Connor mentioned, electricity demand is accelerating as a result of growth in digitalization, electrification and renewables, which are the lowest cost source of bulk power generation in most regions and countries now, and they're aligned with net-zero targets, are among the most likely sources to meet this growth. In 2023, renewable capacity additions globally grew by 50% compared to the prior year. However, renewable power developers and operators were not prepared for a higher interest rate environment or are unable to manage through supply chain challenges have seen their business models disrupted. This has created an opportunity to invest for value, where for business, which remains insulated from such headwinds, we are ideally situated at the clean energy center between capital and opportunities. Our access to scale capital means we can execute on large opportunities where there are few viable partners and risk-adjusted returns can therefore be very attractive. Larger companies can also attract stronger management teams and have embedded growth opportunities, which when combined with our capital and capabilities, can allow us to unlock additional value creation that others cannot. We're excited about the opportunity to add scale businesses and platforms in attractive markets where we can compound our competitive advantages. We're also able to leverage the expertise for global investment teams and our operating capabilities to strategically enter new markets, which enables us to look at a broader range of opportunities. Thus far this year, we have advanced several growth initiatives that when closed would add operating capacity and near-term growth through our development pipeline, and based on our current pipeline, we are optimistic that capital deployment will accelerate throughout the rest of the year. On asset recycling, the market for the right type of renewable power asset continues to strengthen as the outlook for interest rates have stabilized. 2023 was a very strong year for capital rotation, and we expect to continue that trend this year. Our large and growing portfolio of contracted operating assets with fixed rate, nonrecourse financing and pipeline of derisked projects are in high demand from lower cost of capital buyers, where for scaling development activities, we have a growing pool of projects to monetize and crystallize strong returns. We are fortunate to have launched a significant pipeline of asset sales into this environment, which we are advancing across technologies and geographies with the consistent characteristic being the derisked nature of the assets. In aggregate, we are targeting to generate $3 billion of proceeds or $1.3 billion net to BEP this year at attractive returns. With that, I'll pass it on to Wyatt to discuss our operating results and financial position."", 'Wyatt Hartley', ""Thanks, Esper, and good morning, everyone. Our operating business had a strong start to the year, delivering record funds from operations as we benefited from our diverse operating assets and contributions from our growth and development activities. We generated FFO of $296 million in the quarter, up 8% year-over-year or $0.45 per unit. These results position us well to deliver on our 10%-plus FFO per unit growth target for the year. Our hydro assets exhibited strong cash flow resiliency, a reflection of our diversified asset base, inflation-linked power purchase agreements and ability to realize strong power prices. Our wind and solar segments benefited from our recently closed acquisitions including Dervia, formerly Duke Energy's unregulated renewable business, and on path, our U.K. wind, solar and storage platform. Our Distributed Energy & Storage segment benefited from recent development activities and our Sustainable Solutions segment performed well as we felt the impact from a full quarter of contributions from Westinghouse. Our financial position remains excellent with a strong balance sheet and robust liquidity, positioning us to be opportunistic through the cycle. Over the quarter, we executed almost $6 billion in financing, taking advantage of pricing with spreads near historic lows. In January, we issued CAD 400 million of 30-year notes at 5.3%, and meaningfully extended our debt maturity profile. Later in the quarter, we issued $150 million of fixed-rate perpetual preferred equity, with proceeds being used to refinance outstanding preferred shares that were scheduled to reset in early April. The newly issued notes are 70 basis points cheaper than the reset rate of the outstanding shares we redeemed, saving us almost $5 million over the next 5 years. We ended the quarter with $4.4 billion of available liquidity, enabling us to deploy significant capital into growth. Considering public market conditions, our strong conviction in the intrinsic value of our business and our healthy balance sheet position, we allocated capital to repurchase our units in the quarter. In the last 9 months, we repurchased over 4 million units under our normal course issuer bid. Looking forward, we will continue to allocate capital based on where we are seeing the best risk-adjusted returns, and remain confident we will continue to create meaningful value for our investors. In closing, we remain focused on delivering 12% to 15% long-term total return for our investors, leveraging our deep funding sources and operational capabilities to enhance and derisk our business. On behalf of the Board and management, we thank all of our unitholders and shareholders for the ongoing support. We are excited about Brookfield Renewable's future, and look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year. That concludes our formal remarks for today's call. Thank you for joining us this morning. And with that, I'll pass it back to our operator for questions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Sean Steuart with TD Cowen.', 'Sean Steuart', 'A couple of questions on the Microsoft agreement to start with. Connor, can you give us more detail on the focus between North America versus Europe for this initial 5 years? And within the U.S., specifics on target regions and how your pipeline lines up with what Microsoft is targeting for their demand growth?', 'Connor David Teskey', ""Sean, thanks for the question. Certainly. So we're thrilled about this arrangement with Microsoft. It's incredibly beneficial in help -- in how it will help us to further optimize and grow our development activities. In terms of the breakdown between Europe and the United States, the balance of it is certainly in the United States. And this just layers very logically with where you are seeing the greatest amount of data center build-out around the world. That pairs very, very well with our business. As many may know, on the call, the vast majority of our near-term development pipeline is in the United States and pairs very well with that growing demand. In terms of where within the individual regions, we'll probably avoid the specifics. But the comment that can be made is, it's very well known where the largest data center markets are. These tend to be the areas where there is the most robust grid in order to support the build-out and where there is the greatest amount of development capacity in order to support that build out. So there's no secret sauce here. This is the locations where this activity will take place are primarily in the U.S. because that's where data centers are built mostly. And then within that, in the biggest data center markets within the United States."", 'Sean Steuart', 'Okay. One other question before I get back in the queue. The Biden Administration advancing trade action on solar panel imports from China, and it sounds like other Southeast Asian countries. Can you give us perspective on how BEP is positioned? Any possible impact on project economics as you see it going forward? How does this affect your growth plans in the technology?', 'Connor David Teskey', ""Certainly. So one of the competitive advantages and something we've been very proud of over the last several years is the performance of our centralized procurement approach. And via that group, we've been constantly diversifying our ability to procure panels from different sources that give us a lot of flexibility as we manage through what is a very fluid situation in terms of tariffs and trade actions to the United States. We've certainly done some obvious things increasing our procurement from domestic manufacturers within the U.S. and things like our investment in Avaada, which is beginning to produce solar panels itself in India, put us in a unique position where we don't see the current environment slowing our growth profile in any way. The one additional point that I think it's important to recognize when it comes to the headlines around equipment procurement and solar panels is around the world, solar panels are -- in markets outside the United States, solar panels are cheaper today than they've been at any point in history. This really is a tale of 2 worlds, if you will. You've got the dynamics in the United States that are impacted by the trade discussions and the tariffs, in the United States, solar panel prices have come down materially in the last 12 months. But outside of the United States, solar panel prices have come down dramatically. And that is obviously very, very constructive to our broader business and the economics we can get out of our projects."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Rupert Merer with National Bank.', 'Rupert M. Merer', ""Can you give us a little more color on the scale of the market opportunity for power and data? And how much of your growth could come from data markets in the future. And I suppose if you look at the overall market for power, we're seeing drivers from reshoring, electrification, population growth. How much of that growth do you think can come from data?"", 'Connor David Teskey', ""Thanks, Rupert. Maybe let's tackle this a slightly different way. The dynamic in the market today is very simply, there is an imbalance between supply and demand. There is far more demand for incremental new build in particular, clean power than there are available projects. And that is a dynamic that we do not expect to change for years or potentially decades to run because as you say, we've had these long-standing enduring trends that were driving electricity demand whether it be energy security, whether it be the electrification of industry, transport, residential, but all of that has just been multiplied in the last 12 to 24 months with this huge incremental driver of demand, which is data centers to support AI and cloud compute. And therefore, in terms of how much of our growth is going to go towards supporting the tech sector, I would say, a very meaningful component but our business continues to be very, very well diversified. But the nature of the current environment is that incremental demand from the techs is really lifting all boats. And one thing that we are seeing on the ground across all of our businesses is that incremental demand from the techs for whom procuring power is on the critical path to growth, those companies are getting a lot more constructive around price and terms in how they procure power. And quite frankly, they're dragging the rest of the market with them and creating a really, really robust and constructive environment to be a renewables developer, whether you're contracting with a tech company or anyone else. So while we do expect a very large and growing portion of our business to be supplying this incremental tech demand, the point that we like to highlight is this incremental tech demand is supporting the entire sector regardless of who your counterparty is."", 'Rupert M. Merer', 'All right. Great. And looking at your framework agreement with Microsoft, any color you can give on the typical terms you might expect in your contracts, maybe looking at contract duration or ability to index your power price. Any color?', 'Connor David Teskey', ""Yes, certainly. So the way the framework agreement works is it aligns one of the largest, if not the largest, corporate procure green power with one of the, if not the largest, producer and provider of green power. And it makes it very, very efficient for us to work together because we have essentially agreed on a framework PPA under which we can offer Microsoft projects to meet their demand going forward. The important thing we would highlight about this agreement is it's really in line with our historic development approach. We -- the final prices in these PPAs and terms in these PPAs will be negotiated between us and Microsoft to reflect the cost of construction and financing at the time, and to ensure that they are within our target returns as we have done with Microsoft over the gigawatt of transactions we've done with them in recent times. Therefore, we expect the contracts that we execute under this agreement to be very much in line with what we've done in the past, long-term contracts, 15 to 20 years plus inflation-linked at agree to prone prices that allow us to achieve our target returns."", 'Rupert M. Merer', ""My final question here may be a question for Microsoft. But when you're working with Microsoft to develop power solutions to support data centers, how important is the cost of power, meaning are they looking to develop data centers where power is cheap? Or do you think there are more important considerations for the location?"", 'Connor David Teskey', ""No doubt. That is a question for Microsoft. We wouldn't want to speak for them. But perhaps what we can share is what we are seeing in the market, which is -- and again, apologies to really be driving on, on this point. The supply-demand imbalance for power is very dramatic right now. And therefore, the accessibility to power, having comfort that the power is going to be delivered on time at scale in order to not compromise your growth trajectory, certainly seems to be the priority in the market today. And that's creating a really constructive environment for us as renewable power developers. But the important thing to recognize about the product that we do offer to Microsoft, all the technology companies, all of our broader power marketing clients is renewables are the cheapest form of bulk electricity. So even while this is a constructive market and it's allowing us to develop in a very attractive way, the power that we are offering them is long-duration power at a discount to retail rates, which is obviously supportive for their businesses."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Nelson Ng with Capital Markets -- RBC Capital Markets.', 'Nelson Ng', ""Congrats on the Microsoft agreement. So no surprise one further question on the Microsoft arrangement. So I was just wondering whether the Microsoft transaction takes up a lot of your current development capacity in the U.S. over that 5-year period? And whether there's room for, let's say, another framework agreement with another offtaker in the U.S."", 'Connor David Teskey', ""So I'll maybe come at that in reverse order. Absolutely, we could do other framework agreements or multiple other framework agreements, given the capacity we have and the pipeline we've assembled. I think it's important to understand the strategy that we have been pursuing, which is we have been acquiring and building a portfolio of leading renewable power developers with attractive pipelines in major core markets around the world because we had confidence that given our relationships with the large offtakers of power, we would be able to contract and build out those pipelines. And therefore, as we sit today, while we are thrilled about this agreement with Microsoft, we fully expect to not only expand this agreement but do other similar arrangements with other major buyers around the world. And maybe just to give some directional numbers around this, we are currently -- have a run rate of producing 7,000 to 8,000 megawatts of new generation capacity from organic development within our current business. Those numbers will naturally grow as our existing businesses get built out over time. And obviously, we are a growth company, we are going to consistently add other developers and other pipeline as we move through the remainder of this decade. It's very conceivable that by the period of '26 to '30, we will be producing well over 10 gigawatts a year, if not more. And therefore, while our arrangement with Microsoft takes -- derisks a good portion of that, it still is expected to only be a minority within our broader portfolio."", 'Nelson Ng', ""That's great color. So do you see this type of framework agreement as potentially being a template for, I guess, further project developments going forward?"", 'Connor David Teskey', ""Perhaps the way we'd answer that is, we have a lot of arrangements with different customers and those arrangements are always tailored to meet the needs of that specific customer. And while this agreement with Microsoft is certainly unique in its scale, we have lots of existing partnerships without our -- throughout our business, and we will continue to do other partnerships going forward, where this one is precedent setting and we do think will trigger other similar types agreements in its scale. But what we would expect is they all look a little bit different because one of the unique things that we can bring is not simply the scale, but the ability to tailor the energy solutions to meet that specific clients' needs. And therefore, these broad framework agreements, I would say, tend to be fit for purpose depending on who the counterparty is."", 'Nelson Ng', ""Okay. Great. And then just shifting gears a bit on the capital recycling side. You mentioned that you're expecting net proceeds to Brookfield Renewable of about $1.3 billion this year. Are you seeing some of that pent-up demand from last year kind of shift into this year? And then also, is it safe to assume that most of that capital recycling would happen in North America or maybe other parts like Asia Pacific? I know that you're -- you have a lot of, I think, solar projects and a few wind projects going on in the Asia Pacific region."", 'Connor David Teskey', ""Sure. So maybe to take a step back and this wasn't your specific question. But one thing that we often get asked is, is this a better market for investing or a better market for capital recycling? And more so than probably any point in recent history, we would say right now the market is heavily, heavily bifurcated, and we think it is a very, very good market for both. And therefore, we are seeing very, very attractive opportunities to deploy capital at scale at attractive returns. But on the same time, we are also seeing a very robust bid for high-quality derisked assets. Now tying that back to your question, is some of this perhaps a little bit of pent-up demand from last year? Maybe. But we really think that the key drivers of it is there is still a broad institutional bias to adding more exposure to this space. And with the stabilization of interest rates, there is still significant access to capital in this industry, and that is creating a very, very robust bid from both strategics and financials. In terms of where we are seeing opportunities for capital recycling, it is very broad-based. We are seeing opportunities in Asia Pac, as you mentioned. We are seeing opportunities in North America. The one that I would highlight that you didn't mention is we're also seeing significant opportunities for capital recycling in Europe."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Mark Jarvi with CIBC.', 'Mark Thomas Jarvi', 'So just staying on the asset sales, that $1.3 billion net to BEP, how much line of sight do you have on that? How would you put your conviction level on hitting that number? Is there an opportunity to exceed that number this year?', 'Connor David Teskey', ""Mark, we feel very good about that number. We started the year by launching a few fairly meaningful sales processes that at this point are well advanced and are seeing strong traction. So in terms of hitting the number we've guided to, I would say we have a very, very high degree of comfort. And if we continue to see that robust bid for high-quality derisked assets, as we mentioned on the previous question, I think we would just continue to add to that pipeline of capital recycling because that is where our business can really hum. When we're able to sell high-quality derisked assets at a lower cost of capital and reinvest that capital into very attractive higher returning investments, that drives really great returns for our business. So if we continue to see the market play out as we're seeing it today, we'll certainly look to add to that pipeline throughout the year."", 'Mark Thomas Jarvi', 'Just coming back to your comment about normalization and stabilization of interest rates, we did see a move back up in the 10 years. Did that slow any processes down? Or does that actually just push some sellers to have to transact just given where their own balance sheets are right now?', 'Connor David Teskey', ""Certainly. So maybe the way I would position it is in 2023, and I'm clearly being a little bit illustrative here, interest rates went from 2% to 4% to 6%, and there was a concern they'd go even higher than that. Now interest rates have stabilized in a very constructive level. If they end up 50 basis points higher or 50 basis points lower, it is still a very constructive environment for investing and transacting. So we wouldn't expect the recent movement in interest rates to derail our plans for the year. What we would say is on the investing side, we are seeing some opportunities in the market where that move in interest rates from 0% to 2% to, let's say, 4% to 5%, there are some market participants whose capital structures or growth strategies were not well prepared for that move in interest rates, and that is one of the things that's driving opportunities for us to deploy capital at really attractive returns in this environment."", 'Mark Thomas Jarvi', ""Understood. And then just lastly on the framework agreement with Microsoft and, obviously, you had a relationship with Amazon and you think about big buyers from the tech side of things, how does that factor into sort of your M&A pursuits, whether it's operating assets, you might be able to recontract or repowering or development pipelines. Has anything changed? Or have you seen this coming and that's already kind of factored into how you've been pursuing your acquisitions, both on development side and operating side?"", 'Connor David Teskey', ""So we very much appreciate the way you frame that question because if anything, perhaps what the agreement with Microsoft, given it's somewhat public nature does is it kind of demonstrates why we've been doing what we've been doing, which is very constructively and thoughtfully acquiring high-quality pipeline in critical markets around the world. So we absolutely will continue to do that going forward. And the demand that we are seeing gives us incredible conviction to continue to lean into that strategy. What the demand we are seeing and what the agreement with Microsoft does is it does really derisk a meaningful component of our development activities for the remainder of the decade. And it also allows us to move with a lot of conviction to expand and develop in areas and geographies that match where we are seeing demand from our portfolio of customers. And when you have such strong visibility on tens or multiple tens of gigawatts of offtake, it really allows you to move with more confidence in things like putting shovels in the ground and getting development permits, it allows you to lean into, looking to source equipment, looking to source financing because you know that demand is going to be there. So we simply see this as a first step in accelerating into the strategy that we've been executing on for a number of years now."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from the line of Jessica Hoyle with Scotiabank.', 'Jessica Hoyle', 'So just to start thinking about the Microsoft deal and dealing with large tech companies, is how narrow is the competition to provide these types of renewable packages just given they are across multiple geographies and are quite large?', 'Connor David Teskey', 'Thanks, Jessica. The arrangement we have been able and are fortunate to be partnered with Microsoft on and similar with some of our other very large customers, is there is a very significant differentiation. In order to be a credible partner of scale, one, you need the capital and the amount of capital to support these types of partnerships is very limited to a small number of participants in the marketplace today. So we would certainly see that as a major limiting factor and one that differentiates us. But the other important things that we would highlight is you need the operating capabilities. This is bringing on multiple projects across multiple geographies concurrently. And therefore, you need that best-in-class development and construction capability. And then the last point is, even if you are large and have the capital and have the capabilities, you actually need the assets, you need the pipeline. And this is where our approach of acquiring pipeline over the last 2 or 4 or 5 years is really coming to fruition because we have the projects and the assets to meet this growing demand already. This is a very real opportunity today and really lends itself to those that have that pipeline already, not those who are going to start developing it today in order to deliver it several years from now.', 'Jessica Hoyle', ""That's helpful. And then you talked a little bit on this, but maybe can you talk a little bit more about the opportunity set out there just in terms of buy versus build. There seem to be a lot of packages out there. So I just want to get your overall thoughts on these dynamics in the market."", 'Connor David Teskey', ""Great. The -- back to the comment that we think it is a bifurcated market where you can be both a very active buyer and a very active capital recycler, we do expect there to be a lot of transactions this year for the same reasons. Banks are lending. Again, the institutional bid is back, the strategic bid is back, and there is certainly a lot of capital available in the space. Given the very robust pipeline that Esper highlighted, we mean this with absolutely no sensationalization, our pipeline for growth is probably larger today than it's been at any point in history. And as a result of the scale of that pipeline, it is quite diversified. It is across both operating assets and development opportunities really across all markets around the world that we're active in."", 'Operator', ""I'm currently showing no further questions at this time. I'd like to hand the call back over to Connor Teskey for closing remarks."", 'Connor David Teskey', ""Great. Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us on today's call. As always, we greatly appreciate your interest and support of Brookfield Renewable and we look forward to giving you an update following our Q2 results. Thank you, and have a great day."", 'Operator', ""This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.""]"

Value investors who like to invest in profitable companies with high gross margins and net income have made shrewd investments in businesses with a solid track record over these twenty years.

Our own research, as well as external studies, show as much as 70% improvement in productivity, using generative AI for specific work tasks, and overall early Copilot for Microsoft 365 users were 29% faster in the series of tasks, like searching, writing, and summarizing. Two months in, we have seen faster adoption than either our E3 or E5 suites as enterprises, like Dentsu, Honda, Pfizer, all deploy Copilot to their employees, and we are expanding availability to organizations of all sizes.

Our sales and currency did shift to a slight headwind this quarter, not terrible at 0.6%, but it's the first time the sheer currency has been a headwind. If you look at the adjusted segment operating margins, that's an improvement of 150 basis points versus prior year."", ""We did finish at 24.7%. And a similar story on EBITDA margins. We finished at 25.5%. That is an increase of 130 basis points from prior year. Moving to adjusted net income. We generated $851 million of net income. That is an loss of 16.8%. And adjusted earnings per share were $6.51, and that's a $0.58 or 10% increase from prior year. Net income is also an increase of 10% from prior year. Q3 was really just a solid quarter when you look at the sales, when you look at segment operating income, when you look at net income and earnings per share, each one of those generated the highest levels that we produced this fiscal year. So a very strong quarter. If we can move to Slide 9. This just shows the walk of that $0.58 or 10% increase in adjusted EPS."", ""I'm really glad to say again, the main driver of segment operating income dollars increasing. We increased by $76 million in the quarter. That accounted for $0.45 of the EPS growth. That's nearly 80% of the EPS growth in the quarter. Again, Jenny mentioned this, but it's just impressive operating performance across the company, but specifically, the strength in our Aerospace Systems segment was again a main contributor this quarter. Interest expense is again favorable. That really is the result of our successful efforts to deleverage after the Meggitt transaction. Tax was favorable $0.06 versus prior year. Simply, that's just a few discretes that are certainly hard to predict. Corporate G&A was higher from prior year, but really, that's just more a result of prior year favorable items not repeating this fiscal year and you can see other expense and share count were just a little bit higher than prior year."", ""So the theme really remains the same this quarter as it has in the first half of the year. Our team members are generating strong operating performance that is driving margin expansion, really in a tepid top line industrial environment. And our debt paydown efforts are really reducing our interest cost. So it's just great to see the team work together to generate those results. If we go to Slide 10, this is the segment performance. You can see we continue to see positive growth as a result of the higher concentration of Aerospace in our portfolio. Margin expansion does continue across all of our businesses. That is great to see. Order dollars did remain strong against a very tough comp in the prior year. Order dollars did improve sequentially from last quarter."", ""So we're happy to see that. If you look at the North American businesses, sales volume reached $2.2 billion. Organic growth was down 4.6%, as you can see on the slide, but that was in line with our expectations. It was driven by softness in off-highway and transportation markets specifically. We did continue to see destocking throughout the quarter, but I will say it did continue at a decelerating rate. Despite the down volume, margins increased 120 basis points to a third quarter record of 24.1% in the North American business. This just really is a shining example of operation excellence and how the teams continue to see opportunities to drive margins even higher. Order rates in North America did remain constant with last quarter. They finished at minus 4 in the quarter."", ""If we move to the international businesses, you can see sales volume reached $1.4 billion. Organic growth was down 3.1% on those businesses. But again, that was in line with our guidance. If you look at EMEA, that was the most negative at negative 5.1 and just some contraction again in highway transportation and implant industrial markets. Asia Pac growth was minus 2.8%. China remains generally soft. Latin America is a strong point. They continue to be positive at 19% versus prior year. What we're really proud about is the team, even on that lower volume, expanded margins by 10 basis points, and they also generated a third quarter record of 23.5%. Focus remains on productivity improvements and cost controls in these businesses with orders in the international businesses at minus 8."", ""In EMEA, we are seeing some choppiness on orders, while Asia Pac we are seeing some improvements. If we look at Aerospace, Aerospace delivered another stellar quarter for the company. Sales reached a record of $1.4 billion, that's the highest we've ever had in the aerospace business. Organic growth was 18% across every market segment we have in aerospace. This is the fifth quarter of double-digit organic growth within Aerospace. Aftermarket strength continues to be outstanding. This quarter, we were up 26% in the commercial aftermarket area and operating margins are fantastic, reaching a new record, increasing by 320 basis points versus prior year to come in at 26.7%. Demand just remains robust, aftermarket strength continues and the team is just doing great driving margins ever higher."", ""Order rates in aerospace continue to be very strong at plus 15. So just great performance across all of our businesses. If we go to Slide 11, let's talk about cash flow. So first of all, I think most of you have probably seen this last week, our Board approved a quarterly dividend payout of $1.63 per share. That is a 10% increase over the prior dividend payout. With that increase, this does increase our annual record of paying higher dividend dollars per year from 67 years to now 68 years, just an unbelievably impressive record. Looking at cash flow. We've got a record on cash flow of $2.1 billion of cash flow from operations, that's 14.6% of sales. That is a 20% increase over prior year. And I said it already, but it is a record. When you look at free cash flow, we did $1.9 billion that is 12.6% to sales and that also is a 22% increase versus prior year."", ""The team really remains focused on being great generators and great deployers of cash. We are reaffirming our full year target of free cash flow dollars of over $3 billion, and we certainly are committed to free cash flow conversion of over 100 for the full fiscal year. So great performance on cash. Let's move to Slide 12. I'm happy to give an update on our deleveraging progress. We did reduce debt by over $420 million in the quarter. Since we closed the Mega transaction, it was just six quarters ago. We have reduced debt by over $2.6 billion. That, coupled with the continued expansion in EBITDA growth, we have reduced our leverage by over 40% just since the close. Both of those are ahead of our original commitment. And you can see on the slide here, gross debt to adjusted EBITDA is now 2.3 times and net debt is down to 2.2 times."", ""We still feel confident that we will get the $2 billion of debt paid down in this fiscal year and we certainly are on track to achieve net leverage of 2 times by June of this fiscal year, just in two months. So if we go to Slide 13, just some color on our guidance. We are reaffirming our full year organic growth midpoint and increasing our margin and earnings per share expectations for the year. Our reported sales growth for the year is expected to be 4% at the midpoint. And on organic growth, we are increasing aerospace once again. We're increasing it by 300 basis points to 15% for the full year. Both North America and international diversified industrial businesses. Organic growth is now forecasted to be negative 2.5. But for the company, full year organic growth remains the same at 1.5% positive."", ""So you can see how aerospace is helping the portfolio on our top line. We're raising adjusted segment operating margins. We're raising that to 24.6. That's 30 basis points higher than prior guidance, and that now forces the full year margin expansion to be approximately 170 basis points versus prior year. Corporate G&A and interest, unchanged from prior guide. Tax rate is down a little bit, just really based on Q3 actual results. We expect that to be 22% now. Full year as-reported EPS has increased to $20.90 and full year adjusted EPS has increased to $24.75. Both of those are at the midpoint and there's a range narrowed to plus or minus $0.10 for the fourth quarter. Finally, if you look at the fourth quarter, our adjusted EPS is expected to be $6.13 at the midpoint."", ""So as usual, we've got some more specifics in the appendix if needed. And now, I'm going to hand it back to you, Jenny, and I ask everyone to turn to Slide 14."", 'Jennifer Parmentier: Thank you, Todd. A few key messages to close this out as we near the end of our fiscal year 2024, our high-performance culture built a better and more resilient Parker. We will continue to drive operational excellence through the Win Strategy. As mentioned a couple of times already, aerospace demand remains robust, and our transformed portfolio drives growth. And finally, Parker is and will continue to be a great generator and deplorer of cash. Next slide, please. We are looking forward to sharing our story at our investor meeting on May 16th.

And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher.

We estimate that on a foreign currency adjusted basis, including the alcohol brand segment, April 2024 sales were approximately 12.9% higher than the comparable April 2023 sales and 14.9% higher than April 2023, excluding the alcohol brands segment."", ""Excluding Argentina's impact, we estimate that on a foreign currency adjusted basis, including the alcohol brand segment, April 2024 sales were approximately 11.5% higher than the comparable April sales and 13.5% higher than April 2023 excluding the Alcohol Brands segment. We estimate April 2024 sales, including the Alcohol Brand segment, to be approximately 10% higher than in April 2023 and 11.9% higher than in April 2023 excluding the Alcohol Brand segment. April 2024 had two more selling days compared to April 2023. In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives, as well as shifts in the timing of production."", 'In some instances, our bottlers are responsible for production and determine their own production schedules. This affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers. Furthermore, our bottling and distribution partners maintain inventory levels according to their own internal requirements, which they may alter from time to time for their own business reasons. We reiterate that sales over a short period, such as a single month, should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. The energy category continues to grow globally. We are pleased to report that our pricing actions have not significantly impacted consumer demand.', 'Our AFF flavor facility in Ireland is now providing a larger number of flavors to our EMEA region, enabling better service levels and lower landed costs to our EMEA region. We are in the process of constructing a juice facility at our AFF flavor facility in Ireland. We have a robust innovation plan for 2024. Beast Unleashed is performing to expectations. We are excited for Nasty Beast Hard Tea as well as the additional alcohol opportunities that Monster Brewing Company presents. Initial acceptance from retailers and consumers has been positive. We are pleased with the rollout of Predator and Fury, our affordable energy drink portfolio in a number of markets internationally, including the launch last month of Predator in a non-carbonated formula in 500 ml PET bottles in selected provinces in China.', ""We are proceeding with plans for further launches of our affordable energy brands. We are excited about the opportunities that the acquisition of the Bang Energy brand presents to us and believe that the brand will fit well within our broader portfolio of energy drink brands. The company achieved record first quarter net sales of $1.9 billion in the 2024 first quarter, 11.8% higher than net sales of $1.7 billion in the 2023 comparable period and 15.6% higher on a foreign currency adjusted basis or 12.6% exclusive of Argentina's impact.

GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Sign with AVB.', ""On May 3, 2024, Host Hotels & Resorts Inc (NASDAQ:HST), a premier owner of luxury and upper-upscale hotels, reported its first-quarter financial results through the 10-Q filing. The company's portfolio, predominantly located in the United States, consists of 77 properties, with a strong presence under the Marriott and Starwood brands. Despite a slight decrease in net income from $291 million in Q1 2023 to $272 million in Q1 2024, Host Hotels & Resorts Inc demonstrated a 6.5% increase in total revenues, reaching $1,471 million. Operating profit surged by 17.3%, and the operating profit margin under GAAP improved by 180 basis points to 19.8%. Adjusted EBITDAre also saw an 8.8% increase, indicating a solid operational performance. The company's strategic divestitures of its interests in European and Asian joint ventures, along with other U.S. properties, reflect a focused approach to optimizing its portfolio."", ""Brand Power and Portfolio Quality: Host Hotels & Resorts Inc's strength lies in its high-quality portfolio of luxury and upper-upscale hotels, primarily operating under the prestigious Marriott and Starwood brands. This association with renowned brands enhances the company's market presence and customer loyalty. The strategic focus on urban and resort properties in key markets positions Host to capitalize on high-demand segments, driving revenue per available room (RevPAR) and maintaining a competitive edge."", ""Financial Robustness: The company's financial health is underscored by its strong balance sheet and revenue growth. The 6.5% increase in total revenues and the expansion of the operating profit margin reflect efficient cost management and an ability to drive top-line growth. The 13.5% increase in EBITDAre further demonstrates Host's operational efficiency and its capacity to generate cash flow, which is crucial for reinvestment and shareholder returns."", ""Strategic Asset Management: Host's recent divestitures and acquisitions indicate a proactive asset management strategy. By selling off non-core assets and investing in strategic properties, such as the 215-room 1 Hotel Nashville and 506-room Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown, Host is refining its portfolio to focus on high-potential markets and properties that align with its growth objectives."", ""Net Income Decline: Despite revenue growth, Host Hotels & Resorts Inc experienced a 6.5% decrease in net income in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. This decline may raise concerns among investors regarding the company's ability to translate revenue increases into net profit consistently. It is essential for Host to analyze the underlying causes, such as potential increases in operating expenses or one-time charges, and address them to ensure sustained profitability."", ""Dependence on Brand Partners: The company's significant reliance on Marriott and Starwood brands, while a strength, also poses a risk.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Jaime Marcus, Senior Vice President of Investor of Investor Relations. You may begin."", ""Jaime Marcus: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin, please note that many of the comments made today are considered to be forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. As described in our filings with the SEC, these statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause future results to differ from those expressed, and we are not obligated to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements. In addition, on today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial information, such as FFO, adjusted EBITDAre and comparable hotel level results. You can find this information together with reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP information in yesterday's earnings press release and our 8-K filed with the SEC and in the supplemental financial information on our website at hosthotels.com."", ""With me on today's call are Jim Risoleo, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Sourav Ghosh, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim."", 'Jim Risoleo: Thank you, Jaime, and thanks to everyone for joining us this morning. In the first quarter, we delivered adjusted EBITDAre of $483 million and adjusted FFO per share of $0.60, which includes $10 million of business interruption proceeds from Hurricane Ian. Excluding the business interruption proceeds, our adjusted EBITDAre was 7% above the first quarter of 2023, and our adjusted FFO per share was 8% above last year. We delivered a year-over-year comparable hotel total RevPAR improvement of 50 basis points, underscoring the continued strength of out-of-room revenue while comparable hotel RevPAR declined 1.2%. First quarter RevPAR faced headwinds from tough year-over-year comparisons, particularly in Maui. The year-over-year decline in Maui RevPAR had an actual drag of 170 basis points on our first quarter portfolio RevPAR.', 'However, this understates the true impact of the wildfires as we would have expected Maui to contribute 140 basis points to portfolio RevPAR growth in the first quarter given the renovation disruption at Fairmont Kea Lani in 2023. As a result, the total estimated impact of the wildfires on first quarter RevPAR is 310 basis points. RevPAR was also impacted by unseasonable weather in Florida, Arizona and California unanticipated renovation delays at the Singer oceanfront resort. Despite these headwinds, our first quarter comparable hotel EBITDA margin of 31.2% and was 30 basis points above 2019. As a reminder, our first quarter operational results discussed today refer to our comparable hotel portfolio, which excludes The Ritz-Carlton, Naples in 2024.', 'In addition, while Alila Ventana Big Sur is included in our first quarter results, it is currently closed and it has been removed from our comparable hotel set for the remainder of the year after a portion of Highway 1 collapse in late March. At this time, we expect the resort to reopen towards the end of the second quarter. During the first quarter, our portfolio results continued to be impacted by the evolving nature of demand on Maui. Our risk management team has reached an agreement with our insurance carriers and we are now including between $18 million and $22 million of business interruption proceeds related to the Maui wildfires and our full year 2024 guidance. Turning to business mix. It is worth noting that this quarter, we are referring to revenue growth for our business mix segment as revenue per available room as a result of the leap year.', 'Group revenue per available room grew 4% in the first quarter, driven by room nights. Our properties booked over 500,000 group room nights in the year for the year bringing our definite group room nights on the books for 2024 to $3.6 million, with total group revenue pace up 7% compared to the same time last year. In the first quarter, business transient revenue per available room grew 5%, driven by both rate and room nights and leisure remained steady with transient rates at our comparable resorts up 52% compared to 2019, including our 3 Maui resorts. Briefly touching on out-of-room spend. Food and beverage revenue per available room grew 2% in the first quarter compared to last year, driven by an all-time high banquet and catering contribution.', 'Other revenue per available room grew 6%, driven by elevated attrition and cancellation fees. It is worth noting that nearly 40% of our total revenue in 2023 came from food and beverage and other revenue and our 2024 guidance assumes a similar proportion. Since 2017, non-room revenue has steadily grown as our portfolio has shifted towards more complex, higher-end properties, which benefit from substantial out-of-room spend from both guests and non guests. In fact, there may be instances that the property teams at our hotels strategically forgo [indiscernible] room rate as they focus on the total revenue picture. The Ritz-Carlton, Naples is a clear example of the positive impact out-of-room spending. In the first quarter, the resort achieved RevPAR of $900, which is only half of its $1,700 total RevPAR.', ""As a result of our meaningful expansion and transformational renovation, transient rates in the quarter were up 40% compared to 2019 driven by club level rooms and food and beverage revenue grew 38%, driven by outlets. In March, the resort posted its best revenue month ever, aided by Easter week's RevPAR, which was 45% above the competitive set. In addition, the resort was recently named to Travel and Leisure's It List, and we are proud to say that it truly is firing on all cylinders. Turning to capital allocation. Yesterday, we announced the acquisition of the fee simple interest in a 2-hotel complex comprising the 215 room, 1 Hotel Nashville, in the 506 room Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown were approximately $530 million in cash."", 'The acquisition price represents a 12.6x EBITDA multiple or a cap rate of approximately 7.4% on 2024 estimated results. The properties are each expected to rank among our top 25 assets based on estimated full year 2024 results, with an expected combined RevPAR of $275, RevPAR of $435 and EBITDA per key of $58,550, further improving the quality of our portfolio. The newly built LEED silver complex opened in 2022, and stands directly across from the 2.1 million square foot music city convention center adjacent to the Bridgestone Arena, which is home of the NHL Nashville Predators, and within a 10-minute drive of Nissan Stadium, the Country Music Hall of Fame Museum, Vanderbilt University, Tennessee State University and Centennial Park. It sits on 1.2 fee simple acres in Nashville, Spain Lower Broadway Entertainment District.', 'The 2 hotel complex has a combined 721 oversized rooms that average approximately 500 square feet with a 75% suite mix. The properties offer 7 separate food and beverage outlets, including [indiscernible] rooftop at the 1 Hotel, which provides guests with exclusive views of Music City skyline in an elevated night life setting. Other amenities include a spa, 2 fitness centers, a yoga studio and 33,000 square feet of shared meeting space. From 2000 to 2023, the Nashville hotel market had a RevPAR CAGR of 7.7%, even while absorbing new supply. It is the #2 ranked convention destination in the United States and the convention center has continued to set record attendance numbers by attracting larger events with promising definite bookings in future years.', 'The new Nissan Stadium, home of the NFL Tennessee Titans, is also expected to generate increased demand as the stadium zone attracts more entertainment and sporting events with year-round activation. In addition, Nashville has the fastest-growing airport in the United States with current passenger traffic 33% above 2019. The recent $1.5 billion airport expansion added 6 international gates and 8 satellite gates. And another $1.5 billion expansion is already underway, with expected completion in 2028. While supply growth is expected to continue in Nashville, most projects are in the planning stages and in the select service chain scale. We believe the 1 Hotel Nashville and the Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown are highly differentiated from the future supply due to their central location and diversified product offerings, which provide distinct value propositions to customers and guests.', 'With multiple demand generators and no expected near-term capital expenditure requirements, we believe the combined properties will stabilize at approximately 10 to 12x EBITDA in the 2026 to 2028 time frame, driving additional value creation for our portfolio. Due to the timing of the acquisition, the 1 Hotel Nashville and the Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown are not yet included in our comparable hotel guidance metrics, but will be included starting in the second quarter. The acquisition is expected to generate $29 million of adjusted EBITDA for our ownership period, which is included in our adjusted EBITDAre and FFO guidance for 2024. Looking back on our transaction activity. We have acquired $4 billion of assets since 2018 at a 13.5x EBITDA multiple and disposed off $5 billion of assets at a 17x EBITDA multiple including $976 million of estimated foregone capital expenditures.', 'This accretive capital recycling has allowed us to grow our adjusted EBITDAre and dividend in excess of full year 2019 levels as we continue on the path towards $2 billion of adjusted EBITDAre. As we have demonstrated, we believe Host is well positioned to continue capitalizing on value-enhancing acquisition opportunities. After adjusting for post-quarter transactions, we have $1.7 billion of total available liquidity and net leverage of 2.3x, and we will continue using our size, scale and relationships to uncover more acquisition opportunities. Turning to portfolio reinvestment. Our 2024 capital expenditure guidance range remains $500 million to $605 million, which reflects approximately $225 million to $280 million of investment for redevelopment, repositioning and ROI projects.', 'During the first quarter, we started the Hyatt Transformational Capital program renovations at the Grand Hyatt, Atlanta and the Grand Hyatt, Washington, which we expect to complete in the first half of 2025. We received $2 million of operating guarantees in the first quarter to offset business disruptions related to the Hyatt Transformational Capital program and we expect to benefit from an additional $7 million in 2024. More broadly, we have completed 24 transformational renovations since 2018, which we believe provide meaningful tailwinds for our portfolio. Of the 12 hotels that have stabilized post renovation operations to date, the average RevPAR index share gain is 8.5 points, which is well in excess of our targeted gain of 3 to 5 points.', 'Wrapping up, we believe Host is well positioned to continue to outperform. Our successful capital allocation strategy has allowed us to deliver 2023 adjusted EBITDAre and adjusted FFO per share above 2019 levels, outperforming the other full-service lodging REITs. We are encouraged by the supply picture for our markets and chain scales, which remains below historical levels. The improving international demand imbalance, the continued improvement in business transient demand and increased activity in the transactions market. We believe our EBITDA growth profile, our investment-grade balance sheet, our diversified portfolio and our continued portfolio reinvestment are key differentiators. As we have demonstrated, Host can and will continue to do it all.', 'With that, I will now turn the call over to Sourav to discuss additional operational detail and our revised 2024 outlook.', ""Sourav Ghosh: Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Building on Jim's comments, I will go into detail on our first quarter operations, updated 2024 guidance and our balance sheet. Starting with business mix. Overall transient revenue per available room was down 6% compared to the first quarter of 2023, driven by tough comparisons, including the evolving nature of demand in Maui, unseasonable weather in many markets and unanticipated renovation delays at the Singer Oceanfront Resort. Combined, we estimate that the renovation delay and Maui had a 440 basis point impact to transient RevPAR in the quarter. However, leisure rate is still strong. Transient rates at our resorts remained resilient at 52% above the first quarter of 2019 and resort food and beverage outlet revenue per occupied room grew over last year."", 'Gulf revenue continued to grow the record levels set in the first quarter of the last 2 years despite the impact from our Maui golf courses. Looking ahead to holidays in the second quarter, for Memorial Day weekend, transient room revenue pace for the overall portfolio is up over last year and up high single digits, excluding Maui. We are still outside the primary booking window for July 4, but thus far, we are encouraged by strong bookings in San Diego, Houston and New York. Business transient revenue per available room was 5% above the first quarter of 2023 driven by an increase in rate and room nights as business transient demand continued its slow and steady recovery. Seattle, Boston, and San Francisco led room night growth, and both New York and Boston are within 2% of pre-pandemic demand.', 'Turning to group. Revenue per available room was up 4% in the first quarter, driven by room night growth in San Diego, San Francisco, Orlando and Maui. Notably, group room night volume reached 96% of the first quarter of 2019 levels, led by corporate and SMERF groups. For full year 2024, we have 3.6 million definite group room nights on the books, representing a 17% increase since the fourth quarter and putting us ahead of same time last year. Group rate on the books is up 4%, and total group revenue pace is up 7% over the same time last year. As Jim mentioned, our banquet and catering contribution per group room night in the first quarter was at an all-time high, coming in approximately 1% above the prior record set in the first quarter of 2023.', 'We continue to be encouraged by the ongoing strength of group business as evidenced by strong pace, lingering booking windows and double-digit citywide room night pace in key markets such as Nashville, New Orleans, San Antonio, Seattle and Washington, D.C. Shifting gears to margins. As expected, margin declines year-over-year were driven by increases in wages, benefits and fixed expenses as well as impacts from Maui. Despite these headwinds, our comparable hotel EBITDA margin was 31.2% in the first quarter, representing a 30 basis point increase over 2019 as a result of our continued efforts to redefine the operating model. We expect year-over-year margin comparisons to improve as the year progresses. Turning to our revised outlook for 2024.', 'The midpoint of our guidance continues to contemplate steady demand in travel and low supply growth. Our expectations for the year are driven by improvements in group business, a gradual recovery in business transient, softer short-term leisure transient demand and a continued evolution of demand on Maui as the island recovers from the recent wildfires. At the low end, we have assumed slow group pickup and softer leisure transient demand. And at the high end, we have assumed a faster recovery at our Maui resorts and increased group pickup. For full year 2024, we anticipate comparable hotel RevPAR growth of between 2% and 4% over 2023. We expect comparable hotel EBITDA margins to be down 80 basis points year-over-year at the low end of our guidance to down 30 basis points at the high end.', 'Notably, we expect comparable hotel EBITDA margins to be up 10 basis points at the midpoint versus 2019 despite an estimated 20 basis point margin impact from Maui. At the midpoint of our guidance range, we anticipate comparable hotel total RevPAR growth of 3.7% and comparable hotel RevPAR growth of 3% compared to 2023. This 100 basis point reduction in our RevPAR growth midpoint is driven by lower-than-expected first quarter results, underperformance in Maui and softer-than-expected short-term leisure transient demand. That said, the strength of out-of-room revenues allowed for total RevPAR to decline only 60 basis points relative to our prior midpoint. We expect a comparable hotel EBITDA margin midpoint of 29.6%, which has improved 30 basis points from our initial guidance and is now only 50 basis points below 2023.', 'We estimate the Maui wildfires will impact full year comparable hotel TRevPAR by 90 basis points, RevPAR by 130 basis points and comparable hotel EBITDA margin by 20 basis points. We also expect a 50 basis point impact from property taxes and insurance. In terms of RevPAR growth cadence for the year, we expect comparable hotel RevPAR growth to be flat to low single digits in the first half of the year based on the drivers I just mentioned. We continue to expect mid-single-digit comparable hotel RevPAR growth in the second half of the year as a result of strong group booking pace, less renovation disruption compared to the second half of 2023, and the diminishing year-over-year impacts of the Maui wildfires, which occurred in August of 2023.', 'Our revised 2024 full year adjusted EBITDAre midpoint is $1.670 billion, a $35 million or 2% increase over the prior quarter. This includes an expected additional $8 million from business interruption proceeds related to Hurricane Ian, $20 million of business interruption proceeds related to the Maui wildfires, an estimated $62 million contribution from operations at The Ritz-Carlton, Naples, which is up from $60 million in our prior guidance and $6 million from operations at Alila Ventana Big Sur, a decline of $10 million compared to our prior guidance. As a reminder, Ritz-Carlton Naples and Alila Ventana Big Sur are excluded from our comparable hotel set for the full year 2024 forecast. Our adjusted EBITDA and FFO guidance also includes an estimated $29 million contribution from the 1 Hotel Nashville and Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville downtown.', ""Turning to our balance sheet and liquidity position. Our weighted average maturity is 4.3 years at a weighted average interest rate of 4.7% after repaying the $400 million Series G senior notes in April. As Jim noted, we currently have $1.7 billion in total available liquidity, which includes $231 million of FF&E reserves. Our quarter end leverage ratio adjusted for post-quarter transactions was 2.3x, and we have $1.3 billion of availability on our credit facility. Also, since our last call, Moody's upgraded the company's issuer outlook from stable to positive. Further, in April, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per share demonstrating our commitment to returning capital stockholders. As always, future dividends are subject to approval by the company's Board of Directors."", 'We will continue to be strategic and opportunistic in managing our balance sheet and liquidity position as we move through the remainder of 2024. To conclude, we believe our best-in-class portfolio and balance sheet uniquely position Host to capitalize on opportunities for growth in the future. With that, we would be happy to take your questions.

Emerging from the dotcom boom and bust without permanent damage, the economy has faced the financial meltdown of 2008, a tech-enabled boom that has resulted in trillion dollar valuations, and the pandemic crisis of 2020 that ground business to almost a complete halt across the globe. From 2003 to 2023, the benchmark S&P 500 has registered double digits annual returns thirteen times.', 'Investors at the stock market have made money from this growth by piling into profitable stocks like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). However, even as these tech stocks become the hottest equities, old-school value investing has yet to lose charm. Value investors who like to invest in profitable companies with high gross margins and net income have made shrewd investments in businesses with a solid track record over these twenty years. For example instead of NVDA, we identified the cheapest AI stock that is trading at less than 5 times market value excluding cash and investments using the value investing approach.', 'The present condition of the stock market is better understood in the context of a recent research report by investment advisory Deutsche Bank. The report underlines that the seven biggest companies in the S&P 500 now have a combined market capitalization that make these firms the second biggest stock market in the world, almost double the size of the Japanese market that is in fourth position. Jim Reid, the head of global economics and thematic research at the advisory, has warned that this makes the US market most concentrated in history.\xa0', 'The fortunes of these firms are set to rise even further as AI hype and rate cut expectations serve to increase interest in growth stocks. Businesses are investing heavily in AI tools to keep pace with industry demand in this regard. Satya Nadella, the CEO of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), recently highlighted the role that he expected AI to play in changing work trends in the coming years and months. He made these comments during the second quarter earnings call at the end of January.\xa0', ""“A growing body of evidence makes clear the role AI will play in transforming work. Our own research, as well as external studies, show as much as 70% improvement in productivity, using generative AI for specific work tasks, and overall early Copilot for Microsoft 365 users were 29% faster in the series of tasks, like searching, writing, and summarizing. Two months in, we have seen faster adoption than either our E3 or E5 suites as enterprises, like Dentsu, Honda, Pfizer, all deploy Copilot to their employees, and we are expanding availability to organizations of all sizes. We're also seeing a Copilot ecosystem begin to emerge ISVs like Atlassian, Mural, and Trello, as well as customers like Air India, Bayer, and Siemens have all built plug-ins for specific lines of business that extend Copilot's capabilities.”"", 'Our Methodology', 'To select stocks for this list, we used the FinViz stock screener to identify companies with high gross margins and net income.

Emerging from the dotcom boom and bust without permanent damage, the economy has faced the financial meltdown of 2008, a tech-enabled boom that has resulted in trillion dollar valuations, and the pandemic crisis of 2020 that ground business to almost a complete halt across the globe. From 2003 to 2023, the benchmark S&P 500 has registered double digits annual returns thirteen times.', 'Investors at the stock market have made money from this growth by piling into profitable stocks like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). However, even as these tech stocks become the hottest equities, old-school value investing has yet to lose charm. Value investors who like to invest in profitable companies with high gross margins and net income have made shrewd investments in businesses with a solid track record over these twenty years. For example instead of NVDA, we identified the cheapest AI stock that is trading at less than 5 times market value excluding cash and investments using the value investing approach.', 'The present condition of the stock market is better understood in the context of a recent research report by investment advisory Deutsche Bank. The report underlines that the seven biggest companies in the S&P 500 now have a combined market capitalization that make these firms the second biggest stock market in the world, almost double the size of the Japanese market that is in fourth position. Jim Reid, the head of global economics and thematic research at the advisory, has warned that this makes the US market most concentrated in history.\xa0', 'The fortunes of these firms are set to rise even further as AI hype and rate cut expectations serve to increase interest in growth stocks. Businesses are investing heavily in AI tools to keep pace with industry demand in this regard. Satya Nadella, the CEO of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), recently highlighted the role that he expected AI to play in changing work trends in the coming years and months. He made these comments during the second quarter earnings call at the end of January.\xa0', ""“A growing body of evidence makes clear the role AI will play in transforming work. Our own research, as well as external studies, show as much as 70% improvement in productivity, using generative AI for specific work tasks, and overall early Copilot for Microsoft 365 users were 29% faster in the series of tasks, like searching, writing, and summarizing. Two months in, we have seen faster adoption than either our E3 or E5 suites as enterprises, like Dentsu, Honda, Pfizer, all deploy Copilot to their employees, and we are expanding availability to organizations of all sizes. We're also seeing a Copilot ecosystem begin to emerge ISVs like Atlassian, Mural, and Trello, as well as customers like Air India, Bayer, and Siemens have all built plug-ins for specific lines of business that extend Copilot's capabilities.”"", 'Our Methodology', 'To select stocks for this list, we used the FinViz stock screener to identify companies with high gross margins and net income.

Results reflected better-than-anticipated revenues, backed by a rise in the base rent per square foot and occupancy levels as well as lower property operating expenses.

Operationally, we had a strong start to the year, demonstrating our ability to execute despite some headwinds. Touching on a few highlights. New business bookings reached almost $13 billion, reflecting the continued demand for our industry-leading product portfolio. First quarter revenue was just under $5 billion, representing adjusted year-over-year growth of 2%, impacted by continued slowing of electric vehicle production in North America and Europe production and increased labor inflation and earnings per share increased 27% to $1.16. Lastly, we repurchased $600 million of stock during the quarter... Hello. Apologies we seem to have had a technical difficulty."", ""So if it's okay, I'll start from the beginning. So again, thanks, Jane, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. Let's begin on Slide 3. Operationally, we had a strong start to the year, demonstrating our ability to execute despite some headwinds. Starting on a few highlights. New business bookings reached almost $13 billion, reflecting the continued demand for our industry-leading product portfolio. First quarter revenue was just under $5 billion, representing adjusted year-over-year growth of 2%, impacted by continued slowing of electrical vehicle production in both North America and Europe. EBITDA and operating income totaled $720 million and $544 million, respectively, representing more than 20% growth and roughly 200 basis points of margin expansion, reflecting benefits from productivity initiatives and cost actions, which offset lower vehicle production and increased labor inflation."", ""And earnings per share increased 27% to $1.16. Lastly, we repurchased $600 million of stock during the quarter, bringing the total amount of shares repurchased to $900 million over the last 2 quarters. In summary, the team did an exceptional job delivering solutions to our customers, while at the same time, increasing operating efficiencies and reducing our cost structure. Turning to Slide 4. While we are encouraged by our strong first quarter execution, we believe that it's prudent to update our 2024 outlook to reflect the continued weakness in electric vehicle production, including significant customer schedule reductions over the past few weeks and the current negative impact of foreign exchange rates. As a result, we're lowering our full year 2024 revenue guidance by $450 million, principally reflecting a reduction in our outlook for high-voltage revenue growth."", ""While we continue to believe that all regions are on the path to full electrification, some will move faster than others, so we consider it prudent to reduce our near-term revenue expectations. As the industry navigates the current headwinds, we're maintaining our high standard of flawless execution, while continuing to reduce our cost structure and strengthen our sustainable business model. We're supporting our customers on a record number of new program launches, almost 2,300 in 2024, including over 750 program launches in the first quarter, the cadence of which gives us confidence in the acceleration of our second half revenue growth. We've also proactively executed initiatives that have lowered our cost structure. In early '23, we launched several initiatives to improve engineering efficiency in both our ASUX and SPS segments."", ""And in late 2023, we executed additional cost actions across all overhead and operating functions, targeting more than a 10% reduction in salary payroll. And in response to the recent softness of electric vehicle production schedules, we kicked off incremental cost actions that will generate an additional $50 million of cost savings through the balance of this year. The net result of these puts and takes is a $50 million reduction in our full year outlook for operating income to $2.5 billion, above the bottom end of our prior guidance range, representing 11.8% operating margin and just under 80% growth in operating income. I'm pleased to announce that we've reached a formal agreement with the Hyundai Motor Group regarding our Motional joint venture, which positions Motional for ongoing success while addressing the needs of both joint venture partners."", ""Joe will go into more detail later in the presentation. Lastly, we continue to believe that our stock is undervalued and presents an attractive opportunity to return capital to shareholders. As such, we're doubling our share repurchase target from $750 million to $1.5 billion during 2024. In summary, our conviction regarding the strength of our competitive position and the long-term value of our business is as high as ever, and we remain committed to delivering value to our shareholders. Moving to Slide 5. As mentioned, bookings reached nearly $13 billion in the quarter. Advanced safety and user experience bookings totaled $2.5 billion, driven by active safety bookings of $1.9 billion, including our first full system Gen 6 ADAS award, including in-cabin sensing and the full suite of Wind River Embedded and Studio developer software with an emerging EV player, bringing the cumulative active safety and user experience segment awards to $33 billion since the first quarter of 2021."", 'Signal and Power Solutions new business bookings reached a record of over $10.3 billion, reflecting electrical distribution systems bookings totaling a record $7 billion including an award from a leading global Japanese OEM for both plug-in hybrids and battery electric vehicles for the North American market and connection systems bookings totaling $2.5 billion including an award from a leading electric vehicle OEM for high-speed cable assemblies on a global electric vehicle platform, bringing cumulative S and PS segment bookings to $70 billion since the first quarter of 2021. In China, across both segments, we were awarded $3 billion in new business awards with both local and multinational OEMs including a vehicle architecture work from a leading local Chinese OEM for a low-cost battery electric vehicle, putting us on track to exceed our full year 2023 bookings of just under $6 billion.', ""With our industry-leading portfolio, our global scale and our ability to execute highly complex programs, we remain confident in achieving our target of $35 billion of business awards during 2024. Turning to Slide 6 to review our Advanced Safety and User Experience segment's first quarter highlights. The segment reported 5% growth driven by 24% growth in active safety, which is on track for 20% full year revenue growth, more than offsetting the challenging comparables for user experience in Wind River in the quarter. Solid revenue growth was coupled with ongoing productivity improvements, including the continued maturation of our global product organization, driving higher levels of platform usage and software reuse. The consolidation of engineering centers and the continued rotation of engineering resources to our tech center in Bangalore, India, which is driving our percentage located in best cost countries to over 75%."", ""The ongoing adoption of Wind River Studio, which is resulting in a roughly 40% improvement in workflow performance in the software building and scanning processes. And lastly, the continued progress we've made validating local Chinese semiconductor suppliers to meet the increasing demand from local Chinese OEMs for localized sources of supply and provide global OEMs with increased supply chain flexibility and resiliency at significantly lower costs. In terms of commercial highlights in the quarter, in addition to the Gen 6 ADAS award I mentioned earlier, we're awarded a radar program by a global Japanese OEM for applications across multiple vehicle platforms in the North American, European and Asia Pacific markets. And Wind River Studio developer was selected by a major local Chinese OEM to help increase efficiency and reduce costs associated with the development, deployment, operations and servicing of the intelligent edge systems."", ""Moving to Slide 7. As I mentioned earlier, an emerging electric vehicle OEM has selected the Aptiv Gen 6 ADAS platform to enable turnkey ADAS across a wide range of platforms and models with the start of production in 2026. This is our first full system productized Gen 6 ADAS platform award, building on Aptiv's proven hands-free highway full system solutions, which are already in production. This open modular and scalable ADAS platform will enable advanced hands-free urban and highway vehicle automation, driver safety and region-specific features, including fully integrated sensors, tightly coupled with Aptiv's edge to cloud compute framework. A containerized feature stack enabled by Aptiv's AI/ML enhanced solutions, including radar machine learning and ML-based vehicle behavior."", ""And Wind River's extensive offerings such as Wind River Edge with VxWorks and Wind River Studio develop, deploy and operate the software over the life of the program. This award is a testament to our ability to deliver a full system, productized solution to our customers while validating the value of our Gen 6 ADAS platform, which includes flexibility across key layers of the staff to meet our customers' needs, scalability of hardware and software components from entry-level compliance up to Level 3 and industry lead performance at a very competitive cost.

We continue to benefit from our industry-leading portfolio, global scale and experience designing and developing optimized vehicle architecture solutions across the entire range of powertrain platforms from the internal combustion engine to battery electric vehicles."", 'First quarter revenues increased 1%, driven by strong growth in China, partly offset by a decline in high voltage revenues, the result of the softening production schedule for electric vehicle platforms in both North America and Europe that I mentioned earlier. New business bookings during the quarter totaled over $10 billion. We continue to gain traction with top OEMs in China. During the quarter, electrical architecture bookings with China local OEMs reached more than $1 billion, including major awards across each of the 5 top local OEMs. And we received our first high-voltage integrated Power Electronics award for a DC-to-DC converters from a global EV manufacturer for its next-gen vehicle platform. As discussed previously, our Signal and Power Solutions segment continues to be impacted by increased labor inflation.', 'To mitigate the impact, the operating team has initiated several actions including the further consolidation of our manufacturing footprint, while rotating more of our footprint to Central America and North Africa and modifying vehicle architecture design to enable the increased automation of select manufacturing processes with a target to increase automation to 30% of standard labor hours by 2026 and over 50% by 2030. Moving to Slide 9, and our OEM partners adapt to the shifting pace of consumer electric vehicle demand and emission requirements. Aptiv is positioned to deliver high-performance, cost-effective solutions that span the powertrain spectrum and adapt our capacity to align with the needs of our customers. Starting on the left of the slide.', ""As we've discussed previously, we're benefiting from significant and increasing addressable content per vehicle from approximately 800 in electrical architecture content for an internal combustion engine platform to approximately 2,300 for a full battery electric vehicle. In many cases, this incremental content represents an opportunity to apply existing capabilities to a much larger addressable market. Although global penetration rates for hybrids and battery electric vehicles may fluctuate in the near-term, we firmly believe that the long-term macro tailwind remains attractive as the industry continues down path to full electrification. That said, we've taken a more conservative approach to the pace of electrification. And while we will continue to be more conservative than the broader market sentiment, our outlook still represents a significant market opportunity with meaningful future upside."", ""Finally, on the right side of the slide, the strength of our current portfolio across regions, powertrains and platforms significantly insulates the business from any single industry headwind. To illustrate this point, if we were to assume that growth of all electrified vehicle platforms on which we have content was reduced to zero in 2024, including low-voltage solutions on battery electric vehicles, with no substitution from ICE vehicle platforms, our overall growth rate would decline by 1 to 2 points. As a result, we believe that we're uniquely positioned to deliver innovative solutions to our customers and value to our shareholders across all powertrain platforms. Moving to Slide 10. Before I turn the call over to Joe to walk through the financials, I wanted to touch on 2 recent customer events."", 'In late February, the Wind River and Aptiv teams exhibited at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, giving us the opportunity to collaborate with a wide range of telco customers and partners. The team showcased our ability to support operations at scale for 5G V-RAN and O-RAN deployments while highlighting solutions being leveraged by our customers to improve performance and reliability, reduce costs and unlock new business models. Among the many years of interest to our telco customers was our unique ability to support the convergence of telco infrastructure with a software-defined vehicle, enabling the deployment and update of new services much faster and much more efficiently. Last week, we took the opportunity to further strengthen our strategic partnerships in China during the 2024 Beijing Auto Show.', ""Led by our local China management team, we engaged with a wide range of customers to discuss key technology trends, consumer expectations and performance and cost requirements that are unique to the China market. Local OEMs are demanding full system solutions, spanning both hardware and software, while consumer interest is accelerating for higher levels of ADAS and enhanced user experience. Aptiv is perfectly positioned in this market to deliver solutions with increased flexibility, higher performance and faster speed to market, all at a much lower cost. While we have active engagements with customers across all regions and end markets, and it's important to note that all are essentially asking for the same thing: The right hardware, the right software and the right engineering tool chain to support software-defined functionality for mission-critical applications."", ""And as a result, our unique edge-to-cloud portfolio positions Aptiv to capitalize not only on the automotive industry's transition to software-defined vehicles, but also on the digital transformation and convergence of multiple industries as intelligence increasingly moves to the edge. By leveraging these proven solutions across industries, Aptiv is positioned for sustained long-term profitable growth. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Joe."", 'Joseph Massaro: Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Starting with the first quarter on Slide 11. Aptiv delivered strong financial results in the quarter, reflecting robust execution across both segments and continued progress on our cost savings and margin improvement actions, resulting in operating margin improvement of 200 basis points over the prior year. Revenues were $4.9 billion, up 2% or 3% above underlying global vehicle production, which was down 1% in the quarter. Growth was negatively impacted by the continued slowing of battery electrical platforms in the quarter, particularly in North America and Europe, where we saw our high-voltage revenue down 2% and 6%, respectively. Revenues on ICE platforms and high-voltage solutions on hybrids were up 2% and 26%, respectively.', 'As I will discuss shortly, given the continued weakness in electric vehicle production, including significant customer schedule reductions over the past few weeks, we are revising downward our 2024 outlook for the year. Adjusted EBITDA and operating income were $720 million and $544 million, respectively. Operating income margin expanded 200 basis points versus prior year, in part driven by cost reduction and recovery programs put in place in 2023, as well as continued achievement of our operating performance initiatives, including the continued rotation of our engineering footprint to best cost locations. The year-over-year FX and commodity impacts were negligible. Earnings per share in the quarter were $1.16 and increased 27% from the prior year, including year-over-year earnings growth of 24%, partially offset by higher tax expense.', 'And share repurchases completed in 2023 in the first quarter of 2024 added approximately $0.03 to EPS in the quarter. Operating cash flow was strong, totaling $244 million. Capital expenditures were $265 million, and share repurchases totaled $600 million. Looking at first quarter revenues on Slide 12. As noted, revenue of $4.9 billion was up 2%. Revenue growth was driven by strong active safety growth as well as growth in commercial vehicle and engineered components partially offset by lower high-voltage revenue. Net price and commodities were positive to the top line, partially offset by foreign exchange. Moving to the right. Revenues outgrew vehicle production in all regions. North American revenues were up 2% or 1% above market, driven by increases in active safety and engineered components, partially offset by lower high voltage.', 'In Europe, revenues were down 1% year-over-year or 2 points above vehicle production with lower EV production in the region, partially offset by double-digit growth in active safety. And in China, revenues grew 5 points over market driven by growth with several key local OEMs. Moving to the ASUX segment on the next slide. Revenue growth was 5% or 6% above global vehicle production. Active safety was up 24% in the quarter, benefiting from new program launches as well as continued strong demand across all regions. User experience was down 8% in the quarter, primarily driven by the roll-off of the legacy program in North America and lower multinational JV volumes in China as discussed during our year-end earnings call. Wind River revenue decreased 16% in the quarter due to a strong year-over-year comparison.', 'As we have discussed, Wind River revenues are lumpy on quarterly basis. For the full year, we expect mid-teens revenue growth at Wind River. Segment adjusted operating income in the quarter was $155 million, up significantly over prior year driven by cost reductions taken in the second half of 2023 as well as ongoing performance initiatives, including continued rotation of our footprint. Operating income margin in the quarter was 10.8%. Turning to Signal and Power on Slide 14. Revenue in the first quarter was approximately $3.5 billion, an increase of 1% or 2% above vehicle production driven by growth in engineered components of 3%, declines in high-voltage revenue on BEVs were partially offset by growth in hybrids, which make up approximately 25% of our high-voltage product line revenues.', 'And China revenues were up 11% as we saw SPS growth of approximately 30% with local OEMs, while we saw growth of 2% with foreign OEMs. Segment adjusted operating income was $389 million or 11.2%, up 40 basis points over prior year as our cost savings and operating performance initiatives significantly reduced the impact of higher labor costs. Net price and commodities were positive. And on a year-over-year basis, the OI impact of foreign exchange was minimal. Moving to Slide 15 and our updated macro outlook. As Kevin mentioned, over the past several years -- over the past several weeks, we have seen both legacy OEMs as well as global EV OEMs, lower production schedules primarily in North America and Europe. These reductions are partially offset by select increase in ICE platforms, particularly in North America.', 'As a result, we estimate global vehicle production to be down 1% for the year from a prior forecast of flat. Our outlook for revenue growth is now 5% for the year versus our prior outlook of 7%, reflecting growth over market of 6%. As for our key FX and commodity rates for the remainder of the year, we are now assuming copper at $4.35, Mexican peso at MXN 17 to the dollar and the Chinese RMB at 7.15. Slide 16 has our updated full year outlook. As discussed, our Q1 operating results were substantially in line with our expectations, including the benefit of our cost savings and performance actions. However, as we look at the balance of the year, we do see several likely and persistent headwinds that have caused us to revise and derisk our full year outlook.', ""The revised outlook includes revenues of $21.15 billion, down from the prior midpoint of $21.6 billion, running adjusted revenue growth of 5%. The lower revenues resulted from the previously mentioned customer schedule reductions as well as an additional reduction to our H2 revenue growth based on current market conditions. As a result, first half revenue growth has been lower to 2% from our prior outlook of 4% and second half growth is now 8%, down from over 9%. Operating income of $2.5 billion or 11.8% of revenues, down $50 million from the prior midpoint. We are increasing our EPS estimate to $6.05 a share at the midpoint as the negative impact of the reduction in earnings is more than offset by the benefit of our share repurchase activity as well as the benefit of previously mentioned Motional transactions, which I'll cover in more detail in a moment."", 'We have increased our outlook for operating cash flow, primarily reflecting improved working capital. And we are now targeting share repurchases of $1.5 billion in 2024, up from our prior guidance of $750 million. Moving to the next slide, we lay out the more significant changes to our outlook. With respect to revenue, global vehicle production decreasing from a previous outlook of flat to now down 1%, reduction of our full year high-voltage revenue growth from 20% to 5%, the decrease in high voltage is partially offset by increases in ICE production schedules, primarily in North America as well as increases in net price and commodities, reflecting higher copper prices that offset the foreign exchange impact on revenues. The decrease in operating income is driven by the flow-through of lower revenues as well as the negative impact foreign exchange, primarily the peso and RMB.', 'As it relates to the Mexican peso, although many forecasts expect the peso to weaken over the course of the year, the peso has remained stronger than our initial expectations. Accordingly, we have updated our guidance to reflect an exchange rate of MXN 17 to the dollar. This is more in line with our spot level and also represents the level at which we have hedged approximately 90% of our 2024 peso exposure. And finally, despite the macro headwinds, we fully expect the benefits of the cost savings and performance actions we delivered in the first quarter to continue, partially mitigating the volume and foreign exchange impact. Turning to the next slide. We thought it would be helpful to walk our expected first half versus second half revenues in 2024.', 'Second half revenue is expected to increase approximately $800 million. The increases in both segments are driven by new program launches with key customers in all regions. ASUX half-over-half revenue is expected to increase approximately $200 million with over half of the increase coming from the launch of one of our largest active safety programs across additional platforms in North America and Europe for a global OEM. These additional platforms are internal combustion vehicles and represent several of the OEMs best-selling platforms. Approximately 40% of the launch volume is with local Chinese OEMs, including several launches that have already commenced. The increase in Signal and Power of $500 million includes a launch totaling over $100 million in a large North American internal combustion SUV platform, an additional $100 million across 2 OEMs for new internal combustion truck launches in North America and Chinese market launches and volume growth for both local and foreign OEMs of over $100 million.', ""The increase in sales will deliver margins higher in the second half with volume flow-through of approximately 30%, partially offset by incremental FX headwind of approximately $35 million due primarily to the peso. Moving to the next slide. As Kevin noted, we are excited to announce that we have reached a definitive agreement with Hyundai that provides for the future success of Motional while meeting the needs of the joint venture partners. As part of the agreement, Hyundai will provide Motional additional funding of $475 million. Hyundai will acquire 11% of Motional's common equity held by Aptiv for $448 million, and Aptiv will convert approximately 21% of our common equity interest to a preferred stockholding. Hyundai's funding to Motional will occur in the second quarter and we expect the acquisition of Aptiv shares, which is subject to customary regulatory review to close by the third quarter."", ""The preferred stock conversion will coincide with the sale of our common equity to Hyundai. Our updated guidance includes approximately $0.30 of additional EPS, reflecting the benefit of the lower Motional common equity holdings beginning in the fourth quarter of this year. On a full year pro forma basis, the lower dilution for Motional will result in incremental EPS of approximately $0.90 per share beginning in 2025. Before handing the call back to Kevin, I'd like to walk through our updated earnings per share expectations in more detail. Building off a strong performance in the first quarter, the year-over-year EPS growth of 24% is driven by higher earnings of $1.32 as well as the benefit of share repurchases in 2024 and the improvement resulting from the transaction with Hyundai to reduce Aptiv's common equity holdings in Motional, more than offsetting the increase in Aptiv's tax rate, which was included in our original guidance."", ""In summary, despite the lower vehicle production levels and slowdown in high voltage, we are confident that the measures taken to improve first quarter operating income and cash flow are sustainable for the balance of the year. The earnings and cash flow growth, combined with the proceeds from the Motional transaction, provide us the opportunity to continue our long track record of balanced capital deployment, including the return of capital to our shareholders. When combined with the 2023 share repurchases, our outlook for 2024 results in almost $2 billion of capital returned to shareholders in the past 2 years, increasing total capital returned to over $9 billion since our IPO. With that, I'll turn the call back to Kevin for his closing remarks."", ""Kevin Clark: Thanks, Joe. I'll wrap up on Slide 21 before opening the line up for questions. Overall, our strategy remains unchanged, while the industry navigates the near-term headwinds. We'll continue to provide flexible, high-performance, cost-effective solutions to our customers that enable the transition to the electrified software-defined vehicle. We remain focused on thought execution and operational excellence, which enables us to delight our customers while optimizing our cost structure to expand margins and deliver value to our shareholders. We executed well in the first quarter and are laser focus on continuing to execute, which will position us well for the remainder of the year. Operator, let's now open the line for questions."", 'Operator: [Operator Instructions].

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to BJ Grant, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.', 'Bill Grant: Thank you, Katleen, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Ventas First Quarter financial results conference call. Yesterday, we issued our first quarter earnings release, supplemental investor package and presentation materials, which are available on the Ventas website at IR.ventosread.com. As a reminder, remarks today may include forward-looking statements and other matters. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and a variety of topics may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated in such statements.

And with that, I'll turn the call over to the Chairman and CEO of Ventas, Debra Cafaro."", ""Debra Cafaro: Thank you BJ. On behalf of all of my colleagues, I want to welcome our shareholders and other participants to the Ventas First Quarter 2024 earnings call. Today, I'll discuss our good start to the year, describe the actions we are taking to execute on our strategy and create value for our stakeholders and share our improved outlook for 2024 as the multi-year growth opportunity in senior housing builds. As a reminder, our three-pronged Ventas strategy is composed of first, deliver organic growth in our senior housing portfolio, second, capture value through investments focused on senior housing, and third, drive cash flow throughout our portfolio. We entered this year with momentum. And in Q1, our enterprise delivered $0.78 of normalized FFO per share and over $2 billion in annualized NOI."", ""Our strong results came from nearly 7% same-store property NOI growth, led by shop at over 15%. Notably, demand-driven occupancy gains in our shop portfolio are accelerated, fueled by favorable supply demand fundamentals in our markets and the actions we've taken in concert with our care providers. Move-ins across the portfolio were elevated as we gained 240 basis points of occupancy in our same-store shop portfolio year-over-year. As the second largest owner of senior housing, we are benefiting from the multi-year senior housing growth opportunity that continues to gain traction from both demand-led occupancy and RevPOR growth. Accelerating demand for our senior housing community underscores the valuable benefits they provide to residents and their families."", ""The over 80 population is expected to grow by 5 million individuals through 2030, yet new construction starts in senior housing are the lowest in over a decade, as is the percentage of inventory under construction. In our shop portfolio, 99% of Ventas' communities are free from competing construction starts. All of these trends combine to support a highly favorable, long-term runway for growth, in the biggest part of Ventas' business, senior housing. We also want to expand our footprint in senior housing by capturing value-creating investments in the space. On this second prong of our strategy, we are making good progress. Year-to-date, we have closed or placed under contract about $350 million of investments that meet our targets of going in yields, expected unlevered IRRs, occupancy growth potential, affordability, and pricing below replacement costs."", ""Over my career, it has been rare to see such a compelling investment environment where we can acquire attractive assets in favorable markets at high going in yields and high growth. Due to market conditions, our efforts, and our team's relationship, our pipeline of investment opportunities continues to grow, and we expect to make further progress on our investment plan in the balance of the year. Across Ventas, we are also focused on the third element of our strategy, driving cash flow throughout our portfolios. In addition to SHOP, which is now generating over $800 million in annualized NOI, there are two other areas I'd like to cover. Kindred and our outpatient medical and research business. First, respecting the Kindred lease for 23 LTACs, representing approximately 5% of our NOI."", ""The trailing rent coverage remains stable, and Kindred has projected improving revenue and expense performance trends for 2024. We continue to have active discussions with Kindred and other parties to optimize Ventas enterprise value and NOI from our properties following the April 2025 lease maturity. We and Kindred recently agreed to a one month extension for the lease renewal notice date to the end of May. We know you are keenly interested in hearing the outcome of our discussion, and we look forward to providing you with more information as soon as we can. Our competitively advantaged outpatient medical and research business continues to shine and benefit from strong institutional demands, and it's delivering complementary, compounding contributions to our enterprise."", ""As a leader in senior housing, whose portfolio is aligned around serving a large and growing aging population, Ventas is advantaged across commercial real estate because demand for our assets is strong and getting stronger. The Ventas team is focused on the opportunity for value creation right in front of us. On that point, we are pleased to improve our outlook for the full year. We are raising Ventas' 2024 normalized FFO guidance to between $3.10 and $3.18 per share, and increasing our full year 2024 total company same-store cash NOI guidance to 7% at the midpoint. And with that, I'm happy to call over to Justin."", 'Justin Hutchens: Thank you, Debbie. I am pleased to report that our SHOP portfolio performance is off to a strong start. Total SHOP same-store cash NOI growth was 15.2%. Our same-store SHOP communities delivered solid results across all key metrics, including occupancy, REVPOR and OpEx. The first quarter same-store SHOP occupancy group by 240 basis points year-to-year led by the U.S., which saw 280 basis points of occupancy gains. We have had a strong start to the year with broad-based contributions across community types, geographies, and operators. In our same-store portfolio in the U.S., move-ins were elevated at 113% versus prior year led by independent living move-ins at 127%, outperforming normal seasonal patterns. We have had nine consecutive months of tours outperforming prior year levels, contributing to the positive move-in momentum we have been experiencing.', ""REVPOR performed in line. Operating expenses were lower than expected due to continued strength in net hiring and cost efficiencies realized by our operators, leveraging insights from our Ventas OI platform. OpExPOR was 1.6%, 4.5% when adjusted for the leap year. I'm really happy that our operators are delivering excellent care and services and great results. I'd like to highlight Sunrise, [Indiscernible], Discovery, and Le Groupe Maurice in particular for their superb all-around performance to start the year. Like I said, we are experiencing broad-based contributions from our operators and we continue to leverage Ventas' OI's vast datasets and powerful analytics and insights to drive performance outcomes. Notably, our SHOP portfolio delivered double-digit, same-store cash NOI growth for the seventh quarter in a row."", 'Growth in the first quarter was led by our U.S. communities, which grew same-store cash, NOI 18%. This strong performance in the U.S. was complimented by our high-quality Canadian portfolio, which is 95% occupied, and continues to deliver a valuable and stable cash flow with 9% year-to-year growth. Given the strong start to the year, we are happy to raise our full-year guidance expectations on our same-store SHOP portfolio, which we now expect to grow 12% to 16% in NOI year-to-year. The key assumptions that drive the midpoint of our range are average occupancy growth for about 270 basis points up from 250, led by the U.S. with over 300 basis points, which is higher than we originally anticipated. We still expect REVPOR of about 5%, which puts the total revenue growth at around 8%, and OpExPOR growth is expected to be slightly lower than previously forecasted at approximately 2.5%.', ""Our total SHOP expectations were originally to add 118 million of NOI growth, and we have raised that expectation to 130 million. April occupancy is already off the strong start, driven by both tours and move-ins, volumes that are higher than prior year levels, so we're optimistic about our ongoing occupancy performance. Remember that we are just now entering the critical key selling season, so we'll have to see how that plays out. Looking forward, we are energized by the 1,000 basis points of potential occupancy upside in our markets over the course of the next few years. I'm excited about the very strong supply demand fundamentals combined with well-invested properties and excellent operators supported by our Ventas-OI platform to drive growth."", 'Moving on to investments, senior housing is now just over half of the Ventas portfolio NOI, with shop representing 40% and growing due to the exceptionally strong organic growth, and now we are expanding externally as well. We have been actively capturing value-creating external growth opportunities focused on senior housing. So far, we have closed our under contract for approximately 330 million of senior housing investments, out of which 130 million has already closed. These opportunities are exactly in our sweet spot. I am particularly excited by the unique opportunity to invest in relatively high yielding, high-quality senior housing communities coupled with outsized growth. These investments have a blended going in yield and high sevens coupled with mid-teens on levered IRRs. Additionally, we are investing in attractive discounts for replacement costs with an average cost of $241,000 per unit.', 'Our approach to executing our investment strategy is guided by our right market, right asset, right operator framework. We are investing in markets with a compelling supply demand profile, strong affordability, and meaningful expected net absorption. We prefer communities that are supported by need-driven demand and offer a combination of services, including independent living, assisted living, and memory care. These communities help us employ a strategic expansion of Ventas strengths in our active value-creating asset management playbook, driven through the Ventas-alive platform supported by our best-in-class data analytics. We are primarily expanding with existing operators with proven performance. Additionally, as part of our data-driven selection process, we welcome new operators with strong track records, with capabilities tailored to the service offering at the community, as we have more than doubled our SHOP operator pool over the past few years.', ""I'll highlight the Magnolia Springs acquisition, which includes seven communities that are 10 years old on average. They're currently 89% occupied and are located in markets projected to grow around 1,100 basis points over the next few years, supporting more significant revenue growth. The communities average 100 units each and offer a combination of assisted living and memory care services in the Indianapolis Cincinnati and Louisville market areas. Affordability on average in the markets is very strong at a projected seven times length of stay. The going-in yields projected to be low sevens and the unlevered IRR is projected to be mid-teens. The discount to replacement cost is estimated to be around 40%. The communities will be operated by [Indiscernible] who has a proven track record of delivering outstanding care services and performance."", 'Moving ahead, we plan to continue to execute on our growing pipeline of senior housing communities. We are actively evaluating many attractive opportunities. In summary, occupancy momentum is strong, and we are off to a strong start to the year. We look forward to continuing SHOP organic growth and executing on our compelling investment pipeline. Bob?', ""Robert Probst: Thanks, Justin. I'll share some highlights of our first quarter performance, provide an update on our balance sheet and capital activities and close with our increased 2024 guidance. I'll start my first quarter comments with our Outpatient Medical & Research segment, or OMAR, which reported same-store cash NOI growth of nearly 5% in the quarter. In outpatient medical, Eaton [ph] team executed 900,000 square feet of new and renewal leases in the first quarter, 50% higher than prior year. Meanwhile, the outpatient medical assets from the equitized loan portfolio increased occupancy by 300 basis points since taking ownership last year due to the effective asset and property management initiatives from the Ventas team."", 'Our university based research same-store cash NOI increased over 5% in the first quarter. with occupancy growth across the same-store portfolio. Our overall new leasing pipeline has increased by 30% to 1.4 million square feet with strong institutional and university demand for university-based life science buildings. In terms of first quarter enterprise results, we reported a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $0.04 per share. Normalized FFO per share in Q1 was strong at $0.78, representing 5% year-over-year growth. Our total company same-store cash NOI grew nearly 7%, led by SHOP, increasing 15%. Strong SHOP organic growth also drove a 20-basis-point sequential improvement in our net debt-to-EBITDA in the first quarter, further supporting our leverage trajectory was $94 million in equity raised at an average price of $44.04 to fully fund senior housing investments.', ""The SHOP growth included in the balance of the year guidance is expected to drive continuing leverage improvements in 2024. We had some notable capital markets activity so far this year. First, we extended the maturity to 2028 on our $2.75 billion revolving credit facility with improved pricing and strong oversubscription from our banking partners. We thank for their support of our platform. Second, we raised $650 million in 5-year Canadian senior notes at 5.1% in the first quarter, taking some 2025 maturing debt off the table early at attractive rates. We also used cash on hand to repay a portion of recent maturing debt, leaving us $700 million of 2024 debt maturities left to refinance this year. I'll close with our updated 2024 guidance. We improved our outlook for net income attributable to common stockholders now range from $0.03 to $0.11 per diluted share."", ""We increased the midpoint of our full year normalized FFO guidance to $3.14 per share from the previous midpoint of $3.125. The increase in our midpoint can be explained by a $0.03 per share improvement in organic SHOP NOI, partially offset by higher interest rates. We've also raised both our property NOI and same-store cash NOI year-over-year growth midpoint expectations for each of our segments. Total company same-store cash NOI is now expected to grow 7% year-over-year compared to our prior midpoint of 6.25%. We have not included any incremental investments in our outlook beyond the $350 million closed or on our contract discussed today. We're increasing our full year capital recycling proceeds to $300 million, as we enhance our portfolio and build additional sources to fund an attractive pipeline of senior housing investments."", ""Finally, we expect to spend $250 million in FAD CapEx in 2024.

Solid economic growth and modest loan demand will also support banks’ financials in the near term.Business restructuring/expansion initiatives and digitization will offer support. Though weakening asset quality is likely to exert pressure on the financials to some extent, major banks like Wells Fargo & Company WFC and Northern Trust Corporation NTRS are worth investing in.', 'About the Industry', 'The Zacks Major Regional Banks industry includes the nation’s largest banks in terms of assets, with most operating globally. The financial performance of these banks largely depends on the nation’s economic health. As the banks are involved in several complex financial activities, they are required to meet the stringent regulations set by the Federal Reserve and other agencies. Apart from traditional banking services, which are the source of the net interest income (NII), major regional banks provide a wide array of other financial services and products to retail, corporate and institutional clients, both domestic and global. These include credit and debit cards, mortgage banking, wealth management and investment banking, among others. Therefore, a large revenue source for these banks is fees and commissions earned from these services.', '4 Themes Influencing the Major Regional Banks Industry', 'High-Interest Rates: The Fed’s aggressive monetary policy since March 2022 has led the interest rates to touch a 23-year high of 5.25-5.5% as it continues to fight ‘sticky’ inflation. While the inflation numbers are cooling down, the path for it to reach the central bank’s target of 2% is going to be bumpy. Hence, the market participants seem to have watered down the chances of a 75-basis point cut in interest rates this year. The tighter job market is also not helping the case.While the faster pace of rate hikes puts pressure on major banks’ net interest margin (NIM) because of an increase in funding costs, high rates for a longer period will be a boon for the industry players on the back of decent economic growth, resilient consumers and modest deposit inflows. This will support banks’ NII growth, though at a slower pace than in 2023.Business Restructuring Initiatives: Major regional banks are taking strategic actions to expand into new avenues and lower their dependence on spread income. The business restructuring is essential for technological advancement and further domestic/global expansion to continue improving profitability. The industry players are constantly investing in artificial intelligence and other digital platforms and even partnering/acquiring providers of such services. Major regional banks are also aggressively expanding their footprint outside the United States and into Europe and Asia. Several industry players are re-evaluating their business structure to simplify operations and do away with unprofitable ones.Modest Loan Demand: The central bank’s aggressive monetary policy lowered the demand for loans due to fears of a severe economic downturn/recession. Nonetheless, the Fed’s Summary of Economic Projections released in March indicates that the U.S. economy will slow down slightly this year and grow at a rate of 2.1%. In 2023, the U.S. economy grew at a rate of 2.5%, per the data released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis.While the high rates kept the borrowers on the sidelines for the major part of last year, the Fed’s higher-for-longer stance is likely to reverse the trend to some extent in 2024. The demand for loans is likely to tick up marginally as borrowers get used to the high interest rate environment.Weakening Asset Quality: For most of 2020, major regional banks built extra provisions to tide over unexpected defaults and payment delays due to the economic downturn resulting from the COVID-19 mayhem. This considerably hurt their financials. But with solid economic growth and support from government stimulus packages, banks began to release these reserves back into the income statement.Now, given the current macroeconomic headwinds, industry players are building provisions to counter any adverse fallout. While conservative lending policy and the resilience of borrowers helped banks to keep their asset quality manageable, several metrics have started rising. This, thus, signals the gradual deterioration of the industry players’ asset quality.', 'Zacks Industry Rank Suggests Bright Prospects', 'The Zacks Major Regional Banks industry is a 15-stock group within the broader Zacks Finance sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #41, which places it in the top 16% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates outperformance in the near term. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of an encouraging earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gaining confidence in this group’s earnings growth potential. Since the end of October 2023, the industry’s earnings estimates for the current year have been revised 1.5% upward.Before we present a couple of major bank stocks that are worth buying, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock market performance and valuation picture.', 'Industry Outperforms the Sector and the S&P 500', 'The Zacks Major Regional Banks industry has widely outperformed both the S&P 500 composite and its sector over the past year. While stocks in this industry have collectively surged 42.2% over the period, the Zacks S&P 500 composite has jumped 24.5%, and the Zacks Finance sector has rallied 23.1%.', 'One-Year Price Performance', '', ""Industry's Valuation"", 'One might get a good sense of the industry’s relative valuation by looking at its price-to-tangible book ratio (P/TBV), which is commonly used for valuing banks because of large variations in their earnings results from one quarter to the next.The industry currently has a trailing 12-month P/TBV of 1.98X. This compares with the highest level of 2.48X, the lowest of 1.21X and the median of 1.93X over the past five years. The industry is trading at a huge discount compared with the market at large, as the trailing 12-month P/TBV for the S&P 500 composite is 10.89X, as the chart below shows.', 'Price-to-Tangible Book Ratio (TTM)', '\xa0', 'As finance stocks typically have a lower P/TBV ratio, comparing major regional banks with the S&P 500 may not make sense to many investors. However, a comparison of the group’s P/TBV ratio with that of the broader sector ensures that the group is trading at a solid discount. The Zacks Finance sector’s trailing 12-month P/TBV came in at 4.09X. This is way above the Zacks Major Regional Banks industry’s ratio, as the chart below shows.', 'Price-to-Tangible Book Ratio (TTM)', '2 Major Regional Banks to Bet on Right Away', 'Wells Fargo: With total assets worth $1.96 trillion as of Mar 31, 2024, Wells Fargo is one of the largest financial holding companies in the United States. The company provides a diverse range of banking and non-banking financial services and products through more than 5,000 branches, a broad ATM network, the Internet and other distribution channels across North America and globally.Though WFC has been facing problems related to its 2016 sales scandal, management has been striving hard to overcome this matter and lift the asset cap imposed on it by the Fed.Wells Fargo is focused on reducing its expense base. Expense reduction efforts, such as streamlining organizational structure, closing branches and reducing headcount, undertaken since third-quarter 2020 have been aiding expense management. The company delivered gross expense savings aggregating $10 billion in 2021-2023. The company expects to take on these efficiency initiatives this year too.Further, this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company continues to build on its deposit base, which witnessed a three-year (ended 2023) CAGR of 1.1%. While the pace of deposit growth is likely to continue moderating in the near term, a large base of retail clients will likely support the deposit balance in the upcoming period.  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. With a market cap of $209.5 billion, Wells Fargo is expected to regain its lost glory with the above-mentioned strategic efforts. Analysts are bullish on the stock. In the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings has been revised 5.5% upward for 2024. The stock has jumped 44.7% over the past six months.', 'Price and Consensus: WFC', '\xa0', 'Northern Trust: With total assets worth $156.1 billion as of Mar 31, 2024, Northern Trust is a leading provider of wealth management, asset servicing, asset management and banking solutions to corporations, institutions, families and individuals.Organic growth is the company’s key strength. Its revenues witnessed a CAGR of 3.5% over the last three years (2020-2023), driven by rising non-interest income and NII. The growth of NII was aided by an improvement in loan balances and higher rates. Also, robust pipelines in the Asset Servicing and Wealth Management segments will likely drive organic growth in the upcoming period.NTRS is undertaking expense management efforts to tackle expense growth and reinstate its operating leverage. It focused on disciplined headcount management, vendor consolidation, rationalization of its real estate footprint and process automation. Through such efforts, it will likely improve productivity and meet the financial targets.This Zacks Rank #1 company’s capital distributions seem impressive. In 2022, the company hiked its quarterly dividend by 7% to 75 cents per share. In 2021, the company announced a 25-million share repurchase program with no expiration date. Its debt/equity ratio, comparing favorably with the broader industry, and decent liquidity highlight the fact that such capital-distribution activities are sustainable in the future.NTRS has a market cap of $17.1 billion. Analysts are bullish on the stock. In the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings has been revised 8.5% upward for 2024.

(NYSE:AIG) Q1 2024 Earnings Call Transcript May 2, 2024', 'American International Group, Inc. isn’t one of the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds at the end of the third quarter (see the details here).', ""Operator: Good day and welcome to AIG's First Quarter 2024 Financial Results Conference Call. This conference is being recorded. Now at this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Quentin McMillan. Please go ahead."", ""Quentin McMillan: Good morning, and thanks very much. Today's remarks may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. These statements are not guarantees of future performance or events, and are based on management's current expectations. AIG's filings with the SEC provide details on important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially. Except as required by applicable securities laws, AIG is under no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, circumstances or management estimates or opinions should change. Today's remarks may also refer to non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation of such measures to the most comparable GAAP figures is included in our earnings release, financial supplement, and earnings presentation, all of which are available on our website at aig.com."", ""Additionally, note that today's remarks will include results of AIG's Life & Retirement segment and other operations on the same basis as prior quarters, which is how we expect to continue to report until the deconsolidation of Corebridge Financial. AIG's segments and US GAAP financial results, as well as AIG's key financial metrics with respect thereto differ from those reported by Corebridge Financial. Corebridge Financial will host its earnings call on Friday, May 3rd. Finally, today's remarks, as they relate to net premiums written in general insurance, are presented both on a reported basis as well as a comparable basis, which reflects year-over-year comparison on a constant dollar basis as applicable, adjusted for the sale of Crop Risk Services and the sale of Validus Re. Please refer to the footnote on Page 26 of the first quarter financial supplement for prior period results for the Crop business and Validus RE."", ""With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Peter Zaffino."", ""Peter Zaffino: Good morning and thank you for joining us today to review our first quarter 2024 financial results. Following my remarks, Sabra will provide more detail on the quarter and then we'll take questions. Kevin Hogan will join us for the Q&A portion of the call. Here are some highlights from the quarter. Adjusted after tax income was $1.2 billion or $1.77 per diluted common share representing a 9% increase in earnings per share year-over-year. Consolidated net investment income on an adjusted pretax income basis was $3.5 billion, a 13% increase year-over-year. General insurance underwriting income was $596 million, a 19% increase year-over-year, reflecting improved accident year results including lower catastrophes and increased 67% year-over-year on a comparable basis if you exclude divested businesses from the prior year quarter."", 'The accident year combined ratio excluding catastrophes was 88.4%, a 30 basis point improvement from the prior year quarter and was the 10th consecutive quarter of a sub-90 combined ratio. The quarter also reflected the significant improvement we have made in controlling volatility in our property portfolio as total catastrophe related losses in the quarter were $107 million or 1.9%, representing a 230 basis point improvement year-over-year. Turning to Life & Retirement, the business reported very good results with premiums and deposits of $10.7 billion in the first quarter, their highest quarterly result achieved in the last decade and strong APTI growth of 12% over the prior year quarter. Last September, Corebridge entered into a definitive agreement to sell the UK Life Insurance Business to Aviva plc, which closed on April 8th.', ""Net proceeds were approximately $550 million and will be used for Corebridge share repurchases. During the quarter, we returned over $2.4 billion to shareholders through $1.7 billion of common stock repurchases. $250 million of dividends and the redemption of all our outstanding Series A preferred stock for $500 million. We repaid $459 million of debt upon maturity, lowering our total debt to $9.8 billion. In addition, we repurchased approximately $613 million of common stock in April. Based on our strong performance, the AIG Board of Directors approved an 11% increase in AIG's quarterly common stock dividend to $0.40 per share. The AIG Board of Directors also increased the share repurchase authorization to $10 billion effective May 1st. Lastly, we ended the first quarter with strong parent liquidity of $5.1 billion."", ""Overall, I'm very pleased with our first quarter results and the continued strong execution of our strategy to deliver sustained underwriting excellence, profitability and disciplined capital management. During my remarks this morning, I will discuss four important topics. First, I will provide some financial highlights in the quarter focused on the General Insurance business, including some insight into our net premiums written. Second, I will talk briefly about the results in Life & Retirement. Third, I will provide an update on our capital management strategy, specifically our plans for 2024 and 2025. And finally, I will discuss our path to a 10% plus ROCE and provide more detail on AIG Next and our future state operating structure that will create value through a leaner and more unified company."", ""Let me take a moment to update you on our sell down of Corebridge. Our Corebridge Holdings currently stand at 324 million common shares outstanding, which represents a 53% ownership stake. We continue to explore all alternatives to reduce our ownership stake in Corebridge. Once Corebridge is deconsolidated from AIG, Life & Retirement's balance sheet and income statement will no longer be included in AIG's consolidated financial statements and our remaining ownership stake will be reported in parent investments with dividends reported in net investment income. Sabra went through this in detail on our last earnings call. We have been evaluating opportunities to maximize long-term value for Corebridge and have considered multiple strategic alternatives that we believe will best position Corebridge for future success."", ""We remain committed to reducing AIG's ownership and to fully selling our remaining stake, and I will continue to provide updates to all of our stakeholders. In terms of the use of Corebridge related proceeds, AIG expects to continue to utilize excess capital and liquidity with a focus on returning capital to shareholders through share repurchases and liability management, which I will discuss later when I outline our capital management strategy. Now turning to General Insurance. Net premiums written were $4.5 billion and reflected the impact of the dispositions of Validus Re and Crop Risk Services as well as actions we've taken to restructure specific treaty reinsurance. Overall, Global Commercial had a very strong quarter. Excluding the impact of our divestitures, Global Commercial net premiums written growth was 1% year-over-year."", ""First, I want to reconfirm the guidance for the year. We expect high-single-digit growth in net premiums written for the full year in our Global Commercial Insurance business. Now the results. In North America Commercial, net premiums written grew 4%. Lexington grew 24%, which was led by Casualty and Western World. Our excess Casualty Line grew 46% and our Captive Solutions grew 20%. There's been meaningful commentary on the excess and surplus lines market and we continue to experience terrific fundamentals and results in Lexington. Let me provide a few examples. Our submission volume was up over 50% year-over-year. Lexington delivered strong new business, outperforming last year's record first quarter results, balanced across all lines. And retention remains strong for Lexington at 78%."", ""Shifting to North America retail property. Net premiums written were negative $120 million in the quarter, driven by first quarter reinsurance purchased and had over a 600 basis point impact on the first quarter net premiums written growth for North America Commercial compared to prior year. North America Financial Lines declined 4% year-over-year. In prior quarters, we provided meaningful commentary on the dynamics within Financial Lines, so I will not go through that again. It's been a challenging market environment with continued headwinds on rate. Having said that, we continue to believe our portfolio is strong and we remain disciplined. Sabra will give more detail in her prepared remarks. In International Commercial, net premiums written were flat for the quarter."", 'International Property grew 23% and Talbot grew 18%. This was offset by a decline in our Global Specialty business of slightly over 10% due to some top line weakness in energy and the effects of the reinsurance restructuring. Also, we had a 5% decline in international Financial Lines. Now turning to the combined ratio. Our Global Commercial business in the first quarter had an outstanding result with an 84.4% accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophe, a 150 basis point improvement year-over-year. The accident year combined ratio, including catastrophe, was 86.6%, a 500 basis point improvement year-over-year. This was led by International Commercial, which on a comparable basis had an 82.8% accident year combined ratio excluding catastrophe, which is a 140 basis point improvement year-over-year and an 83.5% accident year combined ratio, including catastrophe, which is a 770 basis point improvement year-over-year.', 'North America Commercial also had an outstanding result with an 85.9% accident year combined ratio excluding catastrophe, which is a 180 basis point improvement year-over-year and a 89.5% accident year combined ratio including catastrophe, which is a 260 basis point improvement year-over-year. These results were simply outstanding and are a testament to our commitment and culture of underwriting excellence. Shifting now to Global Personal Insurance, net premiums written were flat to prior year. We had modest growth in personal auto and individual travel and reductions in high net worth driven largely by reinsurance and accident and health largely driven by two non-renewals in China is part of our focus on portfolio improvements in our accident and health business.', 'North America Personal had a 97.7% accident year combined ratio excluding catastrophe. This is a 990 basis point improvement year-over-year and a 101.6% accident year combined ratio including catastrophe, which is an 870 basis point improvement year-over-year. As we discussed last year, we expect a material financial improvement in 2024 that will be driven by higher earned premium and a lower loss ratio from the high net worth business. We saw this manifest in the first quarter and expect this improvement to continue throughout 2024. International Personal Insurance had a 96.8% accident year combined ratio excluding catastrophe, which increased 90 basis points year-over-year and a 96.8% accident year combined ratio including catastrophe, which is a 20 basis point improvement year-over-year.', ""Overall, I'm very pleased with the financial performance of General Insurance, which delivered another excellent quarter. Our reinsurance decisions in the first quarter had an impact on net premiums written. As we've discussed over the past several years, our reinsurance partnerships and global treaty structures have been purposeful. Our objective has been to deliver improved underwriting profitability and evolve our business portfolio to be appropriately diversified to deliver consistent results throughout the market cycle. We believe this strategy has provided sustained value to our clients, while also delivering improved risk adjusted returns. It has significantly repositioned AIG, especially as we prepare to deconsolidate from Corebridge."", ""Our goals with our reinsurance purchasing have been to preserve and optimize capital and enhance the quality of earnings through active management of the volatility of our underwriting results. This deliberate approach to reinsurance has helped position AIG with a very strong balance sheet and has given us the flexibility to add exposure where risk-adjusted returns are very attractive while also moderating volatility in our underwriting results. As a result of our divestiture of Validus Re, combined with the reduction in gross limits in property through our underwriting strategy, we have reduced our PMLs and create a meaningful capacity to increase our property writings throughout our global platform should they meet our expected returns. Without going through each return period by parallel and region, our key zone PMLs on average, have decreased by over 40% compared to the first quarter of 2023, which provides considerable aggregate for future growth while appropriately managing the exposures we're assuming."", ""Our reinsurance purchasing is deliberately concentrated at January 1. As a result, any changes in purchasing tend to be more pronounced in the first quarter reporting of net premiums written. In January of 2024, we also made some changes related to the allocation of catastrophe costs among the businesses, so that catastrophe costs are more accurately reflected in pricing. Historically, some of these costs have been shared with Validus Re. We reallocated PMLs and the catastrophe costs to where we believe the most attractive opportunities for growth existed in our portfolio. It's worth noting, when considering our property catastrophe placement, we believe we have the lowest attachment point of our peer group. Over time, we have the balance sheet and perhaps the risk appetite to take more net on our catastrophe program post deconsolidation and subject to market conditions."", ""As a point of reference, if we chose to raise our catastrophe attachment point to $500 million worldwide, our attachment point would likely remain the lowest among our peer group with a 111 attachment point in North America wind and a 119 attachment in North America earthquake based on today's exposure. Importantly, our net premiums written in Commercial would have been 15% greater in the first quarter if we had elected to have a $500 million attachment point across our global portfolio. Our earnings potential is significant. And when combined with the strength of our balance sheet, it will provide us with the flexibility to continuously evaluate and refine our strategic reinsurance purchasing as we enter 2025. Turning to Life & Retirement."", 'As I noted earlier, the business continued to produce strong results in the first quarter. In April, Corebridge completed their Corebridge forward restructuring. $400 million of savings has been actioned or contracted and they expect to realize the vast majority of the savings by the end of 2024 at a cost to achieve of $300 million. Corebridge repurchased approximately $240 million of common shares during the first quarter. They have repurchased 370 million of common shares year-to-date. Corebridge ended the quarter with a strong balance sheet with parent liquidity of $1.7 billion. This week, the Corebridge Board of Directors approved a share buyback authorization of $2 billion, which reflects their stated commitment to delivering a 60% to 65% payout ratio to shareholders, subject to market conditions.', 'Turning to other operations. We have made significant progress towards our future state operating model. Adjusted pretax loss from other operations in the quarter, including Life & Retirement, was $408 million, a 17% improvement year-over-year. The improvement was primarily attributable to lower general operating expense, higher short-term investment income and lower interest expense at AIG due to debt reduction actions. We expect our future state parent expenses to be in the range of $325 million to $350 million by year-end 2024. After deconsolidation, we intend to use 1% to 1.5% of net premiums earned as a benchmark of total parent expenses in the future. Turning to capital management. In the first quarter, we continue to execute on our balanced capital management strategy.', ""Over the past couple of years, we have significantly strengthened our balance sheet by making key decisions that have increased our financial flexibility while always planning for the long-term, which has allowed us to accelerate the execution of our strategy and unlock meaningful value for AIG shareholders. Along with establishing appropriate debt capital structures for AIG and Corebridge and diligently executing on AIG's capital management priorities, we have also completed over $40 billion of capital market transactions since 2022. We have been very disciplined in the execution of the components of our capital management strategy that we first outlined in 2022. As a reminder, our objectives were. To maintain very strong insurance company capital levels to support organic growth and a steady source of operating subsidiary dividends to service parent company needs, to reduce our total debt outstanding and improve our leverage ratios, providing a well-structured and well-laddered debt portfolio with no outsized amounts due in any given year, particularly over the next five years, to return excess capital to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends, to increase our dividend as our earnings and financial flexibility improved and to maintain a strong parent liquidity position."", ""All of our Tier 1 insurance company subsidiaries are at or above their target capital ranges and have the ability to support meaningful growth without additional capital contributions. At current profitability levels, we had approximately $3 billion of run rate dividend capacity from our Global General Insurance subsidiaries with approximately $2 billion attributable to the US General Insurance Company's dividend capacity. We have increased the US General Insurance company dividend capacity by approximately 400% over the last three years. This reflects a significant increase from 2021, when it was $550 million and in 2022, when it was $1.4 billion. Looking forward, we expect to continue positioning AIG with maximum capital flexibility for growth, including reviewing our reinsurance over time and considering compelling and strategic inorganic growth opportunities should they exist."", ""In addition to strong insurance company capitalization, we've continued to significantly reduce our overall debt. Outstanding debt is now approximately $9.8 billion a reduction of over $12 billion since the end of 2021, which has been a remarkable result for AIG. We have previously provided guidance that we're targeting a 20% to 25% total debt-to-capital ratio, and we expect to be in the 15% to 20% range upon deconsolidation. While we may do additional work on maturities, we would not expect that to take priority over share repurchases. Since 2022, we've increased our focus on share repurchase activities. We completed over $5 billion of repurchases in 2022 and approximately $3 billion in 2023. Looking ahead, we expect up to $6 billion in repurchases in 2024 and up to $4 billion in 2025, depending on the timing of future Corebridge sell-downs and market conditions."", 'All of the expected activity in 2024 and 2025 will be covered by the $10 billion share authorization that we announced yesterday. For the balance of 2024, we expect to be able to repurchase about $1.5 billion of common stock a quarter depending on excess parent liquidity levels, including future Corebridge sale proceeds, General Insurance dividends and market conditions. And based on the current stock price, we would expect this to get us close to the higher end of our target share count range of 600 million to 650 million common shares by the end of the second quarter and towards the lower end of the range by the end of 2024. Furthermore, based on this outlook and depending on the stock price and market conditions, we would expect to be between 550 million and 600 million shares outstanding by year end 2025.', 'Turning to our dividend. The AIG Board of Directors recently increased the cash dividend of $0.40 per share on AIG common stock up 11%, the second consecutive year with an increase of more than 10%. I could not be more pleased with our progress. We remain confident in our ability to deliver while continuing the positive momentum in our financial performance. We remain committed to delivering an adjusted 10% plus ROCE post deconsolidation of Corebridge. For the first quarter, we achieved a 9.3% adjusted ROCE and a 13.3% adjusted ROCE in General Insurance. Contributing to ROCE will be AIG Next, which will focus on achieving an expense base that will generate additional savings for AIG while reducing complexity throughout our organization and simplifying how we operate.', 'AIG Next will create clarity in our operating structure, including aligning our underwriting and claims organizations, with our operations and functions while defining our parent company of the future. This is the key objective as we weave AIG together. To be a less complex, more effective and leaner company with the appropriate infrastructure and capabilities for the business we will be post deconsolidation. AIG Next has clearly defined work streams governed by a very experienced, centralized team with significant experience in transformations and company design reporting directly to me. As I stated on previous calls, we expect AIG Next to generate approximately $500 million in annual run rate savings by the end of 2025. Of the $500 million in run rate savings, we expect $350 million to be actioned in 2024, which is an increase of the guidance we have provided in the past, and the balance will be actioned within 2025 with a cost to achieve of $500 million.', ""To-date, we've made meaningful progress on AIG Next across multiple work streams. In April, we announced a voluntary early retirement program available to colleagues in the United States who meet the eligibility criteria. Eligible participants will have the opportunity to accelerate their retirement from AIG with enhanced retirement benefits. The population of eligible participants represents approximately 25% of our US workforce. About half of the eligible participants are located in the high-cost New York metropolitan area. We are anticipating a 50% take up rate, which would result in approximately $225 million of onetime cost and a net run rate benefit of approximately $150 million after reinvestment for the skills and capabilities we need for the future."", ""The numbers I have provided for our early retirement program are included in the total numbers I provided for AIG Next. In summary, I'm very pleased with our overall performance as we start 2024. As I said in my recent letter to shareholders, our ability to execute continues to be one of the company's best attributes. We have accomplished a significant amount in the past several years in order to position AIG for the future and we have continued to deliver in the first quarter, which will enable us to achieve our objectives in 2024 and beyond. I am confident that we will continue to uphold our commitment to achieving underwriting excellence and high-quality earnings over the long-term, benefiting all of our stakeholders as we continue to simplify and streamline our business and create the AIG of tomorrow."", ""With that, I'll turn the call over to Sabra."", ""Sabra Purtill: Thank you, Peter. This morning, I will provide details on AIG's first quarter results, including General Insurance, Investment Income and Life & Retirement and a balance sheet update. First quarter 2024 adjusted after-tax income attributable to AIG common shareholders or AATI, was $1.2 billion, flat to last year due to the reduction in our ownership of Corebridge from 77.3% to 52.7% at the end of this quarter. General Insurance adjusted pretax income or APTI, increased $110 million year-over-year, driven by higher underwriting and net investment income. The prior year quarter included APTI of approximately $175 million from Validus Re and Crop Risk Services. On a comparable basis, excluding the divested businesses, General Insurance APTI was up about $285 million."", 'As Peter noted, first quarter General Insurance underwriting income was $596 million, up $94 million from the prior year quarter. On a comparable basis, underwriting income rose $239 million year-over-year. International Commercial Lines was the primary contributor to higher underwriting profitability with $175 million increase in underwriting income. North America Commercial Lines underwriting income was down $95 million from the prior year quarter as reported but up $35 million on a comparable basis. Underwriting income includes catastrophe losses of $107 million in the quarter or 190 basis points on the loss ratio, down from $265 million or 420 basis points last year. Prior year development this quarter was a favorable $34 million compared to a favorable $68 million in the prior year quarter.', ""This quarter's development was solely from the amortization of the deferred gain on the adverse development cover which is recalculated each year based on prior year experience. For 2024, the amortization gain will be $34 million each quarter compared to $41 million a quarter last year. Turning to underwriting ratios. The General Insurance calendar year combined ratio was 89.8% this quarter, a 210 basis point improvement from the prior year quarter and a 380 basis point improvement on a comparable basis. We provided additional data on Page 26 of the financial supplement on the impact of the divestitures on 2023 North American Commercial combined ratios. The accident year combined ratio ex-catastrophes was 88.4%, a 30 basis point improvement over the prior year quarter and a 160 basis point improvement on a comparable basis."", 'The accident year loss ratio adjusted for catastrophes was 56.6% this quarter, 10 basis points better than the first quarter of 2023 as reported and 70 basis points better on a comparable basis. This improvement reflects continued earn-in of rate above loss cost trend and better underwriting and risk selection, particularly in Global Commercial lines. The expense ratio for the quarter was 31.8%, down 20 basis points from the prior year quarter as reported with a $43 million reduction in general operating expenses. On a comparable basis, the expense ratio improved 90 basis points with 10 basis points from the acquisition ratio and 80 basis points from the general operating expense ratio, reflecting continued expense discipline as general operating expenses rose only $6 million.', ""As Peter covered General Insurance premium growth, I will focus on Commercial Lines new business, renewal rate, loss trends and retention as well as reserves. New business production in Global Commercial remained strong. In North America, New business was almost $450 million and balanced across all lines with excellent performance from Lexington. International Commercial new business levels were very good with over $500 million in the quarter led by Talbot, Property and Casualty offset by lower new business in energy and financial lines. In North America Commercial, overall rate, excluding workers' compensation, increased 5% in the quarter with exposure adding 2% for overall pricing of 7%, which is above loss cost trend. Excluding workers' comp and financial lines, North America Commercial rate was up more than 8% in the quarter, with exposure up 2% for overall pricing over 10% meaningfully above the loss cost trend."", ""North America Commercial rate increase reflect strengthening pricing trends in casualty, including Lexington Casualty, which was up 11%, Lexington Healthcare up 15% and Excess Casualty up 16%. In International Commercial, overall rate increased 3% and exposure added 2% for overall pricing increase of 5%, modestly ahead of the loss cost trend. Excluding financial lines, international rate was up 5% with overall pricing up 7%, well ahead of loss cost trend. The rate increase was driven by property, which was up 7%, energy up 8%, and marine up 7%. As we've discussed, financial lines is a notable exception to pricing trends. This was particularly the case in excess. We are taking a long-term view in financial lines and remain disciplined on risk selection, terms and conditions, pricing and reserving."", ""While rate trend has been negative the past few quarters, in aggregate, the cumulative rate level in North America financial lines is about 50% higher than five years ago. Renewal retention has improved over the past several years and remained strong. As a reminder, we calculate renewal retention using expiring premiums, excluding the impact of renewal rate and exposure changes on the ratio. Global Commercial retention increased to 89%, stable at 88% in North America and rose to 89% in International. Turning to reserves. I wanted to provide some background on AIG's reserve review schedule for 2024 and quarterly processes. At AIG, we performed detailed valuation reviews or DVRs, on each book once a year. In DVRs, we look at loss development and trends in prior and current accident years and consider changes in our reserving factors and approaches based on emerged experience."", ""We do not perform DVRs in the first quarter. In the second quarter of 2024, we will review the North America Casualty book, including excess and primary casualty, Lexington, workers' compensation and mass tort comprising about $20 billion of reserves or 44% of our total reserves. In the third quarter, we will review International Commercial Lines, Global Financial Lines, Commercial Property and other lines, totaling about $22 billion or 47% of reserves with the balance of the DVRs completed in the fourth quarter. Between DVRs, our actuarial team evaluates pricing, claims, loss trends and reserves across the portfolio. Each quarter, we complete an actual versus expected review or AVE for each book. The AVE review gives us a current look at trends and the opportunity to address issues prior to the scheduled DVR."", 'Examples of such items include large new claims, notable changes in claims patterns or settlements, changes in attritional loss trends beyond normal ranges or significant major events. We are aware that the industry has begun to address adverse casualty loss development and trends in the 2016 to 2019 accident years. On our third quarter 2023 call, Peter provided significant detail on the reunderwriting and repricing of our casualty book that we began in 2018 with an entirely new framework and approach to underwriting. In addition, we changed our reserving assumptions on the book. And by 2021, we had increased reserves on North American Casualty, 2016 through 2019 accident years, by over $1 billion. We also continued to refine our actuarial judgments, and in 2019, we raised the loss cost trend assumption for certain excess casualty segments to 10%.', ""And by 2022, all excess casualty segments were at or above 10%. Our AVE reviews on North American Casualty since the second quarter 2023 DVR continue to show loss experience within the range of our expectations on the 2016 to 2019 accident years. As we have previously outlined, our reserving philosophy is to react to adverse trends quickly and to allow time for favorable trends, particularly in recent accident years, to mature. We did not make any adjustments to our casualty reserves this quarter in total or within the 2016 to 2019 accident years. AIG's reserves and balance sheet are much stronger today and our reinsurance is much more comprehensive, helping improve our underwriting results and reduce volatility. Turning now to investment income."", 'AIG continues to benefit from reinvestment rates on fixed maturities and loans that exceeded sales and maturities, helping drive higher yields and net investment income in General Insurance and Life & Retirement. This quarter, consolidated net investment income on an APTI basis was $3.5 billion, up 13% from the prior year quarter and up 2% in General Insurance and 16% in Life & Retirement. General Insurance net investment income growth was negatively impacted by the sale of Validus Re which had a $5 billion portfolio. Adjusted for income on that portfolio in the prior year quarter, General Insurance net investment income rose about 7%, with a 9% increase in fixed maturities and loans driven by higher reinvestment rates. This quarter, new money rates on fixed maturities and loans averaged 5.9%, 150 basis points higher than the yield on sales and maturities in the quarter.', 'The new money rates were about 115 basis points higher in General Insurance and 165 basis points higher in Life & Retirement. The annualized yield on fixed maturities and loans, excluding calls, prepayments and other onetime items, was 3.9% in general insurance, three basis points higher than the fourth quarter of 2023 and 44 basis points higher than the prior year quarter. The sequential yield comparison in General Insurance was negatively impacted by the sale of Validus Re. First quarter General Insurance alternative investment income was $54 million or an annualized return of 5.2% this quarter, down $41 million from the prior year quarter. Continuing to Life & Retirement. Sales and earnings were strong this quarter. First quarter sales remained at historically high levels with premiums and deposits of $10.7 billion driven by strong sales in fixed annuities and pension risk transfer.', ""Life & Retirement segment APTI was $991 million, up 12% from the prior year quarter, driven by higher base portfolio spread income due to higher reinvestment rates, higher fee income due to higher market levels and lower general operating expenses, partially offset by lower alternative investment income. Life & Retirement alternative investment income was negative $23 million this quarter for an annualized yield of negative 1.8% due to private equity losses and very low income on hedge funds and real estate compared to breakeven last year. Corebridge's total contribution to AIG's AATI, including corporate expenses, declined by approximately $100 million or 20% over the prior year quarter due to the reduction in our ownership. Turning to the balance sheet."", 'Book value per common share was $64.66 this quarter, down 1% from year-end 2023 and up 10% from the prior year quarter, driven mostly by the impact of interest rates. Adjusted book value per share was $77.79, up 1% from year-end 2023 and up 3% from the prior year quarter, reflecting the net impact of earnings, dividends and share repurchases. Peter covered our capital management actions year-to-date. With respect to debt leverage, consolidated debt and preferred stock to total capital, excluding AOCI, which includes $9.4 billion of Corebridge debt, was 23.6% at March 31st, down 70 basis points from year-end 2023. Excluding Corebridge debt on a pro forma deconsolidated basis, AIG debt to total capital is expected to be within the new 15% to 20% debt target range that Peter provided.', 'To conclude, AIG delivered another excellent quarter with significant financial and operational accomplishments.

GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Signs with AMH.', ""On May 3, 2024, Hologic Inc (NASDAQ:HOLX), a leader in women's healthcare solutions, filed its 10-Q report, providing a snapshot of its financial performance and strategic direction. The company reported a net income of $169.9 million for the three months ended March 30, 2024, and $218.5 million for the six months ended, indicating a robust financial position. Despite facing challenges such as a decrease in COVID-19 assay sales and a competitive market landscape, Hologic Inc continues to leverage its strengths in diagnostics and explore opportunities in surgical segments to maintain its market leadership. This SWOT analysis delves into the company's internal capabilities and external environment to offer investors a detailed perspective on its potential growth trajectory."", ""Market Leadership in Diagnostics: Hologic Inc's diagnostics segment remains a cornerstone of its success, contributing significantly to its revenue stream. The company's molecular diagnostic assays, backed by advanced instrumentation systems like Panther and Panther Fusion, have established a strong market presence. This is evidenced by the segment's resilience despite the decline in COVID-19 assay sales. Hologic's diagnostics portfolio is diversified and includes the ThinPrep cytology system and the Rapid Fetal Fibronectin Test, which continue to drive demand."", ""Innovative Product Pipeline: Hologic Inc's commitment to innovation is evident in its product development efforts. The company has successfully introduced new technologies such as the Genius Digital Diagnostics system and the 3Dimensions mammography systems. These advancements not only reinforce Hologic's brand but also cater to the evolving needs of healthcare providers, ensuring a competitive edge in the women's health market."", ""Dependence on Breast Health Segment: While Hologic Inc has diversified its portfolio, the company's financial performance is still significantly influenced by its breast health segment. The recent 10-Q filing indicates that supply chain constraints have impacted the breast health product revenues, suggesting a vulnerability to external disruptions. This dependence on a single segment could pose risks if market dynamics shift unfavorably."", ""Operational Inefficiencies: Hologic Inc's operational costs, as a percentage of revenue, have increased in the diagnostics and skeletal health segments. This rise is attributed to lower sales of high-margin SARS-CoV-2 assays and unfavorable manufacturing variances. Addressing these inefficiencies is crucial for maintaining profitability and competitive pricing."", 'Expansion in Surgical Market: Hologic Inc has identified growth opportunities in the GYN Surgical market, as indicated by the increase in product revenues from MyoSure devices and Fluent Fluid Management products. Capitalizing on the recovery of procedure rates post-COVID-19, Hologic can further strengthen its position in this segment and diversify its revenue sources.', ""Global Market Penetration: The company's international expansion strategy, particularly in emerging markets, presents significant growth potential.

The 10-Q filing highlights concerns about inflation, bank failures, and potential recessions, which could affect customer purchasing power and disrupt supply chains, posing a threat to the company's growth."", 'Competitive Pressure and Technological Advancements: The healthcare industry is highly competitive, with continuous technological advancements. Hologic Inc must navigate this landscape by investing in R&D to stay ahead of emerging technologies and maintain its market share against competitors who may offer alternative or more advanced solutions.', ""In conclusion, Hologic Inc (NASDAQ:HOLX) demonstrates a strong financial foundation with significant strengths in its diagnostics segment and innovative product offerings. However, the company must address its weaknesses related to operational costs and segment dependence to sustain its competitive advantage. The opportunities for expansion in the surgical market and global penetration are promising, but Hologic must remain vigilant of external threats such as economic uncertainties and competitive pressures. By strategically leveraging its strengths and opportunities while mitigating its weaknesses and threats, Hologic Inc is well-positioned to continue its trajectory of growth and market leadership in women's healthcare."", 'This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

Good afternoon and thank you for joining Hologic's second quarter fiscal 2024 earnings call. With me today are Steve MacMillan, the company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Karleen Oberton, our Chief Financial Officer; and Essex Mitchell, our Chief Operating Officer. Our second quarter press release is available now on the Investors section of our website. We will also post our prepared remarks to our website shortly after we deliver them as well as an updated corporate presentation and a replay of this call will be available on our website for the next 30 days.

Also during this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP can be found in our earnings release. Two of these non-GAAP measures are: one, organic revenue which we define as revenue excluding divested businesses and revenue from acquired businesses owned by Hologic for less than 1 year; and two, organic revenue, excluding COVID-19 which further excludes COVID-19 assay revenue, revenue related to COVID-19 and sales from discontinued products in Diagnostics. Finally, any percentage changes we discuss will be on a year-over-year basis and revenue growth rates will be in constant currency unless otherwise noted.', ""Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Steve MacMillan, Hologic's CEO."", 'Steve MacMillan: Thank you, Ryan and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to discuss our financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2024. For the quarter, total revenue was $1.02 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.03. Both revenue and EPS came in above the high end of our guidance, reflecting another strong quarter. Similar to Q1, it is again important to view our Q2 performance in proper perspective. As we shared on our Q1 earnings call in February, throughout 2024, we faced double-digit comps, massive comps in the first half and still very strong comps in the second. As a reminder, in Q2 of last year, organic Molecular Diagnostics ex COVID posted growth of nearly 25%. And both Surgical and Breast Health posted phenomenal growth of over 25%.', ""This year, in Q2, on top of the high growth rates from a year ago, we grew our Molecular Diagnostics business, ex COVID at 10.7%. Our surgical business, 7.4%; and our Breast Health business 1%, excluding the divested SSI business, a solid result given the elevated gantry placements in Q2 a year ago. We also delivered operating margins of 30.4% in Q2, improving 190 basis points sequentially from Q1 and setting us up nicely to approach 31% for the full fiscal year. Now past the halfway point of fiscal '24, we believe we are in an excellent position to achieve our full year goals. Before moving on to our themes for today, our fiscal second quarter marks the fourth anniversary of when the COVID virus changed the world. When COVID initially surged, we had 3 goals: one, ensure that we take care of our employees; two, make a huge difference in the world with our Panther system and COVID testing."", ""And three, emerge as a bigger, stronger, faster growing company in a post-pandemic world. Fast forward to today, as you can see from our results, we have delivered against these 3 goals and we're aiming for more. Not only did we achieve our primary objectives, we also successfully managed to strengthen all of our franchises, both in the U.S. and internationally, remain innovative and disciplined in executing our growth strategies and build a fortress balance sheet to facilitate future growth. On top of these achievements, we continue to elevate our already high employee engagement scores and all through complicated macro challenges. That said, we are never satisfied and firmly believe the best is still ahead. As we look further out beyond the horizon, we see significant potential to continue to innovate and unlock growth opportunities for years to come."", ""Now on to our 3 themes for today. First, our core franchises Diagnostics, Breast Health and Surgical continued to showcase the benefits of our diverse portfolio. As planned, we continue to yield robust growth and durability because we benefit from being both Diagnostics and Medtech. Second, our international business quietly continues to drive strong top line growth demonstrating our ability to capture potential growth opportunities and turn them into reality. And third, our strong balance sheet and disciplined approach to capital allocation, empower us to fortify our foundation as we've done this week with the announcement of the Endomagnetics acquisition. We have the ability to build on our strength with significant operational flexibility which allows us multiple levers to deliver top and bottom line performance."", ""Turning to our first theme. Sometimes overlooked and misunderstood -- the strength of our business comes from the sum of our parts. We are a unique collection of Diagnostics and Medtech businesses with many more growth drivers than meets the eye. Each business has multiple growth drivers with tremendous runway ahead. To the outside, it may be unclear how we can keep driving growth with the strong market shares we have. In reality, our product and service diversity creates enduring strength as we advance forward and notch incremental wins. Over time, these wins collectively deliver meaningful and durable growth across multiple franchises and multiple geographies. While we know we don't fit neatly into either diagnostics or medical device, we do fit neatly into the world of improving women's health."", ""Our unique set of businesses equips us to deliver results and positively impact more and more women regardless of external macro challenges. Our strong growth over the past 4 years reflects a combination of multiple durable growth drivers intentionally built into each of our businesses. The beauty here is that over time and in any given quarter, our growth drivers can change and morph. What we've done is create multiphase extended and stacked growth cycles. The net result is our ability to consistently deliver on a consolidated basis over time. A few examples to highlight from across our business. In our second quarter, worldwide diagnostics growth ex COVID of 9.8% was again primarily driven by our Molecular Diagnostics business. In Molecular Diagnostics, over the last few years, we've dramatically expanded both our installed base and menu, nearly doubling our installed base from 1,700 Panthers to over 3,200 during the pandemic and going from 4 FDA-approved assays to over 20."", 'Our next phase of growth is about menu adoption and driving more volume by focusing largely on existing customers while adding more geographies. At the same time, we continue to broaden our menu. As a result, we create years of growth ahead as we extend our commercial reach and continue to add products to our portfolio. In the second quarter, U.S. Molecular Diagnostics delivered double-digit growth, led by ongoing adoption of BV/CV/TV on the Panther, strong contributions from our respiratory suite of assays on the fusion as well as continued growth from Biotheranostics. Each of these are newer products to our portfolio, underscoring the power of our extended reach, layering on top of the strong U.S. molecular performance, international cytology was also accretive to worldwide diagnostics growth.', ""Outside the U.S., diagnostics growth was driven primarily by multi-country adoption of our innovative Genius AI digital psychology in the quarter. As a reminder, digital cytology was only recently approved in the U.S. earlier this year. meaning the U.S. opportunity is still ahead. In Breast Health, we've expanded our product offering from imaging to cover the continuum of breast cancer care, including biopsy and surgery. In the second quarter, on a worldwide basis, the gantry and service businesses performed well against very strong comps from the prior year period. Meanwhile, outside the U.S, our emerging interventional breast business grew double digits in Q2, accretive to the worldwide growth rate. And finally, in Surgical. Once essentially only a U.S. 2 product business with NovaSure and MyoSure, we now have Fluent, Accesa and Bolder."", ""And internationally, we are just getting started with both the core business and new product lines. In Q2, worldwide growth of 7.4% was very strong against the high prior year comp. Our performance was driven in large part by very strong double-digit growth in our International Surgical business which in Q2 is a reflection of continued market penetration as well as our go-direct strategy in the Nordics. All in, we are a powerful women's health composite. As we extend our reach globally, we expect to grow even in product categories and territories that may on their surface appear to be mature and well penetrated. With that, I'll turn the call over to Essex to discuss our final 2 themes for today."", ""Essex Mitchell: Thank you, Steve. As previewed by Steve's discussion of our diverse and durable growth drivers, our strong international growth is a direct result of identifying and capturing underpenetrated market opportunities with steady execution. As a reminder, our international business is over 40% larger than it was in 2019. We are in more territory and more direct than ever before. That said, big picture, we are still in the early days of our international opportunities. Our early success is driven largely by 2 approaches: One, going direct; and two, entering markets where we elevate the standard of care. For example, on the latter, while the ThinPrep Pap test, 2D and even 3D mammo and procedures like NovaSure and MyoSure are widely accepted as standard of care in the U.S., internationally, this is unfortunately not yet the case."", ""Many parts of the world even those considered developed and industrialized, still have the opportunity to elevate their screening, diagnosis and treatment of women to gold standards. These women deserve it and Hologic is poised to realize this potential. Acceptability to women's health options around the world remains a priority and a great opportunity for Hologic. This is why our work with the Hologic Global Women's Health Index and our worldwide partnership with the Women's Tennis Association to elevate women's health, education and access are critically important. Reinforcing our position, the index clearly shows that we are only scratching the surface of the global opportunity and this holds true even in Europe, with other large market geographies like Asia Pacific being further out on the time horizon."", ""From our perspective, as leading champions for women's health, we believe there is still significant market adoption opportunity ahead of us. And this adoption will not happen overnight, we expect adoption to grow over time, at different places around the world as more and more governments prioritize women's health. And for our final theme today, we'd like to underscore the importance of our strong balance sheet and recap our capital allocation priorities. With over $2 billion in cash and strong cash flow we have the capacity to fund key in-house initiatives and also deploy cash towards both M&A and share repurchases. Regarding capital allocation, our strategy remains the same. We are focused on tuck-in opportunities for our 3 core franchises."", 'And as we have stated in the past, we have a strong preference for any potential deal to have a clear line of sight to accretion on both top and bottom line, if not immediately, the sooner, the better. Our business development teams across each of our franchises are consistently building and reviewing opportunities in their respective pipeline. We view our ability to shop across multiple aisles as a strength as we continue to grow into an even greater performing composite than we are today. The ability to shop in multiple aisles also creates the flexibility to maneuver potentially unfavorable valuations in one aisle versus another. Overall, a blend of adding in-house developed and external innovation across our strong fan franchises is an important part of our growth strategy.', ""Leading into our strategy, on Monday, we announced our agreement to acquire Endo-Magnetics LTD -- a provider of breast cancer surgery technologies for approximately $310 million. Endo-Mag's portfolio of innovative breast surgery localization and lymphatic tracing products complements and diversifies our expanding interventional breast business. We are excited for the potential to join forces, amplify growth and better serve patients around the world. In calendar 2023, Endomag generated approximately $35 million of revenue and we believe our combined global reach and breadth of interventional options will accelerate growth in this exciting space. At this point, we are still early and do not have a definitive time line on closing the transaction, though we estimate to close in the second half of calendar year."", 'Before I turn the call over to Karleen, let me conclude by saying we are proud of our strong Q2 results that build on our Q1 performance. All said, we are in a solid position to carry our success into Q3 and Q4.', 'Karleen Oberton: Thank you, Essex and good afternoon, everyone. In my statements today, I will provide an overview of our revenue results, walk down our income statement showcasing strong performance, touch on a few other key financial metrics and finish with our guidance for the third quarter and full fiscal 2024. As highlighted, our second quarter financial results were very strong. exceeding our expectations on revenue and profitability. Q2 was a continuation of our momentum from Q1. Total revenue came in at $1.018 billion, beating the midpoint of our guidance by $18 million. We delivered organic growth of 4.9%, excluding COVID, on top of a challenging double-digit comp from the prior year. In addition, non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.03 which exceeded the high end of our guidance by $0.03.', 'Before moving on to our franchise results, we want to highlight the continued strength of our balance sheet. In Q2, we generated over $290 million in cash from operating activities and ended the quarter with nearly $2.2 billion on the balance sheet. Our strong cash balance leverage ratio well below our target range and ability to consistently generate strong cash flow provide us the flexibility to fund innovation and execute our capital allocation strategy. We have significant firepower to continue to deploy capital as opportunities arise. Turning to our franchise results. In Diagnostics, second quarter revenue of $450.1 million declined 3.2%. Excluding COVID assay and related revenue, worldwide Diagnostics grew by 9.8%. Within Diagnostics, Molecular Diagnostics continues to contribute significantly, growing 10.7% excluding COVID.', 'We continue to see underlying strength in BV/CV/TV which continues its outstanding growth trajectory. BV/CV/TV is tracking to become our second largest assay globally. With very little international revenue as we have focused primarily on the U.S. market. Additionally, as expected, non-COVID respiratory assay sales remained solid as the flu season continued into our second quarter. Growth was a combination of more volume year-over-year across our respiratory menu plus ASP lift from elevated contribution from our COVID, Flu A, Flu B and RSV 4-Plex assay. Finally, Biotheranostics remains a strong pillar of growth for our base molecular business. Rounding out Diagnostics, Psychology and perinatal grew 7.9% globally, primarily fueled by double-digit growth internationally as well as impact from the prior year comp.', ""As a reminder, Q2 last year was adversely impacted by supply constraint issues related to a third-party logistics partner. Level set growth in the second quarter is above our long-term expectations for this business. Moving on to Breast Health. Total second quarter revenue of $384.6 million decreased 0.3% but grew 1% when excluding SSI. As a reminder, Q1 '24 resulted in an elevated growth rate assisted by lapping soft prior year performance due to supply constraints in Q1 '23. The opposite is true for Q2 '24, where we faced significant prior year comps. In Q2 of last year, we placed an elevated number of gantries as semiconductor chip supply and visibility improved. For the remainder of the year, we expect growth rates in the gantry business to normalize."", ""Within Breast Health, growth was driven primarily by our international interventional mix. This highlights the diversity of growth drivers Steve and Essex commented on. And the fact that growth drivers across our business and within our divisions can change and morph over time. Continuing next to Surgical. Second quarter revenue of $156 million increased 7.4%. Surgical growth continues to be fueled by MyoSure in the related Fluent fluid management system. As anticipated, NovaSure continues to be a headwind to growth as we lapped the prior year NovaSure V5 ASP lift. And finally, in our Skeletal business, Second quarter revenue of $27.1 million declined 14.3% from lower capital placements and upgrades. Now let's move on to the rest of the non-GAAP P&L for the second quarter."", 'Gross margin was 60.7% for the quarter and in line with expectations. The decline of 160 basis points from the prior year was anticipated and primarily driven by lower COVID sales compared to the prior year period. As a reminder, we expect gross margin to improve as we work past the amortization of previously procured higher-priced semiconductor chips. Total operating expense of $307.6 million in the second quarter decreased by 3%. This decrease was primarily driven by elimination of expenses related to the divested SSI business. As Steve mentioned, the operating margin was 30.4% for the second quarter. The year-over-year decline of 90 basis points was driven primarily from lower COVID sales. Sequentially, as expected, operating margins expanded 190 basis points from Q1 largely from lower operating expenses in Q2, a strong result for the quarter.', ""Below operating income, other income net represented a loss of nearly $6 million in our first -- in our fiscal second quarter. As expected, interest income is lower due to lower cash balances from the significant share repurchases completed earlier in the fiscal year. Additionally, interest expense is up due to lower proceeds from our interest rate swaps. Finally, our tax rate in Q2 was 19.75% as expected. Now let's move on to our non-GAAP financial guidance for the third quarter and full year fiscal 2024. For Q3 2024, we are expecting total revenue in the range of $992.5 million to $1007.5 million. and EPS of $0.98 to $1.05. For the full year 2024, our guidance assumes revenue of $4 billion to $4.05 billion. and EPS of $4.02 to $4.12. With respect to foreign exchange, we expect the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar to create a significant headwind in the second half of the year."", ""For Q3, we are assuming FX headwind of about $3 million. For the full year, we now expect a slight tailwind of about $2 million. All in, this represents about a $2 million -- a $10 million impact to our prior guidance. And as a reminder, prior guidance assumed a $12 million tailwind for the full year. Turning to our franchises. We want to reiterate that we expect each to grow at least 5% to 7% in our fiscal 2024, excluding the impact of COVID. While we have navigated the most challenging comps from fiscal '23, we still have strong double-digit comps across the board to close out fiscal '24. Starting with Diagnostics. We expect our Molecular Diagnostics business to drive high single-digit growth, excluding COVID as customers continue to adopt and drive utilization of our expanded menu."", ""In cytology and perinatal, however, we expect minimal growth in Q3. In Q3 of last year, customers built inventory as a result of the third-party shipping constraints experienced in Q2 of '23, resulting in slightly elevated sales. We expect to see more normalized comps for our cytology and perinatal business in fiscal year '25. Closing out on non-COVID diagnostics, we expect blood revenue of approximately $7 million in Q3 and $28 million for the full year.

Our guidance also assumes Q3 operating margins in the low 30s and we remain on pace to finish fiscal '24, approaching 31%. Below operating income, we estimate fiscal '24 other income net to be an expense of approximately $10 million in Q3 and an expense between $30 million and $40 million for the full year.

And while there are major differences between companies that don't pay dividends and those that do, there's an equally stark contrast between companies with complete capital return programs and those that mainly focus on dividends."", ""We're talking about stock repurchases -- where companies return capital to investors by buying back (and usually retiring) shares. Fewer shares shrink the pie and make each outstanding share more valuable. The practice is so powerful that Warren Buffett-led Berkshire Hathaway doesn't even bother paying a dividend -- choosing instead to reward shareholders by growing the business and repurchasing shares."", 'Investors looking for quality companies with sizable stock buyback programs have come to the right place. Here, three Fool.com contributors discuss why Chevron (NYSE: CVX), Owens Corning (NYSE: OC), and Phillips 66 (NYSE: PSX) are three dividend stocks worth buying now.', ""Daniel Foelber (Chevron): Chevron is hovering around an all-time high for all the right reasons. The company's capital return program is at a record high, driven by strong dividend growth and stock buybacks."", 'In the most recent quarter -- Q1 2024 -- Chevron returned about $3 billion to shareholders through dividends and another $3 billion in buybacks. The latest quarterly dividend payment was $1.63, up 8% from the prior payment.', ""Chevron's dividend has increased by 22% in just three years, and it has increased its dividend for 37 consecutive years. The yield is a sizable 3.9%. In this vein, Chevron checks all the boxes dividend investors look for -- growth, track record, and yield. But what makes Chevron a particularly attractive investment is its dividend paired with its buyback program."", 'Chevron has funneled outsized profits into its stock repurchase program to reduce its share count, which makes the stock a better value and benefits existing shareholders by giving them greater ownership of the company. The buybacks have been adding up. Factoring in $3 billion from Q1, Chevron has repurchased $14.2 billion of its stock over the past 12 months -- nearly 5% of its market cap.', 'Compared to Q1 2023, Chevron generated 14% lower diluted earnings per share and 5.6% lower cash flow operations in Q1 2024. Its upstream earnings were actually higher as production surged 35% thanks to investments and acquisitions. But lower refining margins hammered its downstream business, and natural gas prices have been performing far weaker than oil prices.', ""So even though Chevron isn't at the top of its game and is facing some challenges, it is still putting up strong results that can support sizable buybacks and dividends -- which illustrates the strength of its business model and upstream portfolio."", ""Throw in Chevron's incredibly strong balance sheet and low net debt ratio, and you have a complete company that remains a foundational holding for investors looking to generate passive income from the oil patch."", 'Lee Samaha (Owens Corning): Deciding how to return cash to shareholders is no easy task, but I think Owens Corning, a roofing, insulation, and composites company, has done an excellent job of it in recent years. If the market values a stock at a low price-to-free cash flow (FCF) multiple, it makes sense for management to use that cash flow to buy back stock.', 'As you can see in the chart, the market did grant the company a lowly FCF multiple, and management opportunistically took advantage of this by buying back stock, resulting in a significant drop in outstanding shares.', ""Taking the argument further, the company's FCF per share has improved markedly more than its impressive enough FCF due to reduction in the share count."", ""Of course, the company could have used the cash to raise its dividend even more than it did so (from $0.90 per share in 2019 to $2.40 per share in 2024), but doing so might have restricted its ability to make a game-changing acquisition, as it's trying to do now by acquiring door company Masonite on an excellent valuation at a time of negative sentiment toward housing-related stocks."", 'I think the deal makes sense, as did the share buybacks, and the acquisition of Masonite will hopefully add even more value for shareholders.', 'Scott Levine (Phillips 66): From managing 72,000 miles of pipeline throughout the United States to manufacturing chemicals to operating refineries, Phillips 66 generates strong revenue -- as well as cash flow -- from a variety of energy industry businesses. Over the past three years, for example, Phillips 66 has averaged annual operational cash flow of $8 billion. And to the delight of investors, the company is generous in returning capital to shareholders through its share buyback plan and its dividend.', ""Since its spinoff from ConocoPhillips in 2012, Phillips 66 has returned $39 billion to shareholders in stock buybacks and dividends. And there's more to come in the remainder of 2024."", ""Over the past two years, the company had totaled $8.3 billion in shareholder distributions, and it plans on meeting an upwardly revised target of returning a total $13 billion to $14 billion by the end of 2024. Regarding stock buybacks, Phillips 66 has used its strong cash flow to reduce its outstanding shares by 31% since 2012. The company's aggressive approach to rewarding shareholders warrants recognition for investors with an eye on dividends. From the first dividend it paid in Q3 2012 through Q4 2023, Phillips 66 has increased its distribution at a 16% compound annual growth rate."", ""With management's dedication to returning capital to shareholders, Phillips 66 has vastly outperformed the S&P 500 since its spinoff."", ""While there's no guarantee that management will extend its policy of returning ample capital to shareholders, management has stated a target of returning more than 50% of operating cash flow to investors. This is in concert with the company's strong financial position, which features an investment-grade balance sheet."", 'Before you buy stock in Chevron, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Chevron wasn’t one of them.

And the year before that, the company raised its payouts by 6.6%."", ""This doesn't mean that the rate hikes are going to continue shrinking, but it is a possibility. The company has been pivoting toward growth after spinning off its consumer health business last year, which may result in a greater need for cash in the future as it invests in growth opportunities. Plus, with tens of thousands of talcum lawsuits to resolve, it is facing the prospect of some costly legal battles ahead."", ""A decade ago, I would have said this is a safe dividend stock to own, but it's hard to make a case for that today. Although it's likely that Johnson & Johnson will still increase its dividend payments, the rate of increase may slow in the years ahead. And there's the outside chance that if the legal bills pile up and its talcum payouts prove to be more than expected, a dividend cut may even take place."", ""Although its payout ratio looks manageable at 64% of earnings and its 3.4% yield may be sustainable in the short run, Johnson & Johnson isn't the super-safe dividend stock it once was, and investors should tread with caution here."", ""Atlanta-based utility Southern Company announced on April 22 that it would be increasing its quarterly dividend by two cents to $0.72. At 2.9%, it's a modest bump up to the payout, but it's also consistent. This increase marks the 23rd consecutive year that Southern has raised its dividend, and typically, the increases have just been modest two-cent hikes."", ""For dividend investors, utility stocks have good value because they can often provide a lot of long-term stability and predictability. In three of the past four years, Southern has posted a profit between $3 billion and $4 billion. While there can be some earnings volatility for utility companies depending on the weather, these are the types of stocks that can be ideal for risk-averse investors. Southern's stock has a beta value of 0.5, indicating that there isn't a whole lot of volatility with this investment."", 'In terms of both earnings and dividends, Southern can make for a dependable and predictable income stock to hang onto for the long haul. At 3.9%, it has the highest yield on this list.', ""When a company announces a double-digit dividend increase, it usually means it has been performing exceptionally well. On April 2, off-price retailer TJX announced it was raising its dividend by a generous rate of 13%. This is the 27th time in the past 28 years that TJX has made an increase to its dividend. Not only is it increasing the dividend, but it's also planning to repurchase at least $2 billion worth of shares for fiscal 2025."", ""For the company's fiscal 2024, which ended on Feb. 3, TJX reported 9% revenue growth, with sales topping $54.2 billion. And net income of $4.5 billion was up an impressive 28%. The company says its same-store growth rate of 5% was at the high end of its plan as it benefited from an increase in transactions."", ""Business has been strong for TJX, and the big dividend hike inspires confidence that the company's trajectory will remain positive. Although TJX's yield of 1.6% may appear modest, between its encouraging growth and generous rate increases, this can make for a well-balanced dividend stock to buy and hold right now."", 'Before you buy stock in Johnson & Johnson, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Johnson & Johnson wasn’t one of them.

The filing reveals a company that continues to leverage its expertise in human therapeutics, with a focus on areas of high unmet medical need. Amgen Inc's financial tables from the first quarter of 2024 show a significant increase in product sales, rising from $5.846 billion in Q1 2023 to $7.118 billion in Q1 2024. This growth is indicative of the company's strong market presence and the successful integration of Horizon Therapeutics, which has expanded Amgen's portfolio in rare diseases. However, the company also faced increased interest expenses and a net loss, reflecting the complex financial landscape it navigates. This SWOT analysis aims to dissect these financial nuances and provide a comprehensive overview of Amgen Inc's strategic position."", 'Warning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with AMGN.', ""Product Portfolio and Innovation: Amgen Inc's strength lies in its diverse and innovative product lineup, which includes treatments for inflammatory diseases, cancer, and rare conditions. The acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics has further bolstered its offerings, particularly in the rare disease space with drugs like Tepezza. Amgen's commitment to R&D ensures a pipeline of potential blockbusters, maintaining its competitive edge."", ""Financial Resilience: Despite macroeconomic headwinds, Amgen Inc has demonstrated financial resilience. The increase in product sales and strategic acquisitions signal strong revenue generation capabilities. Amgen's financial discipline and robust balance sheet provide the flexibility to navigate market volatility and invest in growth opportunities."", ""Global Reach and Market Share: With a presence in over 100 countries, Amgen Inc has established a significant global footprint. Its leading products, such as Prolia and Enbrel, command substantial market shares in their respective categories, underpinning the company's strength in key therapeutic areas."", ""Dependence on Key Products: Amgen Inc's reliance on a few flagship products for a large portion of its revenue poses a risk. Any disruption to these products, whether from patent expirations, competitive pressures, or regulatory changes, could impact the company's financial performance."", 'Regulatory and Legal Challenges: Amgen Inc faces ongoing regulatory scrutiny and legal disputes, which can lead to costly settlements or delays in product approvals. The complexity of biologic drug development also exposes the company to heightened regulatory risks compared to traditional pharmaceuticals.', 'Operational Complexities: The integration of acquired companies, such as Horizon, introduces operational complexities and challenges in realizing synergies. Managing a growing portfolio across different therapeutic areas requires effective coordination and can strain resources.', 'Biosimilars Market Expansion: The growing demand for biosimilars presents a significant opportunity for Amgen Inc. With its expertise in biologics, the company is well-positioned to capitalize on this trend and expand its biosimilar portfolio, catering to cost-conscious healthcare systems and patients.', ""Rare Disease Treatments: The acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics has provided Amgen with a foothold in the lucrative rare disease market. The company can leverage Horizon's existing treatments and pipeline to address unmet medical needs and command premium pricing."", 'Strategic Collaborations: Amgen Inc has the opportunity to forge strategic partnerships and collaborations to enhance its R&D capabilities, access new markets, and share the risks and costs associated with drug development.', 'Pricing Pressures and Healthcare Reforms: Amgen Inc operates in an environment where pricing pressures from payers and government healthcare reforms, such as the Inflation Reduction Act, can erode profit margins. The company must navigate these challenges while maintaining its value proposition.', 'Competition and Patent Expirations: The biotechnology industry is highly competitive, with numerous players vying for market share. Patent expirations of key products expose Amgen to generic and biosimilar competition, threatening its revenue streams.', ""Macroeconomic Uncertainties: Global economic instability, including inflation and currency fluctuations, can impact Amgen's international operations and profitability. The company must adapt to these external factors to sustain its growth trajectory."", ""In conclusion, Amgen Inc (NASDAQ:AMGN) exhibits a strong competitive position, underpinned by its diverse product portfolio, financial resilience, and global reach. However, the company must address its reliance on key products, regulatory challenges, and operational complexities to maintain its industry leadership. The opportunities in the biosimilars market and rare disease treatments offer promising avenues for growth, while pricing pressures, competition, and macroeconomic uncertainties pose significant threats. Amgen's strategic focus on innovation, market expansion, and partnerships will be crucial in leveraging its strengths and opportunities to mitigate weaknesses and threats."", 'This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

153,b824c979-a067-3fde-af99-746dbfd90c02,NEM,2024-05-04,4 Colossal Growth Stocks You'll Regret Not Buying in the New Nasdaq Bull Market,Motley Fool,https://finance.yahoo.com/m/b824c979-a067-3fde-af99-746dbfd90c02/4-colossal-growth-stocks.html,1714813560,STORY,"['MA', 'COMP', 'BIDU', 'NEE', 'NEM']","['Putting your money to work on Wall Street requires patience and perspective. Since this decade began, all three major stock indexes have vacillated between bear and bull markets in successive years, with these swings most pronounced in the growth stock-powered Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC).', 'During the 2022 bear market, the Nasdaq Composite brought up the caboose with a 33% loss. But since closing this chapter, the Nasdaq has gained 51% and, as recently as last month, pushed to a new record-closing high above 16,400. This move confirms that the Nasdaq is firmly in a new, albeit young, bull market.', ""What's particularly interesting about this leading index is that it's retraced nearly 4% off its all-time high, as of the closing bell on May 2. For long-term-minded investors with cash at the ready, it means growth stocks can still be found at a bargain."", ""What follows are four colossal growth stocks you'll regret not buying in the new Nasdaq bull market."", ""The first sensational growth stock that's begging to be bought in the early stages of the new Nasdaq bull market is payment-processing leader Mastercard (NYSE: MA)."", ""The only real knock against Mastercard is that it's a cyclical company. If the U.S. and global economy were to dip into a recession, consumer and enterprise spending would be expected to decline, which would have a negative effect on the fees Mastercard collects from merchants to process transactions. A couple of predictive indicators, including a historic decline in M2 money supply, suggest a growing likelihood of weakness to come in the U.S. economy."", ""On the other hand, history is very much on Mastercard's side. Whereas most periods of economic expansion last for years, there hasn't been a single U.S. recession since the end of World War II that endured longer than 18 months. Extended periods of growth allow Mastercard to consistently grow its sales by double digits year after year."", ""Though it's a bit of a subtle point, Mastercard's purposeful avoidance of lending is another reason for its ongoing success and sustained profit margin of more than 40%. Companies that lend have to set aside capital to cover possible credit delinquencies and loan losses that arise during recessions. Strictly focusing on payment processing means Mastercard avoids these pitfalls and bounces back from downturns faster than most lending institutions."", ""Additionally, Mastercard's growth runway stretches for decades. Cross-border volume growth of 18% in the March-ended quarter speaks to just how large the opportunity is for it to continue expanding its payment infrastructure into underbanked regions, such as Africa, the Middle East, and Southeastern Asia."", 'While Mastercard might look a bit pricey at nearly 27 times forward-year earnings, this represents a 21% discount to its average trailing-five-year forward-earnings multiple.', ""A second colossal growth stock that you'll be kicking yourself for not buying in the early stages of the new Nasdaq bull market is gold-mining company Newmont (NYSE: NEM). Yes, you read that right... a gold stock that's also a growth stock."", ""Before (pardon the necessary pun) digging into company specifics, it's important to recognize the elephant in the room: The spot price of gold has surged to an all-time high in 2024."", ""The sizable rally in physical gold can be explained by a stubbornly high prevailing rate of inflation. In other words, people are looking for a place to park their cash (rather than letting it sit under the proverbial mattress) where it won't lose value over time. For decades, gold has been an asset that skittish investors have flocked to during periods of high inflation and/or economic turbulence. If the spot price of gold remains near an all-time high, it should translate into higher profitability for gold miners across the board."", ""One of the clearest company-specific catalysts for Newmont is its $16.8 billion, all-share buyout of Australia's Newcrest Mining, which closed in November. Newmont anticipates recognizing $500 million in cost synergies by the end of this year, as well as beefing up the combined company's operating cash flow by $2 billion within two years of closing. Buying Newcrest further solidified Newmont's already impressive gold and copper reserve profile."", 'To add to the above, Newmont\'s size presents clear cost advantages. Newmont has 10 ""Tier 1 assets,"" which are mines producing at least 500,000 gold equivalent ounces per year, with an all-in sustaining cost in the lower half of the industry, and a mine life of greater than 10 years.', ""Newmont's earnings per share (EPS) is forecast to double between 2023 and 2027 to around $3.20, which makes this lustrous stock all the more delectable for growth seekers."", ""The third exhilarating growth stock you'll regret not adding to your portfolio with the Nasdaq firmly in a new bull market is China-based Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU)."", ""The reason Baidu's stock has struggled recently is because the Chinese economy hasn't bounced back from the COVID-19 pandemic as quickly as expected. Multiple years of stringent lockdowns created supply chain kinks that are still working themselves out."", ""But as I pointed out earlier, patience and perspective are important when investing on Wall Street. Although China's economic ramp-up is taking a bit longer than anticipated, its burgeoning middle class gives the world's No. 2 economy by gross domestic product a path to sustained annual growth of 5% (or higher). Most large China-based companies, including Baidu, are going to benefit from this extensive growth runway."", ""Baidu's foundational operating segment is its internet search engine. Baidu's internet search share in China clocked in at close to 52% in April 2024, and has consistently come in at between 50% and 85% dating back 10 years, based on data from GlobalStats. Businesses are well aware that the best way to reach Chinese consumers is to target their advertising on Baidu's search engine. When China's economy finds its stride, once again, Baidu's ad revenue should increase substantially."", ""However, Baidu's most exciting growth catalyst is artificial intelligence (AI). Enterprise cloud spending is still in its infancy in China, which bodes well for Baidu's AI Cloud platform. Meanwhile, subsidiary Apollo Go surpassed more than 5 million cumulative autonomous rides since its inception. Perhaps it's no surprise that Baidu is providing electric vehicle maker Tesla with its mapping license for data collection on Chinese roads."", ""Baidu is forecast to grow its EPS by roughly 12% through 2027, but is currently valued at less than 10 times forward-year EPS. That's what we call a growth stock bargain!"", ""A fourth colossal growth stock you'll regret not buying in the new Nasdaq bull market is the U.S.'s largest electric utility by market cap, NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE)."", 'Generally, utility stocks are slow-growing businesses that investors seek out for their low volatility and market-topping income. NextEra has been consistently doubling or tripling the growth rate of other electric utilities for more than a decade, which qualifies it as a growth stock in an industry where very few exist.', ""The not-so-subtle secret to NextEra's long-term outperformance has been its focus on renewable energy. Out of its 72 gigawatts (GW) of capacity, 36 GW can be traced to green energy sources, including 24 GW of wind and 7 GW of solar. No utility in the world has more wind or solar capacity than NextEra Energy."", ""Though investing in cleaner energy solutions has been pricey, it's paid off in a big way for NextEra. Adjusted earnings have averaged a 10% growth rate since 2013, with dividend growth coming in at a compound annual rate of 11% over the same span. Substantially lower electricity generation costs have bolstered the company's profit and payout growth rates, compared to its peers."", ""What's more, NextEra Energy has no intentions of paring back its clean energy investments. Even with the Federal Reserve undertaking its steepest rate-hiking cycle in four decades, NextEra plans to bring between 32.7 GW and 41.8 GW in collective clean energy projects online between the start of 2023 and end of 2026. This should help it sustain a superior growth rate within the utility sector."", ""Shares of NextEra Energy can be snatched up right now by opportunistic growth seekers for less than 19 times consensus EPS forecasts for 2025. That's a 27% discount to its average forward-year earnings multiple over the last five years."", 'Before you buy stock in Mastercard, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Mastercard wasn’t one of them.

Existing poles were replaced with a stronger class pole installed deeper in the ground to resist the impact of severe wind. Cross-arms, pole hardware, and primary wire were also upgraded to a new storm hardening standard. PSEG Long Island also invested in technology and emergency response process improvements.', 'Power On, a program that started in the spring of 2020, continues the work that the Federal Emergency Management Agency program initiated. Since the launch of Power On, more than 352 miles of the most vulnerable distribution mainline and branch line circuits on Long Island and in the Rockaways have been storm hardened with stronger poles and wire, and other system enhancing devices.', 'For more storm hardening details, visit psegliny.com/inthecommunity/currentinitiatives/stormhardeningprojects.', ""PSEG Long Island's climate change studies to shape proactive measures in years aheadPSEG Long Island is also pleased to announce that the findings of its recent Climate Change Vulnerability Study are shaping an in-depth Climate Change Resilience Plan to be published by PSEG Long Island and LIPA later this year."", 'The study considered global climate projections through 2080. Data was downscaled to the PSEG Long Island service area using New York State Energy Research and Development Authority and Columbia University datasets. Supplementary analyses were conducted for additional hazards, including severe storms such as tropical cyclones.', 'Among its many findings, the study considers risks associated with increases in average daily temperatures and more frequent, longer heat waves as the century progresses. It also considers greater asset exposure to coastal flooding due to rising sea levels, as well as risks associated with a modest increase in the maximum sustained wind speeds of tropical cyclones. It sets the stage for proactive initiatives to address them in the Climate Change Resilience Plan.

The Climate Action Council (CAC) Scoping Plan, released in December 2022, also recommended that LIPA, NYPA and New York State's municipal utilities undertake studies to identify vulnerability to climate change and establish resilience plans."", ""PSEG Long Island is committed to staying aligned with and integrating rapidly emerging standards and filings pertaining to sustainability and climate resilience into its practice. While PSEG Long Island is not required to file a plan with the Public Service Commission because of its unique regulatory position as a service provider to LIPA, the company has elected to conduct a CCVS and develop a CCRP that is largely in line with the efforts being undertaken by the State's investor-owned electric utilities."", ""Here's how customers can prepare for a severe storm and other emergencies:"", 'Ensure you have a battery-powered radio and fresh batteries.', 'Check your supply of flashlights, blankets, nonperishable food and bottled water.', 'Create an emergency communications plan.', 'Develop an evacuation plan.', 'Charge your cell phones, tablets and other mobile devices.', 'Make sure to have cash available.

158,2d9228bb-11ae-3052-97a2-a468d027f51e,PEG,2024-05-04,Earnings Miss: Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated Missed EPS By 16% And Analysts Are Revising Their Forecasts,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-miss-public-enterprise-group-105142065.html,1714733502,STORY,['PEG'],"[""It's shaping up to be a tough period for Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated (NYSE:PEG), which a week ago released some disappointing quarterly results that could have a notable impact on how the market views the stock. Public Service Enterprise Group missed earnings this time around, with US$2.8b revenue coming in 8.8% below what the analysts had modelled. Statutory earnings per share (EPS) of US$1.06 also fell short of expectations by 16%. The analysts typically update their forecasts at each earnings report, and we can judge from their estimates whether their view of the company has changed or if there are any new concerns to be aware of. So we gathered the latest post-earnings forecasts to see what estimates suggest is in store for next year."", ' See our latest analysis for Public Service Enterprise Group ', ""Taking into account the latest results, the current consensus from Public Service Enterprise Group's 15 analysts is for revenues of US$10.8b in 2024. This would reflect a satisfactory 5.7% increase on its revenue over the past 12 months. Statutory per-share earnings are expected to be US$3.68, roughly flat on the last 12 months. Before this earnings report, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$10.6b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$3.68 in 2024. There doesn't appear to have been a major change in sentiment following the results, other than the small lift in revenue estimates."", 'Even though revenue forecasts increased, there was no change to the consensus price target of US$68.91, suggesting the analysts are focused on earnings as the driver of value creation. The consensus price target is just an average of individual analyst targets, so - it could be handy to see how wide the range of underlying estimates is. Currently, the most bullish analyst values Public Service Enterprise Group at US$77.00 per share, while the most bearish prices it at US$61.50. Still, with such a tight range of estimates, it suggeststhe analysts have a pretty good idea of what they think the company is worth.', ""Looking at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can make sense of these forecasts is to see how they measure up against both past performance and industry growth estimates. The analysts are definitely expecting Public Service Enterprise Group's growth to accelerate, with the forecast 7.7% annualised growth to the end of 2024 ranking favourably alongside historical growth of 2.3% per annum over the past five years. Compare this with other companies in the same industry, which are forecast to grow their revenue 4.4% annually. It seems obvious that, while the growth outlook is brighter than the recent past, the analysts also expect Public Service Enterprise Group to grow faster than the wider industry."", ""The most important thing to take away is that there's been no major change in sentiment, with the analysts reconfirming that the business is performing in line with their previous earnings per share estimates. Pleasantly, they also upgraded their revenue estimates, and their forecasts suggest the business is expected to grow faster than the wider industry. The consensus price target held steady at US$68.91, with the latest estimates not enough to have an impact on their price targets."", ""With that said, the long-term trajectory of the company's earnings is a lot more important than next year. We have estimates - from multiple Public Service Enterprise Group analysts - going out to 2026, and you can see them free on our platform here."", ""Plus, you should also learn about the   2 warning signs  we've spotted with Public Service Enterprise Group (including 1 which is potentially serious) ."", 'Have feedback on this article?

PEG's financial statements reveal a solid performance with capital expenditures of $739 million primarily directed towards Transmission and Distribution (T&D) system reliability and advanced electric metering. Moreover, the company has invested approximately $118 million in energy efficiency programs, reflecting its commitment to sustainable growth. With a focus on regulated investments to modernize energy infrastructure and improve service reliability, PEG is poised to meet the evolving demands of its customer base."", 'Warning! GuruFocus has detected 10 Warning Signs with PEG.', ""Infrastructure Investment and Regulatory Support: PEG's strength lies in its significant investment in infrastructure to enhance system reliability and resilience. The company's $739 million capital expenditure in T&D and advanced metering infrastructure underscores its commitment to modernization. Regulatory support, as evidenced by the approval of various projects and programs, further solidifies PEG's position, enabling it to maintain a steady revenue stream and invest in growth initiatives."", ""Clean Energy Focus: PEG's investment in clean energy projects, particularly solar, aligns with the global shift towards sustainable energy sources.

(NYSE:ZTS) Q1 2024 Earnings Call Transcript May 2, 2024', 'Zoetis Inc. beats earnings expectations. Reported EPS is $1.38, expectations were $1.35. Zoetis Inc. isn’t one of the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds at the end of the third quarter (see the details here).', 'Operator: Welcome to the First Quarter 2024 Financial Results Conference Call and Webcast for Zoetis. Hosting the call today is Steve Frank, Vice President of Investor Relations for Zoetis. The presentation materials and additional financial tables are currently posted on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. The presentation slides can be managed by you, the viewer, and will not be forwarded automatically. In addition, a replay of this call will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of the call via dial-in or on our Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. [Operator Instructions]. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Steve Frank. Steve, you may begin.', ""Steve Frank: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Zoetis first quarter 2024 earnings call. I am joined today by Kristin Peck, our Chief Executive Officer; and Wetteny Joseph, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'll remind you that the slides presented on this call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website, and that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements, and that actual results could differ materially from those projections. For a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statements in today's press release and our SEC filings, including, but not limited to, our annual report on Form 10-K and our reports on Form 10-Q."", ""Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures, which were not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings press release and the company's 8-K filing dated today, Thursday, May 2, 2024. We also cite operational results, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange. And with that, I will turn the call over to Kristin."", 'Kristin Peck: Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter earnings call for 2024. Today, we reported outstanding first quarter results underscored by steady demand for our products, a focused strategy and our purpose-driven colleagues. We delivered 12% operational revenue growth and grew adjusted net income 15% operationally in line with the tenets of our value proposition. Driven by the launch of our osteoarthritis pain franchise, the U.S. led the way with 16% growth and 8% operational growth internationally. More specifically, globally, Librela grew 189% operationally, including $40 million sales in the U.S., in line with our expectations. The powerful human animal bond fueled demand for our companion animal portfolio with 20% growth operationally, while livestock declined 1% operationally.', ""This quarter's results even amidst global uncertainty are a testament once again to the power of our diverse and durable portfolio across markets, species and therapeutic areas. It also highlights the continued rise and resilience of the animal health industry. Our purpose and performance are rooted in science, which has always been the great disruptor. And as animal health is increasingly essential for nutrition and companionship, caregivers demand even more high quality innovation. That means we identified the most prevalent areas of unmet veterinary need and invest in, develop, manufacture and deliver life-changing products that customers have been waiting for. Take for example, Librela and Solensia, our injectable monoclonal antibodies to treat OA pain in dogs and cats, which are helping millions of pets return to play."", ""With more than 18 million doses distributed worldwide, we are providing long lasting relief to animals, many of whom were previously undiagnosed or untreated due to limitations of NSAIDs. With nearly 40% of all dogs suffering from OA pain globally, we believe just one-third of those are being treated. So we're just scratching the surface of care. And cats are visiting the clinic more often. In fact, we're helping curve clinic fears with Bonqat, the first FDA approved product to alleviate anxiety in cats, which means we're expanding care in a historically under-medicalized area of the market. We understand that social media is a form for convening, a place for pet owners to connect and to share. But we also have a responsibility to empower our customers to make informed decisions grounded in science and data."", 'We are unwavering in our commitment to rigorous safety and quality standards, which has earned us the trust and confidence of veterinarians worldwide. Backed by that commitment, Librela and Solensia are safe and effective. They are anchored in 10 years of science and have been used in Europe for more than three years. In the U.S., 78% of veterinarians who are at the center of care are very satisfied with Librela. This is driven by real world experience and consistent with the feedback we hear in other markets. And our research indicates that 46% of vets globally will treat OA earlier and 65% will treat more dogs now that Librela is available. To accurately reaffirm the safety and efficacy of these therapies, we are doubling down, working directly with veterinarians who need these products, hosting live sessions with our Chief Medical Officer and expanding online education and training while deploying capital to expand our DTC strategy.', ""And veterinarians continue to be confident in Librela as evidenced by a recent blind survey of U.S. vets confirming that perception and intent to prescribe remain unchanged. We remain confident that OA pain could be our next $1 billion franchise, because we are meeting the needs of an underserved market. We are growing by nearly every metric, including adoption, penetration, reorder rates, patient share and expanded utilization. And looking at our 4-week rolling average in the U.S., we're excited to report that sales steadily increased through April. Our performance speaks to the power of the human animal bond, discerning pet owners want option and they will work with our vets to find relief for their best friend. Beyond OA pain, Zoetis has been able to lead the market in other key categories because we deeply understand our customers' needs."", 'This allows us to not only compete in existing markets, but again to create entirely new ones. And Science has created something completely unique to our industry, $2 billion franchises. Our parasiticides portfolio expanded the total market based on deep customer insights. Before Simparica and Simparica Trio, we were number 5 in this category. These innovations changed how we compete. Today, we are number 2 and continue gaining share and growing the market even in the face of competition. Similarly, we were first to recognize the new therapies where needed to treat canine ish safely and effectively. That market foresight changed the treatment paradigm and revolutionized pet care. A decade of dermatology has led to three products, 20 major lifecycle enhancements including Cytopoint, the first ever animal health monoclonal antibody and the first chewable with Apoquel chew.', ""From what was once believed to be just $100 million market has grown to $1.4 billion, because we know what our customers need. Today, more than 18 million dogs are treated for allergic ish and atopic dermatitis and another 13 million remain untreated globally. We built $1 billion franchise and demonstrated the durability of our portfolio and we will continue growing this franchise underpinned by strong brand equity, first mover advantage, lifecycle innovation and strong customer relationships. We've led in parasiticides, dermatology and now OA pain. And each time our innovations have created new categories in animal health, you've seen the total industry opportunity expand. Now moving to livestock. I'm sure you all saw the news this week on the announcement of our agreement with Phibro Animal Health to sell our global medicated feed additives and certain water soluble product portfolios and related assets for $350 million."", ""This deal is another great example of Zoetis' disciplined capital allocation strategy to focus investments in areas with the greatest growth potential and innovation that are aligned with our key capabilities. I'm confident that under Phibro's management, the global reach of these products will continue to expand to meet customer needs worldwide. We remain very committed to livestock and to sharpening our focus and our core innovative livestock growth areas including preventatives, antibiotic alternatives and genetics. In summary, for more than 70 years, Zoetis has been leading the industry with our commitment to innovation. We've invested over $5 billion in R&D since our IPO, which has brought more than 300 product lines to the market. Science is and always has been the great disruptor and at the core of our success in delivering the innovations that veterinarians, livestock producers and pet owners expect from us."", ""Our pursuit of science has led to breakthroughs in dermatology like Cytopoint and Apoquel chew, in parasiticides and Simparica Trio and now the latest in OA pain with the Librela and Solensia that are revolutionizing animal health. Blazing new trails isn't easy. But time and again, our purpose driven colleagues have proven their ability to expand our industry leadership and forge entirely new markets. And we remain committed to delivering strong growth through our innovative franchises and diverse portfolio, while continuing to invest for the future. Looking ahead to the remainder of 2024, our increased operational guidance reflects the resilience of the animal health market and the execution of our strategic growth priorities. We will continue to be disciplined yet adaptable in our approach to the opportunities, potential challenges and economic shift that occurred throughout the year."", 'And with that, I will turn it over to Wetteny.', 'Wetteny Joseph: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. As Kristin mentioned, we had an outstanding start to the year, driven by the underlying strength of our companion animal portfolio, particularly our innovative products, as well as price growth across all species. In the first quarter, we generated revenue of $2.2 billion, growing 10% on a reported basis and 12% on an operational basis. Adjusted net income of $634 million grew 4% on a reported basis and 15% on an operational basis. Our 12% operational revenue growth was due to the underlying strength of our companion animal portfolio aided by the impact of a weak comparative quarter in our U.S. companion animal business. However, the majority of this visibility to growth was offset by headwinds related to economic conditions in China, the impact of a tough comparative quarter in livestock due to the timing of supply for certain products last year and inventory destocking related to our U.S. diagnostics sales model change.', 'Of the 12% operational revenue growth, 7% is from price with 5% growth in volume. While we saw price growth across our portfolio, price was favorably impacted by hyperinflationary markets, especially Argentina, which contributed 2% to our overall price growth. The volume growth was driven primarily by new products, including our monoclonal antibodies for OA pain, Librela and Solensia as well as our key dermatology products and Simparica Trio. On a segment basis, the U.S. posted $1.2 billion in revenue, growing 16% on the quarter, while our international segment reported revenue of $1 billion with operational growth of 8% on the quarter. Our companion animal portfolio was the main driver of revenue growth in Q1, growing 20% operationally. This growth was partially offset by livestock, which declined 1% on an operational basis.', 'We saw double-digit operational companion animal growth in both our U.S. and our international segments again this quarter, driven by the strong performance of our innovative products with contributions from both volume and price. Simparica Trio was the primary driver of growth in the quarter generating $243 million globally, representing operational growth of 61%. We saw strong demand for Trio as well as continued growth in patient share even with competition. Our OA pain mAbs were also a significant contributor to growth, posting $131 million in the quarter. Global growth came from the impact of new launch markets both in the U.S. and internationally. In our early launch EU markets, recent vet surveys showed an increase in muscle on therapy and expansion into more moderate OA cases.', 'Our key dermatology products grew 25% operationally in the quarter with $360 million in global revenue. Wealth within dermatology was driven primarily by our Apoquel franchise where we are seeing solid conversion to Apoquel chewable including a modest impact from the initial distributor stocking in the U.S. Cytopoint growth continues to be driven by vet and pet owner preference for injectable methods of treatment. Our global companion animal diagnostics portfolio declined 12% operationally with declines in the U.S. driven by a distribution model change. These declines were anticipated as our distribution partners sold off their remaining inventory due to our transition to a direct only model for our U.S. diagnostics portfolio. U.S. declines were partially offset by growth internationally.', 'Our livestock portfolio declined 1% operationally as expected, driven by a tough comparative quarter in the prior year, especially in the U.S. as well as impacts from the ongoing economic conditions in China. This decline was partially offset by price growth in our other international markets. Now moving on to revenue growth by segment for the quarter. U.S. revenue was $1.2 billion in the quarter growing 16% with companion animal growth of 25% and livestock posting a 7% decline. The companion animal performance in the quarter was driven by Simparica Trio, our key dermatology portfolio and the impact of the launch of Librela in the U.S. as well as the impact of a weak comparative quarter. Our outstanding U.S. companion animal growth came in the quarter where we saw vet clinic visits decreased 1.5%.', 'We continue to see growth in the therapeutic visits, while wellness visits drove the decline. Sales outgrowth in the retail and home delivery continued to uptake vet clinic fulfillment, which is based on growing pet owner preference for these alternative channels. This dynamic is expected to put continued pressure on total vet clinic visits without impacting our expectations for revenue. Despite the visit decline, revenue and spend per visit in the clinic grew 4.5% and 6%, respectively, which reflects continued pet owner willingness to pay. Turning to product performance, Simparica Trio posted sales of $205 million in the quarter growing 61%. We continue to be the market leader in the triple combination parasiticide space. Our leading footprint across channels has allowed us to continue to drive dosage growth through increased compliance even with declines in wellness visits at the clinic.', 'In addition to a weak comparable period in the prior year, we are seeing favorable price realization due to more targeted discount programs to vets as well as channel dynamics. Key dermatology product sales in the U.S. were $233 million for the quarter growing 27%. We saw growth in both price and volume and across both Apoquel and Cytopoint. Growth also benefited from a weak comparable period in the prior year. Market demand for our dermatology products remains high. In the quarter, we saw growth in both our patient share as well as higher periodic visits in the clinic. Additionally, growth of retail auto-ship programs continue to bolster compliance. At the beginning of April, we made Apoquel chewable available through our distribution partners.', 'Our pay mAbs, Librela and Solensia posted a combined $57 million in U.S. sales in Q1. Librela generated $40 million in the quarter with underlying vet demand continuing to build on the momentum from our full launch in Q4 of last year. Excluding the impact of the initial clinic stocking, which we were provided last quarter, we are seeing robust sequential quarter growth in Librela in line with expectations. We continue to see good growth in penetration as well as strong reorder rates, which are approaching 80%, all of which points to positive real world satisfaction in the clinic and among pet owners. We remain confident not just in the safety and efficacy of Librela, but also in our expected performance. As Kristin alluded to, we have seen steady increasing trends in our trailing 4-week sales average in the U.S. even into April after the increased media attention.', 'We continue to see steady progress in Solensia, which had U.S. sales of $17 million in the quarter, more than doubling our prior year Q1 sales. We have indicated the feline market needs significant development, but we are pleased with our progress thus far. Solensia is now the market-leading product for feline OA pain in the U.S. and we have seen a significant increase in the medicalized patient pool since launch. Our U.S. companion animal diagnostics portfolio declined 21% in the quarter, driven primarily by distributor inventory work downs following our channel strategy change. This destocking is in line with our expectations and has negligible impact on our underlying clinic demand. U.S. livestock declined 7% in the quarter, while our underlying business performance in the quarter was as expected.', 'Our results are reflective of a strong comparative period in Q1 of 2023 in which we grew 15% due to the return of supply on several products, primarily in cattle. Sales of swine products declined due to decreased sales of vaccines as well as JAKs. In poultry, we saw declines as a result of increased generic competition in our medicated feed additive products. Moving on to our International segment, where revenue grew 3% on a reported basis and 8% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Companion animal grew 14% operationally and livestock grew 2% operationally. Increased sales of our international companion animal products were driven by OA pain mAbs, key dermatology products, vaccines and small animal parasiticides. This growth was partially offset by impacts in China.', 'Our international OA pain mAbs grew 67% operationally to $74 million in combined revenue in the quarter. International Librela sales were $59 million, growing 71% operationally. Growth is balanced across new launch markets and our first wave EU markets. We continue to see evolution in the European markets where we have seen expansion in Librela’s use in moderate OA cases, which according to the latest vet surveys now represents the majority of Librela patients in Europe. We remain pleased with the success of our DTC advertising campaigns in increasing pet owner awareness of OA. Solensia sales were $15 million internationally in the quarter, growing 54% on an operational basis. Our international key dermatology portfolio grew 23% operationally in the quarter, posting $127 million in sales.', ""We saw double-digit operational growth across most of our major markets driven by higher compliance and new patients. Wealth was also favorably impacted by pre price increased buy-ups in Japan and certain European markets. Our international small animal parasiticide portfolio grew 6% operationally, driven by our Solensia franchise with Simparica Trio growing 58% operationally to $38 million in sales. Trio growth benefited from continued uptake in Europe, driven by key account penetration and field force effectiveness as well as contributions from Trio's launch in China. Simparica posted $56 million in revenue, growing 22% on an operational basis in the quarter. This growth was partially offset by 29% operational decline in our Revolution franchise, which generates a high proportion of sales in China."", 'International livestock grew 2% operationally in the quarter, driven by price increases especially in high inflationary markets. Price growth was partially offset by volume declines across all of our species, partially driven by a tough comparative period in the prior year due to the return of supply of certain livestock products. The volume declines in livestock were driven by cattle due to a tough comparable period related to supply and worsening market conditions in Australia. Our international swine portfolio saw volume declines driven by China, where we saw lower hog prices as well as a reduction in herd sizes. In sheep, we saw declines from herd reductions due to expected weather conditions in Australia and New Zealand as well as supply constraints on eight key products.', 'As we mentioned last quarter, we continue to see economic challenges in China, where low consumer spending and high urban unemployment have reduced spending. We are also seeing a slowdown in livestock with lower pork prices and smaller herd sizes. The impact on our growth is expected to moderate late in the year, but we expect to continue to see headwinds throughout the year across both companion animal and livestock. Now moving on to the rest of the P&L for the quarter. Adjusted gross margins of 70.7% declined 10 basis points on a reported basis compared to the prior year. Foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact of 180 basis points on our reported adjusted gross margins. Excluding FX, we saw higher margins due to price increases, favorable mix and lower freight costs, partially offset by higher manufacturing costs, especially in hyperinflationary markets.', 'Adjusted operating expenses increased 11% operationally, driven primarily by SG&A growth of 10% operationally, mainly due to higher compensation related expenses as well as increased advertising and promotion spend on our OA pain mAbs. R&D grew 13% on an operational basis, driven by higher project spend related to both recent acquisitions as well as advancements of our pipeline candidates. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 19.7%, a decrease of 80 basis points, primarily due to a higher benefit in the U.S. related to foreign derived intangible income and a more favorable jurisdictional mix of earnings. And finally, adjusted net income grew 15% operationally despite a $31 million headwind to growth from the non-recurring benefit of our prior year royalty settlement.', ""Adjusted diluted EPS grew 17% operationally for the quarter. Capital expenditures in the first quarter were $140 million. In the quarter, we repurchased $339 million of Zoetis shares. Before moving to guidance, I wanted to comment on our recent announcement to divest our medicated feed additive portfolio and certain water soluble products to Phibro Animal Health. This is a transaction that demonstrates Zoetis' disciplined capital allocation strategy to focus our investments on innovative solutions that advance animal health, productivity and sustainability. This divestiture will allow us to remain focused on other livestock solutions, including vaccine, biologic and genetic programs that are more aligned with our strategic priorities. Now moving on to guidance for full-year 2024."", ""As we have mentioned, we had an outstanding first quarter that highlighted our ability to deliver through multiple sources of growth. Our performance in companion animal, especially in parasiticides and our key dermatology franchises exceeded our expectations. Additionally, we continue to be pleased with the progress of the U.S. launch of Librela and are confident in our ability to meet expectations. We are therefore raising our 2024 operational guidance provided during February's earnings call. Note that guidance reflects foreign exchange rates as of late April. The updated foreign exchange rates negatively impacted our reported revenue guidance by approximately 2% and our reported adjusted net income guidance by approximately 4% when compared to our initial guidance issued in February."", ""For the year, we expect revenue between $9.05 billion and $9.20 billion, representing a range of 8.5 to 10.5 operational growth. Our increase in operational growth is reflective of Argentina's pricing impact as well as due to performance in our companion animal parasiticides and key dermatology products. We now expect our full year operational growth for Simparica Trio to be double-digits, while we expect growth in our key dermatology products to be in the high single-digit range. As we stated earlier, we remain pleased with our U.S. launch of Librela. Our expectations for Librela for the year remain unchanged. Moving down the P&L, we now expect adjusted net income to be in the range of $2.62 billion to $2.67 billion, representing operational growth of 13% to 15%."", ""And finally, we expect adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.71 to $5.81 and reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.34 to $5.44. Just to summarize before we go to Q&A, we are very pleased with our start to the year. While our reported results are reflective of various foreign exchange related headwinds, operationally, we continue to deliver growth across our key therapeutic areas and across most of our major markets. This growth highlights the diversity and dependability that allows us to continually outpace the animal health market. Additionally, we continue to lead the way creating new markets and launching new innovation that increases the standard of medical care for animals.

And with that, I will turn the call over to Kristin."", 'Kristin Peck -- Chief Executive Officer', 'Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter earnings call for 2024. Today, we reported outstanding first quarter results underscored by steady demand for our products, a focused strategy, and our purpose-driven colleagues. We delivered 12% operational revenue growth and grew adjusted net income by 15% operationally in line with the tenets of our value proposition. Driven by the launch of our osteoarthritis pain franchise, the U.S.', ""led the way with 16% growth and 8% operational growth internationally. More specifically, globally, Librela grew 189% operationally, including $40 million in sales in the U.S., in line with our expectations. The powerful human-animal bond fueled demand for our companion animal portfolio with 20% growth operationally, while livestock declined 1% operationally. This quarter's results even amid global uncertainty are a testament once again to the power of our diverse and durable portfolio across markets, species, and therapeutic areas."", 'It also highlights the continued rise and resilience of the animal health industry. Our purpose and performance are rooted in science, which has always been the great disruptor. And as animal health is increasingly essential for nutrition and companionship, caregivers demand even more high-quality innovation. That means we identified the most prevalent areas of unmet veterinary need and invested in, developed, manufactured, and delivered life-changing products that customers have been waiting for.', ""Take for example, Librela and Solensia, our injectable monoclonal antibodies to treat OA pain in dogs and cats, which are helping millions of pets return to play. With more than 18 million doses distributed worldwide, we are providing long-lasting relief to animals, many of whom were previously undiagnosed or untreated due to limitations of NSAIDs. With nearly 40% of all dogs suffering from OA pain globally, we believe just one-third of those are being treated. So, we're just scratching the surface of care."", ""And cats are visiting the clinic more often. In fact, we're helping curve clinic fears with Bonqat, the first FDA-approved product to alleviate anxiety in cats, which means we're expanding care in a historically under-medicalized area of the market. We understand that social media is a forum for convening, a place for pet owners to connect and to share. But we also have a responsibility to empower our customers to make informed decisions grounded in science and data."", 'We are unwavering in our commitment to rigorous safety and quality standards, which has earned us the trust and confidence of veterinarians worldwide. Backed by that commitment, Librela and Solensia are safe and effective. They are anchored in 10 years of science and have been used in Europe for more than three years. In the U.S., 78% of veterinarians who are at the center of care are very satisfied with Librela.', 'This is driven by real-world experience and consistent with the feedback we hear in other markets. And our research indicates that 46% of vets globally will treat OA earlier and 65% will treat more dogs now that Librela is available. To accurately reaffirm the safety and efficacy of these therapies, we are doubling down, working directly with veterinarians who need these products, hosting live sessions with our chief medical officer, and expanding online education and training while deploying capital to expand our DTC strategy. And veterinarians continue to be confident in Librela as evidenced by a recent blind survey of U.S.', ""vets confirming that perception and intent to prescribe remain unchanged. We remain confident that OA pain could be our next $1 billion franchise because we are meeting the needs of an underserved market. We are growing by nearly every metric, including adoption, penetration, reorder rates, patient share, and expanded utilization. And looking at our four-week rolling average in the U.S., we're excited to report that sales steadily increased through April."", ""Our performance speaks to the power of the human animal bond, discerning pet owners want option and they will work with our vets to find relief for their best friend. Beyond OA pain, Zoetis has been able to lead the market in other key categories because we deeply understand our customers' needs. This allows us to not only compete in existing markets, but again to create entirely new ones. And Science has created something completely unique to our industry, $2 billion franchises."", 'Our parasiticides portfolio expanded the total market based on deep customer insights. Before Simparica and Simparica Trio, we were No. 5 in this category. These innovations changed how we compete.', 'Today, we are No. 2 and continue gaining share and growing the market even in the face of competition. Similarly, we were first to recognize that new therapies were needed to treat canine itch safely and effectively. That market foresight changed the treatment paradigm and revolutionized pet care.', 'A decade of dermatology has led to three products, 20 major lifecycle enhancements including Cytopoint, the first ever animal health monoclonal antibody, and the first chewable with Apoquel chew. From what was once believed to be just $100 million market has grown to $1.4 billion, because we know what our customers need. Today, more than 18 million dogs are treated for allergic itch and atopic dermatitis and another 13 million remain untreated globally. We built $1 billion franchise and demonstrated the durability of our portfolio and we will continue growing this franchise underpinned by strong brand equity, first-mover advantage, lifecycle innovation, and strong customer relationships.', ""We've led in parasiticides, dermatology, and now OA pain. And each time our innovations have created new categories in animal health, you've seen the total industry opportunity expand. Now moving to livestock. I'm sure you all saw the news this week on the announcement of our agreement with Phibro Animal Health to sell our global medicated feed additives and certain water-soluble product portfolios and related assets for $350 million."", ""This deal is another great example of Zoetis' disciplined capital allocation strategy to focus investments in areas with the greatest growth potential and innovation that are aligned with our key capabilities. I'm confident that under Phibro's management, the global reach of these products will continue to expand to meet customer needs worldwide. We remain very committed to livestock and to sharpen our focus and our core innovative livestock growth areas including preventatives, antibiotic alternatives and genetics. In summary, for more than 70 years, Zoetis has been leading the industry with our commitment to innovation."", ""We've invested over $5 billion in R&D since our IPO, which has brought more than 300 product lines to the market. Science is and always has been the great disruptor and at the core of our success in delivering the innovations that veterinarians, livestock producers and pet owners expect from us. Our pursuit of science has led to breakthroughs in dermatology like Cytopoint and Apoquel chew, in parasiticides and Simparica Trio and now the latest in OA pain with the Librela and Solensia that are revolutionizing animal health. Blazing new trails isn't easy."", 'But time and again, our purpose-driven colleagues have proven their ability to expand our industry leadership and forge entirely new markets. And we remain committed to delivering strong growth through our innovative franchises and diverse portfolio, while continuing to invest for the future. Looking ahead to the remainder of 2024, our increased operational guidance reflects the resilience of the animal health market and the execution of our strategic growth priorities. We will continue to be disciplined yet adaptable in our approach to the opportunities, potential challenges, and economic shifts that occurred throughout the year.', 'And with that, I will turn it over to Wetteny.', 'Wetteny Joseph -- Chief Financial Officer', 'Thank you, and good morning, everyone. As Kristin mentioned, we had an outstanding start to the year, driven by the underlying strength of our companion animal portfolio, particularly our innovative products, as well as price growth across all species. In the first quarter, we generated revenue of $2.2 billion, growing 10% on a reported basis and 12% on an operational basis. Adjusted net income of $634 million grew 4% on a reported basis and 15% on an operational basis.', 'Our 12% operational revenue growth was due to the underlying strength of our companion animal portfolio aided by the impact of a weak comparative quarter in our U.S. companion animal business. However, the majority of this visibility to growth was offset by headwinds related to economic conditions in China, the impact of a tough comparative quarter in livestock due to the timing of supply for certain products last year, and inventory destocking related to our U.S. diagnostics sales model change.', 'Of the 12% operational revenue growth, 7% is from price with 5% growth in volume. While we saw price growth across our portfolio, price was favorably impacted by hyperinflationary markets, especially Argentina, which contributed 2% to our overall price growth. The volume growth was driven primarily by new products, including our monoclonal antibodies for OA pain, Librela, and Solensia, as well as our key dermatology products and Simparica Trio. On a segment basis, the U.S.', 'posted $1.2 billion in revenue, growing 16% in the quarter, while our international segment reported revenue of $1 billion with operational growth of 8% in the quarter. Our companion animal portfolio was the main driver of revenue growth in Q1, growing 20% operationally. This growth was partially offset by livestock, which declined 1% on an operational basis. We saw double-digit operational companion animal growth in both our U.S.', 'and our international segments again this quarter, driven by the strong performance of our innovative products with contributions from both volume and price. Simparica Trio was the primary driver of growth in the quarter generating $243 million globally, representing operational growth of 61%. We saw strong demand for Trio, as well as continued growth in patient share even with competition. Our OA pain mAbs were also a significant contributor to growth, posting $131 million in the quarter.', 'Global growth came from the impact of new launch markets both in the U.S. and internationally. In our early launch EU markets, recent vet surveys showed an increase in muscle on therapy and expansion into more moderate OA cases. Our key dermatology products grew 25% operationally in the quarter with $360 million in global revenue.', 'Wealth within dermatology was driven primarily by our Apoquel franchise where we are seeing solid conversion to Apoquel chewable including a modest impact from the initial distributor stocking in the U.S. Cytopoint growth continues to be driven by vet and pet owner preference for injectable methods of treatment. Our global companion animal diagnostics portfolio declined 12% operationally with declines in the U.S. driven by a distribution model change.', 'These declines were anticipated as our distribution partners sold off their remaining inventory due to our transition to a direct-only model for our U.S. diagnostics portfolio. U.S. declines were partially offset by growth internationally.', 'Our livestock portfolio declined 1% operationally as expected, driven by a tough comparative quarter in the prior year, especially in the U.S., as well as impacts from the ongoing economic conditions in China. This decline was partially offset by price growth in our other international markets. Now moving on to revenue growth by segment for the quarter. U.S.', 'revenue was $1.2 billion in the quarter growing 16% with companion animal growth of 25% and livestock posting a 7% decline. The companion animal performance in the quarter was driven by Simparica Trio, our key dermatology portfolio, and the impact of the launch of Librela in the U.S., as well as the impact of a weak comparative quarter. Our outstanding U.S. companion animal growth came in the quarter where we saw vet clinic visits decreased 1.5%.', 'We continue to see growth in therapeutic visits, while wellness visits drove the decline. Sales outgrowth in retail and home delivery continued to uptake vet clinic fulfillment, which is based on growing pet owner preference for these alternative channels. This dynamic is expected to put continued pressure on total vet clinic visits without impacting our expectations for revenue. Despite the visit decline, revenue and spend per visit in the clinic grew 4.5% and 6%, respectively, which reflects continued pet owner willingness to pay.', 'Turning to product performance, Simparica Trio posted sales of $205 million in the quarter growing 61%. We continue to be the market leader in the triple combination parasiticide space. Our leading footprint across channels has allowed us to continue to drive dosage growth through increased compliance even with declines in wellness visits at the clinic. In addition to a weak comparable period in the prior year, we are seeing favorable price realization due to more targeted discount programs to vets, as well as channel dynamics.', 'Key dermatology product sales in the U.S. were $233 million for the quarter growing 27%. We saw growth in both price and volume and across both Apoquel and Cytopoint. Growth also benefited from a weak comparable period in the prior year.', 'Market demand for our dermatology products remains high. In the quarter, we saw growth in both our patient share, as well as higher periodic visits in the clinic. Additionally, growth of retail auto-ship programs continue to bolster compliance. At the beginning of April, we made Apoquel Chewable available through our distribution partners.', 'OA pain mAbs, Librela, and Solensia posted a combined $57 million in U.S. sales in Q1. Librela generated $40 million in the quarter with underlying vet demand continuing to build on the momentum from our full launch in Q4 of last year. Excluding the impact of the initial clinic stocking, which we were provided last quarter, we are seeing robust sequential quarter growth in Librela in line with expectations.', 'We continue to see good growth in penetration, as well as strong reorder rates, which are approaching 80%, all of which points to positive real-world satisfaction in the clinic and among pet owners. We remain confident not just in the safety and efficacy of Librela, but also in our expected performance. As Kristin alluded to, we have seen steadily increasing trends in our trailing four-week sales average in the U.S. even into April after the increased media attention.', 'We continue to see steady progress in Solensia, which had U.S. sales of $17 million in the quarter, more than doubling our prior-year Q1 sales. We have indicated the feline market needs significant development, but we are pleased with our progress thus far. Solensia is now the market-leading product for feline OA pain in the U.S.', 'and we have seen a significant increase in the medicalized patient pool since launch. Our U.S. companion animal diagnostics portfolio declined 21% in the quarter, driven primarily by distributor inventory work downs following our channel strategy change. This destocking is in line with our expectations and has negligible impact on our underlying clinic demand.', 'U.S. livestock declined 7% in the quarter, while our underlying business performance in the quarter was as expected. Our results are reflective of a strong comparative period in Q1 of 2023 in which we grew 15% due to the return of supply on several products, primarily in cattle. Sales of swine products declined due to decreased sales of vaccines, as well as JAKs.', 'In poultry, we saw declines as a result of increased generic competition in our medicated feed additive products. Moving on to our international segment, where revenue grew 3% on a reported basis and 8% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Companion animal grew 14% operationally and livestock grew 2% operationally. Increased sales of our international companion animal products were driven by OA pain mAbs, key dermatology products, vaccines and small animal parasiticides.', 'This growth was partially offset by impacts in China. Our international OA pain mAbs grew 67% operationally to $74 million in combined revenue in the quarter. International Librela sales were $59 million, growing 71% operationally. Growth is balanced across new launch markets and our first-wave EU markets.', ""We continue to see evolution in the European markets where we have seen expansion in Librela's use in moderate OA cases, which according to the latest vet surveys now represents the majority of Librela patients in Europe. We remain pleased with the success of our DTC advertising campaigns in increasing pet owner awareness of OA. Solensia sales were $15 million internationally in the quarter, growing 54% on an operational basis. Our international key dermatology portfolio grew 23% operationally in the quarter, posting $127 million in sales."", ""We saw double-digit operational growth across most of our major markets driven by higher compliance and new patients. Growth was also favorably impacted by pre-price increased buy-ups in Japan and certain European markets. Our international small animal parasiticide portfolio grew 6% operationally, driven by our Solensia franchise with Simparica Trio growing 58% operationally to $38 million in sales. Trio growth benefited from continued uptake in Europe, driven by key account penetration and field force effectiveness, as well as contributions from Trio's launch in China."", 'Simparica posted $56 million in revenue, growing 22% on an operational basis in the quarter. This growth was partially offset by 29% operational decline in our Revolution franchise, which generates a high proportion of sales in China. International livestock grew 2% operationally in the quarter, driven by price increases, especially in high inflationary markets. Price growth was partially offset by volume declines across all of our species, partially driven by a tough comparative period in the prior year due to the return of supply of certain livestock products.', 'The volume declines in livestock were driven by cattle due to a tough comparable period related to supply and worsening market conditions in Australia. Our international swine portfolio saw volume declines driven by China, where we saw lower hog prices, as well as a reduction in herd sizes. In sheep, we saw declines from herd reductions due to expected weather conditions in Australia and New Zealand, as well as supply constraints on eight key products. As we mentioned last quarter, we continue to see economic challenges in China, where low consumer spending and high urban unemployment have reduced spending.', 'We are also seeing a slowdown in livestock with lower pork prices and smaller herd sizes. The impact on our growth is expected to moderate late in the year, but we expect to continue to see headwinds throughout the year across both companion animal and livestock. Now moving on to the rest of the P&L for the quarter. Adjusted gross margins of 70.7% declined 10 basis points on a reported basis compared to the prior year.', 'Foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact of 180 basis points on our reported adjusted gross margins. Excluding FX, we saw higher margins due to price increases, favorable mix, and lower freight costs, partially offset by higher manufacturing costs, especially in hyperinflationary markets. Adjusted operating expenses increased 11% operationally, driven primarily by SG&A growth of 10% operationally, mainly due to higher compensation-related expenses, as well as increased advertising and promotion spend on our OA pain mAbs. R&D grew 13% on an operational basis, driven by higher project spend related to both recent acquisitions, as well as advancements of our pipeline candidates.', 'The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 19.7%, a decrease of 80 basis points, primarily due to a higher benefit in the U.S. related to foreign-derived intangible income and a more favorable jurisdictional mix of earnings. And finally, adjusted net income grew 15% operationally despite a $31 million headwind to growth from the nonrecurring benefit of our prior-year royalty settlement. Adjusted diluted EPS grew 17% operationally for the quarter.', ""Capital expenditures in the first quarter were $140 million. In the quarter, we repurchased $339 million of Zoetis shares. Before moving to guidance, I wanted to comment on our recent announcement to divest our medicated feed additive portfolio and certain water-soluble products to Phibro Animal Health. This is a transaction that demonstrates Zoetis' disciplined capital allocation strategy to focus our investments on innovative solutions that advance animal health, productivity, and sustainability."", 'This divestiture will allow us to remain focused on other livestock solutions, including vaccine, biologic, and genetic programs that are more aligned with our strategic priorities. Now moving on to guidance for full year 2024. As we have mentioned, we had an outstanding first quarter that highlighted our ability to deliver through multiple sources of growth. Our performance in companion animals, especially in parasiticides and our key dermatology franchises exceeded our expectations.', ""Additionally, we continue to be pleased with the progress of the U.S. launch of Librela and are confident in our ability to meet expectations. We are therefore raising our 2024 operational guidance provided during February's earnings call. Note that guidance reflects foreign exchange rates as of late April."", ""The updated foreign exchange rates negatively impacted our reported revenue guidance by approximately 2% and our reported adjusted net income guidance by approximately 4% when compared to our initial guidance issued in February. For the year, we expect revenue between $9.05 billion and $9.20 billion, representing a range of 8.5 to 10.5 operational growth. Our increase in operational growth is reflective of Argentina's pricing impact, as well as due to performance in our companion animal parasiticides and key dermatology products. We now expect our full year operational growth for Simparica Trio to be double-digits, while we expect growth in our key dermatology products to be in the high single-digit range."", 'As we stated earlier, we remain pleased with our U.S. launch of Librela. Our expectations for Librela for the year remain unchanged. Moving down the P&L, we now expect adjusted net income to be in the range of $2.62 billion to $2.67 billion, representing operational growth of 13% to 15%.', 'And finally, we expect adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.71 to $5.81 and reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.34 to $5.44. Just to summarize before we go to Q&A, we are very pleased with our start to the year. While our reported results are reflective of various foreign exchange-related headwinds, operationally, we continue to deliver growth across our key therapeutic areas and across most of our major markets. This growth highlights the diversity and dependability that allows us to continually outpace the animal health market.', ""Additionally, we continue to lead the way creating new markets and launching new innovation that increases the standard of medical care for animals. Now, I'll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions. Operator?"", '', 'Operator', '[Operator instructions] We ask that you limit yourself to one question and then queue up again with any follow-ups. [Operator instructions] With that, we will take our first question is coming from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Please go ahead.', 'Michael Ryskin -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', ""Great Thanks for taking the question. First, I want to ask just about the guide change. It seems like there's just so many moving pieces right now, the FX moves, you've got all the price you're taking in Argentina, some of the stocking comments for Apoquel chewable and obviously Librela. So, just this early in the year to decide to raise the guide, just sort of like what went into that and what do you see as the upside risk or downside risk to that as you go through the year? And then just a quick follow-up question, I'll squeeze both in."", ""My question is on margin. With all the price, with all the strength in companion gross margin was still a little bit weaker in the quarter, and you're not raising EPS operationally for the year. So, just what's going on with the gross margin and why isn't the flowthrough to the companion animal portfolio better? Thanks."", 'Wetteny Joseph -- Chief Financial Officer', ""I'll be happy to take this, Mike. Look, we're very pleased with an outstanding quarter to start the year, clearly delivering 12% operational growth at revenue, 15% at adjusted net income from an operational perspective. Could be more pleased with this. In terms of the guidance, of course, there are puts and takes as you laid out."", 'The performance in the quarter, when we think about the prior-year comps, we think these are largely offsetting puts and takes that go into the performance. And I think that feeds into the later part of your question, which is how do we decide to go into increasing our guidance from an operational perspective. But when we look at the puts and takes, clearly, the performance from our Trio and key derm continued growth as we continue to ramp the launch of Librela, not only in the U.S., but across international markets, give us a lot of confidence in terms of underpinning the growth that you saw in the quarter from an operational perspective. Yes, there are some easier comps when you look at the companion animal business, particularly in the U.S.', ""We talked about those at length last year with the destocking and the price and the timing of promotional activity, etc. But we also had some headwinds where we had strong comps across livestock in particular because of the timing of supply last year, as well as the China market that we've been talking about as we expected, as well in Argentina, given the pricing impact issue and in Australia and New Zealand. So, when we take a look at those, we think there's probably 1 to 2 points of tailwind on a net basis is what we would estimate coming into the quarter. But then when you look at the bottom line, 15% operational growth in adjusted net income despite the royalty settlement that we had last year, again, is an offsetting element."", ""So, we still end up with a sort of an operational growth that's in the same range that we've delivered. And so, though it's still early in the year, we have confidence in the underlying market and demand that we see across our products. We're seeing increased periodic visits into the clinic for dermatology. Trio, despite head-to-head competition, had a phenomenal quarter of 61%, with $243 million of revenue, with the U.S."", ""leading that at 61% as well. So, when we take all those into consideration we're seeing price realization across the globe, including increased price from hyperinflationary markets like Argentina. So, that gives us enough confidence to be able to raise the guidance and still be very confident in delivering the revised guidance that we did today. Now in terms of margins, let me just make sure I give you -- cover that."", ""If you look at the headline, right, the gross margins were down about 10 basis points. FX had about nearly 200 basis points headwind in this. I think it's important to remind everyone, there's a significant devaluation in Argentina that occurred two times last year, in December, as well as prior to that in August. The December devaluation is actually in our first quarter."", ""Keep in mind, our international operations closed their books a month earlier. So, December is actually Q1, so you're seeing the impact of that Argentina devaluation play out, particularly as you look at inventories and the impacts on COGS, cost of goods sold, as well as lower in the P&L. And so, when you factor those out, we actually had about a 200-basis-point expansion operationally in our gross margins, which again aided our way into the expansion of adjusted net income and growing that at 15%."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Jon Block with Stifel. Please go ahead.', 'Jon Block -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst', ""Great. Thanks, guys. Good morning. I guess I'll ask both up front as well."", ""Wetteny, I'm getting a lot of questions on Argentina, so hope this is clear. The strength of the top line was big. You raised the guide revenue by 150 bps for the year. You mentioned 200 bps of year-over-year growth in the quarter from Argentina, if I have that right."", ""But what is the incremental growth contribution from Argentina for the year? I just think everyone's like trying to figure out what the raise is, call it, like ex Argentina due to that market's hyperinflationary environment. Hope that's clear, let me know if it's not. And then maybe just to shift gears, Kristin on Librela, very helpful comments on the April run rate. In over-checks, we hear about a safe drug that might have some issues in dogs with neurological issues."", 'And so, just would love your thoughts on that. And does the company plan to do any, call it, follow-up studies maybe addressing select AEs, that would be great. Thanks for your time, guys.', 'Wetteny Joseph -- Chief Financial Officer', ""I'll take the Argentina question first and then Kristin will cover Librela. Look, the way I look at it, as we said in the prepared commentary and you quoted here, there's a 200 basis points contribution to the top line from Argentina in the quarter. And so, if I were to say, look, we're still early in the year and we'll continue to look to take price in that market and we'll have to watch how that plays out between price and volume as we go. It's a hyperinflationary market."", ""We're pegging what we're looking at based on the actuals and what we anticipate. But again, it's still early in the year. So, if you were to take these 200 basis points and you spread them for the year, in effect, you could say that's 50 basis points contribution to the year, if I don't account for any more price from here on, right? And so, that's kind of how you'd look at it and you said, well, the other 100 basis points in the raise is from the rest of the underlying business. The answer is somewhere between there, right? But certainly, there's contribution from the growth we're seeing, which we said is above our expectations for our derm franchise, delivering $360 million, growing 25% on the quarter, as well as Trio, which continues to perform really well for us."", ""And so, those, I would say, are significant contributors to the top-line guide that we gave. So, we're increasing the top line by 150 basis points in terms of the range of operational growth and Argentina is a piece of that, but I would say there is significant contribution from the underlying business as well."", 'Kristin Peck -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Sure, Jon. And I'll take the second part of your question on Librela. I mean, first, I really want to underscore that we have the utmost confidence in the safety and efficacy of Librela. It has been used for over three years across the globe and over 14 million dogs and it's approved in over 50 countries."", ""And if you overall look at the rate of reported adverse events, it's about 18% per 10,000 or 0.18% globally. And I think it's important to keep in mind that no single adverse event is classified under the EMEA guidelines as more than rare, which is more than 1 to 10 out of 10,000. So, we remain very confident in the safety and efficacy of this product. We watch these reported adverse events very carefully."", ""It's an important part of what every pharmaceutical company does to make sure that we understand any trends that we're seeing. We've remained very confident in the data. I really want to underscore, they've been on the market for three years. So, we continue to watch the AEs that are coming in."", ""And to be clear, the top adverse events today are, number one, lack of efficacy, so it's not working maybe, as well as they wanted. Polydipsia, which is frequent drinking. And the third being polyuria, which is frequent urination. So, the other ones you're talking about remain a rare side effect."", 'In other words, not more than one in 10,000. So, hopefully that answers your question.', 'Operator', 'Our next question will come from Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.', 'Erin Wright -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst', 'Great, thanks. Just another one on Librela. Just given the seller trends that you were mentioning, how do we think about the quarterly progression from here in the second quarter? And then also just like new patient starts, like how has that looked since kind of the media attention? And then on livestock and just a broader rationalization kind of the business with the selling of the feed additives business, which made sense. And do you see other opportunities to further prune the portfolio and presumably this lifts your long-term top-line growth targets and margin profile and just on the improved mix alone and the focus you can have on these higher growth, higher margin businesses? What does Zoetis look like in three to five years down the road? Because it could be potentially more skewed to that and how do you think about that? Thanks.', 'Kristin Peck -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Sure. I'll let, Wetteny, why don't you start with the Librela performance and the questions you got there, and then I can take the livestock question after that, Wetteny?"", 'Wetteny Joseph -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah, I'd be happy to. Look, we delivered $100 million of revenue in Q1 on the Librela. That's 189% growth over the prior year. Clearly, the U.S."", ""contributing $40 million is a big part of that, but we are very pleased with the performance across our international markets, as well for Librela, and we saw a really strong sequential quarter growth across our international markets and we continue to see the uptake. We're very pleased as well when surveyed European vet clinics actually are indicating that now they're seeing more than 50% of the cases being moderate cases, which is very encouraging as we continue to progress the product having been out there for three years. In terms of the progression for the year, clearly, we continue to ramp in the U.S. and as Kristin said and we said in the prepared commentary, as we look at on a rolling four-week basis, through the quarter and beyond the quarter into April, we continue to see steadily increasing orders of Librela as well, which again, caused us to be able to be confident in our expectations for Librela, as you look at the guidance that we gave as well."", ""We're not going to get into very specific quarter by quarter, but I would say, if you look at the $40 million in Q1, there's very little to no stocking in that number. Now we did speak at length in February about the stocking in the initial launch in the fourth quarter. We had about two and a half months at the end of the year for the product launch and you have to factor holidays as well into that, and we saw a very fast penetration into 60% plus in clinics very quickly, which means that there's a lot more stocking in there. Now we gave you a range of somewhere between a quarter and a third of that being stocking."", ""I would say it's likely in the high end of that range. So, when you factor that into the $40 million this year, this is really substantial sequential growth in Librela. And as we said, we continue to see momentum in the product. The one thing I would remind everyone is, in international, we did have a number of markets that we launched in the second quarter last year."", ""So, we'll be lapping those across the international markets. Those include Canada, Brazil, Australia, Japan, and so we will be lapping those, but we still continue to expect to see strong meaningful growth in the product, as well as sequential growth as we go through the rest of the year is what I would remind you in terms of how we expect progression for Librela."", 'Kristin Peck -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Sure. And Erin, I'll take your second question on livestock. As you and I have talked about many times, livestock generally historically in our industry has grown at around 2% to 4%. I know we grew less for a period of time when we were facing the LOE on DRAXXIN and with some large disease outbreak across the globe."", ""But I think what you're seeing is the wettest over the last year and going into this year, is returning more to those historic levels. I think if you look at this year, we expect to be above that level. Again, as Wetteny mentioned, Q1 is not a good indication. If you look at sort of the comparable that we had there."", ""So, we remain very confident again in livestock. We believe we'll end at the higher end of that range. As you look at the divestiture of our medicated feed additive and water-soluble portfolio and assets, we continue to be disciplined around our capital allocation. We divested our Pumpkin Pet Care last year."", ""This is something that as a leadership team we continue to do. We look at every asset we have and we want to make sure that we're investing in highest areas of growth. So, I think that's something that's just a rigorous part of how we manage the company. And as I think as you look at livestock, obviously, the divestiture of the medicated feed additives portfolio will increase the overall growth of the company and the overall growth of livestock and also help overall margins."", ""But our real focus of the divestiture really had to do with doubling down and investing in what we see our great potential in the livestock industry, and really playing to what are our core strengths in preventatives, into antibiotic alternatives, into genetics, as we think about vaccines, biologics and new genetic solutions. So, again, we'll continue to look at our portfolio as we always have and as we've done every year, but remain confident in livestock and especially this year in our ability to grow faster than the market."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is coming from David Westenberg with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.', 'David Westenberg -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst', ""Hi, thanks for taking the question and congrats on the quarter. So, you gave a lot of commentary on April and Librela sales, and it sounds like there's week-on-week build. Just to confirm that is in fact clinic administration or end market that you're looking at versus like stocking or sales out from you. Veterinarians are really behind the product."", ""It seems like there is some consumer social media kind of stuff. I just want to confirm that the DT sales advertising is on track or if there's any kind of changes there. And then just finally, if I could squeeze in just one more. In terms of your assumptions on that high single digit in derm, what is the assumption in terms of competitive launch there? Thank you very much and again, congrats on the quarter."", 'Wetteny Joseph -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yes, David. Look, I'll take a stab at this and then Kristin may add some. First of all, when you look at Librela sales in the U.S., keep in mind, Librela is sold direct to clinics and the turnaround is very fast. And so, there's no sort of channel dynamics to play out in terms of what we're seeing."", ""What we're seeing from week to week is actually coming directly from what the clinics are ordering. And then look, DTC continues to be on track. As we said in our prepared commentary, part of the increase you see in our SG&A spend is really advertising and promotion behind our pain franchise, and clearly, Librela in the U.S. is a big part of that."", 'And then when you think about derm, of course, very pleased with our performance here, $360 million, up 25%. Now there is some soft comp in that. But when we neutralize for that, we still see really, really strong underlying growth and strong demand. And we continue to be able to take price across derm.', ""Now of course, it's still early in the year. So, as we look at, particularly in the back half, we are factoring different scenarios around what's the timing of competition. And while we remain confident in our ability to continue to grow our franchises post-competition, as we're doing in Trio, this can be some near-term or short-term promotional activity that we are mindful, right? So, we do factor those into our thinking in terms of how we land at the high single-digit range, which is up from what we said last time, which was mid- to high single digit. So, clearly, our confidence continues to increase there."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is coming from Balaji Prasad with Barclays. Please go ahead. Balaji, your line is open. Please check your mute function.', 'OK. We will take our next question from Brandon Vazquez with William Blair. Please go ahead.', 'Brandon Vazquez -- Barclays -- Analyst', ""Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. First, on Librela, I'll ask two up front here. On Librela, can you guys talk about are you starting to see any pockets of that going from maybe the more severe OA dogs and being used in the moderate OA population? Anything you guys can do to kind of help push that market development because that seems to be the bigger opportunity as this grows over the coming years."", ""Follow-up, second question is you're spending over $600 million in R&D now. I think we're about a year out from the nice Investor Day you guys held for us last year. Any meaningful updates in the pipeline that you guys can share with us, either new products or lifecycle innovation, that might be coming in the near to medium term? Thanks."", 'Kristin Peck -- Chief Executive Officer', 'Sure. Wetteny, do you want to take the first one on Librela and I can take the R&D question?', 'Wetteny Joseph -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah. I'd be happy to. Look, we continue to be very pleased with the performance of Librela, as we said, both the U.S. and international."", ""We did complete a recent survey of vet clinics across European markets. And after three years in the market, we are certainly seeing the transition to having a lot more moderate cases. In fact, vets, based on surveys, are saying more than 50% of the cases they're seeing now are moderate and even some mild cases coming into the mix. So, that's very encouraging."", ""And again, and that also contributed to an increase in months on therapy going somewhere between seven and eight months now is what we're estimating based on those surveys with vets. So, that progression is what we count on and anticipate, and we're seeing that across international markets. We're still very early in the U.S. But that's the sort of progression we would expect."", ""And we'll continue to educate vets on the product, as we've talked about, to continue to drive that as we move forward. Kristin?"", 'Kristin Peck -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Sure. And Brandon, to your second question on our R&D. Yes, you probably saw the strong growth in R&D in the quarter that is really because we remain very confident in our pipeline in many of the key areas that we mentioned at Investor Day, which was, I guess, a little less than a year ago, really investing behind some of the key therapeutic areas, both our long-lasting monoclonal antibodies, which will be some of the more near-term launches. We are not making any announcements on today's call, obviously, with regards to that."", ""But that's going to be some of the more near-term launches. And then as we talked about, very excited as you look at renal, as you look at oncology and cardiovascular and diagnostics to continue to invest in those areas where we see huge potential. As you look at renal, cardiology, and oncology, we always said, as we said last year, those are more in the four years plus range. So, there's no near-term updates there."", ""But we continue to launch products. As you look at -- as I spoke in my script about on Bonqat, which is around anxiety for cats, that's really important. It may not seem a huge product overall, but it's an unlock for the rest of our portfolio. If we can get cats to the clinic, we can sell more -- a lot of our other products, and more importantly, meet the needs of the cat population, which to date has very under-medicalized."", ""So, I know we don't give you all the visibility that you're dying for in R&D. But I think as you can see, we've continued to deliver on our pipeline and both in really innovative products, like what you're seeing in Librela and Solensia, but also lifecycle innovations that will really extend the life of important franchises such as some of our long-acting monoclonal antibodies, which should be more in the near term."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is coming from Steve Scala with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.', 'Unknown speaker', 'Hi, good morning, this is Chris on for Steve Scala. We had two questions. First, on livestock, are you seeing any impacts on the ongoing outbreak of H5N1 avian influenza? And then second on the U.S. companion animal market, what underlying trends are you seeing in U.S.', 'pet adoption and abandonment rate? And are you seeing any change in share of wallet, share of consumer pet spend on medicines versus other product categories? Thanks.', 'Kristin Peck -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Thanks, Steve, I'll try to take those, and Wetteny, certainly, if there's anything I missed, you can jump in. Look, we, like all of you, are continuing to watch the outbreak of H5N1. If you look at the portfolio that we have and our capabilities, we stand ready to support both governments and customers across the globe as they look at potential solutions to address H5N1, both on the vaccine side and on the diagnostics side. To date, we have not been requested to do that."", ""But I think like many of our peer companies, we stand ready to support government authorities when that's needed. I do want to reassure people, I mean, data has come out that the milk is safe. Data came out from FISS this morning reassuring people that the meat base is safe. So, we have not seen any impact to our business whatsoever with regards to this."", ""This is a major issue for our customers. And our real focus is supporting them through this and making sure that we focus on what we can do certainly around biosecurity surveillance and detection, which we're more and more engaged with the USDA and others, given our diagnostics portfolio as well. So, no, we have not seen any impacts to our business to date on that. Regards to the U.S."", ""and looking at -- we have not seen a significant U.S. national increase in people bringing their pets back to shelters. I know there's been some isolation here and there, but as the overall U.S., that is not a trend. And those pets that they all adopted during COVID are all aging and continue to be drivers of our growth, not just in the U.S."", ""but globally. And I know there has been some talk around consumer sentiment and is that really changing. Obviously, we've seen some changes in sort of collars or treats and things like that. But what's really been clear and what we've talked about for a long time is when you think about animal healthcare, it's essential."", ""They are not skimping on their animal healthcare. And if you look at the trends in the quarter as you look at an increase in periodic visits, as Wetteny talked about, the reality is when their animal needs care, they are getting that care. And as you look at spend per visit in the U.S., we're seeing spend per visit up 6% in the U.S., which means, again, consumers and pet owners want to take care of their animals and they continue to invest in this. If you look at the strength of the human-animal bond, this is one of the reasons that we say animal health is a very resilient industry that people will continue to invest in the health of their pets, and that's certainly what we're seeing in the quarter."", 'And as you saw, our expanded operational guidance for the year really being driven by our companion animal portfolio is what we expect for the year as well.', 'Operator', ""We'll take our next question from Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead."", 'Nathan Rich -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst', ""Great, good morning, and thanks for the questions. First, just a clarification on Argentina and the price increase. I guess, the price increase you referenced coincides with the December devaluation? It sounds like that price increase wasn't contemplated in the initial operational revenue range for the year. So, I guess, like as we think about the impact going forward, I'd imagine that contribution should be similar over the balance of the year, I guess, assuming no major change in the currency dynamics in that market."", 'So, is that the correct way to think about it? And then on derm, the company decided to start selling Apoquel Chewable through distribution. Could you maybe just talk about the factors that led to that decision? And any impact on top-line and margins for Apoquel, as well as the broader portfolio as you think about the potential benefits of selling that portfolio through distribution.', 'Wetteny Joseph -- Chief Financial Officer', ""I'll take the first one, Nathan, just on Argentina. Look, clearly, the devaluation occurred prior to us issuing guidance and we have plans and continue to see our ability to take price fairly significantly in that market perhaps beyond what we factored in. And so, yes, we won't sit here and forecast what FX is going to do or what's going to happen in Argentina. It is a hyperinflationary market after all, so we'll continue to monitor that."", ""And so, we're only through one quarter here and we're all on our way through the second quarter, so we're factoring that into our thinking as well. And we are seeing an ability to continue to do that. But we can't sort of forecast, forecast for the rest of the year what will happen there. So, we are a bit measured in how we treat that."", ""I would say a portion, again, to repeat what I said earlier, a portion of our increase is certainly coming from that. I would say somewhere between a third to half of the increase that we're giving in terms of operational guidance is coming from that because we are getting the operational lift from price there. And the rest of it coming from the rest of the underlying business, as we've talked about, is how I would think about that. In terms of derm, I'll start and then see if Kristin wants to add."", ""Look, clearly, we have products in derm with Apoquel and Cytopoint, they've been in the market for over 10 years and seven years, respectively. And the level of satisfaction on these products is very high among vets and pet owners. We've launched Apoquel Chewable as an important element because, one, there's a preference from pet owners and perhaps vets to have a palatable chewable. And so, we see that as, one, meeting a need in the market, as well as an important part of a defense strategy."", 'And so, as we anticipate competition in derm, we believe that competition will more likely be a film-coated tablet. And the conversion to Apoquel Chewable is important to us. We are seeing that conversion occur across international markets. In particular, if you look at Europe, we now have about 40% conversion to chewable after being in the market the last couple of years.', ""So, that's very encouraging. We just launched in the U.S. at the same time as we launched Librela. And so, we want to look to potentially accelerate that transition in that conversion, hence, what went into the thinking here."", ""And so, it's still relatively early. There's only a little bit of contribution in the quarter here, perhaps out of the 25% growth you saw in key derm, there might be two points coming from that. And so, we'll see some more of that occur in the second quarter, but it is an important part of our defense strategy."", 'Operator', 'We will take our next question from Balaji Prasad with Barclays. Please go ahead.', 'Balaji Prasad -- Barclays -- Analyst', 'Good morning, everyone, and apologies for missing my spot earlier and also in case my questions are a repeat. So, on Librela, curious to understand how has your messaging changed, if at all, with the vets in how they use, how they triage for drugs that they want to treat and what does this mean for the total addressable market, one. And two, can you help us understand the quarterly cadence for the rest of the year? I think the understanding before was that 1Q was expected to be the weakest quarter and second half stronger than 1H. On the back of this print, does this alter the quarterly cadence in any way? Thank you.', 'Kristin Peck -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Sure. I'll take your first question, Balaji, on Librela. And Wetteny, I expect you can take the second one on quarterly cadence. As we think about how we're approaching vets, vets are at the center of care."", ""And our focus has always been around ensuring vets are educated on the product, that they understand it, that they understand how it should be used, when it should be used, etc. Certainly, since a lot of the social media, we've been more committed than ever to make sure that vets have better access to a lot of the education we've always been providing. And we've significantly increased our education with vets and their access. So, things that we've done."", ""We've done over 1,000 webinars. We have daily sessions with our chief medical officer, Dr. Richard Goldstein, to make sure they can have interactive sessions. We have an always-on customer support team."", ""And I think, really, what you're seeing with regards to the vets and how they feel about the product is the confidence that they have access to the education that they need. And as you look at that, that is why you're seeing such a strongly positive experience, not just from pets, but from vets who really are confident in the product, as Wetteny mentioned, their confidence in prescribing the product more, their confidence in the safety and efficacy of the product. As we've talked about, we invest a lot in Zoetis in veterinary education, and we always have, and our vet operations in every market. So, I think this is something that's been our strength."", ""Clearly, with the social media, we have doubled down to ensure there's more access to this veterinary education to make sure that any vet who wants to understand more has access to experts, both internally, as well as external KOLs, so they can best understand the product. And that again underscores our confidence in this product that we've talked about and the fact that we continue to believe this product will be -- this category, not just Librela, but Librela and Solensia, we continue to commit this will be $1 billion franchise for Zoetis and that is really rooted in the safety and efficacy of this product and in investment we're putting into both vet and pet owners to make sure they understand the product."", 'Wetteny Joseph -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah. And Balaji, in terms of quarterly cadence and I'll answer the question specifically with respect to Librela. If you mean it for overall, I can certainly recap that conversation. But look, clearly, $40 million contribution in the first quarter."", ""And keep in mind, we continue to see really strong growth across our international markets, which grew 71% on the quarter as well. So, those will continue to drive growth for us. We won't get ultra-specific in terms of the exact contribution as the quarters go, but we would expect to continue to ramp up from that $40 million through the year. And then, of course, the fourth quarter in terms of percentage growth, we'll be lapping the $44 million that we delivered in the fourth quarter and the first quarter of launch."", 'Operator', ""Thank you. We'll take our next question from Glen Santangelo with Jefferies. Please go ahead."", 'Glen Santangelo -- Jefferies -- Analyst', ""Yeah, thanks for taking my question. Hey, Kristin, obviously, the outlook for Trio and derm continues to be encouraging here. But just given the recent launch of BI and the Elanco launches that presumably may be coming in the second half, if you could look out to 2025 for a second. I'm kind of curious if you anticipate any sort of noticeable shift in the competitive landscape or anything that you think might impact your ability to take price? And the reason I ask is some are getting concerned about increasing competition and a weakening consumer at the same time maybe would impact the company's ability to take price increases consistent with what you have done historically."", 'So, any sort of high-level commentary, I think, would be helpful. Thanks.', 'Kristin Peck -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Sure. I'll start and then, Wetteny, you can certainly build on this one. We remain very confident and it's really based on our historical performance, and I think you can look at that, we invest in the lifecycle innovation across our franchises. We were No."", ""5, let's be clear, guys, in Patis when we entered with Simparica and Simparica Trio and we're now No. 2. We're facing competition from the leader in parasiticide, and we grew our share of 0.7% if you look at Q1 in the U.S. So, even with very strong competition, we continue to grow share."", 'So, we remain confident we can continue to grow our parasiticides and our dermatology franchises even with competition. I mean, paras has always been a very competitive space with most companies operating there. We think our strength, obviously, with the vets, our strength with pet owners, really seeing tremendous growth in our franchises for both Trio and derm in alternative channels, in home delivery and retail. And we see great strength there as you look at the auto-ship.', ""We continue to increase auto-ship out there, which absolutely increases compliance, which we think is really important. As you look at, for example, the alternative channels, they grew 55%. Now that was a little bit of a weaker comp if you look at last year. But even if you adjust for all that, that's 25% plus growth in the alternative channel."", ""So, we really believe that we can continue to grow this franchise based on the strength of our products, the strength of our portfolio, our lifecycle innovation if you look at what we're doing with Chewable, as well as leveraging some of these new channels, which have the benefit of increased compliance. So, back again, it's our confidence not just for '24, but for '25. I don't know, Wetteny, if you want to add anything on that."", 'Wetteny Joseph -- Chief Financial Officer', 'Look, the only thing I would say is two things. One, we are not seeing a weakening consumer. You saw us post high double-digit growth across Trio and our key derm franchise. And even if we normalize for some of the tailwinds from last year, we still have high double-digit growth across each of those.', ""And so, that certainly demonstrates continued demand products and our innovation. The other one I would say is, look, as we look ahead and we're not going to give guidance specific to 2025 here, but we're confident in our ability to grow in the face of competition. Now there can be some short-term promotional activity that might have some impact. But beyond those, we're confident in our products and we'll see what the labels are that we're going to compete against."", 'Operator', ""We'll take our next question from Chris Schott with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead."", 'Chris Schott -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst', ""All right, great. Thanks so much. Just two questions for me. Just continuing on Trio, can you quantify if there's a channel dynamic benefit you saw here? And just give us a little more color on maybe the size of that."", ""And then the second one was Librela U.S. Should we expect a similar dynamic in the U.S. that we saw ex U.S., where initial uptake is more in the severe OA pets, which I think would be maybe a little bit less sensitive to some of the headlines we've seen over the past month and then the moderate piece of the business is happening kind of a year or two or further out? Or is the U.S. market you're thinking different where those severe and moderate may be scaling kind of simultaneously with each other? Thanks so much."", 'Kristin Peck -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Sure. Thanks, Chris. I'll let you take, Wetteny, the Trio question. I can follow up on Librela."", 'Wetteny Joseph -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah, absolutely. Look, the short answer is no. There's no channel dynamics that we're seeing here. As I mentioned just a moment ago, we did have dynamics last year in the quarter where you saw destocking coming from promotional -- timing of promotions in the prior year and more pre-priced buy-ups."", ""And so, that did provide some tailwind here. So, we posted 61% growth on Trio globally, and that's the same percentage growth in the U.S., $205 million growing 61%. And if you were to say -- there's no precision here, but I would say our internal estimates is that if we factor in the tailwinds from last year, that may account for about half of the growth that we're seeing. So, still remaining very significant growth on Trio, and there's no channel dynamics in terms of inventories to speak of in the current year."", 'Kristin Peck -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Sure. And on your second question with regards to Librela in the U.S., I mean, what we have seen historically in Europe and in markets that launched first is it is often put into the severe dogs who are desperate for a new therapy initially and moving to the moderate. But we've learned that lesson after three years in Europe. And so, we're making sure as we launch in the U.S."", 'that we get into that moderate. As you think about the early Experience Trial, for example, that we did in the U.S., we made sure there was a balance of mild, moderate and more severe cases so that they have experience and they can see the impact of the product in that. As you even look at some of the data that Wetteny spoke about earlier, which is we have more than 50% of -- outside of the U.S. of patients right now in moderate -- mild to moderate cases, which I think is tremendous growth.', ""And what you're seeing when you do that is also an increase in compliance. So, compliance is now between seven and eight months, up from six to seven months outside the U.S. So, our goal as we were launching in the U.S. as we designed the early Experience Trial and as we market with vets is to make sure that this is a product that can be a first-line therapy for mild, moderate and severe cases and making sure that we can get that conversion into mild and moderate, similar to where we are in Europe, faster in the U.S."", 'So, that is certainly our focus as we think about growing that brand in the U.S.', 'Operator', ""Thank you. We'll take our final question from Navann Ty with BNP. Please go ahead."", 'Navann Ty -- Exane BNP Paribas -- Analyst', 'Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions and thanks for the color on Librela. I have some follow-ups. What is the earliest from the vets from your online education sessions? And how many vets approximately did you reach out to so far? Also interested in your early dialogue with the FDA, if any? Is that just a common surveillance after a product launch so far? Thank you.', 'Kristin Peck -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Sure. Thank you. With regards to your first question on the vets, we've reached out to through our tech bulletins with letters directly from our chief medical officer almost every vet in the U.S. -- any vet who's a customer of ours in the U.S."", ""We think that, that's really critical. Any of those vets can join, for example, our open office hours with our chief medical officer, Richard Goldstein. We've invited vets to these webinars and really working with our veterinary operations group in every area across the U.S. to make sure they have access not just to internal and external."", ""So, thousands of vets have attended these webinars to date.

Since this decade began, all three major stock indexes have vacillated between bear and bull markets in successive years, with these swings most pronounced in the growth stock-powered Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC).', 'During the 2022 bear market, the Nasdaq Composite brought up the caboose with a 33% loss. But since closing this chapter, the Nasdaq has gained 51% and, as recently as last month, pushed to a new record-closing high above 16,400. This move confirms that the Nasdaq is firmly in a new, albeit young, bull market.', ""What's particularly interesting about this leading index is that it's retraced nearly 4% off its all-time high, as of the closing bell on May 2. For long-term-minded investors with cash at the ready, it means growth stocks can still be found at a bargain."", ""What follows are four colossal growth stocks you'll regret not buying in the new Nasdaq bull market."", ""The first sensational growth stock that's begging to be bought in the early stages of the new Nasdaq bull market is payment-processing leader Mastercard (NYSE: MA)."", ""The only real knock against Mastercard is that it's a cyclical company. If the U.S. and global economy were to dip into a recession, consumer and enterprise spending would be expected to decline, which would have a negative effect on the fees Mastercard collects from merchants to process transactions. A couple of predictive indicators, including a historic decline in M2 money supply, suggest a growing likelihood of weakness to come in the U.S. economy."", ""On the other hand, history is very much on Mastercard's side. Whereas most periods of economic expansion last for years, there hasn't been a single U.S. recession since the end of World War II that endured longer than 18 months. Extended periods of growth allow Mastercard to consistently grow its sales by double digits year after year."", ""Though it's a bit of a subtle point, Mastercard's purposeful avoidance of lending is another reason for its ongoing success and sustained profit margin of more than 40%. Companies that lend have to set aside capital to cover possible credit delinquencies and loan losses that arise during recessions. Strictly focusing on payment processing means Mastercard avoids these pitfalls and bounces back from downturns faster than most lending institutions."", ""Additionally, Mastercard's growth runway stretches for decades. Cross-border volume growth of 18% in the March-ended quarter speaks to just how large the opportunity is for it to continue expanding its payment infrastructure into underbanked regions, such as Africa, the Middle East, and Southeastern Asia."", 'While Mastercard might look a bit pricey at nearly 27 times forward-year earnings, this represents a 21% discount to its average trailing-five-year forward-earnings multiple.', ""A second colossal growth stock that you'll be kicking yourself for not buying in the early stages of the new Nasdaq bull market is gold-mining company Newmont (NYSE: NEM). Yes, you read that right... a gold stock that's also a growth stock."", ""Before (pardon the necessary pun) digging into company specifics, it's important to recognize the elephant in the room: The spot price of gold has surged to an all-time high in 2024."", ""The sizable rally in physical gold can be explained by a stubbornly high prevailing rate of inflation. In other words, people are looking for a place to park their cash (rather than letting it sit under the proverbial mattress) where it won't lose value over time. For decades, gold has been an asset that skittish investors have flocked to during periods of high inflation and/or economic turbulence. If the spot price of gold remains near an all-time high, it should translate into higher profitability for gold miners across the board."", ""One of the clearest company-specific catalysts for Newmont is its $16.8 billion, all-share buyout of Australia's Newcrest Mining, which closed in November. Newmont anticipates recognizing $500 million in cost synergies by the end of this year, as well as beefing up the combined company's operating cash flow by $2 billion within two years of closing. Buying Newcrest further solidified Newmont's already impressive gold and copper reserve profile."", 'To add to the above, Newmont\'s size presents clear cost advantages. Newmont has 10 ""Tier 1 assets,"" which are mines producing at least 500,000 gold equivalent ounces per year, with an all-in sustaining cost in the lower half of the industry, and a mine life of greater than 10 years.', ""Newmont's earnings per share (EPS) is forecast to double between 2023 and 2027 to around $3.20, which makes this lustrous stock all the more delectable for growth seekers."", ""The third exhilarating growth stock you'll regret not adding to your portfolio with the Nasdaq firmly in a new bull market is China-based Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU)."", ""The reason Baidu's stock has struggled recently is because the Chinese economy hasn't bounced back from the COVID-19 pandemic as quickly as expected. Multiple years of stringent lockdowns created supply chain kinks that are still working themselves out."", ""But as I pointed out earlier, patience and perspective are important when investing on Wall Street. Although China's economic ramp-up is taking a bit longer than anticipated, its burgeoning middle class gives the world's No. 2 economy by gross domestic product a path to sustained annual growth of 5% (or higher). Most large China-based companies, including Baidu, are going to benefit from this extensive growth runway."", ""Baidu's foundational operating segment is its internet search engine. Baidu's internet search share in China clocked in at close to 52% in April 2024, and has consistently come in at between 50% and 85% dating back 10 years, based on data from GlobalStats. Businesses are well aware that the best way to reach Chinese consumers is to target their advertising on Baidu's search engine. When China's economy finds its stride, once again, Baidu's ad revenue should increase substantially."", ""However, Baidu's most exciting growth catalyst is artificial intelligence (AI). Enterprise cloud spending is still in its infancy in China, which bodes well for Baidu's AI Cloud platform. Meanwhile, subsidiary Apollo Go surpassed more than 5 million cumulative autonomous rides since its inception. Perhaps it's no surprise that Baidu is providing electric vehicle maker Tesla with its mapping license for data collection on Chinese roads."", ""Baidu is forecast to grow its EPS by roughly 12% through 2027, but is currently valued at less than 10 times forward-year EPS. That's what we call a growth stock bargain!"", ""A fourth colossal growth stock you'll regret not buying in the new Nasdaq bull market is the U.S.'s largest electric utility by market cap, NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE)."", 'Generally, utility stocks are slow-growing businesses that investors seek out for their low volatility and market-topping income. NextEra has been consistently doubling or tripling the growth rate of other electric utilities for more than a decade, which qualifies it as a growth stock in an industry where very few exist.', ""The not-so-subtle secret to NextEra's long-term outperformance has been its focus on renewable energy. Out of its 72 gigawatts (GW) of capacity, 36 GW can be traced to green energy sources, including 24 GW of wind and 7 GW of solar. No utility in the world has more wind or solar capacity than NextEra Energy."", ""Though investing in cleaner energy solutions has been pricey, it's paid off in a big way for NextEra. Adjusted earnings have averaged a 10% growth rate since 2013, with dividend growth coming in at a compound annual rate of 11% over the same span. Substantially lower electricity generation costs have bolstered the company's profit and payout growth rates, compared to its peers."", ""What's more, NextEra Energy has no intentions of paring back its clean energy investments. Even with the Federal Reserve undertaking its steepest rate-hiking cycle in four decades, NextEra plans to bring between 32.7 GW and 41.8 GW in collective clean energy projects online between the start of 2023 and end of 2026. This should help it sustain a superior growth rate within the utility sector."", ""Shares of NextEra Energy can be snatched up right now by opportunistic growth seekers for less than 19 times consensus EPS forecasts for 2025. That's a 27% discount to its average forward-year earnings multiple over the last five years."", 'Before you buy stock in Mastercard, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Mastercard wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.', 'Consider when\xa0Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $525,806!*', 'Stock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Signs with WWD.', ""Bank of New York Mellon Corp (NYSE:BK), a leading global investment company, has recently filed its 10-Q report on May 3, 2024. The report provides a comprehensive overview of the company's financial performance and strategic positioning. As of the end of Q1 2024, BK reported a notable increase in net income to $1,027 million, up from $206 million in the previous quarter, showcasing a strong financial upturn. The company's total fee and other revenue also saw an increase to $3,487 million, compared to $3,257 million in the previous quarter. This financial overview sets the stage for a detailed SWOT analysis, providing insights into BK's strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats as it navigates the complex financial landscape."", ""Market Leadership and Global Presence: Bank of New York Mellon Corp's position as the world's largest global custody bank, with $47.8 trillion in assets under custody or administration, is a testament to its market leadership. The company's extensive global network, spanning 35 countries and over 100 markets, provides a competitive edge by offering clients a wide range of financial services. This global reach not only diversifies revenue streams but also enhances the company's ability to attract and retain multinational clients."", ""Strong Financial Performance: The recent financial data from the 10-Q filing underscores BK's robust financial health. The company's net income applicable to common shareholders saw a significant increase to $953 million in Q1 2024, up from $162 million in the previous quarter. This improvement reflects the company's ability to effectively manage its assets and generate revenue, even in a challenging economic environment. BK's solid balance sheet and revenue growth are indicative of its financial resilience and operational efficiency."", 'Operational Risks: Despite its strong market position, BK is not immune to operational risks, including those related to transaction processing and technology infrastructure. As financial services become increasingly digitized, BK must continuously invest in and update its systems to prevent disruptions, data breaches, and cyber threats. Any failure to do so could result in financial losses, reputational damage, and a loss of client trust.', 'Competitive Pressures: The financial services industry is highly competitive, with numerous players vying for market share. BK faces stiff competition from other custody banks and financial institutions, which could impact its ability to grow its client base and maintain profitability. The company must continually innovate and offer differentiated services to stay ahead of competitors and meet the evolving needs of its clients.', 'Technological Advancements: The ongoing digital transformation in the financial sector presents BK with opportunities to leverage technology to enhance its service offerings. By investing in blockchain, artificial intelligence, and data analytics, BK can improve operational efficiency, reduce costs, and offer more sophisticated solutions to its clients. These technological advancements can also help BK tap into new markets and create additional revenue streams.', 'Strategic Acquisitions and Partnerships: BK has the opportunity to expand its global footprint and service capabilities through strategic acquisitions and partnerships. By aligning with fintech companies or other financial institutions, BK can access new technologies, enter emerging markets, and diversify its product portfolio. Such collaborations can also help BK to better address the needs of its clients and strengthen its competitive position.', ""Market Volatility: As a global investment company, BK is exposed to market volatility and economic fluctuations. Changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates, and geopolitical tensions can impact the company's investment performance and client activity levels. BK must navigate these uncertainties carefully to mitigate potential negative impacts on its financial results and maintain client confidence."", ""Regulatory Changes: The financial services industry is subject to stringent regulatory oversight, and any changes in regulations can have significant implications for BK's operations. Compliance with new rules can result in increased costs and operational complexities. BK must stay abreast of regulatory developments and adapt its strategies accordingly to ensure compliance and minimize potential adverse effects on its business."", ""In conclusion, Bank of New York Mellon Corp (NYSE:BK) demonstrates a strong market position and financial performance, bolstered by its global presence and leadership in the custody banking sector. However, the company must address operational risks and competitive pressures to maintain its standing. Opportunities for growth through technological innovation and strategic partnerships are plentiful, but BK must also be vigilant of market volatility and regulatory changes that pose potential threats. Overall, BK's strategic approach and adaptability will be key to its continued success in the dynamic financial landscape."", 'This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 88% to be precise, is institutions. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.', 'Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors.

This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Bank of New York Mellon's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story."", ""Since institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences.

In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 8.6% and 7.9% of the stock."", 'A closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 15 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.', ""Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future."", 'While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders.

However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.', 'Our information suggests that The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation insiders own under 1% of the company. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$71m worth of shares (at current prices). It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling.

On its last earnings call, management stated that it expects the uncertainty around the cattle cycle to persist.Apart from this, TSN highlighted that the second quarter is seasonally the company’s weakest in terms of adjusted operating income and cash flows.

Since this decade began, all three major stock indexes have vacillated between bear and bull markets in successive years, with these swings most pronounced in the growth stock-powered Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC).', 'During the 2022 bear market, the Nasdaq Composite brought up the caboose with a 33% loss. But since closing this chapter, the Nasdaq has gained 51% and, as recently as last month, pushed to a new record-closing high above 16,400. This move confirms that the Nasdaq is firmly in a new, albeit young, bull market.', ""What's particularly interesting about this leading index is that it's retraced nearly 4% off its all-time high, as of the closing bell on May 2. For long-term-minded investors with cash at the ready, it means growth stocks can still be found at a bargain."", ""What follows are four colossal growth stocks you'll regret not buying in the new Nasdaq bull market."", ""The first sensational growth stock that's begging to be bought in the early stages of the new Nasdaq bull market is payment-processing leader Mastercard (NYSE: MA)."", ""The only real knock against Mastercard is that it's a cyclical company. If the U.S. and global economy were to dip into a recession, consumer and enterprise spending would be expected to decline, which would have a negative effect on the fees Mastercard collects from merchants to process transactions. A couple of predictive indicators, including a historic decline in M2 money supply, suggest a growing likelihood of weakness to come in the U.S. economy."", ""On the other hand, history is very much on Mastercard's side. Whereas most periods of economic expansion last for years, there hasn't been a single U.S. recession since the end of World War II that endured longer than 18 months. Extended periods of growth allow Mastercard to consistently grow its sales by double digits year after year."", ""Though it's a bit of a subtle point, Mastercard's purposeful avoidance of lending is another reason for its ongoing success and sustained profit margin of more than 40%. Companies that lend have to set aside capital to cover possible credit delinquencies and loan losses that arise during recessions. Strictly focusing on payment processing means Mastercard avoids these pitfalls and bounces back from downturns faster than most lending institutions."", ""Additionally, Mastercard's growth runway stretches for decades. Cross-border volume growth of 18% in the March-ended quarter speaks to just how large the opportunity is for it to continue expanding its payment infrastructure into underbanked regions, such as Africa, the Middle East, and Southeastern Asia."", 'While Mastercard might look a bit pricey at nearly 27 times forward-year earnings, this represents a 21% discount to its average trailing-five-year forward-earnings multiple.', ""A second colossal growth stock that you'll be kicking yourself for not buying in the early stages of the new Nasdaq bull market is gold-mining company Newmont (NYSE: NEM). Yes, you read that right... a gold stock that's also a growth stock."", ""Before (pardon the necessary pun) digging into company specifics, it's important to recognize the elephant in the room: The spot price of gold has surged to an all-time high in 2024."", ""The sizable rally in physical gold can be explained by a stubbornly high prevailing rate of inflation. In other words, people are looking for a place to park their cash (rather than letting it sit under the proverbial mattress) where it won't lose value over time. For decades, gold has been an asset that skittish investors have flocked to during periods of high inflation and/or economic turbulence. If the spot price of gold remains near an all-time high, it should translate into higher profitability for gold miners across the board."", ""One of the clearest company-specific catalysts for Newmont is its $16.8 billion, all-share buyout of Australia's Newcrest Mining, which closed in November. Newmont anticipates recognizing $500 million in cost synergies by the end of this year, as well as beefing up the combined company's operating cash flow by $2 billion within two years of closing. Buying Newcrest further solidified Newmont's already impressive gold and copper reserve profile."", 'To add to the above, Newmont\'s size presents clear cost advantages. Newmont has 10 ""Tier 1 assets,"" which are mines producing at least 500,000 gold equivalent ounces per year, with an all-in sustaining cost in the lower half of the industry, and a mine life of greater than 10 years.', ""Newmont's earnings per share (EPS) is forecast to double between 2023 and 2027 to around $3.20, which makes this lustrous stock all the more delectable for growth seekers."", ""The third exhilarating growth stock you'll regret not adding to your portfolio with the Nasdaq firmly in a new bull market is China-based Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU)."", ""The reason Baidu's stock has struggled recently is because the Chinese economy hasn't bounced back from the COVID-19 pandemic as quickly as expected. Multiple years of stringent lockdowns created supply chain kinks that are still working themselves out."", ""But as I pointed out earlier, patience and perspective are important when investing on Wall Street. Although China's economic ramp-up is taking a bit longer than anticipated, its burgeoning middle class gives the world's No. 2 economy by gross domestic product a path to sustained annual growth of 5% (or higher). Most large China-based companies, including Baidu, are going to benefit from this extensive growth runway."", ""Baidu's foundational operating segment is its internet search engine. Baidu's internet search share in China clocked in at close to 52% in April 2024, and has consistently come in at between 50% and 85% dating back 10 years, based on data from GlobalStats. Businesses are well aware that the best way to reach Chinese consumers is to target their advertising on Baidu's search engine. When China's economy finds its stride, once again, Baidu's ad revenue should increase substantially."", ""However, Baidu's most exciting growth catalyst is artificial intelligence (AI). Enterprise cloud spending is still in its infancy in China, which bodes well for Baidu's AI Cloud platform. Meanwhile, subsidiary Apollo Go surpassed more than 5 million cumulative autonomous rides since its inception. Perhaps it's no surprise that Baidu is providing electric vehicle maker Tesla with its mapping license for data collection on Chinese roads."", ""Baidu is forecast to grow its EPS by roughly 12% through 2027, but is currently valued at less than 10 times forward-year EPS. That's what we call a growth stock bargain!"", ""A fourth colossal growth stock you'll regret not buying in the new Nasdaq bull market is the U.S.'s largest electric utility by market cap, NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE)."", 'Generally, utility stocks are slow-growing businesses that investors seek out for their low volatility and market-topping income. NextEra has been consistently doubling or tripling the growth rate of other electric utilities for more than a decade, which qualifies it as a growth stock in an industry where very few exist.', ""The not-so-subtle secret to NextEra's long-term outperformance has been its focus on renewable energy. Out of its 72 gigawatts (GW) of capacity, 36 GW can be traced to green energy sources, including 24 GW of wind and 7 GW of solar.

Baxter International Inc. isn’t one of the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds at the end of the third quarter (see the details here).', 'Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to Baxter International’s First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Your lines will remain in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer segment of today’s call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded by Baxter and is copyrighted material. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Baxter’s permission. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Clare Trachtman, Senior Vice President, Chief Investor Relations Officer (sic) [Vice President, Investor Relations] at Baxter International. Ms. Trachtman, you may begin.', 'Clare Trachtman: Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Joe Almeida, Baxter’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Joel Grade, Baxter’s Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. On the call this morning, we will be discussing Baxter’s first quarter 2024 financial results along with our financial outlook for the second quarter and full year 2024. With that, let me start our prepared remarks by reminding everyone that this presentation, including comments regarding our financial outlook for the second quarter and full year 2024; new product development, including the potential impact of recent regulatory clearances with status and potential impact of our ongoing strategic and recent pricing actions, business development, regulatory matters and the macroeconomic environment, including commentary on improving supply chain conditions and evolving customer capital spending trends; contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties and of course, our actual results could differ materially from our current expectations.', ""Please refer to today's press release and our SEC filings for more detail concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. In addition, on today's call, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Baxter's ongoing business performance. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures being discussed today to the comparable GAAP financial measures is included in the accompanying investor presentation and also available in our earnings release issued this morning, which are both available on our website. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Joe. Joe?"", ""Joe Almeida: Thank you, Clare, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you taking the time to join us. I will begin with an overview of our first quarter results and then provide some updates regarding our ongoing strategic transformation. Joel Grade will follow with a closer look at our financials as well as our outlook for the second quarter and the remainder of the year. Then, as always, we'll open it up to your questions. Baxter started the year on a positive note, delivering solid results, which exceeded previously issued guidance on both the top line and bottom-line first quarter sales from continuing operations with 2% on a reported basis and 3% at constant currency rates. This compares to our original outlook of approximately 1% reported and 1% to 2% constant currency."", 'Overall revenue growth was driven by positive demand and pricing for a broad range of Baxter products. On the bottom-line, adjusted earnings per share for continuing operations of $0.65 came in above our prior guidance range of $0.59 to $0.62 per share. This performance was fueled by top line results, combined with our intense focus on driving improved supply chain execution across our manufacturing network. Overall, performance is clearly benefiting from the streamlining and strategic clarity afforded by our newly implemented operating model, as we leverage the advantages of improved visibility globally, increased accountability and function of verticalization. Crisp execution of our margin improvement initiatives, along with a more stable macroeconomic backdrop, is driving enhanced performance across our integrated supply chain operations.', ""And as always, Baxter benefits from its emphasis on essential health care needs in combination with the diversity and durability of our portfolio. This is clearly affecting our overall performance this quarter as the strength of our results across Medical Products and Therapies, Pharmaceuticals and Kidney Care helped offset underperformance in our Healthcare Systems & Technology segment. Taking a closer look at our performance by segment. Medical Products and Therapies, or MPT, delivered first quarter growth of 6% above reported and constant currency rates. Growth was fueled by both pricing and volume gains amid stable market conditions globally. We believe we're well-positioned to build on our momentum in MPT with the recent U.S. FDA clearance of our leading-edge Novum IQ volume infusion pump and Dose IQ Safety Software."", ""This integrated platform, which also includes our previously cleared syringe pump, comprises a single connected intelligent system offering a broad range of benefits for nurses, physicians and other clinicians as well as the patients who depend on them. Our Novum IQ technology is now available to order in the U.S. as part of our expanding portfolio of connected care solutions. Customers are excited about the Novum platform's ability to advance connectivity and intelligent infusion therapy. And the team is already engaged with many customers interested in this new technology. In fact, the large existing Novum syringe from customer will begin implementing the full Novum platform in the next few months. In just last week, we secured a 100% competitive account conversion to Baxter pumps with a top-tier multistate health system."", 'As you may remember, Novum LVB clearance was not factored in our original FY 2024 outlook. Given the time of the approval, we expect the contribution from Novum launch to be more notable in the second half of the year, even as it displaces, to some degree, sales of our Spectrum IQ pump and the outlook we are sharing today reflects this expected benefit along with the outperformance in the first quarter. Also in late-breaking MPT news last week, we received FDA approval of an expanded indication for Clinolipid, our mixed oil emulsion that provides a source of calories and essential omega fatty acids for parenteral nutrition patients. Clinolipid is now indicated for use in pediatric patients, including preterm and term neonates. This is an example of our continued commitment to meeting the nutritional needs of patients of all ages and is expected to be a positive addition to our nutrition portfolio.', 'Our Pharmaceutical segment achieved a growth of 11% in the first quarter at both reported and constant currency rates. Results for the quarter reflect a benefit from our recent new product launches in the U.S., including five new injectables in key therapeutic areas, including anti-infective and antihypertensive medications. Together, these new product introductions demonstrate our continued focus on innovation and delivering differentiated products that address areas of need with proprietary ready-to-use presentations, they can simplify the preparation process and support patient safety. Our performance in this segment was also strengthened by heightened demand outside the U.S. for our drug compounding services. This overall momentum more than offset declines from inhaled anesthesia products.', 'Our Kidney Care segment delivered 3% growth at reported rates and 4% at constant currency. Growth was driven by pricing benefits as well as a strong demand for our Acute Therapies portfolio and steady gains of peritoneal patients in nearly all markets. Growth in this business was tempered by the impact from select product and market exits and reduced volumes in China due to government-based procurement initiatives and a lower patient sensors. As noted, positive results across these three segments helped offset disappointing performance in Healthcare Systems & Technologies, or HST, which declined 9% at both reported and constant currency rates. This decline was driven to some extent by order timing as well as operational factors. Our new operating model has been vital in helping us isolate underlying challenges affecting this segment.', ""The size of steps are already underway to address and enhance performance in this business and help realize our full opportunity in this space. These include forging a deeper partnership between the commercial and enterprise account teams focused on the value and quality of the broader portfolio. Implementing new tools and processes focused on increasing visibility to historical purchases, creating greater differentiation in customer engagement practices and related measures. We expect these steps collectively to improve operational performance for HST, particularly in the second half of the year. I remain excited about HST and the positive contribution it is expected to deliver to the overall Baxter portfolio. The team is working incredibly hard to address this challenge and turnaround performance in this business and I'm grateful for their dedication and efforts."", 'Before I pass it to Joel, I will share an update on our proposed Kidney Care separation as we announced in the March 4th 8-K filing, we are now pursuing dual pathways in the proposed separation of this business, including potentially selling the business to a private equity investor. The ultimate path forward will be determined consistent with our objective to accelerate performance for both entities and maximize shareholder value. We currently expect the separation to take place in the second half of 2024. Looking ahead, I want to express my excitement about Baxter overall trajectory. Our life sustaining mission is as always our North Star and our colleagues around the world making it come alive tenacious focus on execution and operational excellence.', 'Our progress against our strategic transformation initiative showcases our ability to deliver on what we set out to accomplish. The benefits are clear in our overall outperformance for the quarter. Our building momentum, our recent innovation milestones and the progress of our proposed Kidney Care separation journey. We will continue to maintain the pace and intensity of our transformation and take the necessary steps so that all of our segments are well-positioned to power our performance going forward. I will now pass it to Joel to provide more detail on our performance and outlook.', 'Joel Grade: Thanks Joe and good morning, everyone. As Joe mentioned, we are pleased with our first quarter results, which came in ahead of our expectations. First quarter 2024 global sales of $3.6 billion increased 2% on a reported basis and 3% on a constant currency basis, and as mentioned, compared favorably to our previously issued guidance. Performance in the quarter benefited from better-than-expected sales across all our product divisions, with the exception of those within our Healthcare Systems & Technologies segment. On the bottom-line, adjusted earnings from continuing operations totaled $0.65 per share, increasing 33% versus the prior year period and ahead of our prior guidance of $0.59 to $0.62 per share. These results reflect the meaningful operational improvements we are recognizing both commercially as well as within our integrated supply chain network, and these factors drove our outperformance in the quarter.', ""Now, I'll walk through our results by reportable segments. Commentary regarding sales growth will reflect growth at constant currency rates. Sales in our Medical Products & Therapies, or MPT segment, were $1.2 billion, increasing 6%. Within MPT, first quarter sales from our Infusion Therapies & Technologies division totaled $966 million and increased 6%. Sales in the quarter benefited from strong growth internationally across the division, including in our IV solutions, nutrition and infusion systems portfolios. Solid demand in the U.S. for IV solutions also contributed to growth in the quarter. Sales of Advanced Surgery totaled $263 million and grew 8%, coming in ahead of expectations, and reflecting strong growth internationally. For our Healthcare Systems & Technologies, or HST segment, sales in the quarter were $667 million and declined 9%."", 'Within the HST segment, sales in our Care and Connectivity Solutions, or CCS division, were $402 million, declining 7%. Performance in the quarter was impacted by several factors, including the phasing of product installations, particularly for care communications, which is expected to accelerate later in the year by the timing of capital orders, which increased mid-single digits in the quarter but are expected to ramp more meaningfully over the course of the year. By lower rental revenues, which negatively impacted sales by approximately $5 million. And finally, by certain operational challenges, for which the team is in the process of implementing clear plans to improve performance and enhance commercial rigor. Given all these factors, we expect to see significant improvements for CCS in both orders and revenue in the second half of the year, which is similar to the -- we experienced last year in this division.', 'Front Line Care sales in the quarter were $265 million, declining 12%. Growth in the quarter was impacted by a difficult comparison in the prior year as backlog reductions positively contributed to growth in the prior year period. Performance in the quarter was also affected by softness in the primary care market which negatively impacted sales in both our connected monitoring and intelligent diagnostics product portfolios. Similar to CCS, we expect performance to meaningfully improve in the second half of the year as market conditions for primary care are anticipated to ease, the pace of customer orders are expected to increase, and we anniversary the prior year impact from the backlog reduction. Sales in our Pharmaceuticals segment were $578 million, increasing 11%.', 'Performance in the quarter reflected double-digit growth in both our U.S. and international injectables portfolio, driven by new product launches as well as continued strong demand for services within our drug compounding portfolio internationally. Moving on to Kidney Care. Sales in the quarter were $1.1 billion, increasing 4%. Within Kidney Care, global sales for chronic therapies were $888 million, increasing 2%. Solid PD growth in the quarter was partially offset by the negative impact from certain products and market exits in our in-center HD business as well as reduced sales in China due to government procurement initiatives and lower patient census volumes following the pandemic. We estimate that these items negatively impacted sales by approximately $50 million in the quarter.', ""Sales in our Acute Therapies business were $214 million, representing growth of 15%, driven by strong demand and competitive wins in the U.S. and solid performance internationally. Other sales, which represent sales not allocated to a segment and primarily includes sales of products and services provided directly through certain of our manufacturing facilities, were $16 million and declined 47% during the quarter, in line with our expectations and reflecting reduced demand for certain contract manufacturing volumes. Now moving on to the rest of the P&L. Our adjusted gross margin totaled 42.5% and represented an increase of 170 basis points over the prior year and was favorable to our expectations. The year-over-year improvement in gross margin primarily reflects the strong operational efficiencies we are realizing within our integrated supply chain network, resulting from execution of the margin improvement programs we're implementing and the anniversary of the negative margin impacts from inflationary pressures that drove higher cost of goods sold in the prior year period."", 'Pricing initiatives in select markets also positively contributed to margin improvement in the quarter. First quarter margins also reflected a benefit from the closure of our dialyzer facility as production in the facility was increased in advance of the closure, resulting in better absorption and lower costs for these dialyzers. This benefit is expected to be isolated to the first quarter. Overall product mix in the quarter did partially offset margin expansion in the quarter. Adjusted SG&A totaled $856 million or 23.8% as a percentage of sales consistent with the prior year period as ongoing transformation initiatives to enhance operational efficiencies were offset by higher spend in select investments in sales and marketing initiatives. SG&A leverage is expected to improve as sales ramp over the course of the year.', 'Adjusted R&D spending in the quarter totaled $160 million and represented 4.5 as a percentage of sales, similar to the prior year period and reflects our continued investments in advancing new products across the portfolio and bringing innovation to patients across our [Technical Difficulty]. These factors resulted in an adjusted operating margin of 14.3%, an increase of 180 basis points versus the prior year. Net interest expense totaled $78 million in the quarter, a decrease of $39 million versus the prior year period, driven by debt repayments in the fourth quarter of 2023 with proceeds from our BPS divestiture. We plan to continue to repay debt in 2024, consistent with our stated capital allocation priorities. Adjusted other non-operating income totaled $7 million in the quarter, compared to income of $2 million in the prior year period.', 'The adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 25.0% compared to 23.1% in the prior year period. The year-over-year increase is primarily driven by a valuation allowance recognized in the quarter. And as previously mentioned, adjusted earnings from continuing operations totaled $0.65 per share and increased 33% versus the prior year, primarily driven by commercial performance and operational efficiencies within our integrated supply chain. Let me conclude my remarks by discussing our outlook for the second quarter and full year 2024, including some key assumptions underpinning the guidance. For full year 2024, Baxter now expects total sales growth of approximately 2% on a reported basis and 2% to 3% on a constant currency basis, which is an increase from prior guidance of approximately 2% on a constant currency basis.', 'Constant currency sales guidance for the full year by reportable segments is as follows; for MPT, we expect sales growth of 4% to 5%. This is an increase from the prior guidance of 3% to 4% and reflects the first quarter outperformance and the inclusion of Novum, which is currently expected to contribute an incremental $25 million to infusion pump sales and reflects some cannibalization of prior planned sales of Spectrum. Sales in our Healthcare Systems & Technologies segment are expected to be flat to the prior year as compared to previous guidance of approximately 3%. As mentioned earlier, we expect performance to meaningfully improve in the second half of the year, driven by the factors discussed, including timing of installations, order phasing and improved operational execution.', 'We expect pharmaceutical sales growth of 6% to 7%, which compares favorably to prior guidance of 4% to 5% and reflects the strong start to the year and continued momentum for our new product launches. Collectively, sales for these Baxter businesses are expected to increase 3% to 4% in 2024. For Kidney Care, we expect sales growth of flat to 1% as compared to 2023. This also compares favorably to prior guidance and reflects the underlying momentum of this business. Now, turning to our outlook for other P&L line items. We continue to expect adjusted operating margin to increase by at least 50 basis points in 2024. We expect our nonoperating expenses, which include net interest expense and other income and expense, to total approximately $350 million in aggregate during 2024.', 'We continue to anticipate a full year adjusted tax rate between 22.0% and 22.5%. We expect our diluted share count to increase slightly and average 511 million shares for the year. Based on all these factors, we now anticipate full year adjusted earnings, excluding special items, of $2.88 to $2.98 per diluted share, which also compares favorably to prior guidance of $2.85 to $2.95 per diluted share and reflects the outperformance we realized in the first quarter. Specific to the second quarter of 2024, we expect global sales growth of approximately 1% on a reported basis and 2% to 3% on a constant currency basis. And we expect adjusted earnings, excluding special items, of $0.65 to $0.67 per diluted share. With that, we can now open up the call for Q&A.', 'Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would like to remind participants that this call is being recorded, and a digital replay will be available on the Baxter International website for 60 days at www.baxter.com.

Our strong first quarter results demonstrate our focus on profitably growing the business. We produced revenue growth both organically and through acquisitions, while enhancing profitability across the enterprise. During the quarter, we achieved revenue growth of 8%, generated adjusted EBITDA growth of 12%, expanded adjusted EBITDA margin by 120 basis points, reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.45 and produced $535 million of adjusted free cash flow. The results we delivered are made possible by executing our strategy, supported by our differentiated capabilities. Regarding customers zeal, our efforts to provide best-in-class essential services and sustainability offerings continue to drive customer loyalty and organic growth in the business.', 'Our customer retention rate remained high at over 94%. And we continue to see favorable trends in our net promoter score as customers value our broad service offerings and the quality of our service delivery. Strong organic revenue growth during the first quarter was underpinned by core price on related revenue of 8.5% and average yield on related revenue of 7.3%. This level of pricing exceeded our internal cost inflation and resulted in over 100 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion. Organic volume on related revenue declined 1.1%. Large container and disposal volumes were negatively impacted by severe weather across most of our geographies during the first quarter. Most of the weather impact occurred in January, and we saw a notable rebound in volume performance in February and March as weather conditions normalized.', 'Turning to our digital capabilities. The team continues to advance the implementation of digital tools that improve the experience for both customers and our employees. Our RISE digital operations platform is driving improved route optimization and safety performance and providing more predictable service delivery to our customers. Development of our new asset management system is underway, which is expected to increase maintenance technician productivity and enhanced warranty recovery. We expect to begin deploying the new system later this year using a phased approach, which we estimate will result in $20 million of annual cost savings by 2026. We continue to benefit from advanced technology on recycling and waste collection routes. Our platform utilizes cameras to identify overfill containers and contamination and recycling containers.', 'This technology will reduce contamination in our recycling centers and is expected to generate approximately $60 million in incremental annual revenue. To-date, we have already achieved $30 million of annual benefit. Moving on to sustainability. We believe that our sustainability innovation investments in plastic circularity and renewable natural gas are a platform for profitable growth. Development of our polymer centers and Blue Polymers joint venture facilities remains on track. Our Las Vegas Polymer center is operational and delivery of plastic flake to our offtake partners began in March. Construction is progressing on our Indianapolis Polymer Center with equipment installation planned to begin in June. This operation will be co-located with a Blue Polymers production facility.', 'The renewable natural gas projects being co-developed with our partners continue to advance. One project came online during the first quarter, and we expect at least seven additional projects to be completed in 2024. We continue to advance our efforts to support decarbonization, including our industry-leading commitment to fleet electrification. We currently have 15 collection vehicles in operations. We expect to have more than 50 additional EVs to be added to our fleet in 2024. We now have seven facilities with commercial EV charging infrastructure. Development of 40 additional locations is underway with more than 10 new sites expected to be completed in 2024. As part of our approach to sustainability, we continually strive to be the employer of choice in the markets that we serve.', ""Employee turnover continues to improve with our first quarter turnover rate improving 70 basis points compared to the prior year. As a result, we are better staffed to optimize our operations and capitalize on growth opportunities in the market. Our comprehensive sustainability performance continues to be widely recognized as Republic Services was recently named to Barron's 100 Most Sustainable Companies list, Ethisphere's World's Most Ethical Companies list and Fortune's Most Innovative Companies List. With respect to capital allocation, we invested $41 million in acquisitions during the first quarter. Our acquisition pipeline remains supportive of continued activity in both the Recycling and Waste and Environmental Solutions businesses. We continue to see opportunity for $500 million of investment in value-creating acquisitions in 2024."", 'Additionally, we returned $168 million to shareholders through dividends in the first quarter. I will now turn the call over to Brian, who will provide details on the quarter.', 'Brian DelGhiaccio: Thanks, Jon. Core price on total revenue was 7%; core price on related revenue was 8.5%, which included open market pricing of 10.2% and restricted pricing of 5.7%. The components of core price on related revenue included small container of 12.2%, large container of 7.7% and residential of 8.1%. Average yield on total revenue was 6% and average yield on related revenue was 7.3%. First quarter volume on total revenue decreased 90 basis points and volume on related revenue decreased 1.1%. The components of our volume performance included a decrease in large container of 4.4%, primarily due to severe weather in January, along with continued softness in construction-related activity and a decrease in residential of 2.6%.', 'During the quarter, landfill MSW volume was up 1.6% and small container volume increased 30 basis points. Moving on to recycling. Commodity prices were $153 per ton during the first quarter. This compared to $105 per ton in the prior year. Recycling processing and commodity sales increased revenue by 40 basis points during the quarter. Commodity prices are exceeding our initial expectations as current commodity prices are approximately $160 per ton. Now, turning to our Environmental Solutions business. First quarter Environmental Solutions revenue increased $15 million compared to the prior year. The growth was due to the rollover impact from an acquisition that closed in the fourth quarter of 2023. Adjusted EBITDA margin in the Environmental Solutions business was 20.5%, which compared to 21% in the prior year.', 'After considering the dilutive impact from a recent acquisition of 110 basis points, EBITDA margin in the Environmental Solutions business increased 60 basis points. Total company adjusted EBITDA margin for the first quarter expanded 120 basis points to 30.2%, which was driven by margin expansion in the underlying business of 110 basis points. Other changes in margin performance during the quarter included a 20 basis point increase from recycled commodity prices and a 20 basis point increase from net fuel. This was partially offset by a 30 basis point decrease from acquisitions. Adjusted free cash flow was $535 million in the first quarter. Free cash flow conversion was 45.9%. Total debt was $13 billion and total liquidity was $2.8 billion.', 'Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was approximately 2.8 times. With respect to taxes, our combined tax rate and impact from equity investments and renewable energy resulted in an equivalent tax impact of 25.4% during the quarter, which was in line with our expectations. We also received a $12 million state grant associated with renewable energy investment. This benefit was recorded in other income and added $0.03 of EPS. This did not impact EBITDA or EBITDA margin during the quarter. With that, operator, I would like to open the call to questions.', 'See also', '15 Best Places to Retire in Kansas and', '12 Best Alternatives to Adidas Samba.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of Republic Services, Inc. (NYSE:RSG)."", 'Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.', ' See our latest analysis for Republic Services ', 'The formula for return on equity is:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Republic Services is:', '17% = US$1.8b ÷ US$11b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2024).', ""The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.17 in profit."", 'One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, Republic Services has a better ROE than the average (10%) in the Commercial Services industry.', 'That is a good sign. However, bear in mind that a high ROE doesn’t necessarily indicate efficient profit generation. Aside from changes in net income, a high ROE can also be the outcome of high debt relative to equity, which indicates risk.  Our risks dashboardshould have the 2 risks we have identified for Republic Services.', ""Most companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used."", ""It's worth noting the high use of debt by Republic Services, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 1.16. While its ROE is pretty respectable, the amount of debt the company is carrying currently is not ideal. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time."", ""Return on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. In our books, the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE."", 'But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider.

The phosphates segment generated adjusted EBITDA of $277 million on sales volumes of 1.6 million tonnes.

The continued divergence of our performance from many others in the Brazil ag industry is resulting from the decisions we've made to prioritize risk management and margin over volume. Last year, we quickly worked through high-cost inventory. And this year, we are navigating the challenging credit and liquidity environment by prioritizing sales to lower credit risk customers, demanding prepayments and insisting on contract performance."", ""Our distribution margin improved in the second half of last year and first quarter results were significantly better than expected. We also had very strong co-product volume and margin performance during the quarter. Our results this quarter show that we're successfully working through challenging environments to drive strong results. At the same time, we are focused on creating shareholder value in additional ways. A great example of this is our transaction with Ma'aden, which will exchange our 25% position in the MWSPC joint venture for an approximately $1.5 billion position in Ma'aden shares. This new structure allows our successful long-term partnership with Ma'aden to continue while also providing increased investment transparency and flexibility for capital redeployment over time."", ""I should note that we believe that neither this transaction nor any potential future transactions involving the Ma'aden shares will result in any material tax friction. We have several other ongoing initiatives to drive improved returns. Our $150 million cost reduction plan is on track and delivering early results. Potash production cash cost per tonne declined about $10 in the first quarter compared with the same period in the prior year. We are rightsizing our workforce and have identified opportunities to reduce our third-party contractors over the next 18 months, which will result in $20 million to $30 million in annual cost savings when complete. We are making progress on our SG&A expense management. With our first quarter SG&A expenses down by $21 million or 16% compared with a year ago."", ""We are also focused on improving and optimizing our operations. In phosphate, we're making good progress on our volume improvement plans through the execution of extensive maintenance turnarounds, including activities at the Riverview and New Wales plants in the first and second quarters and a turnaround at the Louisiana plant in the second quarter. In potash, our Esterhazy HydroFloat project, which will give us an additional 400,000 tonnes of capacity will be in service by mid-next year. We are expanding our market access with the construction of a 1 million-tonne blending plant at Palmeirante in the fast-growing northern agricultural region of Brazil. The project is well underway. We are currently building the warehouse structure, support buildings and electrical infrastructure and expect to complete the project early next year."", ""We have recently completed the MicroEssentials conversion at our Riverview facility. Once it is fully ramped up, over half of our U.S. phosphate production will be higher-margin value-added products. We are also on track to reduce our capital expenditures by $200 million in this year versus last year. These initiatives all have one thing in common. They improve returns across the cycle. With that, let's take a closer look at agriculture and fertilizer markets. While corn and soybean prices have softened recently, farmers remain profitable. Even a small lift in these commodity prices would return farm profitability to quite healthy levels. Moreover, the prices for many other ag commodities, such as palm oil and rice remain at very attractive levels."", 'In addition, weather is shifting rapidly from a strong El Niño to La Niña, which should prove positive for Southeast Asia, India and Brazil. Favorable conditions in Southeast Asia are particularly important as we expect the region will be responsible for about two-thirds of global potash shipment growth this year. In fact, in January and February, potash imports to Malaysia and Indonesia were up about 35% versus a year ago due to depleted channel inventories in a very constructive potash to palm oil price ratio. Phosphate markets remain tight, we are seeing the expected post-spring seasonal slowdown in North America, but Brazilian demand for the Safra season is emerging. Strong demand and limited supply pushed SSP prices in Brazil, up by $30 per tonne in April.', ""The recent seasonal uptick in Chinese phosphate export availability has exerted downward pressure on prices in India. But India demand for phosphate this year is expected to be solid on the back of an above-average monsoon season. India's demand will surely exceed China's ability to supply the nation. We expect the Indian government to increase the maximum retail price to allow importer economics to work in the current global pricing environment. And thus, incentivize producers to send tonnes there. Longer term, the outlook for phosphate continues to be very positive. Demand is growing to produce more grains and oilseeds for food and biofuels and for increasing industrial uses, including battery production. At the same time, limited new supply is coming to market and Chinese exports are down about 25% from historical norms."", 'The structural changes in phosphate supply and demand point to strong fundamentals in the years ahead. The global potash supply and demand picture is balanced, the same seasonal dynamic occurring in potash, North America is slowing, but Brazil is picking up, resulting in a $30 increase in MOP prices in Brazil in recent weeks, an indication of positive market sentiment and constructive supply and demand dynamics. With Southeast Asia demand returning, we continue to expect near record global potash shipments this year. Now moving on to our outlook. For phosphate, we expect second quarter sales volumes of 1.6 million to 1.8 million tonnes and average FOB prices at the plant of $530 to $580 per tonne. The fire at our Riverview facility caused damage to pipes, pumps and a phosphogypsum transfer station.', ""Our team engineered a temporary solution that enabled us to restore some phosphoric acid production in just two weeks, and we are now back at full capacity. We expect some reduction in the second and third quarter sales volumes, but overall, the impact was minimized. Our second quarter guidance reflects the impacts of the fire, the ongoing turnaround activity and the seasonal softening in the U.S., partially offset by improvements in Brazil. For potash, we expect second quarter sales volumes of 2.2 million to 2.4 million tonnes and average FOB price at the mine of $210 to $250 per tonne. For Mosaic Fertilizantes, we expect second quarter sales volumes and profitability to improve from the first quarter, reflecting seasonality and our differentiated approach to tackling Brazil's operating environment."", ""We expect planned turnaround activities to weigh on production margins in the second quarter. As you recall, we completed the high-priced inventory destocking in the first half of last year. Going forward, we expect distribution margin to be at normal annualized level of $30 to $40 per tonne, but it may vary from quarter-to-quarter. To conclude, despite the seasonal reset of the market as we transition out of North America planting season, our outlook for the year is positive. We are taking near-term actions and executing long-term initiatives, as our agreement with Ma'aden demonstrates, to continue to strengthen our business and maximize shareholder value. Now we'll move on to Q&A."", 'See also', 'Jim Cramer’s New Picks: 10 Stocks to Buy and', 'Bill Miller’s Latest 13 Stock Picks.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

Unlike SpaceX's capsule, which splashes down on water, Starliner will deploy giant air bags and touch down on land in one of four possible locations in the Southwest — a system the Russian space program has used since its inception. Edwards Air Force Base in Kern County is a contingency landing zone.Assuming the flight is a success, Boeing would be cleared to fly Starliner on regular flights carrying cargo and astronauts, where it would stay docked for six months and provide NASA with a second, redundant American craft to reach the station, a longtime goal.

Before going into our first quarter results, I want to take a moment to thank our former Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Strategy and Corporate Development Officer, Joydeep Goswami, for his many contributions to Illumina over more than four years. As Salli noted, Joydeep will stay on an advisory role through June to support a smooth transition. I also wanted to welcome our new CFO, Ankur Dhingra, who you will hear from shortly, and congratulate Jakob Wedel, who has now been named as Chief Strategy and Corporate Development Officer. Jakob joined Illumina in November and has been heavily involved in our long-term strategy planning. Throughout the quarter, I continued to meet with customers around the world and had the opportunity to bring a number of them to our San Diego headquarters to discuss new ways to collaborate, innovate, and shape what their future looks like with Illumina.', 'Some of our customers shared how they are scaling up their projects with NovaSeq X to unlock greater discovery power. One key area of focus is harnessing whole genome opportunities in minimal residual disease. Other customers are starting to sequence deeper and are adding multiomics layers to their projects, while others are looking at epigenomic biomarkers and methylation to help diagnose and characterize disease. We are seeing a significant opportunity to expand in multiomics. Customers are looking for more sophisticated solutions to support their work, and we are exploring all avenues to create value in this space. Our recent acquisition of Partek, a specialized multiomics software solution, is a building block of our expansion into this space.', ""Our intent is to collaborate with our customers to understand how we can provide more sample to answer solutions. Illumina is at the heart of the ecosystem and we will continue to catalyze the industry with an even greater focus on our customers' priorities. Turning to our first quarter results, I'll focus my comments on Core Illumina. In Q1, we delivered Core Illumina revenue of approximately $1.06 billion ahead of our expectations. While it was a decent start to the year, we remain cautious due to the persistently challenging global macro environment where customers are still constrained in their purchasing decisions. As expected, we are seeing this playing out across our regions, notably with lower NovaSeq X placements versus the first quarter of 2023, where we shipped our first X instrument to fulfill a strong pre-order book."", ""Three of our regions declined year-over-year. America's revenue was down 4%. EMEA revenue was down 3%. And Greater China revenue was down 14%. Europe revenue was up 7% year-over-year although we expect a decline in Q2 given the last year's strong X shipment in Europe in the second quarter. Nonetheless, Illumina management team continues to make significant progress executing against my three key priorities to accelerate value creation across the company. My first priority, driving our top line, is grounded in a growing installed base and helping customers realize the full potential of our instruments. In Q1, we shipped an additional 55 NovaSeq X instruments, bringing our total X installed base to more than 400 instruments. This is a solid start of the year and we expect momentum to continue to build."", ""We also saw promising consumables demand throughout the quarter as our customers continue to scaling their operations and expand their sequencing projects. With the launch of the 25B Reagent Kit in Q4 and the 1.5B in Q1, and alongside with the well-received upgrade of the 10B flow cell, we are now providing our customers with the full suite of NovoSeq X products. In Q1, we also made XLEAP-SBS chemistry available to our mid-throughput customers with the launch of our P4 flow cell on the existing NextSeq 1K, 2K instruments. In the first several weeks post-launch, we have received exceptional feedback from customers who are reporting reads that exceed specs for quantity and quality. Customers are positive about the simple migration that's enabled them to run spatial and single-cell projects, and they are impressed with the accuracy they see with the dragon on board."", ""Illumina continues to pursue strategic partnership and alliances to drive the entire genomics ecosystem forward. As a recent example, Pillar Biosciences announced FDA approval for its pan-cancer IVD for general tumor profiling on the Illumina MiSeq DX system. We've been partner with Pillar since 2017 and are excited for this important milestone. Also in the quarter, Bristol Myers Squibb joined our previously announced collaboration with Johnson & Johnson Innovative Medicine on the development of our multi-cancer whole genome sequencing based molecular residual disease assay to better understand disease recurrence. You should expect to see more of these types of activities going forward. Now turning to my second priority. I'm continuing my focus on delivering operational excellence by driving margin improvement through increased productivity by sustaining innovation and growth."", ""It has been my goal to align our organization in a way that best supports our customers' evolving needs. In March, we brought together our marketing and commercial teams under one customer first global function. I'm confident that combining these teams into one global commercial organization will build our agility to better serve customers, while delivering more sustained growth and margins over time. Additionally, we are focused on driving further improvements throughout our end-to-end supply chain and are taking a disciplined approach to improve our cost structure. In Q1, we implemented new initiatives to adjust pricing across our portfolio to better cover our global operational cost. We also made progress in streamlining our real estate footprint as we exited select facilities in the Bay Area and in San Diego."", ""These actions add to the number of ongoing initiatives that will continue to support our margins and increase further flexibility for investment in high growth areas. We are also tightly focused on stabilizing our Greater China business. And in Q1, we brought on Jenny Zheng as Head of Region. Jenny has deep expertise in healthcare and global organization and a strong leadership and execution mindset. She's already proving to be a great leader of our China team and is introducing changes to make our business more in China for China, which will include improving our local manufacturing and partnerships in the region. Moving on to my third priority, which is working to resolve GRAIL as quickly as possible. In April, we reached an important milestone in the divestment process when the European Commission approved our divestment plan for GRAIL."", ""The approved plan contemplates both sales and capital markets options and we have made progress on both paths, consistent with the European Commission's divestiture. In the event of a capital market transaction, we are required to capitalize GRAIL with approximately $1 billion, reflecting two and a half years of funding based on GRAIL's long-range plan. The amount includes cash on GRAIL's balance sheet. We are on track to finalize the terms of the transactions by the end of the second quarter. I look forward to having additional updates for you soon. Overall, I'm encouraged by the progress we have achieved in the quarter and optimistic about delivering on our initiatives here in 2024. Now I'll ask Ankur to share more detail on our first quarter results and outlook."", ""Ankur Dhingra: Thank you, Jacob. And hello, everyone. I'm very excited to join Team Illumina to improve human health by unlocking the power of the genome. I'm passionate about making a positive, meaningful impact in health care. I am very familiar with the role Illumina has played in establishing and advancing the genomics industry over the last 25 years. Building on that strong foundation, I'm confident we can continue leading, supporting our customers, and delivering on the promise of what genomics can do for patients around the globe. I would also like to express my thanks to Joydeep for his support as I transition into my role. It's been a great first two and a half weeks. I'll start by reviewing our segment results for Core Illumina and GRAIL, followed by consolidated financial results, and then conclude with my remarks on our current outlook for 2024."", ""I will be discussing non-GAAP results, which include stock-based compensation. I encourage you to review the GAAP reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures which can be found in today's release and in the supplementary data available on our website. Starting with our segment financials. Core Illumina first quarter revenue was $1.06 billion dollars, which is down 2% year-on-year, both on a reported and constant currency basis. This revenue performance exceeded our expectations and was primarily driven by three areas. First, strong performance in high throughput consumables. Second, timing of revenue from certain strategic partnerships. And third, some customers accelerating delivery of a few NovaSeq X instruments from Q2 into Q1. Core Illumina sequencing consumables revenue of $698 million was up 1% year-over-year, primarily due to growth in high throughput."", 'On a sequential basis, NovaSeq X consumables grew in the double digits following the successful launch of the 25B flow cell. Total sequencing GB output on our connected high and mid-throughput instruments grew over 35% year-over-year and grew at a high single digit rate quarter-over-quarter. The research and applied activity benefited as transition to the NovaSeq X continues to ramp and 25B adoption grew at large core labs. Clinical activity continued to be driven predominantly by the NovoSeq 6000. As a reminder, we believe this data is a useful reference that shows the general activity trends across our install base and is directionally correlated with revenue over time. Sequencing instruments revenue for Core Illumina of $110 million declined 29% year-over-year in Q1 2024.', 'The year-over-year decline was driven both by, one, an expected decline in mid-through-put shipments as capital and cash flow constraints continue to impact purchasing behavior and moderate instrument placements, and second, lower NovaSeq X placements as compared to significant pre-order launch-related shipments in the first quarter of 2023. For NovaSeq X, as Jacob noted, we shipped 55 instruments in Q1. Core Illumina sequencing service and other revenue of $151 million was up 27% year-over-year, driven primarily by an increase in revenue from strategic partnerships and higher instrument service contract revenue on a growing install base. Moving to the rest of the Core Illumina P&L. Core Illumina non-GAAP gross margin of 67.1% for the quarter increased 190 basis points year-over-year, driven primarily by a more favorable mix of sequencing consumables and execution of our operational excellence priorities that delivered cost savings, including freight and improved productivity.', 'This was partially offset by certain strategic partnership revenue, that is lower margin, and increased warranty and fuel service cost. Core Illumina non-GAAP operating expenses of $491 million were down $23 million year-over-year, primarily due to decreased labor expense as a result of reduced headcount and continued savings from our cost containment initiatives. Core Illumina non-GAAP operating expenses were lower than expected due to timing of project spend shifting from Q1 into Q2 and lower stock-based compensation expense due to one-time reversals. Putting it all together, Core Illumina non-GAAP operating margin was 20.6% in Q1 2024 compared to 17.4% in Q1 2023. Transitioning to financial results for GRAIL. GRAIL revenue of $27 million for the quarter grew 35% year-over-year, driven primarily by adoption of Galleri.', ""GRAIL non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $197 million and increased $24 million year-over-year, driven primarily by increased headcount to support commercial expansion and research and development. Moving to consolidated financial results. In the first quarter, consolidated revenue of $1.08 billion was down 1% year-over-year, both on a reported and constant currency basis. Non-GAAP net income was $14 million or $0.09 per diluted share, which included dilution from GRAIL's non-GAAP operating loss of $185 million for the quarter. Non-GAAP EPS exceeded our expectations, driven primarily by higher core revenue and lower core operating expenses in the quarter. Our Q1 non-GAAP tax rate was 46.4% compared to 27.3% in Q1 2023, with both periods including a meaningful impact from the consolidations of GRAIL's operating loss, which increased by $21 million year-over-year."", 'Absent the impact of GRAIL, our Q1 2024 and Q1 2023 tax rates were in the mid-20s. Our non-GAAP weighted average diluted share count for the quarter was approximately 159 million. Moving to consolidated cash flow and balance sheet items for the quarter. Cash flow provided by operations were $77 million. Capital expenditures were $36 million and free cash flow was $41 million and we did not repurchase any common stock. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.12 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Moving now to 2024 guidance. As a reminder, Illumina is moving as quickly as possible to resolve GRAIL, and the company is focusing its 2024 financial outlook on Core Illumina, given the uncertainty around the specific timing and impact of the GRAIL divestment.', ""Our guidance does not assume any impact from the potential divestment of GRAIL in 2024. We will provide non-GAAP EPS guidance for 2024 upon completion of the divestment. We are encouraged by our results in Q1 that came in ahead of our expectations, both for top line and margins. We've also seen the seasonal rebuild of our total performance obligations, our backlog, which increased more than 20% from the end of Q4. At the same time, we're still not seeing any significant improvement in the macroeconomic environment or our business in China. And we are monitoring the impact of a strengthening US dollar. While we are seeing early strength in consumables to start the year, it's being offset by capital constraints that are continuing to weigh on instrument purchases."", 'As such, we are reiterating our full year 2024 Core Illumina revenue guidance of approximately flat from 2023, and non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 20%. Our operating margin expectations continue to reflect the benefit of gross margin improvement and disciplined management of our expenses, including reduced headcount, offset by normalization of our performance-based compensation, as well as the impacts of inflation. For the second quarter of 2024, we expect Core Illumina revenue in the range of $1.072 billion to $1.084 billion, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 6.5 to 7.5 percentage points. The year-over-year decline is predominantly because of the lower NovaSeq X instrument shipments, given the significant backlog we worked through early last year following the launch.', 'At the midpoint, this guidance reflects a $22 million sequential increase from Q1 of 2024. For the second quarter, we expect Core Illumina non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 18%, resulting from a seasonal step up in operating expenses in Q2 compared to Q1, primarily due to an increase in stock-based compensation expenses from the timing of equity grants. We also expect an increase due to some project spending shifting into Q2 from Q1. With that, I will now turn it back over to Jacob for his closing remarks. Thank you.', ""Jacob Thaysen: Thanks, Ankur. Before we close and move to Q&A, I'd like to comment on our upcoming strategy update event. Illumina's leadership team has been reexamining our strategy, the roadmap and initiatives for achieving it, and the profitable growth we believe it can produce. Our strategy will continue to play to Illumina strength of building the genomics ecosystem and maintaining a tight customer focus in an increasingly competitive space. Central to this is our goal of making customers the heroes in their labs. In every customer meeting we are listening intently to understand what they need to unleash the full power of their Illumina instruments and making their priorities the core of our strategy. You will see us continue to develop more sample-to-answer solutions to enable the genomics and multiomics ecosystem."", ""We'll maintain our open platform approach and continue to drive the innovation that our customers need to succeed and for which Illumina is known. Illumina has long been the standard at NGS. Our strategic, hands-on support for customers globally, our deep experience and expertise across multiple research and clinical markets, and our decade-long technology roadmap position us well to continuing leading the industry and enabling our customers to improve human health. I am excited to announce that we will be sharing our comprehensive strategy work with you during a virtual event in the fall of this year. We will have more information in the coming month.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Scott Gammill, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer. Please go ahead, sir.', 'Scott Gammill: Thank you, Rob. Good afternoon, and welcome to Southern Company’s first quarter 2024 earnings call. Joining me today are Chris Womack, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern Company; and Dan Tucker, Chief Financial Officer. Let me remind you, we’ll be making forward-looking statements today in addition to providing historical information. Various important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, including those discussed in our Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and subsequent filings. In addition, we’ll present non-GAAP financial information on this call. Reconciliations to the applicable GAAP measure are included in the financial information we released this morning, as well as the slides for this conference call, which are both available on our Investor Relations website at investor.southerncompany.com. At this time, I’ll turn it over to Chris Womack.', ""Chris Womack: Thank you, Scott. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for what is such an exciting time for our company. Monday, we announced that plant Vogtle 4 successfully achieved commercial operation. Units 3 and 4 now deliver more than 2,200 megawatts of reliable 24/7 carbon-free energy and are designed to do so for decades to come. With all four units operational, the Vogtle site is now the largest generator of clean energy in the country. I cannot be prouder of our team's perseverance and commitment to getting Vogtle Units 3 and 4 completed with the standard of quality clearly demonstrated by Unit 3's performance since it reached in service last July. Along with our own team, success on this historic project required the hard work and dedication of tens of thousands of American craft workers and engineers, a committed group of co-owners and regulators who had the courage to support new nuclear when others did not."", ""While it was not our mission when we embarked on this project and while it was at times an arduous journey, we have proven that new nuclear is achievable in the United States. With ever-increasing demands for carbon-free energy and the burgeoning demand for reliable 24/7 energy to support our digital economy and society, we believe our country will need more nuclear energy. So the importance of this project for Georgia and our nation cannot be understated. This is what making history looks like. These are the first new nuclear units built from the ground up here in the United States in over 30 years. And we are proud to be the company that saw it through. Dan, I'll now turn the call over to you for a financial update."", 'Dan Tucker: Thanks, Chris, and good afternoon, everyone. For the first quarter of 2024, our adjusted EPS was $1.03 per share, $0.24 higher than the first quarter of 2023 and $0.13 above our estimate. The primary drivers of our performance for the quarter compared to last year were investments in our state-regulated utilities and weather that was less mild for our electric utilities than in the first quarter of 2023. This is somewhat offset by higher interest expense and depreciation. A complete reconciliation of our year-over-year earnings is included in the materials we released this morning. All our businesses experienced a strong start for 2024, driving our results meaningfully higher than our estimate of $0.90 per share.', 'While there were several factors for this performance versus our estimate, one worth highlighting is the higher than expected weather-adjusted electricity sales in our commercial customer class. This was driven by a combination of our strong local economies as well as increased usage by many of our existing data center customers. Sales to data centers were up over 12% for the quarter compared to last year. Overall, weather-normal retail electric sales to all classes were 1.7% higher than the first quarter of 2023. Industrial sales are beginning to show signs of recovery following a soft 2023, with year-to-date increases led by the lumber and paper industries. The Southeast regional labor supply remains above pre-pandemic levels. Employment growth is strong and unemployment is low, averaging approximately 3% across our regulated electric jurisdictions.', ""A favorable business climate and increased expansion of manufacturing is attracting new households to the Southeast, driving continued net in-migration and customer growth. Before turning the call back over to Chris, I'd like to highlight our most recent dividend increase. Last week, the Southern Company Board of Directors approved an $0.08 per share increase in our annual common dividend, raising the annualized rate to $2.88 per share. This action marks the 23rd consecutive increase, and this will now be 77 consecutive years dating all the way back to 1948, that Southern Company has paid a dividend that is equal to or greater than the previous year. This remarkable track record remains an important part of Southern Company's value proposition."", ""In one quick note, our adjusted EPS estimate for the second quarter is $0.90 per share. Chris, I'll turn the call back over to you."", ""Chris Womack: Thank you, Dan. Our system performed extremely well, and that's a testament to our team's collective commitment to serving customers reliably across our business, especially as we meet the demands of the extraordinary growth that we're seeing. Particularly within our Southeast footprint, we continue to see strong economic development activity with first quarter investment announcements, representing the second highest first quarter on record, as our teams continue to work closely with our states and local development authorities to attract new businesses. This growth continues to reflect a diverse mix of sectors with recent announcements, including automotive suppliers, flooring and glass manufacturers, data centers and mixed-use developments."", ""During our year-end earnings call in February, we updated our forecast to reflect projected retail electric sales growth that is accelerating to a projected growth rate of approximately 6% from 2025 to 2028. The underlying Georgia Power projected sales growth rate is approximately 9% over the same period. As we look ahead, we're encouraged to see the signs of incremental growth also materializing in Alabama and Mississippi. A little more than weeks ago, the Georgia Public Service Commission approved a stipulated agreement among Georgia Power the Public Service Commission staff and multiple interveners in the 2023 IRP update docket. This approval affirms the need to quickly procure and deploy several thousand megawatts of resources to serve customers for rapidly growing project electricity demands by the winter of 2026 and 2027."", ""Georgia Power was also authorized to build and own a balanced collection of resources, including new natural gas combustion turbines and battery energy storage systems, while also providing for an accelerated RFP process for incremental battery energy storage systems. The constructiveness and timeliness of decisions like this are a testament to the quality of our Southeastern states regulatory environment and our ability to meet the projected rapid demand growth garnering headlines across the country. Coinciding with Georgia Power's 2023, RFP update filing last fall, and the release of our sales forecast in February, external attention, including from the investment community has focused on several key questions. How do you know the load in your forecast is real?"", ""How do you know you're pricing this new load appropriately? And what protections are in place if the forecasted boat does not materialize? Those are all very important questions, and the answers are all fundamentals of how Southern Company has run our electric utilities for a very, very, very long time. We'll address each one of those questions in just a moment. First, I want to share with you what we believe are the four key characteristics required to successfully navigate this tremendous growth opportunity. We believe Southern Company is positioned as well or better than any utility company in the country on these four fronts. First, it requires supportive states and constructive regulation. Our states continue to be great economic development partners, and they have advanced economic policies that support healthy growth."", ""When it comes to utility regulation, our states are among the best in the country at balancing the needs of customers while helping ensure utilities provide real value to customers in the form of clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy. Second, it requires institutional wherewithal. We have vast expertise and experience deploying energy infrastructure. We've been investing billions to improve the resilience of our electric and gas transmission and distribution networks. In recent years across our subsidiaries and across the country, we've built thousands of megawatts of energy supply in the form of new solar, wind and battery facilities, advanced micro grids, a state-of-the-art combined cycle natural gas plant and the only new nuclear units built in this country and more than a generation."", ""These new assets along with the existing electric and gas infrastructure we operate have served customers with a superior measure of reliability and resilience. We have the people, we have the experience and we have the scale to be successful. The third requirement is a flexible pricing framework. Our electric utilities working with existing customers approved by their respective public service commissions have a history of being able to price new large load projects appropriately even in periods of high demand and challenging market conditions. These frameworks are designed to benefit all customers. For example, Georgia Power's real-time pricing rate, or RTP, which was pioneered decades ago allows for the flexibility to price individual customers based on their unique, low profile and risk characteristics."", ""And finally, success in this environment requires experience and discipline, experience understanding utility economics and the true marginal cost to serve new customers. Experience identifying and mitigating the risk inherent and new or expanding large load customers, and experience and competing for new load with an objective of capturing tangible economic benefit for customers and states. Our experience, combined with the robust models and tools we employ are partially a product of the competitive economic environment we've navigated in the Southeast for decades. For example, in Georgia, most new large load customers can choose their electricity supplier. Over the years, we've been the chosen provider more often than not, however, as to load we did not win or perhaps did not even choose to compete for that reflects our discipline and experience."", ""By offering prices designed to recover the marginal cost to serve new loads, we seek to protect all other customers and importantly maintain our credibility with our regulators and state policymakers. I'll now turn back to Dan to address those three key stakeholder questions pertaining to this extraordinary growth opportunity."", ""Dan Tucker: Thanks Chris. So how do we know the load in our forecast is real? The short answer is that we've already incorporated risk adjustments to the forecast. One could argue it's a conservative view. We would say our forecasts are informed by our experience and by our continuous engagement with prospective, new and existing customers. We've included a visual representation of our process in the slide deck. Typically, our forecast appropriately represents only a portion of the full potential load we might ultimately serve. If a customer has not formally communicated state specific project details with our company, they're not included in the forecast. If they have a choice of utility provider within the state that they have chosen, which is the case in each of our states, they are either not included or only included at a reduced probability weighted level."", ""Importantly, even once a customer has committed to one of our utilities, we further risk adjust the forecast based on the likelihood of delays on the customer side, whether those are construction delays or delays in ramping up production. And lastly, we further risk adjust the forecast based on the history of announced loads being higher than actual customer loads. Lower actual customer loads often result from technology improvements, economic conditions or other factors. All of that to say, we believe our forecast is the best representation of expected future demand. And with the potential for additional new customers to choose our states and utilities, there is potential for our forecast to be higher down the road. Next, I'll discuss pricing."", ""When it comes to knowing that we're pricing this load appropriately with a view towards protecting existing customers, several of the factors Chris mentioned a moment ago are key. We use our experience and robust tools to ascertain the expected marginal cost to serve each new customer and incorporate that into our flexible pricing mechanisms. We priced the load in a manner that helps ensure the marginal cost will be borne by the new customer. Sometimes, as is the case with Georgia Power's recent growth, we're able to provide new large load customers with competitive market pricing that also provides meaningful benefits back to existing customers. These benefits are not only driven by carefully constructed market pricing. They're also a function of a robust, long-term integrated resource planning process and Georgia Power's ability to use existing resources to serve a large portion of the new demand, while only needing to incrementally invest to meet higher peak demands."", ""The stipulation the Georgia PSC recently approved includes a commitment by Georgia Power for these customer benefits to be incorporated into the 2025 rate case. Our approach to pricing has never been more important given the current macroeconomic backdrop. Affordability is a key tenet of our customer-centric business model, and we work hard to ensure new customer demands don't place additional burdens on those less able to afford it. Lastly, the risk question, what protections are in place for our forecasted load does not materialize? I've already described how we've risk adjusted the forecast itself, the other major risk mitigations pertain to local infrastructure improvements and our portfolio of supply resources. These new large load customers often require significant local distribution system improvements, and these improvements often provide limited incremental benefit to other customers."", 'As a result, we require most new large load customers to pay for these improvements upfront, helping ensure other customers are protected. When it comes to supply resources, the risk mitigation comes in the form of the diversity of our resources. Purchased resources or PPAs, can expire without being renewed. Older owned resources which might require additional investments or higher maintenance O&M spend to remain available over the long term can be retired earlier. Decisions and risk strategies like these are a key aspect the multiyear integrated resource planning processes in each of our states. With robust long-term planning comes optionality in future decision-making. Said differently, planning for 20 years of resource needs every 3 years helps ensure that customers benefit from a flexible resource plan that is equally focused on reliability and affordability.', ""Chris, I'll turn the call back over to you to wrap up our prepared remarks."", ""Chris Womack: Thanks, Dan. Before taking your questions this afternoon, I'd like to first take a moment to reinforce that as we serve these growing energy needs, we also remain focused on achieving our long-term greenhouse gas reduction goals, including net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Working closely with each of our states, and with an unrelenting focus on safely and reliably serving our customers' needs, we continue to make responsible economic resource decisions over the long term. For example, over 80% of the resources additions plan across our system totaling nearly 10,000 megawatts from 2023 to 2030 are zero carbon emitting resources. We have accomplished some wonderful things in recent weeks, and we are even more excited about our future."", ""We have seven quality state-regulated utilities with long track records of outstanding operational and financial performance that deliver over 90% of our earnings, along with a few quality complementary businesses, we believe we have the ideal portfolio to support our long-term objectives. Southern Company's value proposition has never been more attractive. Our team has never been stronger, and we are positioned as well as we ever have been. As I said earlier, we have the people, the experience and the scale for sustained long-term success. Thank you, as always, for your interest in Southern Company. Robert, we're now ready to take questions."", 'See also', '25 Easy Pranks Guaranteed to Get Laughs and', '30 Most Dangerous Cities in the US.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

After some brief prepared comments, the management team will be available to answer questions. I will now turn the call over to Eric.', 'Eric Bolton: Thanks, Andrew, and performance trends in the first quarter were in line with our expectations, and we enter the summer leasing season well-positioned. Pricing trends for new resident move-ins continue to reflect the impact from new supply delivering in several of our markets. Our renewal pricing remained strong. Encouragingly, blended lease-over-lease pricing in the first quarter captured 100 basis points improvement as compared to the prior quarter, followed by April pricing that was ahead of the first quarter performance. While the bulk of the leasing year is still in front of us, we do like our early positioning as we head into the summer leasing season. We continue to believe that our high-growth markets are producing solid demand sufficient to absorb the new supply in a steady manner that will enable continued stable occupancy, strong renewal pricing, strong collections and overall revenue results that are aligned with the outlook that we provided in our prior guidance.', 'Our leasing traffic remains strong and record low resident turnover, favorable net migration trends and stable employment conditions across our diversified portfolio and markets continue to drive solid demand. While we expect leasing conditions will remain pressured by new supply deliveries through the year, our on-site teams actively supported by our asset management group are doing a terrific job. Superior Resident Services as reflected by our sector-leading Google ratings and record-high resident retention rates, along with several new technology capabilities introduced over the past couple of years are making a meaningful difference in this competitive environment. With new supply deliveries poised to begin tapering later this year, demand trends remaining stable and occupancy remaining strong, we remain optimistic that leasing conditions should recover quickly and begin improving in early 2025.', ""While the transaction market remains slow, we are seeing more acquisition opportunities for new lease-up projects, which Brad will touch on in his comments, and we remain comfortable with our transaction expectation for the year. I continue to be optimistic about our ability to work through the current supply cycle with in our high-growth markets ability to absorb new supply. With a 30-year performance record focused on these high-growth markets, we've operated through prior supply cycles. Today, we believe our diversified and higher-quality portfolio, our stronger operating platform our stronger balance sheet have us positioned to compete at an even higher level. We're excited about the outlook over the next few years. Our high-growth markets continue to offer attractive long-term appeal for employers, households and real estate investors."", ""We have a meaningful future growth on the horizon as new supply deliveries decline and leasing conditions strengthen. Several new technology initiatives will drive further efficiencies and higher operating margins from our existing portfolio and a pipeline of redevelopment opportunities will also drive higher rent growth from our existing properties. And finally, our external growth pipeline continues to expand, setting the stage for a meaningful additional NOI growth. I'd like to send my appreciation to our MAA team for a solid start to 2024. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Brad."", 'Brad Hill : Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. In preparation for what we believe will be a stronger leasing environment in 2025 through at least 2028, we continue to make progress in putting our balance sheet capacity to work to deliver future earnings growth. Subsequent to quarter end, we started construction on a 302-unit prepurchase development in Charlotte, North Carolina, and we expect to start construction this quarter on a 345-unit project under our prepurchase development platform in the Phoenix, Arizona MSA. Both projects are expected to deliver first units by mid-2026, and deliver stabilized NOI yields in the mid-6% range. consistent with what we are achieving on our current developments that are leasing.', 'With the addition of these two projects, our active development pipeline represents 2,617 units at a total cost of approximately $866 million. With continued interest rate volatility and tight credit conditions, transaction volume remains low. But we have seen cap rates firm up a bit from fourth quarter with market cap rates on deals we track that closed in the first quarter, averaging approximately 5.1%, 30 basis points lower than the previous quarter. Despite the low transaction volume, our team continues to find compelling select acquisition opportunities. We currently have an off-market 306-unit suburban property in Raleigh [ph] under contract to acquire for approximately $81 million that we expect to close this month. This newly constructed property is currently in its initial lease-up at 49% occupancy and is expected to stabilize in mid- to late 2025.', 'At this point, we believe our forecasted acquisition volume of $400 million is achievable. Despite the increased pressure from new supply, our four developments that are actively leasing three of which are under construction and one that has completed and is in lease-up continue to deliver good performance. While new lease rates are facing slightly more pressure at the moment with concessions on select units, up from four weeks to six weeks, we continue to achieve rents on average approximately 18% above our original expectations, driving higher than originally projected NOI and earnings and creating additional long-term shareholder value. For these four projects, we expect to achieve an average stabilized NOI yield of 6.5%, exceeding our original expectations by 70 basis points.', ""We continue to make progress on the predevelopment work for a number of projects. In addition to the two 2nd quarter development starts I mentioned a moment ago, we expect to start construction on one to two more projects later this year. While we have not seen a broad reduction in construction costs, encouragingly, we have achieved some level of reduction on our recent pricing supporting our ability to start construction on these projects. We have seen better subcontractor bid participation, which we expect to lead to better execution with stronger subs throughout the construction process for our new starts. We are hopeful that the significant drop in construction starts that we've seen in our region will lead to more substantial construction cost declines."", ""As we progress through the year, allowing us to start construction on additional opportunities in our development pipeline, which today consists of 10 well-located sites that we either own or control, representing additional growth of nearly 2,800 units. We maintain optionality on when we start these projects, allowing us to remain patient and disciplined in our execution timing. Any project we start this year will deliver first units in 2026 and 2027 and aligning with what is likely to be a strong leasing environment, supported by significantly lower supply. Our development team continues to evaluate land sites as well as additional prepurchase development opportunities. In this liquidity-constrained environment, it's possible we could add additional in-house and prepurchase development opportunities to our current and future pipeline."", 'While we continue to pursue numerous external growth opportunities, our existing portfolio remains in a good position heading into the busier leasing season. Our broad diversification provides support during times of higher supply with a number of our mid-tier markets currently outperforming. As Tim will outline further, despite the high level of new supply, we continue to see solid demand and absorption, leading to improved current occupancy with future exposure better than this time last year. Our collections are strong and near pre-covid levels at 99.6% of billed rents. Our resident base is stable with more residents choosing to live with us longer, supported by our focus on customer service, coupled with high single-family housing costs.', ""Before I turn the call over to Tim to all of our associates at the properties in our corporate and regional offices. I want to say thank you for all you do to improve our business and serve our residents and those around you while exceeding expectations of those that depend on us. With that, I'll turn the call over to Tim."", 'Tim Argo : Thanks, Brad, and good morning, everyone. As Eric mentioned, new lease pricing in the first quarter continued to be impacted by elevated new supply deliveries in several of our markets. This, combined with typically slower traffic patterns that are evident this time of the year attributed to new lease pricing on a lease-over-lease basis of negative 6.2%. Renewal rates for the quarter stayed strong, growing 5%. Because traffic tends to be relatively low as compared to the second and third quarters, we intentionally repriced less than 20% of our leases in the first quarter. The new lease-to-renewal pricing resulted in blended lease-over-lease pricing of negative 0.6% for the quarter, an improvement of 100 basis points from the fourth quarter.', 'Average physical occupancy was 95.3%, and collections outperformed expectations with net delinquency representing less than 0.4% of build rents. All these factors drove the resulting revenue growth of 1.4%. From a market perspective, in the first quarter, larger markets such as the Washington, D.C. metro area and Houston continue to hold up well and Nashville showed improvement. Many of our mid-tier metros also continue to be steady with Savannah, Richmond, Charleston and Greenville, all outperforming the broader portfolio from a blended lease-over-lease pricing standpoint. Our diversification between larger and mid-tier markets helps balance performance through the cycle. The improving performance of a market like Nashville, which is getting a lot of new supply, demonstrates the benefit of submarket diversification along with the market diversification.', 'Austin and Jacksonville are two markets that continue to be more negatively impacted by the absolute level of supply being delivered into those markets. Touching on some other highlights during the quarter. We continued our various product upgrade and redevelopment initiatives. For the first quarter of 2024, we completed nearly 1,100 interior unit upgrades. Given the number of units and lease-up across our portfolio currently, we expect to renovate fewer units in 2024 than we would in a typical year, but would expect to reaccelerate the program in 2025. We have now completed over 94,000 smart home upgrades since the inception of the program, and we expect to complete the remaining few properties this year. For our repositioning program, we have four active projects that are in the repricing phase, and we have targeted an additional six projects to begin later in 2024 with a plan to complete construction and begin repricing in 2025.', 'Regarding April metrics, we are encouraged by the accelerating trends from both the first quarter and March in both pricing and occupancy. April blended pricing is negative 0.4%, a 20-basis point improvement from the first quarter and a 70-basis point improvement from March. This is comprised of new lease pricing of negative 6.1%, a 10-basis point improvement from the first quarter and notably a 70-basis point improvement from March. And renewal pricing of 5.1%, slightly ahead of the first quarter and an improvement of 50 basis points from March. Average physical occupancy for April was 95.5%, also up from both the first quarter and March. And as Brad noted, 60-day exposure also remained lower than this time last year at 8.5% versus the prior year of 8.8%.', ""As we've discussed, new supply being delivered continues to be a headwind in many of our markets, but we still believe the outlook is similar to what we discussed last quarter. While we do expect this new supply will continue to pressure pricing for much of 2024, with demand and leasing traffic expected to increase in the spring and summer, we believe we have likely already seen the maximum impact to new lease pricing and that the outlook is better for late 2024 and into 2025. It varies by market, but on average, new construction starts in our portfolio footprint peaked in early to mid-2022. And we've seen historically that the maximum pressure on leasing is typically about two years after construction store. While supply remains elevated, the strength of demand is evident as well."", 'Absorption in the first quarter in our markets was the highest for any first quarter in the last 2 decades and the highest of any quarter since the third quarter of 2021. Job growth is still expected to moderate some in 2024 as compared to 2023, but has recently been revised upwards and growth still expected to be strongest in the Sunbelt region in the country. Job growth combined with continued in-migration accelerate the key demand factor of household formation. Additionally, we saw a resident turnover continued to decline in the first quarter, and we expect it to remain low with fewer residents moving out to buy a home. In fact, the 12.9% of move-outs in the first quarter that were due to a resident buying a home with the lowest ever for MAA.', ""That's all I have in the way of prepared comments. I'll turn the call over to Clay."", 'Clay Holder: Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. We reported core FFO for the quarter of $2.22 per share, which was $0.02 per share above the midpoint of our first quarter guidance. About half of the favorability was related to the timing of real estate taxes, while the remaining outperformance is related to the collective timing of overhead cost, interest expense and nonoperating income. Our same-store operating performance for the quarter was essentially in line with expectations. Same-store revenues were slightly ahead of our expectations for the quarter, driven by strong rent collections. Excluding the favorable timing of real estate tax expenses, Same-store operating expenses were slightly higher than our first quarter guidance, primarily due to onetime property costs.', 'During the quarter, we funded approximately $44 million of development cost of the current expected $647 million pipeline, leaving nearly $202 million to be funded on this pipeline over the next two years. Although we expect to complete three projects in the second half of 2024 with the additional starts that Brad mentioned earlier, we expect to continue to grow our development pipeline over the remainder of the year, which our balance sheet is well positioned to support. During the quarter, we invested a total of $9.4 million of capital through our redevelopment, repositioning and smart rent installation programs, which we expect to produce solid returns and continue to enhance the quality of our portfolio. Our balance sheet remains in great shape.', 'We ended the quarter with nearly $1.1 billion in combined cash and borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility, providing significant opportunity to fund future investments. Our leverage remains low with net debt-to-EBITDA at 3.6 times. And at quarter end, our outstanding debt was approximately 95% fixed with an average maturity of 7.2 years at an effective rate of 3.6%. During January, we issued $350 million of 10-year public bonds at an effective rate of 5.1%, using the proceeds to pay down our outstanding commercial paper. We have an upcoming $400 million maturity in June that has an effective rate of 4%. Following this maturity, the next scheduled bond maturity is in the fourth quarter of 2025. Finally, with the bulk of leasing season ahead of us, we are reaffirming the midpoint of our core FFO guidance for the year while slightly tightening the full-year range to $8.70 to $9.06 per share.', 'We are also maintaining our same store as well as other key guidance ranges for the year. That is all that we have in the way of prepared comments. So, Regina, we will now turn the call back to you for questions.', 'See also', 'American Politicians are Buying These 10 AI Stocks and', '30 Cities with the Highest Number of Veterans in the US.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

At this time, all callers are in a listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session later during the conference and we will review procedures on how to enter queue to ask questions at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference, including the Q&A session, is being recorded. We'll begin by turning the conference over to Ralph Giacobbe. Please go ahead."", ""Ralph Giacobbe: Good morning. Thank you for joining today's call. I'm Ralph Giacobbe, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. With me on the line this morning are David Cordani, The Cigna Group's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Brian Evanko, Chief Financial Officer of The Cigna Group and President and Chief Executive Officer of Cigna Healthcare; and Eric Palmer, President and Chief Executive Officer of Evernorth Health Services. In our remarks today, David and Brian will cover a number of topics, including our first-quarter financial results and our updated financial outlook for 2024. Following their prepared remarks, David, Brian, and Eric will be available for Q&A. As noted in our earnings release, when describing our financial results, we use certain financial measures, including adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues, which are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, otherwise known as GAAP."", ""A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, shareholders' net income or loss, and total revenues respectively is contained in today's earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of thecignagroup.com. We use the terms labeled adjusted income from operations and adjusted earnings per share on the same basis as our principal measures of financial performance. In our remarks today, we will be making some forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2024 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note to today's earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC."", ""Before turning the call over, I will cover a few items pertaining to our GAAP financial results. In the first quarter, we recorded shareholders' net loss of $277 million or $0.97 per share. This is driven by non-cash after-tax net realized investment loss of $1.8 billion or $6.31 per share, primarily related to a VillageMD impairment charge. This is excluded from adjusted income from operations and adjusted earnings per share in our discussion of financial results. We also recorded an after-tax net special item charge of $3 million or $0.01 per share. Details of the special items are included in our quarterly financial supplement. As described in today's release, special items are excluded from adjusted income from operations, adjusted earnings per share, and adjusted revenues in our discussion of financial results."", ""Additionally, please note that when we make prospective comments regarding financial performance, including our full year 2024 outlook, we will do so on a basis that includes the potential impact of future share repurchases and anticipated 2024 dividends. With that, I'll turn the call over to David."", ""David Cordani: Thanks, Ralph. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call. In the first quarter, our company continued delivering differentiated value for our clients, customers, patients, and partners. And we posted strong results for the quarter as we continue to build on our momentum coming into 2024. Today, I'll discuss our quarterly performance and key strategic drivers of our growth. Specifically, I'll spend a few minutes talking about our Specialty business and our focus on biosimilars to drive greater affordability in the market for the benefit of those we serve. Then, Brian will review additional details about our financial results during the quarter, our increased outlook for full-year 2024, and our strong capital position, and then we'll take your questions."", ""So let's get started. In the quarter, I'm pleased to report that the Cigna Group delivered total revenue of $57.3 billion, adjusted earnings per share of $6.47. And given our momentum and strong start to the year, we've increased our guidance for full-year adjusted earnings per share to at least $28.40. These positive results demonstrate our differentiated capabilities, innovative approaches, and disciplined execution during a dynamic and disruptive time for our industry. Our results also speak to our diverse and well-balanced portfolio as we invest in our high-growth businesses, which continue to benefit from secular tailwinds and ensure our foundational businesses are positioned for continued success. In Evernorth Health Services, we're pleased with our results that are in line with our expectations."", ""Starting with our Pharmacy Benefit Services, our foundational businesses, our innovative solutions continue to gain traction with health plans, large commercial employers, and governmental organizations. A recent example of how we continue to drive greater access and affordability in a rapidly evolving pharmaceutical landscape is EncircleRx. This solution focuses on cardiodiabesity, adds value for our clients and patients by providing predictability, reducing cost and enhancing outcomes related to GLP-1 drug coverage. We're pleased with the strong interest in EncircleRx from our clients with more than 1 million lives already enrolled. EncircleRx is made possible given our decade-plus track record of offering new solutions built on data driven insights and our deep supply-chain expertise."", ""Said otherwise, we have a proven innovation platform. In our accelerated growth Specialty Care and Services businesses, our results were in line with our expectations, reflecting strong double-digit adjusted revenue growth. As a reminder, this set of businesses is diverse and includes Accredo, CuraScript Specialty Distribution, and our emerging Care Service businesses. I'll talk more about Specialty in a few moments. In Care Services, we are investing in a number of areas, including accountable care, virtual, home-based, and behavioral care. We're pleased with the progress our Evernorth Behavioral Care Group is making since its launch in six states plus the District of Columbia, and we have already expanded access and convenience for patients with our program."", ""In Cigna Healthcare, our health benefits platform, we achieved another quarter of strong performance. With our focus on affordability and disciplined pricing, we're pleased with our strong medical cost performance and medical care ratio, which was 79.9%. Our US employer business is on pace for another good year as we continue to leverage our high-performing networks and digitally-enabled services to expand access and overall value. At our Investor Day, we discussed the strong results we've seen with our Pathwell suite of solutions, including Pathwell Specialty, which drives value by reducing costs associated with specialty drugs and therapies, and improving care experiences and outcomes for patients. Also within the Pathwell suite is our Pathwell Bone & Joint solution, which we piloted in 2023 and is now being rolled out for broader client adoption."", ""For context, one in two adults suffer from a musculoskeletal condition, which results in more than $500 billion of annual spend. Our solution uses a curated natural network combined with clinical and digital services to guide patients with spine, knee, hip, and shoulder conditions to the right path -- pathway of care at the right time. We're already seeing strong results and our personalized concierge experience has resulted in 96% patient satisfaction, while also delivering meaningful savings for our clients from this innovative program. Turning to International Health. Our results continue to be strong given our focus on localized health solutions and high-quality services for the globally mobile population. In our individual exchange business, we continue to sharpen our focus by repositioning our book through targeted actions in certain geographies."", ""It's also important to note we are making good progress toward our sale of our Medicare businesses to HCSC. The sale of these businesses to HCSC remains on track with the expiration of the waiting period under Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, which occurred on April 17. As such, the regulatory review of this transaction by the DOJ is complete. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2025 as planned. After closing, we will continue to serve Medicare Advantage customers through our Evernorth broad suite of high-performing services. And under our agreement with HCSC, these include services for the seniors who will transition with the divested businesses. Taken together, we're pleased with our results for the first quarter. They reflect the quality and strength of our businesses and position us well for another year of sustained growth and attractive value creation."", 'Now, I want to spend a few minutes on our Specialty businesses within Evernorth, which is already a large and well-established portfolio of services, yet represents accelerated growth opportunity as we look forward. Overall, the Specialty market is large at about $400 billion today and is fast growing and Evernorth is the industry leader. Our performance continues to be strong with double-digit revenue growth in the first quarter. Our combination of Accredo, CuraScript Specialty Distribution, and CarePath offers something truly unique in the market, built over decades with assets and capabilities that are highly differentiated. And while we are the leader in the industry, we continue to innovate our capabilities and offerings, and expand our reach and impact.', ""For example, just last week, Evernorth announced that we will have an interchangeable Humira biosimilar available for $0 out-of-pocket cost for eligible Accredo patients. Currently, more than 100,000 Accredo patients use either Humira or one of the biosimilars. They are supported by Specially trained pharmacists and nurses in Accredo’s therapeutic resource center for inflammatory conditions. We're available to serve and support these patients around the clock. To meet the individual needs of our patients while driving significant savings for them and their health plans, we will be able to provide both high and low-concentration interchangeable biosimilars. Or put another way, varying dosage levels based on patient needs. To accomplish this, we have agreements in place with multiple manufacturers who will produce biosimilars for Evernorth's private label pharmaceutical distributor, Quallent Pharmaceuticals, which we launched back in 2021."", ""The biosimilars will be priced at about 85% lower than Humira and we estimate that individual patients will save on average of $3,500 per year. And in addition to Accredo patients, all of our pharmacy benefit service clients and patients will have access to these biosimilars. Importantly, the biosimilar opportunity goes well beyond Humira. By 2030, we expect to see biosimilars or generics introduced for nearly half of the top 25 specialty drugs in the United States. This translates to over $100 billion in annual spend, subject to additional choice and competition. The introduction of biosimilars creates a multiyear tailwind that enables us to continue to drive growth and value-creation for the benefit of those we serve. Clearly, we're very excited about the growth opportunities we see ahead in Specialty."", ""Our Specialty businesses are a cornerstone of the accelerated growth within Evernorth and our confidence in our leading position and capabilities will continue to fuel innovation such as the biosimilar launch I just discussed. Now to wrap up, let me recap our performance for the quarter. In the quarter, we continued to execute well and perform well. We met the evolving needs of our clients, customers, patients, and partners in the midst of a dynamic marketplace. We delivered on our financial commitments, including adjusted EPS of $6.47, and we -- and we've increased our guidance for full-year adjusted earnings per share to at least $28.40. This performance puts us towards the higher end of our 10% to 14% long-term average annual EPS growth commitment."", ""Looking ahead, we remain focused on meeting our commitments as we execute our strategy by creating value for the benefit of those we serve by driving greater affordability and access expansion, and delivering innovations that continue to grow market share over time in Evernorth and in Cigna Healthcare. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian."", ""Brian Evanko: Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. We're pleased to report a strong start to the year with first-quarter pre-tax adjusted earnings above expectations, reflecting contributions across our two growth platforms, Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare. Key consolidated financial highlights for the first quarter include revenue of $57.3 billion, which represents 23% year-over-year growth. Adjusted earnings per share of $6.47 or 20% year-over-year growth and cash flow from operations of $4.8 billion. The continued momentum in strong fundamentals of our businesses give us the confidence to increase our full-year 2024 adjusted earnings per share outlook to at least $28.40. Before I turn to our segment results, I'd like to briefly discuss the impact of the Change Healthcare disruption in the first quarter."", ""We experienced incremental operating expenses that are reflected in our first-quarter results. And within Cigna Healthcare, we had some disruption to claims submissions and payments that I'll discuss further in a few moments. Despite these unexpected events, we delivered a very strong start to the year and are proud of our teams managing through a dynamic operating environment. Now turning to our segment results. First, I'll comment on Evernorth. First quarter 2024 Evernorth revenues were $46.2 billion and pre-tax adjusted earnings were $1.4 billion, in line with expectations. As discussed at our Investor Day in March, starting this quarter, we're providing revenue and pre-tax adjusted earnings for our two operating segments within Evernorth, namely Pharmacy Benefit Services and Specialty & Care Services."", ""For the quarter, Pharmacy Benefit Services revenue increased 43%, driven by new business wins, including Centene starting on January 1. Pre-tax adjusted earnings were $513 million, reflecting growth offset by the net impact of client onboarding and implementation costs. Specialty & Care Services revenue increased 12% and pre-tax adjusted earnings grew to $788 million, in line with expectations. Overall, Evernorth continues to perform well and we're pleased with the results to start the year. Turning to Cigna Healthcare. First quarter 2024 adjusted revenues were $13.3 billion and pre-tax adjusted earnings were $1.3 billion. Cigna Healthcare's first-quarter results were better than expectations, driven by a favorable medical care ratio, partially offset by higher SG&A expenses and lower net investment income."", 'The first-quarter medical care ratio of 79.9% benefited from our focus on affordability initiatives and effective pricing execution as we planned and priced for the continuation of elevated cost trend levels the industry experienced in 2023. As noted earlier, the Change Healthcare incident caused some disruption to first-quarter operations, including claims processing and submissions. Within the quarter, we booked approximately $650 million in incremental reserves in Cigna Healthcare relating to this disruption. Approximately two-thirds of the incremental reserve pertains to claims that we received but were not paid out as of March 31st. These claims have since been paid out to providers. The balance of the incremental reserve represents an estimate of first-quarter claims incurred, but not yet reported, specifically pertaining to the Change Healthcare disruption.', 'We remain confident in our reserve posture and cost trend projections over the balance of the year. Moving to Cigna Healthcare Medical Customers, we ended the quarter with 19.2 million total medical customers. This is in line with our expectations and includes a reduction to our individual exchange enrollment following the repositioning of our book in certain geographies to improve overall profitability. Overall, Cigna Healthcare delivered strong results in the quarter. Our Cigna Healthcare results continue to benefit from our decade-plus track record of value-based care. We have continued to further evolve this strategy with Evernorth Accountable Care and remain committed to driving affordability and quality outcomes for our clients and patients through our partnership-oriented value-based care framework.', 'As Ralph mentioned in his opening comments, during the quarter, we recognized a non-cash impairment charge related to VillageMD, which is excluded from our adjusted earnings. This accounting item does not alter our forward-looking value-based care strategy, where we continue to make progress in aligning incentives with providers, including with VillageMD. Our partnership has already launched in targeted geographic markets and we will seek to build upon that early progress. Now turning to our outlook for full year 2024. We continue to expect strong underlying growth in Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare. We now expect full-year 2024 consolidated adjusted income from operations to be at least $8.065 billion or at least $28.40 per share, an increase from our prior outlook.', ""We expect the 2024 adjusted earnings per share cadence to be approximately 45% in the first half and the remaining 55% in the second half. Now turning to our 2024 outlook for each of our growth platforms. In Evernorth, we continue to expect full-year 2024 adjusted earnings of at least $7 billion. We expect Evernorth's second quarter pre-tax adjusted earnings to grow mid-single-digits year-over-year. For Cigna Healthcare, we now expect full-year 2024 adjusted earnings of at least $4.775 billion, an increase from our prior guidance to reflect the strength of our first-quarter results and continued confidence for the rest of the year. We expect Cigna Healthcare's pre-tax adjusted earnings in the second quarter to be approximately 25% of full-year pre-tax adjusted earnings."", 'We also now expect our full-year 2024 Medical Care ratio to be in the range of 81.7% to 82.5%, an improvement of 20 basis points from the high end of the prior range. Additionally, we expect our second-quarter Medical Care ratio to be within our full-year guidance range. Turning to our 2024 capital management position. Our debt-to-capitalization ratio was 44.3% as of March 31st compared to 40.1% as of December 31st, 2023. The increase primarily reflects the timing of debt issuance, in part due to the accelerated share repurchase agreements we entered in February. We continue to target a long-term debt-to-capitalization ratio of approximately 40%. We continue to expect at least $11 billion of cash flow from operations, and we continue to expect to use the majority of our discretionary cash flow for share repurchase this year.', ""Additionally, our guidance continues to assume full-year weighted average shares outstanding to be in the range of 282 million to 286 million shares. Our balance sheet and cash-flow outlook remains strong, driven by the strength of our highly efficient service-based model. Now to recap, our first-quarter consolidated results were ahead of expectations, driven by the strength of our medical care ratio within Cigna Healthcare, and our 2024 outlook reflects the sustained momentum and strong fundamentals of our two growth platforms, Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare, while continuing to maintain a prudent posture in this dynamic environment. We're confident in our ability to deliver on our updated full-year 2024 adjusted earnings of at least $28.40 per share."", ""And with that, we'll turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call."", 'See also', '15 Biggest Aircraft Carriers in the World and', '15 Best Places to Retire in Montana.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

Possible interest rate cuts in 2024 are expected to make way for rebounding merger and acquisition (M&A) deals. Though technology investments are made to boost operational efficiencies, they often escalate costs and erode margins for these players. A shortage in the availability of medical personnel across the United States continues to be a concern. Despite the challenges, companies like UnitedHealth Group Incorporated UNH, The Cigna Group CI, Centene Corporation CNC and Humana Inc. HUM\xa0appear well-placed to counter industry headwinds.', 'About the Industry ', 'The Zacks HMO industry consists of entities (either private or public) that take care of subscribers’ basic and supplemental health services. Companies in this space primarily assume risks and assign premiums to health and medical insurance policies. Industry participants also provide administrative and managed-care services for self-funded insurance. Services are generally offered by a network of approved care providers (called in-network), which include primary care physicians, clinical facilities, hospitals and specialists. However, out-of-network exceptions are made during emergencies or when it is necessary. Health insurance plans can be availed through private purchases, social insurance or social welfare programs.', '4 Trends Shaping the Fate of the HMO Industry ', 'Elevated Technology Expenses: Telehealth services were prevalent in the United States prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, but their usage was not as widespread as it has been since the onset of the pandemic. The convenience and affordability of these services send a clear indication of the same continuing to stay in high demand in the days ahead. To stay up-to-date with the ongoing digital trend, the HMO players are compelled to undertake technology investments to build telehealth platforms. The platforms undoubtedly attract more customers and fetch a steady revenue stream for industry players. However, the technology advancements undertaken in relation to such platforms require significant expenses. This may erode the margins of health insurers.', 'A Scarcity of Medical Staff: A shortage of nurses and other medical personnel continues to be a nationwide concern, which is taking a toll on the efficient functioning of hospitals as they have to treat a growing number of patient volumes. An increase in the number of nurses reaching retirement age, a higher burnout level and inequitable workforce distribution are some of the factors triggering a scarcity in the nursing workforce. Health insurers collaborate with hospitals, physicians and other facilities to offer discounted care access to plan members. The effectiveness of services remains a crucial factor behind the renewal of a health insurer’s health plan. A shortage in the nursing workforce can reduce a hospital’s ability to deliver quality care services and indirectly affect the customer base of HMO companies.', 'Rising Membership: Most of the participants in the HMO space distribute cost-effective health plans and upgrade them with some eye-catching features from time to time. The strength of such plans continues to fetch federal or state contract wins for HMO players, which serves as a means to boost membership growth. A steady membership growth brings continual improvement of premiums, the most significant top-line contributor of a health insurer.

Our view on the cycle risk was simple – the long-term growth outlook was tremendous given the proliferation of electronics and software in everyday objects, and the downturn had already begun, and a healthy amount of it was known. We ignored the near-term outlook for profits, assuming they would be down substantially. It turned out that the downturn was more severe than most other investors or industry observers had forecasted.

Solid economic growth and modest loan demand will also support banks’ financials in the near term.Business restructuring/expansion initiatives and digitization will offer support. Though weakening asset quality is likely to exert pressure on the financials to some extent, major banks like Wells Fargo & Company WFC and Northern Trust Corporation NTRS are worth investing in.', 'About the Industry', 'The Zacks Major Regional Banks industry includes the nation’s largest banks in terms of assets, with most operating globally. The financial performance of these banks largely depends on the nation’s economic health. As the banks are involved in several complex financial activities, they are required to meet the stringent regulations set by the Federal Reserve and other agencies. Apart from traditional banking services, which are the source of the net interest income (NII), major regional banks provide a wide array of other financial services and products to retail, corporate and institutional clients, both domestic and global. These include credit and debit cards, mortgage banking, wealth management and investment banking, among others. Therefore, a large revenue source for these banks is fees and commissions earned from these services.', '4 Themes Influencing the Major Regional Banks Industry', 'High-Interest Rates: The Fed’s aggressive monetary policy since March 2022 has led the interest rates to touch a 23-year high of 5.25-5.5% as it continues to fight ‘sticky’ inflation. While the inflation numbers are cooling down, the path for it to reach the central bank’s target of 2% is going to be bumpy. Hence, the market participants seem to have watered down the chances of a 75-basis point cut in interest rates this year. The tighter job market is also not helping the case.While the faster pace of rate hikes puts pressure on major banks’ net interest margin (NIM) because of an increase in funding costs, high rates for a longer period will be a boon for the industry players on the back of decent economic growth, resilient consumers and modest deposit inflows. This will support banks’ NII growth, though at a slower pace than in 2023.Business Restructuring Initiatives: Major regional banks are taking strategic actions to expand into new avenues and lower their dependence on spread income. The business restructuring is essential for technological advancement and further domestic/global expansion to continue improving profitability. The industry players are constantly investing in artificial intelligence and other digital platforms and even partnering/acquiring providers of such services. Major regional banks are also aggressively expanding their footprint outside the United States and into Europe and Asia. Several industry players are re-evaluating their business structure to simplify operations and do away with unprofitable ones.Modest Loan Demand: The central bank’s aggressive monetary policy lowered the demand for loans due to fears of a severe economic downturn/recession. Nonetheless, the Fed’s Summary of Economic Projections released in March indicates that the U.S. economy will slow down slightly this year and grow at a rate of 2.1%. In 2023, the U.S. economy grew at a rate of 2.5%, per the data released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis.While the high rates kept the borrowers on the sidelines for the major part of last year, the Fed’s higher-for-longer stance is likely to reverse the trend to some extent in 2024. The demand for loans is likely to tick up marginally as borrowers get used to the high interest rate environment.Weakening Asset Quality: For most of 2020, major regional banks built extra provisions to tide over unexpected defaults and payment delays due to the economic downturn resulting from the COVID-19 mayhem. This considerably hurt their financials. But with solid economic growth and support from government stimulus packages, banks began to release these reserves back into the income statement.Now, given the current macroeconomic headwinds, industry players are building provisions to counter any adverse fallout. While conservative lending policy and the resilience of borrowers helped banks to keep their asset quality manageable, several metrics have started rising. This, thus, signals the gradual deterioration of the industry players’ asset quality.', 'Zacks Industry Rank Suggests Bright Prospects', 'The Zacks Major Regional Banks industry is a 15-stock group within the broader Zacks Finance sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #41, which places it in the top 16% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates outperformance in the near term. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of an encouraging earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gaining confidence in this group’s earnings growth potential. Since the end of October 2023, the industry’s earnings estimates for the current year have been revised 1.5% upward.Before we present a couple of major bank stocks that are worth buying, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock market performance and valuation picture.', 'Industry Outperforms the Sector and the S&P 500', 'The Zacks Major Regional Banks industry has widely outperformed both the S&P 500 composite and its sector over the past year. While stocks in this industry have collectively surged 42.2% over the period, the Zacks S&P 500 composite has jumped 24.5%, and the Zacks Finance sector has rallied 23.1%.', 'One-Year Price Performance', '', ""Industry's Valuation"", 'One might get a good sense of the industry’s relative valuation by looking at its price-to-tangible book ratio (P/TBV), which is commonly used for valuing banks because of large variations in their earnings results from one quarter to the next.The industry currently has a trailing 12-month P/TBV of 1.98X. This compares with the highest level of 2.48X, the lowest of 1.21X and the median of 1.93X over the past five years. The industry is trading at a huge discount compared with the market at large, as the trailing 12-month P/TBV for the S&P 500 composite is 10.89X, as the chart below shows.', 'Price-to-Tangible Book Ratio (TTM)', '\xa0', 'As finance stocks typically have a lower P/TBV ratio, comparing major regional banks with the S&P 500 may not make sense to many investors. However, a comparison of the group’s P/TBV ratio with that of the broader sector ensures that the group is trading at a solid discount. The Zacks Finance sector’s trailing 12-month P/TBV came in at 4.09X. This is way above the Zacks Major Regional Banks industry’s ratio, as the chart below shows.', 'Price-to-Tangible Book Ratio (TTM)', '2 Major Regional Banks to Bet on Right Away', 'Wells Fargo: With total assets worth $1.96 trillion as of Mar 31, 2024, Wells Fargo is one of the largest financial holding companies in the United States. The company provides a diverse range of banking and non-banking financial services and products through more than 5,000 branches, a broad ATM network, the Internet and other distribution channels across North America and globally.Though WFC has been facing problems related to its 2016 sales scandal, management has been striving hard to overcome this matter and lift the asset cap imposed on it by the Fed.Wells Fargo is focused on reducing its expense base. Expense reduction efforts, such as streamlining organizational structure, closing branches and reducing headcount, undertaken since third-quarter 2020 have been aiding expense management. The company delivered gross expense savings aggregating $10 billion in 2021-2023. The company expects to take on these efficiency initiatives this year too.Further, this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company continues to build on its deposit base, which witnessed a three-year (ended 2023) CAGR of 1.1%.

Its revenues witnessed a CAGR of 3.5% over the last three years (2020-2023), driven by rising non-interest income and NII. The growth of NII was aided by an improvement in loan balances and higher rates. Also, robust pipelines in the Asset Servicing and Wealth Management segments will likely drive organic growth in the upcoming period.NTRS is undertaking expense management efforts to tackle expense growth and reinstate its operating leverage. It focused on disciplined headcount management, vendor consolidation, rationalization of its real estate footprint and process automation. Through such efforts, it will likely improve productivity and meet the financial targets.This Zacks Rank #1 company’s capital distributions seem impressive. In 2022, the company hiked its quarterly dividend by 7% to 75 cents per share. In 2021, the company announced a 25-million share repurchase program with no expiration date. Its debt/equity ratio, comparing favorably with the broader industry, and decent liquidity highlight the fact that such capital-distribution activities are sustainable in the future.NTRS has a market cap of $17.1 billion.

The side effects were so bad that Pfizer opted not to advance the twice-daily danuglipron into late-stage testing."", 'But Pfizer didn\'t throw in the towel on the program. The drugmaker still has a phase 1 study evaluating a once-daily formulation of danuglipron. It\'s fair to say that Wall Street is skeptical about the prospects for the drug, though.

The only other program targeting obesity included in the pipeline on Pfizer's website, though, is early-stage candidate PF-07976016."", 'I\'d say the outlook for danuglipron is murky at best. Pfizer expects to report results around midyear from a study evaluating a once-daily formulation of the drug. Bourla said in the Q1 call that the company ""will make a decision for future plans"" after seeing the data.', ""Pfizer hasn't been shy about using its treasure chest built largely by its COVID-19 vaccine to gobble up other biopharmaceutical companies. It even projects around $25 billion in additional annual revenue by 2030 from business development deals. An obvious solution for Pfizer, therefore, would be to acquire another company with a promising obesity drug."", 'Viking Therapeutics appears to be a great candidate. The company reported overwhelmingly positive results from a phase 2 study of an injectable version of its experimental obesity drug VK2735 earlier this year. Viking also announced encouraging results from a phase 1 study of an oral version of the drug.', 'Altimmune is another possibility. In March, the small drugmaker reported positive results from a phase 2 study of its obesity drug pemvidutide.', ""However, Pfizer CFO Dave Denton stated in the Q1 call not to expect any bolt-on acquisitions in the near term.

But I'm not so sure."", 'Bourla said in the Q1 call that Pfizer has historically been a big player in the metabolic market and ""obesity is a very big part of it."" He even proclaimed, ""[T]his is an area that we have the right to win."" That indicates to me that Pfizer does not intend to let the huge weight loss opportunity pass it by.', ""The analyst who said danuglipron's outlook wasn't good was probably right. We'll know more in the next few months after Pfizer reports the data from its phase 1 trial. If those results aren't promising, I think you can throw Denton's comments about not expecting any near-term acquisitions out the window."", 'My original question was: ""Can Pfizer possibly challenge Lilly and Novo Nordisk in the obesity market?""

It also owns Aetna, a leading health insurance benefits management business."", ""CVS Health's vertically integrated business means it can directly provide many of the benefits it's also paid to manage. In recent years, CVS Health has integrated further by acquiring physician groups such as Signify Health and Oak Street Health."", ""Higher-than-expected medical usage trends raised CVS Health's outgoing expenses in the first quarter. The company is also factoring in changes to the Medicare Advantage rating system that will lower incoming payments from the government."", 'CVS Health is a buy on the dip because the issues pressuring earnings this year are temporary. Fortunately, its relatively unique position at the crossroads of primary care, pharmacy services, and benefits management is a durable advantage that will most likely allow it to continue raising its dividend payout at a rapid pace for another decade.', ""Ares Capital (NASDAQ: ARCC) is America's largest business development company (BDC). These tax-advantaged entities are popular among income-seeking investors because they must distribute at least 90% of their profits to investors as a dividend."", ""At recent prices, Ares Capital offers an eye-popping 9.2% yield. The dividend payout hasn't grown in a straight line, but it is up by 20% over the past three years."", ""BDCs exist because big American banks generally aren't willing to lend to middle-market businesses, regardless of their ability to generate cash and pay their bills. As a result, Ares Capital can charge well-managed businesses interest rates for secured loans that are often higher than the rates individuals receive for unsecured loans. In the first quarter, Ares reported an average yield of 12.4% on its debt-related securities."", ""Ares Capital probably won't be the fastest dividend grower in your portfolio, but it has a good chance to continue meeting its dividend obligation and raising its payout over the long run. As one of the most established BDCs in America, its borrowing costs are relatively low compared to its peers'."", ""Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) isn't getting much attention due to a lack of anti-obesity treatments, but it's still America's largest pharmaceutical company by sales. At recent prices, the stock offers an impressive 6.2% dividend yield."", ""The company's COVID-19-related product sales collapsed faster than expected, but the rest of its portfolio keeps marching higher. Excluding COVID-19 product contributions and currency fluctuations, first-quarter sales marched 11% higher year over year."", ""Strong growth from several brands encouraged Pfizer to raise its 2024 adjusted earnings expectation by $0.10, to a range between $2.15 per share and $2.35 per share. That's more than it needs to meet a dividend commitment currently set at $1.68 per share annually."", ""Over the past decade, Pfizer has raised its payout by 62%, and steady consecutive annual raises seem likely in the decade ahead too. In 2023, the company earned U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for nine brand-new drugs, which was a new record.

Eli Lilly LLY, Novo Nordisk NVO, Pfizer PFE and AbbVie ABBV announced their first-quarter results this week. J&J JNJ announced a new plan to completely resolve its talc-related lawsuits.', 'Earnings Update: Pfizer’s first-quarter results were strong as it beat estimates for earnings as well as sales. While sales of COVID products declined due to lower demand, some key non-COVID products like Prevnar, Vyndaqel and Eliquis, new launches like Abrysvo and newly acquired products from Seagen boosted the top line in the first quarter. Sales of all key products like Prevnar, Vyndaqel and Eliquis beat estimates. Seagen drugs contributed $742 million to the top line in the first quarter. Revenues from Pfizer’s non-COVID products rose 11% operationally in the first quarter.', 'The company raised its 2024 earnings guidance while retaining revenue expectations. Adjusted earnings are expected in the range of $2.15 to $2.35 versus the prior expectation of $2.05 to $2.25 per share.The revenue guidance was maintained in the range of $58.5 to $61.5 billion in 2024, almost flat from the 2023 levels.', 'Lilly’s first-quarter results were soft as it beat estimates for earnings but missed the same for sales. Strong demand for Mounjaro, Zepbound, Verzenio and Jardiance pulled the top line in the quarter. However, continued supply constraints for incretin-based products like Trulicity, Mounjaro and Zepbound hurt sales. Demand for incretin-based products exceeded supply.', 'Mounjaro recorded sales of $1.81 billion during the quarter, while Zepbound’s sales were $517.4 million. Lilly is investing in new advanced manufacturing plants and lines in the United States and Europe to increase supply. Lilly expects the production of incretin-based products to increase from the second half of 2024. “Greater visibility” on its production expansion plans and strong demand for Mounjaro and Zepbound pushed Lilly to raise its sales and earnings guidance ranges for 2024. Lilly expects revenues in the range of $42.4 billion to $43.6 billion compared with the prior expectation of $40.4 to $41.6 billion. The earnings per share guidance was raised from the range of $12.20 to $12.70 to $13.50 to $14.00 per share.', 'Novo Nordisk beat estimates for both earnings and sales. Revenues rose 24% at a constant exchange rate (CER), driven by strong sales of its diabetes and obesity care products, mainly GLP-1 products. Its GLP-1 diabetes sales increased 32% at CER. Total Diabetes care rose 24% and Obesity care sales increased 42% at CER. Sales of the diabetes drug Ozempic rose 43%, while Wegovy rose 107% at CER. Rare disease segment sales were down 3%.', 'Backed by strong sales performance of Ozempic and Wegovy, Novo Nordisk raised its sales growth expectation for 2024 from a range of 18-26% at CER to 19-27%, while the operating profit growth range was raised from 21-29% to 22-30%at CER.', 'AbbVie beat estimates for both earnings and sales in the first quarter. While sales rose 0.7% year over year, earnings declined 6.1%. Sales of key immunology medicines Skyrizi and Rinvoq rose 47.6% and 59.3% on a reported basis, respectively, driven by successful label expansions to new indications. Humira sales declined 35.9% due to generic erosion. The company also raised its EPS guidance for 2024. AbbVie expects adjusted EPS in the range of $11.13-$11.33, up from the previously provided EPS guidance of $10.97-$11.17.', 'FDA Approves Pfizer’s Hemophilia Gene Therapy: The FDA granted approval to Pfizer’s gene therapy fidanacogene elaparvovec for the treatment of adults with hemophilia B, a rare genetic bleeding disorder.

The approval is based on positive data from the phase III study called BENEGENE-2. A regulatory application is also under review in Europe.

However, both the bankruptcy filings were rejected by courts stating that J&J was not in enough financial stress to qualify for bankruptcy.', 'Per the new plan, to completely resolve its cosmetic talc litigation, J&J has offered to pay $6.48 billion to claimants over a period of 25 years. If 75% of claimants vote in favor of the plan, J&J will file a third bankruptcy filing.

Here is the full transcript of the interview.', 'Jennifer Sanasie: MoonPay users can now buy crypto via PayPal (PYPL). The new partnership means that users in the US can seamlessly purchase crypto with PayPal through wallet transfers, bank transfers and debit card transactions. Now the cryptocurrency buying app is the first company to do this with PayPal. CEO and co founder Ivan Soto Wright says that the partnership will help the company reach more customers. So how is this going to enable mainstream adoption? We explore that now. Ivan Soto-Wright, welcome to First Mover.', 'Ivan Soto-Wright: Awesome, thanks for having me.', ""Jennifer Sanasie: Thanks for being here. Now this partnership was announced this week. Let's start at the basics, lay a foundation for me. How's this gonna work?"", ""Ivan Soto-Wright: Yeah, so at MoonPay, we're trying to onboard the world to crypto. And so for us, we're constantly looking at new payment methods, new geographies we can expand into. And for us, PayPal was a natural fit. 426 million customers that are inside of PayPal can now use their balances, their debit cards that are saved on the platform, and frictionlessly use PayPal inside of MoonPay to top up their favorite wallet."", ""Jennifer Sanasie: Now, I gotta ask you, I gotta play the devil's advocate here and I'm doing it because people ask me this all the time. Does the world wanna be onboarded onto crypto? Talk to me about some of your user stories and the future that you envision."", ""Ivan Soto-Wright: Yeah, well, I think the future of money is definitely cryptocurrency. I think that eventually we're going to see a place very similar to what we've seen with the Internet. So the Internet really brought down the cost of communication. We're now using voiceover to intero and a protocol to communicate. The same thing will happen for money instead of, you know, all these legacy infrastructure systems that don't communicate on the same language. We can now move to a system built on Internet built by blockchain where transaction costs, I think, will eventually tend towards zero. We're in the early phases of that. It's kind of like the dial-up days. We're constantly getting faster. We're getting speedier. We're going to reduce those cost of transactions. But our job is really just to lower the barriers to enable people to participate."", ""Jennifer Sanasie: How many years do you think it's gonna be until we hit that adoption, until we go from dial-up days to 5G?"", ""Ivan Soto-Wright: I mean, it's already really impressive some of the innovation that you've seen on some of these Ethereum blockchains, these layer two solutions. We've already gotten to a place of optimism where transaction costs and gas fees are near zero. And we also have new layer one blockchains that are coming to the market. You know, we don't take a particular take on one blockchain that's going to succeed. We have a view that there's going to be multiple blockchains. And really it's around what are the use cases and the performance that we see as a result of the technology."", ""Jennifer Sanasie: So you're not gonna give me any years, no predictions, no looking into the crystal ball."", ""Ivan Soto-Wright: I think it's followed a very similar trend to the internet. I would never have imagined that MoonPay now has 20 million customers on the platform. It's only been five years since we started the business. I still think we're early days in terms of the overall cycle. I look at market cap somewhat as a proxy. If we look at the Bitcoin market cap today, gold at 12 trillion, Bitcoin around a trillion, we still have a long way to go in terms of adoption of this asset class."", ""Jennifer Sanasie: Let's talk about those 20 million customers. I know that there's a story on coindesk.com. You spoke to us for the launch of this yesterday and you outlined some challenges that customers had, particularly when they were trying to get fiat onto the platform via things like bank cards. Tell me a little bit more about those issues."", ""Ivan Soto-Wright: Yeah, unfortunately, you know, it really pains me as the co -founder of the service. One of our biggest complaints that we receive is sometimes people try to use their card and they have that card rejected by their bank. Now we can't really do much about that. Some banks will decide to decline transactions related to crypto. You know, I think what we see is we want to get to a place where we have the same user experience that we have in traditional fintech. So how do we get there? We partner with traditional fintech and PayPal. Used by over 426 million people. It's a seamless way that people have used to pay. We're now forming a partnership with legacy, some of the bigger fintech platforms to enable that same user experience inside this cryptic ecosystem."", ""Jennifer Sanasie: Have you attempted to form partnerships with any of the banks or have conversations with the banks about this? I know it's not just a MoonPay problem, it's a problem for almost every platform that allows people to buy and trade crypto in the United States and Canada where I'm from, but have you had any conversations with the banks?"", ""Ivan Soto-Wright: Yeah, I mean, we're in constant contact with pretty much everyone in this industry. We're always thinking on behalf of our users, how do we provide a better experience? Some banks have updated their policies, some banks haven't. So it just comes down to their appetite. Kind of similar to what you're seeing in the ETF world. There's obviously some players that have decided to not participate full stop. There's others that are really leaning into it like BlackRock. So I think a very similar thing has taken place with banks and their...willingness to work inside this industry. I think for them, the challenge is there are some risks when it comes to cryptocurrency. When you deliver cryptocurrency over a blockchain, it's final. So there's no way to reverse that transaction. And so you do have a potential increased risk for fraud. A lot of the work that we do at MoonPay is to really build the best fraud models to determine should we accept or reject this particular customer and try to de -risk that as much as possible. So we try to do our part. Because we do think this technology is the future and we think that over time that appetite will change. We think that more banks will recognize that this is an important industry to be part of and we'll need tooling like MoonPay."", ""Jennifer Sanasie: You mentioned 20 million customers. Talk to me about how active they are these days. And the reason I ask you that is because it felt like we were going to have an epic year in crypto in January when the ETFs were approved. And now it's feeling a little bit weird if we look at some of what's going on from a macro perspective. The price of Bitcoin is down. There are net outflows with the ETFs now. Talk to me about your user base. Are you seeing an influx of new users? How active are they?"", ""Ivan Soto-Wright: Yeah, we actually saw a 43% increase in activity over the last quarter. So we had our best quarter in our five -year history in Q1 this year. And that's given the backdrop of very high interest rates. Most people thought that if interest rates were going to persist at these levels, crypto was not going to be a thing. We've actually kind of seen the opposite. I think a lot of our work is still just trying to improve the user experience. We really believe that if we get the user experience right, people will start to opt into these products similar to how people start to opt in to zoom and you know All these amazing applications that are built on voice over the internet protocol We think the same thing will take place for money and all these new crypto applications, but we're looking at a long period of time. So if you look at the general trend, I try not to look at trends within a year or six months. I really look at zooming out, look at the long term. It's up and to the right. There's more developers coming into the ecosystem. There's new applications that are being built. It just takes time for this ecosystem to flourish."", ""Jennifer Sanasie: You know, I spoke to tech journalist Kara Swisher recently, and I asked her if she thought that we were in a similar phase to the beginning of the internet. You know, she's been around, she's reported quite deeply on the beginning of the internet, and she told me no, she thinks that this sector is a sector that will be around, but maybe not as grand as us who work in the industry like to say it is. Would you agree with that sentiment, or what do you think?"", ""Ivan Soto-Wright: I think with any new technology, there's obviously a lot of hype. You go through a hype cycle where everyone is extremely excited about all the promise and then reality sets in. And when it comes down to the reality, the reality for crypto today is the user experience is not where it needs to be. And so that's where we're very committed to our mission of making crypto more like your experience with your fintech than, you know, I think traditional crypto companies that, you know, when I started, there wasn't even graphical user interfaces for some of these wallets. Like you had to use your terminal. It's gotten markedly better and I think the experiences will continue to improve."", ""Jennifer Sanasie: Talk to me a little bit more about that user experience because I think everyone agrees that the user experience needs to get better and we have great web two apps with great user experiences. Where are the challenges? What are the issues facing developers when it comes to creating a good user experience? Because we know what a good user experience looks like. It just feels like we can't really get it right."", ""Ivan Soto-Wright: Yeah, well, I think from our side, it's just constant. We have this word inside of MoonPay called Kaizen, which is continuous improvement. It's these 1 % incremental improvements that you make every single day. You do that over a year, and that's a 3 ,000 % improvement. So we're constantly learning from our users. The reality is it just takes time. You have to adapt that product. You have to get that feedback. You need to listen to your customers. And obviously, trying to solve some of the biggest pain points for them. Like, it's not acceptable if you have a high decline rate because you're getting rejected by your bank. We do things like we prompt the customer based on the six digits of the card number. We could tell them, hey, you could try another payment method. Now we can tell them to try PayPal."", ""Jennifer Sanasie: Talk to me a little bit about the partnership with PayPal. What was that journey like? Was PayPal on board from the get -go? Did it take a little bit of convincing? What was that, I don't wanna call it the dating phase like?"", ""Ivan Soto-Wright: Well, we've always had huge admiration for PayPal. They're a phenomenal company. They've always been an innovator. Even since the early days, I remember using PayPal on eBay. I would sell things in my garage online. That was the first time I received money. It was actually through my PayPal account. I see us as kind of building the next frontier. In the same way that you use PayPal to interact with the world of e -commerce, you can use MoonPay to interact the world of crypto and all these new applications. And so I thought it was a natural partnership. I thought that if we could improve the conversion rates for our customers, it was a no brainer. And so we've been spending a lot of time with that team and we're really impressed. They've actually really leaned into crypto. They've been proactive in trying to support more assets on their platform. They've invested heavily in their stable coin initiative, which I think has huge promise. I think we're in the early days of stable coins, but really now you can move frictionlessly money across many different geographies, cross border. They just announced a partnership with zoom. I definitely see the use case for stablecoins being quite strong. We're in the early days. We're obviously still getting to regulatory clarity in the United States around how these things should be backed. But I think ultimately they're going to be an important part of our financial system."", 'Jennifer Sanasie: I know you spoke to a CoinDesk reporter and said it took some time to get PayPal comfortable with the relationship. What did you mean there?', ""Ivan Soto-Wright: It just took time in terms of any major integration. You just have to go through a process. So it's obviously not as fast. As CEO, I want everything to happen yesterday. And so it just takes time to get these things done. But eventually, we get them done."", 'Jennifer Sanasie: Now you are known at MoonPay for the big mainstream partnerships, the big flashy celebrity partnerships. I know late last year there was a MasterCard partnership announced. Any progress there?', ""Ivan Soto-Wright: Yeah, so the MasterCard partnership is one of our most exciting ones. We actually did something very cool at the Arnold Palmer Golf Invitational very recently, where they're starting to look at how do they bring priceless experiences to their customers. Priceless has always been their tagline at MasterCard. And so what they did is they did a bunch of really cool activations at the event. If you scanned, you know, there was a bunch of different QR codes and NFC chips inside the actual event. And if you scan them or you interact with these NFC chips, you would gain collectibles. And some of those collectibles offered you tickets. So if you won't manage to find all these collectibles inside the actual tournament, you would get offered tickets the next day. So it's thinking, how do we provide better experiences to our customers? It's not necessarily, oh, I'm getting an asset because I believe it's going to go up in value. It's an asset that actually has utility."", 'Jennifer Sanasie: Any other big partnerships you can let us know about?', ""Ivan Soto-Wright: We'll have more very soon, but I think this PayPal one is the one that we're super concentrated at the moment. We want to make this a roaring success. We want as many of our users to take it up and actually see success with being able to onboard. It's great for us. Also, for people that have bank payment methods that they'd like to use, they can now use them through PayPal."", ""Jennifer Sanasie: Now, I gotta ask you, everyone who works in this industry has one sector of it that they're very excited about, one that they watch very closely, and it's not always the one that we focus on in our everyday job. Is there a sector in this industry that you're really excited about if you look beyond MoonPay and what MoonPay is doing?"", ""Ivan Soto-Wright: I still think we're really early days around the use cases for NFTs. I'm still quite excited about the promise of NFTs. I think we're still early days in terms of how we think about programming content on the blockchain. And so I think things like tickets make a lot of sense to me. I think the ticketing industry today has a lot of inefficiencies. I think a lot of them could be solved by having a robust system that I think will be built on blockchain. I also think gaming assets, I think inside of games, a lot of people collect these digital assets, but they're constrained to the environments. They're in the same way that your money, in a lot of cases, is being held by all these third parties, your data, your property that you have inside of these games is held by third parties, you can now own and control them yourself. And I think that will be the future."", ""Jennifer Sanasie: You and I are excited about the same things in this industry, so great minds. I've been, yeah, of course. Thank you very much for joining me today."", 'Ivan Soto-Wright: Appreciate that.', 'Ivan Soto-Wright: Awesome. Thanks, Jen.', '']"

With that, I will turn the call over to Andres.', 'Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert', ""Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our first quarter 2024 financial review call. We are very pleased with our progress so far this year. And today, I will discuss our first quarter results and provide key business updates. Steve Coughlin, our CFO, will give more detail on our financial performance and outlook. Beginning on Slide 3 with our first quarter results. We had a strong first quarter that was in line with our expectations, with adjusted EBITDA with tax attributes of $863 million, adjusted EBITDA of $635 million and adjusted EPS of $0.50. These results demonstrate once again our ability to execute on our plans and guidance and our structural resilience to high interest rates and inflation. I am pleased to reaffirm our 2024 guidance for all metrics and growth rates through 2027. Today, I will be discussing the success we have achieved with technology companies and data centers as well as the significant market opportunity that we see for renewable growth for the foreseeable future. Turning to Slide 4. I'm happy to announce that this quarter, we signed a 15-year contract with Amazon with the second phase of our Bellefield project, with an additional 500 megawatts of solar and 500 megawatts of storage. The entire project, including Bellefield 1, which we contracted last year, will provide 2 gigawatts of combined solar and storage for Amazon, making it the biggest solar-plus-storage project in the U.S. We see the 2 gigawatt Bellefield solar-plus-storage project is a milestone for AES and a demonstration of the important role that renewables play in delivering new energy. The significant energy storage component, which includes AES' proprietary AI weather forecasting, ensures the project is able to supply carbon-free energy throughout the day. Turning to Slide 5. With this project, we now have nearly 6 gigawatts of long-term contracts directly with technology companies, making AES among the largest energy providers to data centers. This does not include more than 500 megawatts of contracts signed with utilities to serve data center customers. We are fully supporting the commitments that Google, Microsoft, Amazon and others have made to procure not just carbon-free energy, but specifically additional renewals. Turning to Slide 6. Across the U.S., power demand is forecasted to increase significantly over the next decade, driven by factors such as data center growth, onshoring of manufacturing and electrification of mobility. There is no technology better suited to serve this load growth than wind and solar, particularly when combined with energy storage. Turning to Slide 7. Even using data that is more than a year old, renewables clearly offer the lowest levelized cost of energy, or LCOE, of any new build on an unsubsidized basis. They provide a source of predictable energy that is not impacted by fuel availability or price volatility. Furthermore, renewables are substantially better placed than any other form of power to actually come online over the next decade when power shortages are likely to be most acute. Nowhere is this clearer than in the interconnection queue, which, is as you can see on Slide 8, are dominated by renewable projects. Looking at 2024 as an example, 95% of the capacity additions in the U.S. are expected to come from solar, energy storage and wind. A major part of this growth is coming from energy storage, whose installed capacity is expected to double by the end of the year. Given our role in creating and first commercializing grid-scale lithium-ion-based energy storage, it fills me with great satisfaction to see that the 2 largest economies in the country, California and Texas, now get more than 10% of their dispatchable capacity from batteries. We are now even seeing periods of the day in California when energy storage is the single largest source of power on the grid. Turning to Slide 9. Among renewable developers, AES is best positioned to address corporate load growth. We have the scale and experience to bring projects to market in the most cost-efficient way. Our flexibility and ability to innovate give us a competitive advantage with our large customers, just as it led to our early partnerships with data center companies. We also had the best track record in the market of supply chain management and bringing projects online, on time and on budget. As you can see on Slide 10, we have a pipeline of 66 gigawatts, not including prospects, with projects ranging in maturity from early stage to late stage. Let me emphasize that all of the projects in our pipeline include some degree of land control as well as interconnection filing. In addition, rather than pursuing just total megawatts, we have taken a strategic approach to building our pipeline, focusing on those markets and sites where we see the most significant demand and where we are best positioned to add value. The breadth and maturity of this pipeline, both in terms of market and interconnection queue positions, provide us with a meaningful competitive advantage and line of sight into future growth. As I mentioned in February, our historical results, combined with accelerating demand for our renewable projects, led us to increase our U.S. project return expectations by 200 basis points to 12% to 15% on a levered after-tax cash basis and raised our long-term guidance for both EBITDA and EPS. With 1.2 gigawatts of new contract signings since our Q4 call in February, including Bellefield 2, we now have a backlog of signed contracts of 12.7 gigawatts. We have also added almost 600 megawatts of new projects to our operating portfolio, including the completion of Chevelon Butte, which is the largest wind project in the state of Arizona, and Delta, which is the first utility-scale wind project in the state of Mississippi. With these additions to our operating fleet and the good progress we are making on our projects currently under construction, we remain fully on track to add a total of 3.6 gigawatts of new capacity this year. I should note that for the remaining projects coming online in 2024, we had 92% of the major equipment already on site, including virtually all of our solar modules and more than half of our solar modules for 2025. Our diversified and resilient supply chain has been, and will continue to be, one of our differentiators. Turning to our utilities on Slide 11. In mid-April, AES Indiana achieved a critical milestone with the approval of its rate case by the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission. Resolving the rate case provides us a constructive regulatory foundation for our investments focused on reliability, resiliency and customer experience and allows us to partially recover accumulated inflation since our last rate case in 2017. The $71 million rate case increase includes an ROE of 9.9%, demonstrating the commission's support for investments that strengthen the overall system reliability and drive value for customers. In late February, we also closed on the acquisition of the 106-megawatt Hoosier Wind project, providing long-term savings to our customers while also adding to AS Indiana's portfolio of renewable projects. AES Indiana's latest Integrated Resource Plan, or IRP, includes a commitment for the addition of 1,300 megawatts of wind, solar and energy storage over the next 5 years. At AES Ohio, we continue to execute on our growth plan, stemming from our new rate case structure, ESP 4, put in place in Q3 of last year as well as our Smart Grid program and FERC formula investment in transmission. By the end of the program, AES Ohio will still maintain the lowest rates in the state across all customer classes. As a reminder, approximately 80% of AES Ohio's planned investments through 2027 are already approved or under FERC formula rate programs. Across our 2 utilities, our Q1 investment was up nearly 100% from last year as a result of the new rate structures and investing to improve system resilience and customer experience. Looking ahead, we now have a clear line of sight to $4 billion of our total utility capital program of $5.3 billion through 2027. We are also seeing the potential for further upside from the growing interest from data center providers who see our service territory as a desirable location for growth. With double-digit rate base growth throughout our planned horizon, we believe they represent one of the fastest-growing utility investment opportunities in the country. With that, I now would like to turn the call over to our CFO, Steve Coughlin."", 'Stephen Coughlin', ""Thank you, Andres, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will discuss our first quarter results and our 2024 guidance and parent capital allocation. Following that, I will provide a deeper dive into our low-risk, highly efficient capital structure, which is important for everyone to understand. Turning to Slide 13. Adjusted EBITDA with tax attributes was $863 million in the first quarter versus $641 million a year ago. This was driven primarily by contributions from the roughly 600 megawatts of new renewables we brought online. Turning to Slide 14. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.50 versus $0.22 last year and in line with our expectations. Drivers were similar to those of adjusted EBITDA with tax attributes but also included higher parent interest expense and a lower adjusted tax rate. These results include approximately $0.08 of tax benefits, consistent with our expectations, which were associated with steps we took this quarter to transition to a more U.S.-oriented holding company structure that is better aligned with our significant U.S. growth. In the future, we may recognize further benefits from our revised simpler structure, although likely of a smaller magnitude. We continue to expect an adjusted tax rate of 23% to 25% for the full year, excluding the impact of tax credit transfers, which we are showing at the SBU level for simplicity. I'll cover the performance of our SBUs or strategic business units on the next 4 slides. Beginning with our renewables SBU on Slide 15, higher EBITDA with tax attributes was driven primarily by contributions from new businesses but was partially offset by lower renewable resource in Panama and Brazil. Higher adjusted PTC at our Utilities SBU was mostly driven by favorable weather in the U.S. as well as higher revenues from investments in our rate base. This was partially offset by interest expense on new borrowings to fund future growth. Relatively flat EBITDA at our energy infrastructure SBU primarily reflects prior year higher LNG transaction margins and the sell-down of our gas and LNG businesses in Panama and the Dominican Republic. This was partially offset by higher revenues recognized from the accelerated monetization of the PPA at our Warrior Run plant. Finally, higher EBITDA at our New Energy Technologies SBU reflects continued margin improvement at Fluence. Now turning to our guidance on Slide 19. We are reaffirming our 2024 adjusted EBITDA with tax attributes guidance of $3.6 billion to $4 billion and 2024 adjusted EBITDA guidance of $2.6 billion to $2.9 billion. We expect to continue to see strong growth in our renewables and utilities businesses, partially offset by short-term dilution from continued execution on our $3.5 billion asset sale target through 2027. We are also reaffirming our 2024 adjusted EPS guidance of $1.87 to $1.97. Our earnings will have similar drivers to adjusted EBITDA with tax attributes but will also be impacted by a lower adjusted tax rate and higher parent interest. We anticipate a more even distribution of cash and earnings throughout the year, with nearly half of earnings expected to come in the first half versus only 25% in 2023. Now to our 2024 parent capital allocation plan on Slide 20. Sources reflect approximately $3 billion of total discretionary cash, including $1.1 billion of parent free cash flow, $900 million to $1.1 billion of proceeds from asset sales and $900 million to $1 billion of planned parent debt issuance. As a reminder, we limit any parent debt issuance to a level consistent with our investment-grade credit metrics. We continue to be very pleased with the great progress toward our $3.5 billion asset sale program, which will limit and may eliminate any need for future parent equity issuance throughout our long-term guidance period. On the right-hand side, you can see our planned use of capital. We will return approximately $500 million to shareholders this year, reflecting the previously announced 4% dividend increase. We also plan to invest approximately $2.6 billion towards new growth, of which 85% will go to renewables and utilities. One of our strengths is the flexibility we maintain in our capital plan across both sources and uses. As we have for many years, we will continue to execute on opportunities to rotate capital across the portfolio in a manner that creates shareholder value. Next, I want to take a moment to discuss how we manage our balance sheet on Slide 21. First, we utilize nonrecourse debt to fund our growth. Approximately 82% of the debt on our balance sheet is nonrecourse to AES Corp., meaning it is only secured at the relevant subsidiary level. This important structural component limits our risk at the parent company to the equity we invest in our subsidiaries. We further insulate our financials from interest rate movements with nearly 90% of our long-term debt being fixed rate or hedged. In addition, nearly $4 billion of the debt on our balance sheet is under designated construction facilities, which are also nonrecourse to the parent company but are backed by projects that don't yet generate earnings or cash. When a project reaches commercial operations, approximately half of this construction debt will be repaid with cash generated from the monetization of tax attributes leading to a significantly lower long-term leverage profile on projects in operation. As a result, recourse debt to the AES parent is only 18% of total leverage. Using an example of a typical U.S. solar-plus-battery project on Slide 22. We've centered our strategy around a capital-efficient model, which quickly recycles cash, enabling the rapid growth we've achieved in recent years. First, when we place a project in service, we pay down at least 40% of a project's capital cost with tax equity partnerships and tax credit transfers. Our projects typically benefit from the investment tax credit, which provides an attractive upfront cash return on our investment and significantly reduces net parent cash requirements. We fund an additional approximately 40% using fixed-rate, amortizing nonrecourse debt, which is investment-grade rated. In order to insulate project returns from changes in interest rates, we pre-hedged this expected debt issuance when we sign a PPA. We currently have nearly $9 billion of outstanding interest rate hedges on our balance sheet, most of which relate to our U.S. renewables business. With respect to equity requirements for U.S. renewables, our development partner, Alberta Investment Management, or AIMCo, contributes 25% of equity capital needs. Once a project is completed, we typically bundle it into an operating portfolio and sell down a large minority stake at an attractive premium and recover most, if not all, of the upfront parent equity investment in the project. The end result is a material ownership in a high-quality, long-term renewables project with little net cash invested listed and de minimis risks to our balance sheet. This model allows us to grow rapidly while maintaining an investment-grade credit rating and ensures our financial results are not sensitive to changes in interest rates. Now turning back to our first quarter results. We've had a tremendous start to the year, making significant progress towards all of our financial targets. We expect to continue the momentum in the year to go as we complete our remaining 3 gigawatts of new projects and continue growing the rate base at our U.S. utilities while maintaining a low-risk, highly efficient capital structure and funding plan. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Andres."", 'Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert', ""Thank you, Steve. Before we open up the call for questions, I would like to sum up the highlights of the quarter. We had a strong first quarter, in line with our expectations. Our earnings and cash flow are now more evenly balanced throughout the year as our U.S. renewable business matures. Our performance demonstrates yet again our ability to execute, and that our financial results are not sensitive to higher interest rates. Our financial model is proving very resilient as we see ample supply of nonrecourse project finance debt as well as strong demand for tax attributes and project equity from minority partners. In addition, our asset sales program is on track, representing an important component of our capital-efficient growth model, which may even eliminate our need for issuing corporate equity through our long-term guidance period. Our stock would have to reach much higher valuation before new parent equity would even be considered several years in the future. We see strong and accelerating demand for renewables in our core markets and are pleased to be in a leading position with the largest segment of growth data centers. We're also executing well on our construction program and have virtually all of the major equipment we need for 2024 on site and the majority of what we need for 2025 as well. Our supply chain management continues to support our best-in-class track record of delivering new renewable projects on time and on budget. In closing, we are once again delivering on our strategic objectives and financial guidance and are uniquely well placed to be one of the winners of the energy transition. Operator, please open up the line for questions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Nick Campanella of Barclays.', 'Nicholas Joseph Campanella', ""So thanks for the comments on the asset sale programs. And I was just hoping you could maybe expand a little on your commentary about eliminating future planned equity issuance. Is that something that we should have kind of a view on through this year because you do have asset sales penciled into 2024? Or is that statement more kind of a multiyear effort? I'm just trying to get a sense of size and magnitude of what you guys have visibility to into this year."", 'Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert', ""Yes. No, thanks for the question. Look, historically, I believe we've always overachieved our asset sale targets. So last year, we overachieved by about $600 million. So we're coming into this year with some tailwinds. So we don't comment on any specific asset sale until they're closed. But we feel good. What has been disclosed is, for example, we have already sold the Vietnam asset and are just waiting government approval. So that's a quite large sale that we're -- it's already, let's say, it's not closed, but the sale is done. We just have the final government approval. So we feel good about it. So the general statement is that if you look over our tenure of the last decade, we've been very frugal about issuing new equity. We've actually, in the net bought back shares, we've also paid $3 billion worth of debt. So we've been able to do this transformation being very, very stringent about issuing any new equity. So depending on how the asset sales goes and our growth programs and our partnerships, we feel that we may be able to do this without any additional equity issuance. We've always talked about it being in the later years of our guidance period, and we've also mentioned that we would never do it at current valuations. So I hope that provides as much color as we can, but I think it gives you a clear notion of what our intent is."", 'Nicholas Joseph Campanella', ""All right. That's helpful. And then I guess just you have -- just with the data center opportunity, you've established yourself pretty early as doing some of these deals with hyperscalers. And I'm just wondering, with some of your peers kind of announcing a wider framework with Microsoft earlier this week, is that something that is an opportunity to do on the AES side as well with a large customer? And how would that fit into your overall strategy? Or is that just not the focus at this point? I'm just wondering if you can kind of comment about that framework and what you think."", 'Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert', ""Look, I think that we identified several things some years ago. So first, just looking out, as I've said many times in our meetings or calls, that we would -- we saw a shortage -- eventually a shortage of renewable projects given the increase in demand. So we had somewhat of a lag in 2020 due to tariff issues, but that was basically going to catch up. So what we were seeing is that there was going to be more demand, quite frankly, than supply for renewables, number one. Number two, we very early on identified data centers and technology companies as our -- really, our sweet spot in terms of future deals, and we've been working with them. So we have innovated coming up with things like hourly match carbon-free energy with the data centers. So we've already done 6 gigawatts. So we're out ahead. These are actual projects that have been done. So we have very close relationships with them. And I would say that coming up with various ways of us helping them meet their needs, certainly things that we have been discussing for some time. So our real focus is on meeting their needs, and what we see is that things like pipeline. And we started building up this pipeline again several years ago, really thinking about what they would need. So finding the sites. And I'd say, the most strict about when we talk about backlog, it's a signed contract. It's not something we expect to sign. When we talk about pipeline, it's actual having some degree of land control, and it's being in the interconnection queue. It's not we're prospecting in this area. We've had some discussions. So we feel very good about our ability to meet these clients' needs, and I think understanding very well what those needs are. So I don't see this really just as a zero-sum game. What we see is that the deal that was announced in the last week, an international deal, is good. And it's good because there's a lot of demand out there, and we're not going to be able to satisfy it all by ourselves. And second of all, I think it shows the value of having an international presence and the value of being in diversified markets to be able to satisfy their needs. So I think there's been a lot of focus on the specific technology, not enough focus on how do you satisfy the needs of those clients. So that's what we've been focused on. But quite frankly, this is nothing new to us. We've been doing this almost 5 years. Thank you."", 'Operator', 'Next question comes from Durgesh Chopra of Evercore ISI.', 'Durgesh Chopra', ""Just maybe can I get your thoughts on potential tariffs? There's been talks of some antidumping tariffs, and just how you're positioned there if something were to take place?"", 'Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert', ""Yes. Look, great question. Quite frankly, I'm not concerned at all about the AD/CVD, which is the antidumping compensating tariffs, I would say, for the following reasons. First, we already have pretty much everything we need on site for the remainder of this year and the majority of what we need for next year. And before any tariffs could come in place, I would expect to have everything on site for 2025. So that's the first thing. So -- and then when we think about 2026, we expect to have domestic content -- domestically made solar modules. So quite frankly, I'm not concerned about this. And I think that the most important thing is look at our track record. When there was the uncertainty about tariffs in coming out in 2020, we didn't abandon or significant delay any single U.S. solar project. So whether these countervailing duties come into place, we'll monitor it. I think the effects on the sector as a whole will be much less than the prior tariff circumvention case because the level of the duties should be significantly smaller. But I think the important thing is to have clarity so that people can find PPAs. But specifically about AES, I am not concerned because we've always been concerned about any possibility like this and moving ahead. So we, of course, like others, have strategic relationships with suppliers, but the proof of the pudding is in the eating. So we have everything on site for this year. And before these tariffs come in place, we'll have all our solar modules for next."", 'Durgesh Chopra', ""That is very clear, Andres. And then maybe can I just follow up on Nick's question regarding asset sales? Just as we think about the cadence of announcements here for the rest of the year and into 2025, do you see potential for large deal, large asset sale or maybe a large 1 buyer or a large buyer in place of like multiple small buyers or multiple small deals that you've done in the past? Maybe just -- can you discuss that?"", 'Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert', ""Yes. Again, we don't typically comment on this. But something like, for example, the Vietnam sale or others, these would be large sales, hundreds of millions of dollars. So what I would say, you -- we will do these over time. We'll also continue to do the smaller ones, selling down of specific assets when we think that we've maximized the value that we could add. And we continue to sell down, of course, our renewable projects, as Steve explained. So these will be multiple sources of us getting additional financing. So again, we don't comment until the deal is closed. But I think it's very clear. We have a very good track record of doing this, and we're not just starting. We have some wind in our sails. So I feel very good about it."", 'Stephen Coughlin', ""Yes. And I would just add, Durgesh, as Andres said, we have a long track record. So it's not just about the goal, it's also about securing the best value in exiting properly. So we have a lot of pathways to do that. We have $3.5 billion is a conservative number. And it's a combination of our coal exit, our simplification of our international portfolio, monetizing some of our technology businesses and the renewables, recycling. So there's a number of ways. And so it allows us the luxury of ensuring that we get the appropriate value, and we're looking out in the market on all of these and transacting when we see that appropriate valuation. And we were ahead, as Andres said, by over $600 million last year. So we feel great."", 'Durgesh Chopra', 'Indeed, guys. And I apologize, but just -- I want to ask a quick question on just the pace of deployment, given your leadership in the renewable industry. Andres, just as we think about all the data center demand projections, do you -- are you concerned with the pace at which the deployment might happen? I mean, you mentioned the demand exceeding the supply. But are we going too fast? And do you -- could you see yourself in the position to be able to provide all the renewable power given the demand?', 'Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert', ""Let's see. I think that the -- what we're seeing is they're very concerned about getting power. They're talking about time to power, how fast your renewable projects can come online. I think that the market is beginning to realize that this growth in data center demand will be mostly powered by renewables. They are the cheapest energy, and they're going to be the fastest time to power. There was a lot of talk about, say, something like nuclear. So while existing nuclear plants can be recontracted and provide power, they aren't additional. They aren't decreasing the total carbon footprint of the system, number one. And it takes years to bring new nuclear online. So while I'm a believer nine nuclear in the long run, it's like, okay, time to power and bringing data centers on in the next 3 years, how am I going to power them? And that's really where we'll also play a key role. Now what do I think? I think those people who have advanced pipelines are going to be in the best position, who have the supply chain and have the projects. And the other thing that I find very interesting is that I think pipelines are extremely valuable, and I don't think people are valuing them enough. And I would say, just think about if you were coming in from zero to create a pipeline of, say, 50 gigawatts in the U.S., how much would that cost you? And those pipelines aren't just for projects in the next 2 to 3 years. Those pipelines are going to be serving projects certainly within the next 5 and beyond that. So I think that, to answer your question, there is a lot of pipelines in the state, there's a lot of interconnection. The question will be those developers who will be able to bring them on in time for the data centers, and I think it will require flexibility. So I hope that answers your question. And this view has not changed. What we have seen, I would say, is that data center growth, certainly in the last year, has accelerated. But we saw a huge corporate demand coming, and data center is being part of that.Thank you, Durgesh."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Richard Sunderland of JPMorgan.', 'Richard Wallace Sunderland', ""Maybe picking up on that last question from Durgesh. I'm curious if you could speak a little bit more to transmission constraints and how that's being impacted by this accelerating pace. You obviously have an interesting perspective, both on the commercial side and on the utility side. Curious again how you're positioned from an interconnection perspective, the pipeline for value there? And is there ways to maybe realize even more of that value through unlocking transmission?"", 'Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert', ""Sure. Look, again, that's something we've also been working on for some time. So I think here in the states, the most specific project I can talk about is our use of dynamic line rating. And this allowed us to place a 400-megawatt hour battery project in Indianapolis that otherwise would have not been as possible. So dynamic line rating, very simply, is it actually takes into account monitors the actual state of transmission lines because transmission lines are rated at a capacity for usually is like the worst possible conditions, which, thankfully, don't always exist. Next is we have the grid booster, which Fluence has been doing, for example, in Germany, where you actually, again, use existing transmission lines with banks of batteries to transmit energy on those times when they're underutilized. And look, the typical transmission line is utilized 50% of capacity. So you have a lot of excess capacity there. So definitely, batteries is a way of using them on those off-peak hours. Now look, there is no one silver bullet, but this can avoid billions in costs and decades of permitting. And so they have a massive project in Germany to get this done. And that's not unique to Germany. There are places where we could do that in the States. So the question is why isn't this being more discussed? And really, it's not a technical issue. We're a very solid ground, is what I'm saying here. The issue is who gets to own the batteries? Who determines the dispatch? And how do you remunerate that dispatch? And look, some of the business models actually -- you can make more money to invest more. So avoiding cost is not necessarily what everybody wants. But that is one way. Again, we're looking at a big project in Chile. So again, I think that could be more applicable in the states. It's really a regulatory issue. Other things is, quite frankly, getting sites where you have interconnections that also would be easy for people to put data centers in that same region is something again that, from day 1, that we have been working on. So those are all the ways. There will be others, but the ones I'm mentioning are those that are technically known today. But then look, there's also -- we have Uplight, our investment in Uplight, which just merged without AutoGrid, for virtual power plants and really the orchestration of grid scale energy resources. So those are other ways. It's also a question of more advanced software and better understanding, things like, what we talked about, our proprietary AI system for predicting next-day wind bidding engines. All those things help make better use out of existing transmission. So I think you correctly identified that transmission will be one of the bottlenecks. We'll have to be creative about it, not only the suppliers of the energy but also the consumers."", 'Richard Wallace Sunderland', ""No, that's very helpful color, and I appreciate all the context of that. Maybe switching gears. Hydrogen, overall, been an active focus area for you, featured heavily in some of your updates last year. Just curious to get a temp check on that front, what you're focused on now, what we should be watching in terms of updates on the hydrogen front over the balance of the year."", 'Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert', ""Yes. Look, we have the big project in Texas, a joint venture with Air Products, which is the largest seller of hydrogen in the world. That continues to progress. But we're still waiting for the final treasury regulations in terms of what qualifies as green hydrogen, what is the carbon intensity and what is the degree of tax credits you get on the different factors. So once that comes out, we continue to make progress, and we feel good about it. And also that is, quite frankly, the most advanced green hydrogen project in the U.S. with a real offtaker.Thank you, Rich."", 'Operator', 'Next question comes from David Arcaro of Morgan Stanley.', 'David Keith Arcaro', ""It looks like a bit of a smaller addition in terms of renewables origination this quarter than you had in the last few. I was wondering if you could speak to that and maybe describe the trends you're seeing near term in terms of renewables origination."", 'Stephen Coughlin', ""Yes, yes. I'm not sure the data you're looking at, but we had actually quite a very good quarter. I think it was 1.2 gigawatts signed in the quarter, David. So we're very, very pleased. And also very pleased that we were able to announce Amazon as our Bellefield customer, which is really a total of 2 gigawatts with Amazon, including the first phase from last year and then the second phase. And so that's an example of the things we've been doing with data centers on a very large scale. So we've done a lot in the first quarter. We've been active not only in signing, but also in executing and spreading our execution throughout the year, as I mentioned. So we had many more megawatts installed in this quarter. And as such, our earnings for the year will be much more balanced. But no, we feel really good about our signings target. The demand is stronger than ever. And I think the deal announced earlier this week with Microsoft, as Andres said, it's just one example of what we've been saying is that the renewables is where these folks come first. And that was a 10-gigawatt agreement. And so it dwarfs anything that's been signed with like a nuke or things like that. So -- but as Andres also said, this is not a zero-sum game, and there is much more demand here and continuing to come. And so we feel really good about our pipeline and the maturity of it and where it's located and its positions in the queues. So no, I think our signing progress has been excellent and still feel really good about where we're headed for the rest of the year."", 'David Keith Arcaro', 'Okay. Great. And yes, I was going to go back to that multiyear kind of framework agreement that we saw earlier this week. I was wondering, are you seeing that same level of demand where data center companies are getting potentially more aggressive, willing to contract out further into the decade where you could be? Or should we start to see potentially deals, bigger deals getting signed and looking further out in your pipeline?', 'Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert', ""Well, I think that's sort of a framework agreement. And I think what we've been doing is negotiating big deals and, I would say, with several of the hyperscalers. So we're not just slowly focused on one. And so we're looking at how to solve their demands. And quite frankly, they have slightly different preferences where they're going. We have data center deals with Microsoft in Chile, for example. So what they're looking for is people who can provide, of course, U.S., that's the biggest, the fastest growth. But I think there are very interesting international opportunities, and it depends where you have your footprint. So I believe the deal that we're talking about in Brookfield, they have more Asia and European capabilities. And quite frankly, we have decided not to be in those markets."", 'Stephen Coughlin', 'Thanks, David.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Angie Storozynski of Seaport.', 'Agnieszka Anna Storozynski', ""So I know we talked about it in the past, but I just wanted to go back to this, how much it really costs to develop these renewables and how seemingly little of an EBITDA and free cash flow accretion you guys are going to get from it? And even using your math, right, with this the financing of CapEx and the amount of money that you were planning to spend on renewables from the Analyst Day, it would -- and you would end up with like about $2.7 billion of your equity contribution and, say, $350 million of free cash flow on the back of it, just again using the target return. Isn't that -- I'm just wondering if that's enough? I mean, is it time to maybe up this return expectations? Or is it just simply that that's how competitive the market is, and you just have to accept the terms? All I'm trying to say is that it doesn't seem like it's generating enough EBITDA or free cash flow from the amount of investments that those renewables require."", 'Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert', ""Yes. I would disagree. I mean, we can maybe go into more detail offline. But I think the way to -- first of all, realize that we do renewables not only in the U.S. We do it, for example, a lot of renewables in Chile, where you don't have any of the upfront tax attributes. But it's a different, let's say, model, but actually, our returns are better there. I would say, given the tax attributes in the states, what you have is -- thinking of it's sort of a flow in the stock, right? So you get a lot of the tax attributes is cash, right? So you use that cash to pay down the construction debt. And then you're left with a project with a lower amount of debt going forward. And then you also get cash immediately by selling down to minority partners who want -- in the example we gave, like a solar bond. So they're willing to take lower returns. So on the project itself, you do have a very good cash returns for the total cost of the project. Because again, you're getting almost 50% back and right after you commission it. Now when you're looking at the EBITDA numbers, realize that we're growing very fast. So last year, our commissioning of projects grew 100%. So those projects are now coming online over time. So no, I don't think -- I mean, I think returns will increase. We did increase our targeted returns for the U.S. because of what we're seeing in the market and our increased, let's say, maturity and efficiency. And I would remind you that, again, without tax attributes, we're getting even better returns internationally. And another comment on it, when people talk about the competitiveness of renewables, realize that solar panels in the states are costing 2 to 3x what they cost internationally. So the cost of the megawatt hours from renewables with energy storage on it is much, much cheaper, and then certainly the cheapest energy in most places that we operate. So again, we would -- can go into more discussions about it, but we feel very good about the cash profile of renewables and what they're generating."", 'Stephen Coughlin', ""Yes. I would just add, Angie, also on the EBITDA profile, the EBITDA in the U.S. is growing significantly. I think you're not seeing it in part because of some of the things happening in LatAm around the El Niño, where we've had lower hydro generation, for example, in Panama, as I said in my comments, Brazil has had very low wind in the first quarter. And then frankly, Q1 and even in the U.S. is a very low solar irradiation quarter, so you won't see the EBITDA growth to the same degree. But within that number, there's substantial U.S. growth throughout this year, but it is somewhat offset by a couple of those other factors outside the U.S. So the EBITDA is strong. And the other thing I'd mention in terms of developing renewables, we've been perfecting this machine for many, many years. So the development has gotten quite efficient. We are able to drive high success rates through our development process. And so that cost continues to come down, relative to bringing projects successfully online. So -- but we can go into more detail perhaps separately, but it's a very attractive profile for this business."", 'Agnieszka Anna Storozynski', ""And then just separately, so you mentioned about -- mentioned all of these projects that you developed with hyperscalers. I mean those are virtual PPAs, right? So there's -- but not directly feeding into these data centers. And I'm just wondering, I mean, is it like in a close geographic proximity, given that I think there's more and more discussion about the variability of the grid and transmission congestion? Again, I understand that hyperscalers have the net-zero goals. But at the end of the day, they have to have access to reliable power in the sort of a proximity of these facilities. So again, I'm honestly trying to understand how renewables just built somewhere far will help keeping the lights on in these 24/7 demand machines."", 'Stephen Coughlin', ""Yes, Angie. It's good -- all good points. And so you're absolutely right that the proximity is important within the region. Now the co-location, I think, is overblown in terms of you're adding a new load to the grid, regardless, that needs interconnection and approval, regardless of where this data center is. But what are they really looking for, as Andres said, they're looking for renewables and they're looking for additionality, meaning new renewables. And so you do want to do that in a smart way by minimizing your transmission charges, so you want them to be within a region of the data center. And then you want to be able to add batteries in many cases. And we see tremendous upside. We've been developing battery storage, both technology in Fluence as well as battery storage projects in our portfolio for a very long time, a decade plus. So that's a huge advantage for us in being able to meet their carbon-free needs throughout the entire day. And so being able to have those battery sites in the region with the solar, with the wind sites, is key in having that flexibility. So it's not a market you can tap into just by jumping into this. You have to have been -- had foresight for 5 years-plus to be advanced in developing all these technologies within these regions to do that. And then the other thing I would say is that because -- and we've talked about this, the data center locations are expanding more towards the middle of the country and so it's opening up many more locations, which are -- have much more land availability for solar, for wind, in the regions like MISO, into ERCOT, less congested in the Coast. And so that's an advantage in terms of ensuring you're locating your data centers close to your generation sites as well."", 'Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert', ""Yes. Angie, these are really good points because the other thing is that the new AI requires less latency, immediacy, than traditional data centers. So it opens up the geographic possibilities. But we've always felt, for example, on green hydrogen as an example, that, first, it has to be regional to minimize transmission. Second, that it should be additional. And the fact that it's already a match is something we can do. So in the particular case of our green hydrogen project, that 1 is actually pretty much co-located, it's like across the street. So that's a particular case where that works. But I think that it very much depends on the transmission conditions. But just opening up of more geographies is very favorable."", 'Operator', 'Our final question comes from Michael Sullivan of Wolfe Research.', 'Michael P. Sullivan', ""I wanted to just circle back on the utility side and the data center angle there. I think you alluded to it a little bit, but can you give a little more color on what you're seeing, I guess, particularly in Indiana. And do you think the IRP you have out there is enough to cover any particularly large announcements that have been made? How should we be thinking about that?"", 'Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert', ""Let's see. What I had mentioned in my speech is that, certainly, that as we're involved in these negotiations with hyperscalers due to transmission and other attributes, there is interest in our 2 utilities for possible locations. Now this would be outside of the IRP per se because this would be an additional demand that would be put onto our systems."", 'Michael P. Sullivan', 'Okay. But nothing specific in the works anymore?', 'Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert', ""We have nothing specific to announce at this time. We just thought it was important because when we talk about it, we talked about what we've done purely. We haven't talked about -- well, this is the first time we mentioned, for example, the megawatts that we're doing and actually providing that energy for other utilities to more data centers, and we might be able to do some for ourselves."", 'Stephen Coughlin', 'Yes. So I would look at it as the plan has upside, really, is what it is about, Mike. So we have assumed sort of line of sight to what we know in industrial development in Ohio, but they are becoming very attractive places not only for data centers, but also chips manufacturing, battery manufacturing, we talked about. So there will be some discrete additions that I think will be upside to our plan down the road.', 'Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert', ""In closing, Steve brought up a very good point. But what we're seeing is growth in corporate demand. It's not just data centers. So what you're seeing in our service areas is, for example, a reindustrialization of the U.S. So you have onshoring, whether it be EVs, battery manufacturing, panel manufacturing, other things, which is growing very substantially. And then you have to add in the load for electrification because people have been talking about EVs as if they're not selling, but the fact is they're growing very fast. Charging stations are growing. They're just growing less than some of the forecasts that people have put out there. But if you look at, for example, China, 50% of vehicles sold are EVs. So what we see is an increased demand from corporations from all of these sources. We have particularly focused on tech companies and data centers as really our sweet spot. But -- and internationally, it's the same. What we want is long-term dollar-denominated contracts with investment-grade offtakers. And again, we're doing well on both. So very optimistic about the sector."", 'Michael P. Sullivan', 'Okay. And if I could just squeeze one last one in, just latest thoughts on using Fluence as a funding source.', 'Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert', ""We don't comment on that, quite frankly. And Fluence has its call later on in the week. So -- or next week. So no, we can't give any further color on that. Thank you."", 'Operator', ""With that, I'll hand back to Susan Harcourt."", 'Susan Pasley Keppelman Harcourt', ""All right. We thank everybody for joining us on today's call. As always, the IR team will be available to answer any follow-up questions you may have. Thank you, and have a nice day."", 'Operator', ""Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call.

The average surprise for the last two quarters was 10.34%.', 'For the most recent quarter, Ross Stores was expected to post earnings of $1.63 per share, but it reported $1.82 per share instead, representing a surprise of 11.66%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $1.22 per share, while it actually produced $1.33 per share, a surprise of 9.02%.', 'Price and EPS Surprise', ""For Ross Stores, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank."", 'Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.', 'The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.', ""Ross Stores currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.34%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner."", 'Investors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.', 'Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.', ""Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

Emerging from the dotcom boom and bust without permanent damage, the economy has faced the financial meltdown of 2008, a tech-enabled boom that has resulted in trillion dollar valuations, and the pandemic crisis of 2020 that ground business to almost a complete halt across the globe. From 2003 to 2023, the benchmark S&P 500 has registered double digits annual returns thirteen times.', 'Investors at the stock market have made money from this growth by piling into profitable stocks like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Apple Inc.

Value investors who like to invest in profitable companies with high gross margins and net income have made shrewd investments in businesses with a solid track record over these twenty years. For example instead of NVDA, we identified the cheapest AI stock that is trading at less than 5 times market value excluding cash and investments using the value investing approach.', 'The present condition of the stock market is better understood in the context of a recent research report by investment advisory Deutsche Bank. The report underlines that the seven biggest companies in the S&P 500 now have a combined market capitalization that make these firms the second biggest stock market in the world, almost double the size of the Japanese market that is in fourth position. Jim Reid, the head of global economics and thematic research at the advisory, has warned that this makes the US market most concentrated in history.\xa0', 'The fortunes of these firms are set to rise even further as AI hype and rate cut expectations serve to increase interest in growth stocks. Businesses are investing heavily in AI tools to keep pace with industry demand in this regard. Satya Nadella, the CEO of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), recently highlighted the role that he expected AI to play in changing work trends in the coming years and months. He made these comments during the second quarter earnings call at the end of January.\xa0', ""“A growing body of evidence makes clear the role AI will play in transforming work. Our own research, as well as external studies, show as much as 70% improvement in productivity, using generative AI for specific work tasks, and overall early Copilot for Microsoft 365 users were 29% faster in the series of tasks, like searching, writing, and summarizing. Two months in, we have seen faster adoption than either our E3 or E5 suites as enterprises, like Dentsu, Honda, Pfizer, all deploy Copilot to their employees, and we are expanding availability to organizations of all sizes. We're also seeing a Copilot ecosystem begin to emerge ISVs like Atlassian, Mural, and Trello, as well as customers like Air India, Bayer, and Siemens have all built plug-ins for specific lines of business that extend Copilot's capabilities.”"", 'Our Methodology', 'To select stocks for this list, we used the FinViz stock screener to identify companies with high gross margins and net income.

However, several years ago, we felt that segments of the industry had developed strong enough moats to merit investment under the right conditions. We made one investment (Analog Devices, Inc.

Our view on the cycle risk was simple – the long-term growth outlook was tremendous given the proliferation of electronics and software in everyday objects, and the downturn had already begun, and a healthy amount of it was known. We ignored the near-term outlook for profits, assuming they would be down substantially. It turned out that the downturn was more severe than most other investors or industry observers had forecasted. Thus, semiconductor stocks in general remain depressed, and our investments have so far shown mixed results.', 'However, we have not changed our view on the long-term attractiveness of the industry segments in which they operate, nor on the normalized earning power of these companies five to ten years out.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Kirk Andrews, Director of Financial Planning and Analysis for Shentel."", 'Kirk Andrews', ""Good morning, and thank you for joining us. The purpose of today's call is to review Shentel's results for the first-quarter 2024. Our results were announced in a press release distributed this morning, and the presentation we'll be reviewing is included on the Investor page at our website, www.shentel.com. Please note that an audio replay of this call will be made available later today. The details are set forth in the press release announcing this call. With us on the call today are Chris French, President and Chief Executive Officer; Ed McKay, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Jim Volk, Senior Vice President of Finance and CFO. After our prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As always, let me refer you to slide 2 of the presentation, which contains our Safe Harbor disclaimer to remind you that this conference call may include forward-looking statements subject to certain risks and uncertainties.

You're cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. And with that, I will now turn the call over to Chris. Go ahead, Chris."", 'Christopher French', ""Thanks, Kirk. We appreciate everyone joining this morning, and I hope everyone is well, I will start the call with an update on the recent transactions and our strategy executio. As listed on slide 4, we announced and closed on the sale of our towers during the first quarter. The $310 million sales price represents a multiple of approximately 31 times 2023 tower segment adjusted EBITDA when considering the expected T-Mobil revenue churn we had previously disclosed. We're very pleased with the sale price especially when considering the publicly traded tower companies are trading at multiples in the high teens. This transaction is a good example of the market value of our assets and businesses exceeding the implied value within our stock price. We also closed on $356 million in new financings on April first, including $275 million in incremental credit facility capacity and $81 million in preferred equity. We had strong interest from both lenders and financial sponsors during the financing processes, which reflects well on our track record, management team, and fiber-first strategy. These financings will provide growth capital to continue to invest into new Glo Fiber expansion markets. On April 1, we closed on the acquisition of Horizon Telecom for $385 million which included issuing $4.1 million common shares to a selling shareholder of Horizon. Horizon's fiber-rich network will open up new Glo Fiber expansion markets in Ohio, while doubling the size of our commercial fiber business. We recently announced our plans to expand the Glo Fiber network to Greenfield, Hillsboro, Jackson, Johnstown, and Zanesville, Ohio. We're excited to welcome our new Ohio colleagues to Shentel, and I'm pleased to report that Glenn Lytle has joined the senior management team to lead commercial sales for the combined company. Glenn brings over 25 years of commercial fiber sales experience, including the last five years, successfully growing the Horizon commercial fiber business. I'll now turn to slide 5 to give an update on our strategy execution and our Horizon integration efforts. Although we've only owned horizon for about five weeks, we are off to a fast start with our integration efforts. We announced a brand change from Horizon to Glo Fiber in mid April and implemented a new Glo Fiber rate card in Ohio. Similar to the plans we used in the mid-Atlantic states, we focus on easy, straightforward pricing with no long-term contracts. We expect the new rate card will enhance customer additions and reduce churn. We also identified another $1 million in annual run rate expense synergy savings, increasing our target to $10.6 million. We began to implement plans to achieve these synergies in April, realizing about $4.8 million annualized or about 45% of our target as we enter May. We expect to complete the integration and realize the full energy savings target by the end of the first half of 2025. In parallel with our sale, acquisition, and financing activities. We reported a strong quarter of operating results in our mid-Atlantic markets. We added 5,000 Glo Fiber customers, setting a new quarterly record. We also constructed and released the sales almost 26,000 new Glo Fiber passings. With a 260,000 passings constructed in the mid-Atlantic markets and 15,000 passings acquired as part of the Horizon merger, we now have 275,000 Glo Fiber expansion market passings or 46% of our year-end 2026 target of 600,000. Moving to slide 6. We now have over 15,000 route miles in our super regional fiber network, spanning seven adjacent states. The combination with Horizon has been well received by our commercial customers. We now have 25 Glo Fiber markets as reflected on slide 7. We have started engineering, permitting, and/or construction in another eight markets including the five new markets in Ohio. With the Horizon acquisition closed and most of the underwriting of new markets complete, we have good visibility into the future state of our Glo Fiber network and markets. The next 32 months will be focused on execution of our build and sales plan. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Jim to review the details of our financial results."", 'James Volk', ""Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Before I provide commentary on our financial results, please note that we have altered our financial reporting triggered by the plan to sell our tower portfolio in the first quarter. The tower segment is now reported under discontinued operations in our statement of comprehensive income and statement of cash flow. The tower assets were recorded as held for sale on our balance sheet. These changes are reflected for the current and prior periods in our earnings release and Form 10-K. Under the new organizational and reporting structure, the company has one reportable segment in continuing operations from the quarter. And now moving to slide 9 for our financial results for the first quarter. Revenue grew 3.1% to $69.3 million in the first quarter 2024, driven by continued strong residential and SMB revenue growth of $4.7 million or 9.1%, partially offset by the expected decline of $2.3 million or 19.8% in commercial revenue. The residential SMB revenue increase was driven by growth in Glo Fiber markets revenue of 73.1% due to a 62.3% increase in broadband data RGUs and a 9.7% increase in data market. Commercial revenue declined due to the expected decline in T-Mobile revenue as reported throughout 2023, T-Mobile disconnected backhaul circuits as part of the decommissioning of the former Sprint network. The revenue decline reflects a full period of these disconnects and a significant reduction in related early termination fees. We still expect about $7 million in lower T-Mobile revenue in 2024 and for the commercial revenue to return to mid to high single digit growth rate starting in 2025. As previously disclosed, adjusted EBITDA of $19.3 million was relatively flat flat in the first quarter as compared to the first quarter of 2023. Revenue growth was offset by higher expenses associated with expanding our Glo Fiber line of business higher programming fees for our video products and bad debt to the general macro economic conditions. I'd now like to update you on our liquidity position following the horizon and related financing transactions, which we closed on April first, as reflected on slide 10, we raised $81 million of new preferred equity financing and used the proceeds along with cash on hand primarily from the tower sale to complete the acquisition of Horizon telcom. In summary, we traded a slow growth infrastructure asset for a digital fiber asset with higher growth potential, which fits nicely with our fiber first strategy. Our pro forma liquidity position on April first is 484 million, including about 110 million in cash, 225 million in available delayed-draw term loans and $150 million in available revolver capacity. We are well positioned to fund our business plan to grow our book fiber expansion market getting to 600,000 by the end of 2026. Moving to Slide 11. Our pro forma outstanding net debt as of April first is $190 million on a similar note, after adjusting fully diluted common shares of 51 million for the additional 4.1 million common shares issued to a rollover shareholder of Verizon as part of the acquisition and the ADS converted equivalent common shares of the perfect preferred equity pro forma April first, fully diluted common shares are now 58.4 million. As a reminder, the exchange price for converting the preferred equity into common shares is $24.50. Before turning the call over to Ed, I will provide our expectations for 2020 for Horizon financial contributions and some key operating metrics on Slide 12, we expect Verizon to generate 50 to 54 million in revenue and 12 to $16 million in adjusted EBITDA for the nine months of April to December 2020 for capital expenditures for the nine months ownership period in 2024 are expected to range from 30 to 39 million. Most of the current commercial fiber CapEx is success-based relating to installing service for a portion of the 609,000 contracted monthly recurring revenue backlog. As Chris noted earlier, we announced five new Glo Fiber expansion markets in Ohio. The Glo Fiber CapEx in Ohio will be a combination of engine initial engineering and permitting for these new markets, constructing a few thousand more patents in existing Ohio markets in success based CapEx to connect customers. Horizon currently is 15,000 homes and businesses with fiber in three greenfield markets and 14,000 passings in the RLS market. And now I'll turn the call over to Ed."", 'Edward McKay', ""Thank you, Jim, and good morning. I'll start on Slide 14 with an update on our fiber construction metrics. In the first quarter, we continued the growth of our predominantly fiber network, ending the quarter with 55% of our total broadband passings served by state-of-the-art 10 gig SGXGS. upon fiber to the home networks. We added over 26,000 new fiber passings in the first quarter and our construction pace was 47% faster than the first quarter of 2023. We are very pleased with the progress toward our goal of over 100,000 additional fiber passings in 2024, we now have approximately 260,000 Glo Fiber passings and our total number of approved Glo Fiber passings reached 565,000 at the end of the first quarter, combined with 15,000 existing greenfield fiber passings in former Horizon markets. And our recently announced expansion to 40,000 additional homes in Ohio we now have enough passive in our construction pipeline to reach our goal of 600,000 total Glo Fiber passings by 2026. In addition, we plan to construct approximately 23,000 fiber passings as part of government grant projects and 3,500 were complete at the end of the first quarter as we continue to ramp up Glo Fiber construction. We had a record quarter for customer growth, as shown on Slide 15. We added over 5,000 new Glo Fiber customers in the first quarter and reached a total of almost 47,000, up 62% year over year. A total number of data, video and voice revenue generating units has reached approximately 57,000, up 56% year over year. Our sales team continued to outpace our construction team, and we grew broadband data penetration from 17.4% a year ago to 18% at the end of the first quarter, while adding almost 95,000 new passings during the same period, our broadband data average revenue per user increased almost 10% year over year due to a combination of rate adjustments, additional equipment revenue and customers selecting higher-speed tiers. For the quarter, 50% of our new residential subscribers adopted speed tiers of one gig or higher including approximately 3% that took speeds of two gig or higher. We continue to focus on providing the fastest speeds most reliable network and outstanding local customer service and our churn remained extremely low at 0.86% for the quarter. On slide 60, we highlight our data penetration rates as our markets mature and our continuing progress, increasing penetration rates across all our cohorts. 1st year after launch of the Glo Fiber market, we typically see penetration rates over 18%. And after three years, data penetration rates typically exceed 30% Ultimately, we expect to reach average terminal penetration rates of about 38%, five to six years after launching service in a new area. Our most mature neighborhoods lost in late 2019. I've already exceeded this goal. Let's shift to our first quarter operating results for our cable markets on slide 17. Broadband data subscribers decreased slightly year over year to 109,000 and broadband data churn increased to 1.67%, driven primarily by competition from cable and fiber overbuilders in some markets. Our data penetration decreased to 50.3%, driven by the decrease in subscribers and the addition of over 4,000 passings in the past year, primarily in government subsidized areas by total revenue generating units decreased by about 4.5% year over year as we continued to see declines in video service and residential voice service due to cord-cutting. Competition has increased, but unlike some of our larger cable peers. Our markets are predominantly rural with a cable or fiber competitor offering service to less than 20% of our passings. Despite competitive pressure in portions of some markets. Broadband data RPU increased by 2.4% year over year to $85, offsetting most of the decrease in revenue from fewer RGUs. I'll also add that we believe Shentel has limited exposure to the ACP. program relative to some of our larger cable peers, less than 4% of our total broadband data customers subscribed to a CP. supported plans, and over 75% of them were customers prior to enrolling in the ACP program. Moving to slide 18, we highlight our broadband commercial fiber business in the first quarter, we booked new sales totaling 110,000 in monthly revenue, up almost 4% year over year. Our new installed monthly revenue for the first quarter was 66,000, and we finished the quarter with an installation backlog of approximately 165,000 in monthly revenue. We expect the majority of this backlog to be installed in the second quarter. Monthly churn in compression decreased significantly year over year to 1% for the first quarter of 2020. For T-Mobile has now completed the vast majority of backhaul disconnects associated with the Sprint network rationalization. As Jim mentioned, the Although these disconnects will temporarily slow revenue and earnings growth in 2024, we expect our commercial fiber business to return to historical growth rates in 2025 and beyond. Our 2023 capital spending and guidance or for 2024 are reflected on Slide 19. Total capital investments for the first quarter totaled 70 million, roughly in line with our capital spending in the first quarter of 2023. Our Glo Fiber and government subsidized investments were on plan for the first quarter, and we are on pace to finish 2024 within our previous guidance range of 260 to 290 million. Thank you very much. And operator, we're now ready for questions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Hamed Khorsand, BWS Financial.', 'Hamed Khorsand', ""So first of all, I just want to ask you about the ads you had it with Glo Fiber. Is that a method of just being more markets or is that because you're gaining momentum with the markets you've already been established."", 'Edward McKay', ""So it's a combination of both there. Not only do we have additional new passes as we ramp up construction, but we're continuing to grow our penetration rates in those more mature motors. So it's definitely a combination of the two, and we accelerated our net adds year over year as well."", 'Hamed Khorsand', ""And do these customers that you're adding, do they have a prior broadband service provider or are they brand-new to the service?"", 'Edward McKay', 'I would say the majority of our ads are switching from one of the big cable providers.', 'Hamed Khorsand', ""And lastly, with with Verizon, with the revenue that they're generating, is there any growth possibilities this year? Are you more looking at as to a 25 potential?"", 'James Volk', ""Yes, I think I can jump in here and that the revenue is has grown. Yes, low single digit rents the last two years, they have a very sizable backlog as we noted on the slide, they have 600, $9,000 of monthly revenue under contracted sales contracts that are awaiting installation. We're trying to accelerate that, that that installation pace. It's going a little slower than what we had expected so far but up. But our new leadership team is involved there and we expect that we will we'll pick up as a couple of quarters past, and we should see some meaningful improvements by the time we get into 2025."", 'Edward McKay', 'Okay.', 'James Volk', 'Thank you, Maury. Thanks on that.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. And this concludes the Q&A session for today. I will pass it back to Jim Volk for final comments.', 'James Volk', 'Yes. Thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. We look forward to updating you on our progress on our fiber first strategy and the Horizon integration in future periods. Have a great day. Thank you.', 'Operator', 'And this concludes our conference. You may now disconnect.']"

(NYSE:VZ) recently. Shareholders can take the chance to hold the board and management accountable for the unsatisfactory performance at the next AGM on 9th of May. This will be also be a chance where they can challenge the board on company direction and vote on resolutions such as executive remuneration. We present the case why we think CEO compensation is out of sync with company performance.', ' Check out our latest analysis for Verizon Communications ', ""According to our data, Verizon Communications Inc. has a market capitalization of US$165b, and paid its CEO total annual compensation worth US$24m over the year to December 2023. That's a notable increase of 22% on last year. We think total compensation is more important but our data shows that the CEO salary is lower, at US$1.5m."", 'On comparing similar companies in the American Telecom industry with market capitalizations above US$8.0b, we found that the median total CEO compensation was US$2.9m. Accordingly, our analysis reveals that Verizon Communications Inc. pays Hans Vestberg north of the industry median. Moreover, Hans Vestberg also holds US$19m worth of Verizon Communications stock directly under their own name, which reveals to us that they have a significant personal stake in the company.', 'Component', '2023', '2022', 'Proportion (2023)', 'Salary', 'US$1.5m', 'US$1.5m', '6%', 'Other', 'US$23m', 'US$18m', '94%', 'Total Compensation', 'US$24m', 'US$20m', '100%', ""On an industry level, roughly 19% of total compensation represents salary and 81% is other remuneration. In Verizon Communications' case, non-salary compensation represents a greater slice of total remuneration, in comparison to the broader industry. If non-salary compensation dominates total pay, it's an indicator that the executive's salary is tied to company performance."", 'Verizon Communications Inc. has reduced its earnings per share by 16% a year over the last three years. In the last year, its revenue is down 1.6%.', ""Few shareholders would be pleased to read that EPS have declined. This is compounded by the fact revenue is actually down on last year. These factors suggest that the business performance wouldn't really justify a high pay packet for the CEO. Historical performance can sometimes be a good indicator on what's coming up next but if you want to peer into the company's future you might be interested in this free visualization of analyst forecasts."", 'With a three year total loss of 21% for the shareholders, Verizon Communications Inc. would certainly have some dissatisfied shareholders. Therefore, it might be upsetting for shareholders if the CEO were paid generously.', ""Along with the business performing poorly, shareholders have suffered with poor share price returns on their investments, suggesting that there's little to no chance of them being in favor of a CEO pay raise. At the upcoming AGM, management will get a chance to explain how they plan to get the business back on track and address the concerns from investors."", ""CEO compensation is a crucial aspect to keep your eyes on but investors also need to keep their eyes open for other issues related to business performance.

Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.\xa0 isn’t one of the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds at the end of the third quarter (see the details here).', ""Operator: Welcome to the First Quarter 2024 Stanley Black & Decker Earnings Conference Call. My name is Shannon, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Dennis Lange. Mr. Lange, you may begin."", ""Dennis Lange: Thank you, Shannon. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's 2024 first quarter webcast. Here today, in addition to myself, is Don Allan, President and CEO; Chris Nelson, COO, EVP and President of Tools & Outdoor; and Pat Hallinan, EVP and CFO. Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and a supplemental presentation, which we will refer to, are available on the IR section of our website. A replay of this morning's webcast will also be available beginning at 11 AM today. This morning, Don, Chris and Pat will review our 2024 first quarter results and various other matters followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with prior webcast, we are going to be sticking with just one question per caller."", ""And as we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call based on our current views. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate, and as such, they involve risk and uncertainty. It's, therefore, possible that the actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we might make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent 34 Act filing. I'll now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Don Allan."", ""Don Allan: Thank you, Dennis, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter performance was the result of consistent solid execution, and we are making progress against key operational objectives. We continue to see significant value creation opportunities tied to our strategic business transformation and the entire company is focused on the disciplined execution of this strategy. We are encouraged by the momentum that is building across the organization. Two of our primary areas of emphasis are free cash flow generation and gross margin expansion. We are focused on what is within our control and are pleased with the momentum behind our gross margin. This is particularly notable considering a significantly worse negative macro environment and corresponding revenue performance in 2023 and '24 versus our initial expectations at the outset of our transformation in mid-2022."", ""Our global cost reduction program remains on track for expected run rate savings of $1.5 billion by the end of 2024 and $2 billion by the end of 2025. As we hit the halfway point of our journey, our decisive actions are delivering quantifiable results. Specifically, we have captured 1.2 billion of run rate savings program to date. We remain confident this will support 30% gross margins in 2024, consistent with our guidance. We are encouraged that approximately 80% of the company's revenue is expected to carry 2024 adjusted gross margins in excess of 30% and exit this year at or ahead of initial expectations. We believe these product lines will continue to improve upon their current adjusted gross margin profile over the next 18 to 24 months."", 'As it relates to the rest of the portfolio or that 20%, which is predominantly our cyclically depressed outdoor business and the rapidly recovering aerospace fastener business. We are actioning significant cost efficiencies to make necessary improvements to the profitability of outdoor in response to the current market demand and refining the aerospace fastener product line cost base to drive significant growth leverage as widebody plane production continues to recover. Our long-term success will be driven by improved profitability, coupled with consistent market share gains. We believe our share position in tools is now stable to increasing. For example, our 2023 point-of-sale data in tools performed better than the category average across the North American home centers, which was led by our iconic DEWALT Professional brand.', ""We are also serving our customers better by delivering improved fill rates, earning the right for more activity across our brands. Retailers are recognizing this performance. For 2023, ACE Hardware named Craftsman as Vendor of the Year and Grainger recognized Stanley Black & Decker with their partners and Performance Award. Congratulations to our organization. This is a testament to the team's efforts and as we work to get closer to our partners, it's an early indication that we are on the right track. As we report our first quarter performance, we are energized by how our transformation efforts are taking root. I am confident that by executing our strategy, we are positioning the company to deliver high levels of organic revenue growth, profitability and cash flow to drive strong long-term shareholder return."", 'Turning to the first quarter results. Our top line showed signs of stabilization with organic revenues down 1 point. Excluding the now divested infrastructure business, organic revenue was flat as Engineered Fastening and DEWALT growth was offset by muted consumer and DIY demand. Adjusted gross margin was 29%, up 590 basis points versus the first quarter of last year and 30 basis points above the second half of 2023. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.56. Adjusted gross margin expansion and EPS growth were both supported by lower inventory destocking costs, supply chain transformation benefits and reduced shipping costs. We are reiterating our 2024 full year adjusted diluted EPS guidance range of $3.50, up to $4.50 as well as our expected free cash flow of $600 million to $800 million.', 'Pat will provide more color on this later in our presentation. On April 1, we completed the sale of STANLEY Infrastructure to Epiroc. We have already deployed net proceeds from the transaction to reduce short-term debt, demonstrating our commitment to further strengthening our balance sheet. Looking forward in 2024, we expect mixed demand trends to persist across our businesses and we are driving supply chain cost improvements to expand margins, deliver earnings growth and generate strong cash flow. At the same time, we are funding investments designed to fuel targeted long-term growth and market share gains across our businesses. I want to thank our team members around the world for their contributions to the progress that we have made on our transformation journey and for their energy and focus as we continue to charge forward.', 'I will now pass it to Chris Nelson to review the business segment performance.', 'Chris Nelson: Thank you, Don, and good morning, everyone. Beginning with Tools & Outdoor, first quarter revenue was approximately $3.3 billion, down 1% organically versus prior year as growth in DEWALT was more than offset by muted consumer and DIY demand, which pressured volume. Pricing was relatively flat, consistent with our expectations. Adjusted segment margin was 8.5% in the first quarter, a 550 basis point improvement compared to the first quarter of 2023. This was achieved through lower inventory destocking costs, supply chain transformation savings and shipping cost reductions, which were partially offset with targeted investments designed to accelerate share gain and organic growth. Now turning to the product lines.', 'Power tools was up 1 point organically led by pro-driven growth in DEWALT and international sales. We are also seeing benefits from a return to historic promotional levels on high margin DEWALT cordless. Organic revenue for hand tools declined 7% pressured by lower DIY demand. Outdoor product line organic revenue grew 2% in the quarter, driven by strong demand for handheld cordless outdoor power equipment and incremental retail product listings. We are encouraged by U.S. retail point-of-sale data, which showed an early start to the season versus prior year. We are cautiously optimistic that demand can be better than the last two years. Our visibility will improve as we move through the second quarter and hit key U.S. holidays. The independent dealer channel continues to work through significant on-hand inventory, which pressured shipments in the quarter.', 'We are monitoring POS trends in this channel and currently expect that they can clear their inventory during the 2024 season to set up a stronger 2025. As Don alluded earlier, the outdoor market remains soft versus 2019 volume levels. We are not standing still and are moving with speed to improve profitability by continuing to optimize our cost structure. Consistent with our overall strategy, our intent is to focus resources towards capturing targeted share gain opportunities in the most profitable and attractive growth segments, such as electric handheld outdoor power equipment. Turning to Tools & Outdoor performance by region. North America was down 2% organically, driven by factors consistent with the overall segment. In Europe, organic revenue was down 3% as declines in France and Germany were partially offset by growth in the Nordics and the UK.', 'We are making targeted investments in the region to expand professional product offerings and activate these innovations in the market to capture share. In aggregate, all other regions were up 7% organically in the quarter, driven by mid-teens growth in Latin America, Brazil, Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean led this performance for the quarter. In summary, for Tools & Outdoor, we are acutely focused on successfully winning with our customers and winning with the Pro, while making profitability improvements. We are navigating mixed market conditions with the goal to capitalize on the areas of strength. We are making deliberate investments in our brands, market activation and innovation to capture the growth and margin opportunities that will contribute to the long-term shareholder returns.', 'I will now discuss our Industrial segment performance. First quarter industrial revenue declined 5% versus last year. Price realization of 1% across the segment and engineered passing volume growth was more than offset by infrastructure volume declines and a point of currency pressure. Within the Industrial segment, Engineered Fastening organic revenue growth of 5% includes aerospace growth of 30% and auto growth of 4%. We believe we are outpacing customer production levels as a result of targeted share gains, particularly in EV automotive. This growth was partially offset by market softness in general industrial fastening. Industrials adjusted segment margin was 12.1%, an improvement of 110 basis points versus prior year, driven by price realization and cost actions taken to improve productivity.', ""This was a strong performance considering the infrastructure volume decline that the team faced. The quarter was a result of focused execution by our Industrial business associates. On behalf of the entire leadership team, I'd like to thank our colleagues around the world for delivering another solid quarter of results and a strong start to the year. Now turning to the next slide. I would like to now highlight a few of our recent DEWALT product introductions, which are the results of our investments in innovation. The new DEWALT 20-volt MAX XR cordless framing nailer is engineered for enhanced productivity and performs applications that are traditionally served by pneumatic tools. It is designed to allow the end user to sync framing nails consistently sub flush into LVL material and when used in rapid sequential mode, ramp-up time is eliminated between shots."", ""DEWALT is also introducing the world's first 20-volt MAX cordless 2-1/4 Peak horsepower dedicated plunge router. It provides power like a corded midsized router with the convenience of a cordless tool a prime example of how we continue to help our Pro users transition to a cordless job site. Additionally, our TOUGHSYSTEM 2.0 DXL workstation is the industry's first portable storage solution with a 30-inch platform that helps PROs maximize their productivity. This all-in-one workstation delivers customizable mobile storage and a functional work top that is unlike anything else currently available for commercial construction job sites. These are just a few examples of how we continue driving our innovation engine in a manner that is centered on the professional with the intent of making our users more productive."", ""We believe these innovations, coupled with our investments in brand and market activation will stimulate share gains. As we celebrate the DEWALT 100-year anniversary, we also reflect on our responsibility and commitment to serving the trades people around the world with brands like DEWALT, Craftsman and STANLEY. Thank you, and I'll now pass the call over to Pat Hallinan."", ""Pat Hallinan: Thanks, Chris, and good morning. Turning to the next slide. I would like to highlight the progress we've made along our transformation journey in the first quarter. We achieved approximately 145 million pre-tax run rate cost savings in the period, bringing our aggregate savings to approximately 1.2 billion since program inception. As we focus our portfolio, streamline our business structure and transform our operations, our teams are actively identifying and prioritizing opportunities to further optimize our cost structure. Given the dynamic macro environment, we continue to refine and mobilize plans to deliver targeted savings. We are confident in our ability to execute those plans. We continue to target $1.5 billion of pre-tax run rate savings by the end of 2024 and $2 billion pre-tax run rate cost savings by the end of 2025."", 'Strategic sourcing remains the largest contributor to our transformation savings to date. We are leveraging savings on the $5 billion of addressable spend across areas such as materials and components, finished goods and indirect expenditures. Our operations excellence program, which leverages lean manufacturing principles is driving productivity improvements. The scope of this work stream improves efficiency and effectiveness within our production and distribution facilities. A pipeline of projects is robust with initiatives lined up to deliver efficiency gains in 2024 and beyond. Footprint-related projects and product platforming, which are more event-driven, will become increasingly important throughout the remainder of our transformation.', 'We are optimizing our distribution footprint as well as redesigning our manufacturing network to leverage centers of excellence and to optimize our operations. This multiyear endeavor is accelerating in 2024 as we plan to exit or transform a number of facilities across the globe during 2024 and 2025. And -- the manufacturing sites we previously announced for closure have ceased production and we expect to exit these sites in the near future. We continue to execute manufacturing footprint changes during the first quarter, which affected five sites with the goal to complete the site modifications this year. Regarding product platforming, this initiative will unlock value by reducing complexity across our value chain. This savings initiative identifies various parts and components that can be standardized across a product family, which eliminates complexity and improves procurement scale.', ""In aggregate, our supply chain transformation initiatives are expected to generate approximately $0.5 billion of savings in 2024, improving margins and generating resources for additional growth investments in our core business. We remain confident that our transformation can support the sustainable cost structure and efficiency needed to return our adjusted gross margin to 35% or greater while enabling targeted growth investments. Moving to the next slide. We continue prioritizing free cash flow generation and gross margin expansion to support long-term growth and value creation. First quarter free cash outflow was in line with typical historical trends due to seasonal account receivable increases. This quarter, our inventory control contained the working capital build to approximately 360 million, where we've traditionally averaged a roughly 700 million increase in the first quarter of the year."", 'Days of inventory is now approximately 150 days, an improvement of 10 days versus the prior year and moving toward our long-term target of approximately 120 to 130 days. We used the net proceeds from the infrastructure sale to reduce our commercial paper balance in the beginning of the second quarter. Because this occurred subsequent to the first quarter close, it is not reflected in the first quarter balance sheet. We remain focused on working capital optimization and profitability improvement to generate strong free cash flow in 2024. For the full year 2024, we plan to reduce inventory by $400 million to $500 million as we continue prioritizing working capital efficiency. CapEX is expected to range between $400 million to $500 million, which includes support for the footprint-related transformation initiatives.', 'These items, combined with organic cash generation, support our full year free cash flow range of $600 million to $800 million, which is unchanged from our guidance communicated earlier in the year. Our capital deployment priorities remain consistent, investing in organic growth and our transformation, funding our long-standing commitment to return value to shareholders through cash dividends and further strengthening our balance sheet. Turning to profitability. Adjusted gross margin of 29% in the first quarter improved 590 basis points versus prior year, driven by lower inventory destocking costs, supply chain transformation benefits and lower shipping costs. We expect to increase adjusted gross margin sequentially in each half of 2024, and we are planning for total company adjusted gross margin to approximate 30% for the full year.', ""We continue to expect to exit the year at an adjusted gross margin rate in the low 30s. We are off to a solid start in 2024 and the hard work we've done to make adjusted gross margin progress allows us to fund incremental investments to accelerate long-term organic revenue growth. Now turning to the 2024 guidance and the remaining key assumptions. In addition to the free cash flow guidance I just covered, we are reiterating GAAP earnings per share range of $1.60 to $2.85 and an adjusted earnings per share range of $3.50 to $4.50. We are maintaining the range of organic revenue assumptions to be plus or minus low single digits. We believe the most likely outcome for organic revenue is to be flat to down 1%. At this level, we expect to achieve the midpoint of our adjusted EPS range through cost controls."", ""Our view incorporates modest headwinds in aggregate for our markets, and we remain focused on gaining share in this environment. We are maintaining a disciplined approach to cost management and remain committed to funding investments for long-term organic growth. Turning to the segments. Tools & Outdoor organic revenue is expected to be plus or minus low single digits, most likely below flat consistent with the total company. The Industrial segment organic revenue is expected to be relatively flat to slightly positive. Infrastructure's first quarter decline will impact the segment's full year organic growth. And now that the deal is closed, we will report the divestiture revenue impact quarterly. Our planning assumption for growth investments is approximately an incremental $100 million in 2024."", 'These are designed to accelerate innovation, market activation and to support our powerful DEWALT, Craftsman and Stanley brands. This should result in 2024 SG&A as a percentage of sales in the mid-21% zone for the full year. We will remain agile with the pace of investments should the demand outlook swing in or out of our favor. Turning to profitability. We expect total company adjusted EBITDA margin to approximate 10% for the full year, supported by the benefits of the transformation program. Segment margin in Tools & Outdoor is planned to be up year-over-year, also driven by continued momentum from our ongoing strategic transformation. The Industrial segment margin is expected to be flat to slightly positive versus prior year as operating improvement in Engineered Fastening is offset by the dilution from the infrastructure business divestiture.', 'Our adjusted EPS range remains $1, with variability in market demand being the largest contributor, we will work to optimize adjusted gross margin and manage SG&A thoughtfully throughout the year to balance the macro uncertainty while working hard to preserve investments to position the business for longer-term growth. Turning to other elements of guidance. GAAP earnings include pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments ranging from $290 million to $340 million, largely relating to the supply chain transformation program with approximately 25% of these expenses being noncash footprint rationalization costs. Our adjusted tax rate is expected to be 10% for 2024, with the second and third quarters in the low 30s. Discrete tax planning items are expected to reduce the full year rate and primarily impact the fourth quarter.', 'Other 2024 guidance assumptions at the midpoint are noted on the slide to assist with modeling. We expect the second quarter adjusted earnings per share to be approximately 21% to 22% of the full year at the midpoint. Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter as a percentage of the full year is expected to exceed 25%, with EPS contribution lower due to the quarterly tax profile. In summary, we continue to make progress on our transformation journey with an unwavering focus on gross margin expansion, cash generation, balance sheet strength and share gains in a soft market. We are confident that successful execution of our strategy can position the company for long-term growth and value creation. With that, I will now pass the call back to Don.', 'Don Allan: Thank you, Pat. As we report another quarter of progress, our consistent execution against our plan is building momentum and energizing our team. As our profitability continues to improve, we are focusing organic growth investments behind our most powerful brands, particularly DEWALT, Craftsman and Stanley. We believe these investments can enable organic growth to outpace the market by 2x to 3x. Stanley Black & Decker continues to become a more streamlined business, built on the strength of our people and culture with an intensified emphasis on our core market leadership positions in Tools and Outdoor and Engineered Fastening. We are focused on consistent execution, while positioning the company to deliver higher levels of sustainable organic revenue growth, profitability and cash flow to drive strong long-term shareholder returns. With that, we are now ready for Q&A, Dennis.', 'Dennis Lange: Great. Thanks, Don. Shannon, we can now start the Q&A, please.

The billionaire investor built his fortune in a fund he founded in 1981, Duquesne Capital Management. Although he closed that fund in 2010, he maintains about $3.4 billion in assets through his Duquesne Family Office LLC.', ""Druckenmiller's top holdings, as shown in the 13-F filing for the fourth quarter of 2023, appear to reflect an interest in leading companies in cutting-edge industries and technologies. Let's review three of them."", ""Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is Druckenmiller's largest investment, accounting for just over 16% of his portfolio. As the leading producer of AI-enabled chips, it has achieved triple-digit revenue growth in recent quarters as companies scramble to buy the needed hardware to capitalize on the AI revolution."", ""Estimates on the degree of Nvidia's dominance vary, though most analysts agree that it controls at least 80% of the AI chip market."", 'Moreover, Nvidia has responded to AI chip competitors by releasing Blackwell. This combines six accelerated computing technologies into one product, offering similar functionality at 25 times less cost and energy consumption than its previous AI chip release.', 'Investors may also notice how Druckenmiller structures his Nvidia investment into two holdings. One is Nvidia stock, which is 9% of the overall portfolio.', ""However, Duquesne invested an additional 7% of the portfolio in Nvidia call options. These are highly leveraged investment products. Since they have an expiration date and can easily fall to $0, they are unsuitable for most investors. Also, the size of that investment may change significantly when the next 13-F release in May shows Druckenmiller's first-quarter 2024 holdings."", 'Nonetheless, the aggressiveness of that options investment implies a strong belief that Nvidia will rise significantly in the near term. That additional factor that could help persuade some investors to add Nvidia shares.', ""Duquesne bought Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) stock in the first quarter of 2014, around the time Satya Nadella became CEO. Although the fund was in and out of the stock over the years, the apparent bet on Nadella's leadership has paid off handsomely for Druckenmiller.

That means many companies -- and those who invest in them -- may benefit.', ""On top of this, AI is generating excitement because it offers concrete examples of how it could save companies time and money. For example, it can streamline processes or help a pharmaceutical company develop drugs more quickly. So, it's easy to understand the importance of this technology.

Value investors who like to invest in profitable companies with high gross margins and net income have made shrewd investments in businesses with a solid track record over these twenty years. For example instead of NVDA, we identified the cheapest AI stock that is trading at less than 5 times market value excluding cash and investments using the value investing approach.', 'The present condition of the stock market is better understood in the context of a recent research report by investment advisory Deutsche Bank.

Our own research, as well as external studies, show as much as 70% improvement in productivity, using generative AI for specific work tasks, and overall early Copilot for Microsoft 365 users were 29% faster in the series of tasks, like searching, writing, and summarizing. Two months in, we have seen faster adoption than either our E3 or E5 suites as enterprises, like Dentsu, Honda, Pfizer, all deploy Copilot to their employees, and we are expanding availability to organizations of all sizes.

Let's find out."", ""Allied Market Research estimates that the global AI chip market was worth just under $15 billion in 2022. However, by 2032, the market research firm expects sales of AI chips to generate annual revenue of nearly $384 billion. Nvidia is in the driver's seat in this space, controlling an estimated 94% of the AI chip market last year, per Vijay Rakesh of Mizuho Securities."", ""Nvidia's first-mover advantage in AI chips has paid off handsomely for the company. Its graphics cards have been extremely popular and deployed by major cloud computing providers and start-ups to train AI models, including ChatGPT. As a result, Nvidia's data center revenue has been growing at a stunning rate. In fiscal 2024, which ended on Jan. 28, 2024, the company reported data center revenue of $47.5 billion, up a massive 217% from the previous year."", ""Nvidia, however, is expected to cede some ground in the AI chip market to rivals. Rakesh, for instance, expects the company's AI chip share to slip to 75% over the next couple of years as the likes of Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) bring competitive offerings into the market. AMD witnessed an 80% year-over-year increase in sales of its data center chips in the first quarter of 2024 to $2.3 billion, thanks to the growing demand for its AI accelerators."", 'The Nvidia competitor expects to sell $4 billion worth of AI graphics cards this year, which is double its initial estimate of $2 billion. Analysts, however, expect AMD to end the year with as much as $8 billion in revenue from sales of AI-focused data center chips.', ""Intel management also pointed out on the company's latest earnings conference call that its new Gaudi 3 data center accelerators are gaining traction and could generate $500 million in revenue in the second half of 2024, followed by a stronger showing next year. Nvidia, however, is expected to be in a league of its own."", ""According to market research firm Omdia, the chipmaker could sell $87 billion worth of data center graphics cards this year. That would be a huge jump from the $34 billion the company generated through data center chip sales last year. Even better, Rakesh forecasts Nvidia could sell $280 billion worth of data center graphics cards in 2027 despite the potential loss in market share. That's not surprising, considering how fast this space is growing."", 'In simple words, there is enough room for Nvidia to grow in the AI chip market even if the competition gets stronger. Throw in the potential growth the company could witness in other markets, such as gaming, it is easy to see why analysts expect Nvidia to clock healthy earnings growth for the next five years.', ""Consensus estimates predict Nvidia's earnings will increase at an annual rate of just over 35% for the next five years. Based on the company's fiscal 2024 earnings of $12.96 per share, its bottom line could jump to $58.11 per share after five years, assuming it does increase at the predicted rate."", ""The good part is that the company seems capable of delivering the growth that analysts are expecting from it based on the points discussed above and Nvidia's commanding pricing power in the AI chip space. Not surprisingly, analysts bumped up Nvidia's earnings estimates significantly for the current and the next two fiscal years, as seen in the chart below."", ""As such, there is a good chance that Nvidia's earnings could indeed touch the projected $58.11 per share after five years. Multiplying the projected earnings with Nvidia's five-year average forward earnings multiple of 39 suggests that its stock price could hit $2,266 per share (barring any stock splits or other events) after five years. That would translate into a jump of 162% from current levels."", ""So, investors who haven't bought this AI stock yet can still consider doing so, as its impressive rally seems sustainable over the next five years."", 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

Meanwhile, shares soared over 1,700% over the last two years as strong demand for AI computing products fueled rapid sales growth.', 'The stock still carries a consensus rating of ""buy"" among Wall Street analysts, and the median price target of $965 per share implies 26% upside from its current price of $762 per share. Here\'s what investors should know about Supermicro.', 'Super Micro Computer develops accelerated computing platforms, such as storage and servers for enterprise and cloud-data centers, purpose-built for use cases like 5G and artificial intelligence (AI) applications. Its platforms integrate the latest chips, memory, and storage solutions from suppliers like Advanced Micro Devices, Intel, and Nvidia, such that Supermicro offers customers a high degree of flexibility in customizing their computing products.', 'Additionally, the company has a unique building-block approach to product development. It can usually integrate the latest technologies into its servers and bring them to market before other manufacturers. On the recent earnings call, CEO Charles Liang told analysts, ""We provide optimized AI solutions at scale, offering a time-to-market advantage and shorter lead times over our competition.""', 'Analysts at Bank of America think that competitive advantage will boost its market share in artificial intelligence servers, such that Supermicro accounts for 17% of sales in 2026, up from 10% in 2023.', 'Jim Kelleher at Argus is also bullish. ""We believe Supermicro has a head start on the legacy server vendors and is the partner of choice with Nvidia and other industry leaders for AI implementations,"" he wrote in a note to clients. ""Supermicro is emerging as a go-to provider for data-center implementation of GPU computing infrastructure used in training large language models (LLMs), inference, deep learning, and other elements that enable generative AI applications.""', 'Supermicro shares plunged 15% when the company reported third-quarter financial results that missed estimates on the top line, but investors may have overreacted. Revenue increased 200% to $3.8 billion during the quarter, just short of the 209% growth Wall Street anticipated. However, non-GAAP net income still surged 308% to $6.65 per diluted share, easily topping the 255% growth that analysts forecasted.', ""Regarding the light revenue, Supermicro would have delivered more products had it not been supply constrained, according to CEO Charles Liang. Indeed, management reported record demand for liquid-cooled, full-rack AI systems, and the company was first to market with products featuring Nvidia's new Grace Blackwell GB200 processors, which pair one Grace CPU and two Blackwell GPUs."", 'Moreover, Supermicro actually raised its full-year revenue outlook. Guidance at the midpoint now implies 110% sales growth in fiscal 2024, which ends on June 30. The company previously forecasted 104% sales growth, and Wall Street had penciled in 106% sales growth. In short, Supermicro sees itself on a loftier growth trajectory than it did before Q3, so the recent drawdown looks like a buying opportunity.', 'The AI server market is forecasted to grow at 47% annually between 2023 and 2028, according to JPMorgan Chase. Supermicro is well positioned to benefit from that tailwind. Indeed, Wall Street expects the company to grow earnings per share at 49% annually over the next three to five years.', 'That consensus estimate makes its current valuation of 42.7 times earnings look very reasonable. I say that because its price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio, which compares the price-to-earnings ratio to forecasted earnings growth, is currently below 1. For context, Nvidia currently has a PEG ratio of 2, and Amazon and Microsoft have PEG ratios of 2.2 and 2.5, respectively.', 'Of course, shares could sink if the company grows earnings more slowly than Wall Street anticipates.

One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. Speaking of which, we noticed some great changes in Genuine Parts' (NYSE:GPC) returns on capital, so let's have a look."", ""Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. The formula for this calculation on Genuine Parts is:"", 'Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)', '0.18 = US$1.8b ÷ (US$18b - US$8.6b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2024).', ""So, Genuine Parts has an ROCE of 18%.  By itself that's a normal return on capital and it's in line with the industry's average returns of 18%."", ' See our latest analysis for Genuine Parts ', ""In the above chart we have measured Genuine Parts' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free analyst report for Genuine Parts ."", ""Investors would be pleased with what's happening at Genuine Parts. The data shows that returns on capital have increased substantially over the last five years to 18%. The amount of capital employed has increased too, by 29%. The increasing returns on a growing amount of capital is common amongst multi-baggers and that's why we're impressed."", ""On a side note, Genuine Parts' current liabilities are still rather high at 47% of total assets. This can bring about some risks because the company is basically operating with a rather large reliance on its suppliers or other sorts of short-term creditors. While it's not necessarily a bad thing, it can be beneficial if this ratio is lower."", ""A company that is growing its returns on capital and can consistently reinvest in itself is a highly sought after trait, and that's what Genuine Parts has. Since the stock has returned a solid 83% to shareholders over the last five years, it's fair to say investors are beginning to recognize these changes. In light of that, we think it's worth looking further into this stock because if Genuine Parts can keep these trends up, it could have a bright future ahead."", ""One more thing to note, we've identified   1 warning sign  with Genuine Parts and understanding it should be part of your investment process."", ""While Genuine Parts may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

The company beat forecasts, with revenue of US$4.4b, some 3.1% above estimates, and statutory earnings per share (EPS) coming in at US$0.78, 27% ahead of expectations. Earnings are an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance, look at what the analysts are forecasting for next year, and see if there's been a change in sentiment towards the company. With this in mind, we've gathered the latest statutory forecasts to see what the analysts are expecting for next year."", ' See our latest analysis for C.H. Robinson Worldwide ', 'Taking into account the latest results, the most recent consensus for C.H. Robinson Worldwide from 19 analysts is for revenues of US$17.8b in 2024. If met, it would imply an okay 2.5% increase on its revenue over the past 12 months. Per-share earnings are expected to surge 38% to US$3.61. Yet prior to the latest earnings, the analysts had been anticipated revenues of US$17.6b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$3.27 in 2024. There was no real change to the revenue estimates, but the analysts do seem more bullish on earnings, given the substantial gain in earnings per share expectations following these results.', ""There's been no major changes to the consensus price target of US$80.14, suggesting that the improved earnings per share outlook is not enough to have a long-term positive impact on the stock's valuation. Fixating on a single price target can be unwise though, since the consensus target is effectively the average of analyst price targets. As a result, some investors like to look at the range of estimates to see if there are any diverging opinions on the company's valuation. The most optimistic C.H. Robinson Worldwide analyst has a price target of US$93.00 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at US$60.00. These price targets show that analysts do have some differing views on the business, but the estimates do not vary enough to suggest to us that some are betting on wild success or utter failure."", ""Another way we can view these estimates is in the context of the bigger picture, such as how the forecasts stack up against past performance, and whether forecasts are more or less bullish relative to other companies in the industry. We would highlight that C.H. Robinson Worldwide's revenue growth is expected to slow, with the forecast 3.3% annualised growth rate until the end of 2024 being well below the historical 7.1% p.a. growth over the last five years. By way of comparison, the other companies in this industry with analyst coverage are forecast to grow their revenue at 5.1% per year. So it's pretty clear that, while revenue growth is expected to slow down, the wider industry is also expected to grow faster than C.H. Robinson Worldwide."", 'The most important thing here is that the analysts upgraded their earnings per share estimates, suggesting that there has been a clear increase in optimism towards C.H. Robinson Worldwide following these results. On the plus side, there were no major changes to revenue estimates; although forecasts imply they will perform worse than the wider industry. There was no real change to the consensus price target, suggesting that the intrinsic value of the business has not undergone any major changes with the latest estimates.', ""Following on from that line of thought, we think that the long-term prospects of the business are much more relevant than next year's earnings.

We delivered strong performance in the first quarter. On the call today, I will provide an update on our performance in the quarter, our outlook for the year, and provide some comments on delivery of our growth strategy. Jack will then provide additional details regarding our financial performance.', 'Before I discuss the quarterly performance, I would like to acknowledge the significant milestone of Atmus becoming a fully independent company on March 18th. On February 14th, Cummins announced an exchange offer whereby Cummins shareholders could exchange all or a portion of Cummins common stock for shares of Atmus. Investors showed significant interest in the offer with the transaction approximately 12 times oversubscribed. The divestiture of Atmus shares by Cummins was completed on March 18th and resulted in the full separation of Atmus.', ""With the successful completion of the exchange offer, all former Cummins-appointed directors have resigned from the Atmus board of directors and two new independent directors, Diego Donoso and Stuart Taylor, have been appointed to the board. A majority of the Atmus board of directors is now independent, and I'm excited to be working with the board as we continue to accelerate growth and deliver long-term value for our shareholders. Now, let's turn to the first quarter financial results and our current outlook for 2024. We delivered strong financial performance in the first quarter."", 'Sales were 427 million, compared to 419 million during the same period last year, an increase of approximately 2%. Adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter was 80 million, or 18.8%, compared to 79 million, or 18.8%, in the prior period. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter excludes 6 million of one-time stand-alone costs and 4 million for the same period last year. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.60 in the first quarter of 2024 and adjusted free cash flow was negative 13 million.', 'Adjusted free cash flow excludes 6 million of one-time separation-related items. Now, let me provide some insight into our global market. As expected, we saw softer freight activity during the first quarter. However, our continued market share gains are offsetting some of the market weakness.', 'Demand in the first-fit markets has started to show signs of slowing in the U.S. In India, markets remained robust, while in China, the market continues to fall short of expectations. Looking ahead to our outlook for global markets, I will start with aftermarket for both on-highway and off-highway. In North America, we saw the Cass Freight Index down 5% in the first quarter compared to the prior year.', 'The rate of decline slowed through the quarter with the month of March down 3.6% year over year. While we are expecting year-over-year freight activity to gradually improve through the balance of the year, we are still experiencing year-over-year declines and have not yet seen positive freight activity compared to the prior periods. In global off-highway markets, we continue to see strength in North American construction for both residential and nonresidential construction, partially aided by government infrastructure spending. Economic conditions in Europe continued to be depressed, with weakness in construction activity.', ""And in the Asia-Pacific region, we are seeing low utilization rates across a number of our key end markets. Overall, we expect aftermarket for on-highway and off-highway to be flat to up 2% during the year, down slightly from our previous guidance of flat to up 3%. Let's turn to our first-fit markets. In the U.S., we are anticipating declines to primarily impact the second half of 2024."", 'We are modestly raising our outlook for U.S. heavy-duty truck to be down 7% to 12% for the full year, from our previous guidance of down 10% to 15%. In medium-duty truck, our outlook remains unchanged at flat to down 5%. In China, we expect weakness to persist, and demand for trucks in India is expected to remain robust, driven by strong on-highway performance.', 'While the outlook for our markets is mixed, we continue to execute on our growth plans and expand our market share in both aftermarket and first-fit. Our revenue guidance is unchanged at down 1% to up 3%, with global sales in the range of 1.61 billion to 1.675 billion. We expect continued strong operational performance and to deliver adjusted EBITDA margins of 18.25% to 19.25%, unchanged from prior guidance. Additionally, adjusted EPS is unchanged from our prior outlook and anticipated to be in a range of $2.10 to $2.35.', 'As we have separated from Cummins, we have incurred separation costs and cash impacts associated with establishing a stand-alone company. These costs and cash flows are one-time in nature. We want to be transparent and highlight those items to enable a clear understanding of the ongoing performance and cash generation of our business. In relation to cash flow outlook, I want to highlight a one-time cash outflow, which is estimated to be 30 million in 2024.', 'This impact arises as a result of a change in working capital. Cummins previously processed our payroll on our behalf, and we received 60-day terms. As we transition to managing our own payroll directly, this cash will flow immediately upon payment to employees. Now, I would like to take a moment to share the progress we have made on implementing our growth strategy.', ""As a reminder, there are four pillars of our growth strategy. Our first pillar is to grow share in first-fit. We are a leader in fuel filtration and crankcase ventilation products, and we are focused on growing this leadership position with global OEM customers. We are winning with the winners and have continued to secure Cummins' new vehicle platforms."", 'We are also accelerating growth with other leading global OEMs. We have recently won the fuel filtration business of a global OEM for the European and North American business, and we are actively pursuing new customers who are out of reach to us as part of Cummins. Our second and third pillar are interrelated and focus on accelerating profitable growth in the aftermarket and transforming our supply chain. We are relentlessly focused on our customers and providing the right product when and where it is needed.', 'Our agility allows us to continue gaining share in the aftermarket with our world-class Fleetguard products. As a key component of our agility is the continued transformation of our global distribution capabilities to provide our customers with industry-leading product availability. Earlier this year, we inaugurated our Southern Distribution Center near Dallas, Texas, and we recently opened our newest distribution facility in Singapore. We now have coverage for over 80% of our volume being distributed through dedicated Atmus warehouse facilities.', 'We are on track to establish additional centers in Europe throughout 2024. We are also focused on driving efficiencies through our purchasing organization and investing in automation in our manufacturing operations. These focus areas will support continued reduction of our operating costs. We have demonstrated delivery of our transformation initiatives through expansion of our adjusted EBITDA margin, 300 basis points during 2023.', 'Our guidance for 2024 reflects continued momentum as we execute on our strategy. Our fourth pillar is to expand into industrial filtration markets. We intend to pursue this growth inorganically, and we see a strong pipeline of opportunities, which our team is continuously evaluating. We will take a disciplined programmatic approach, with a focus on creating long-term shareholder value.', 'Our capital allocation priorities will continue to reflect our focus on growing our business both organically and inorganically. We are also assessing our approach to returning cash to shareholders now that we are an independent company. I am proud of our Atmus team who delivered another strong quarter of performance. As a fully independent company, we will accelerate our growth strategy as we move through 2024.', 'Now, I will turn the call over to Jack, who will discuss our financial results in more detail.', 'Jack Kienzler -- Chief Financial Officer', 'Thank you, Steph, and good morning, everyone. We continued to deliver strong financial performance in the first quarter. Sales were 427 million, compared to 419 million during the same period last year, an increase of approximately 2%. The increase in sales was primarily driven by pricing of approximately 2% and the favorable impacts of currency, partially offset by a modest decrease in volume as market share gains continued to counterbalance challenging conditions across many of our markets.', 'Gross margin for the first quarter was 112 million, an increase of 2 million compared to the first quarter of 2023. In addition to pricing, we also benefited from lower commodities, which more than offset the impact of higher freight and manufacturing costs, along with lower volumes. Selling, administrative, and research expenses for the first quarter were 53 million, an increase of 5 million over the same period in the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by higher people-related and consulting costs as we continue to stand up our team and separate our functions from Cummins.', 'Joint venture income was 10 million in the first quarter, an increase of 2 million from 2023, primarily due to strong performance at our joint venture in India. This resulted in adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter of 80 million, or 18.8%, compared to 79 million, or 18.8%, in the prior period. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter excludes 6 million of one-time stand-alone costs and excludes 4 million for the same period last year. We believe these costs will be in a range of 10 million to 20 million in 2024, an increase from our prior guidance of 5 million to 15 million.', 'These one-time costs primarily relate to the establishment of functions previously co-mingled with Cummins such as information technologies, distribution centers, and human resources. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.60 in the first quarter of 2024, compared to $0.67 last year. The decrease was primarily due to higher interest expense incurred from debt issued at our IPO in May of 2023. Adjusted free cash flow was negative 13 million this quarter, compared to 37 million in the prior year.', 'The higher cash usage was primarily related to increased working capital requirements and the payment of incentive compensation for strong performance achieved in 2023. Free cash flow has been adjusted 3 million for capital expenditures related to our separation from Cummins, compared to 1 million in the previous year. As Steph mentioned earlier in the call, we are also adjusting free cash flow for working capital inefficiencies associated with the move from intercompany settlement terms with Cummins to stand-alone practices. In the first quarter, this adjustment is 3 million and relates to Cummins processing payroll on our behalf prior to the full separation, and we reimbursed them on 60-day terms, consistent with historical practices.', 'As we take over the payroll process, these cash obligations are funded as incurred. We expect these inefficiencies to impact us through the end of the third quarter of this year. The effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2024 was 22%, compared to 23.7% in 2023. The decrease was driven by a change in the mix of earnings between U.S.', ""and foreign operations. Now, let's turn to the continued strength of our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with 149 million of cash on hand. Combined with the full availability of our 400 million revolving credit facility, we have 549 million of available liquidity."", 'Our cash position and continued strong performance during the first quarter of 2024 has resulted in a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 1.5 times for the trailing 12 months ended March 31st. Our balance sheet provides us with operational flexibility as we focus on value creation and delivering total shareholder value by deploying capital for continued organic growth and strategic inorganic initiatives. In closing, I want to thank our global team for their hard work and dedication as we begin our first year as a fully independent company. I am looking forward to continuing our momentum and delivering on our strategy throughout the year.', 'Now, we will take your questions.', '', 'Operator', '[Operator instructions] The first question comes from the line of Rob Mason with Baird. Please go ahead. [Audio gap] And the second question comes from the line of Tami Zakaria with J.P. Morgan.', 'Please go ahead.', 'Tami Zakaria -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst', 'Hi. Good morning. Thank you so much. So, the share gain you mentioned in the quarter, can you provide some color? Is that on the OE side or aftermarket side? Is it through coming from new customers or increase in share of wallet gains? Any color on the share gain comments you made?', 'Steph Disher -- Chief Executive Officer', 'Hi, Tami. Good morning. Thanks for the question. You know, I would say that the share gains are primarily coming in the aftermarket, that our share gains there in the aftermarket more than offset any headwinds we saw in market conditions.', ""So, that's primarily where we've seen the share gains."", 'Tami Zakaria -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst', ""Got it. That's helpful. And then my second question is can you comment on whether you see any opportunity for your current products, especially in the coolant side, to be used in the data center end market in light of the liquid cooling technology that these data centers require?"", 'Steph Disher -- Chief Executive Officer', 'Yeah. So, I guess, Tami, to answer your question broadly, we certainly see opportunity for growth. I think this week, on their call, Cummins talked about the significant growth in the PowerGen markets strongly linked to data centers. Certainly, we have product opportunities, both filtration and coolant opportunities, across that market.', ""And we see it as a strong growth market. I think -- I would just say that many of those applications are standby applications, and so don't drive as much recurring opportunity -- recurring revenue opportunities. But certainly, we see strong tailwinds in that market that we can -- we will avail ourselves of in both our filtration product range and coolants."", 'Tami Zakaria -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst', 'Got it. Thank you so much.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Rob Mason with Baird. Please go ahead.', 'Rob Mason -- Robert W. Baird and Company -- Analyst', 'Yes. Can you hear me?', 'Steph Disher -- Chief Executive Officer', 'Yeah. Hi, Rob. Good morning.', 'Rob Mason -- Robert W. Baird and Company -- Analyst', ""Hi. Sorry about that. Just I'm just curious how the first quarter may have compared to your internal plan. I know you don't provide formal first -- or quarterly guidance, but I was just curious how it compared to internal plan."", ""If -- and if there's any thoughts you can maybe give us on how you think about seasonality as we start into the second quarter?"", 'Steph Disher -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Absolutely. Thanks, Rob. So, firstly, I would say slightly ahead of expectations on our first quarter, mostly driven by our market share gains in the aftermarket that I spoke about. I'd say our price expectations were broadly in line."", ""Market expectations overall, broadly in line, but certainly, I think slightly ahead because of the share growth in aftermarket would be how I'd encapsulate the first quarter. As we look ahead, you know, I've given a bit of an outline to the markets and how I see 2024 playing out. I'll just start with first-fit markets for a moment. Really, the only change since our last guidance is the increase in our guidance on the heavy-duty truck in the U.S."", ""markets, aligned with where our customers are seeing it really, but, you know, moved up from down 10% to 15% up to down 7% to 12%, with a midpoint of 9.5%. So, that's really the only change in the first-fit markets. I would say we see that impact of declining markets in first-fit really starting to impact in the second half. It's a little earlier than that in Europe, but we're less -- we've got less exposure on first-fit markets in Europe."", ""And so, that's the first-fit side. If I turn to aftermarket, I talked about -- you know, this is predominantly -- I guess the U.S. is a heavy market for us in this regard. I talked about the Cass Freight Index through the first quarter, down 5% year over year."", 'We certainly saw that moderate throughout the quarter, and the March month was down more like 3%. So, we are certainly seeing freight activity starting to, you know, improve year over year. And the comparables in the second half of the year, as you know on aftermarket, because of the significant destocking through 2023, are much lower for us. So, we see aftermarket through the full year at around 0% to 2%.', 'So, a flattish market, I guess, is the best way to describe it, with the trend starting to lift here through the second quarter and then moderate through the rest of the year gradually is how I would describe it.', 'Rob Mason -- Robert W. Baird and Company -- Analyst', ""Thanks. That's helpful. Just as a follow-up, I noticed there was a revision to the separation cost outlook for the year. How were you thinking about, you know, as we go through this year, you know, completing all those activities or what might extend beyond 2024 and just maybe the reason the costs went up this year?"", 'Steph Disher -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Yeah. Thanks, Rob. I'll just give some context about the overall separation, where we are on that journey, and what we see ahead of us. And then I'll let Jack talk to the sort of sequential story and on costs, separation costs."", ""So, if I just -- you know, it's been a significant undertaking as we step out of Cummins, obviously, the IPO in 2023 -- May of 2023. We completed the full separation from an ownership perspective just here in the quarter. And we have a number of transition service agreements in place with Cummins to continue to provide a level of services. The original approach to those services was that they would run no longer than 24 months from IPO."", ""We are about 55% of the way through those transition services agreements or winding them off if you like. A significant amount of that happened in this first quarter of 2024, and we expect to be majorly done through the -- by the end of 2024 effectively. I'll let Jack just talk to, you know, what drove the revision for the 2024 costs and the timing of this."", 'Jack Kienzler -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah. Thanks, Steph. In terms of the revision, it's really pulsed by timing of certain projects, Rob, in this case, largely associated with IT systems and ensuring we are balancing, you know, switching the go-live on those systems with, you know, risk mitigation. And obviously, there's a cost element there."", 'But want to make sure we get the transition right in order to optimize the business moving forward. As a -- in terms of sequential move, as you noted, it was 6 million in the first quarter, which, I would just say, indicates that, you know, the majority of the anticipated 2024 expenses were incurred in that first quarter, and we should see a moderation or a tapering as we move sequentially through the year. And again, from a comparison standpoint, you know, our -- the one-time cost that we incurred last year were about 29 million, and that compares to the range here of 10 million to 20 million, which kind of coincides, I would say, largely with the progress of 55% that Steph highlighted. We do anticipate to be substantially through that by the end of 2024, with really, you know, one more distribution center to go inside of 2025.', 'Rob Mason -- Robert W. Baird and Company -- Analyst', 'Very good. Thank you.', 'Jack Kienzler -- Chief Financial Officer', 'Thanks, Rob.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.', 'Jerry Revich -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst', 'Yes. Hi. Good morning, everyone.', 'Jack Kienzler -- Chief Financial Officer', 'Good morning, Jerry.', 'Jerry Revich -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst', ""Steph, I'm wondering if -- hi. I'm wondering if I can just trouble you for an update on the M&A landscape. You know, you folks are coming up on a year as a public company, and, you know, I'm wondering what's the range of M&A opportunities for you folks over the next, call it, 12 to 18 months in terms of how much capital you expect to put to work and what that might look like based on your pipeline as you sit here today?"", 'Steph Disher -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Thanks, Jerry. As you know, an important part of our strategy is expanding into industrial filtration markets. We have an established team that are working that significantly. We've conducted all of our, you know, analysis of those markets where we see the opportunity."", ""Obviously, attractive markets for us and the opportunity for us to have a compelling and winning proposition. We've assessed -- we're assessing a strong pipeline of targets. Our team are continuously assessing that as we speak. We've worked through assessment on a number of those and have decided not to proceed with a number so far."", ""And really, you know, as always with M&A, difficult to predict exactly when that opportunity will present itself. The way I see this playing out is consistent with what I've discussed previously. It is really a programmatic approach to acquisitions around that sort of 100 million, 150 million acquisition price, I guess, in terms of -- as the capital outlay for each transaction. Really important that we get the right first step underway."", ""And at a cadence going forward, you know, you could see us doing one to two of those a year as we build out our footprint in industrial filtration. So, that's the landscape as I see it. Nothing to report specifically yet. We're working through a strong pipeline of targets, very focused on balancing -- you know, pivoting our company into attractive growth markets while balancing strong returns to shareholders."", 'Jerry Revich -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst', 'OK. Super. And then, you know, as we think about what 2027 U.S. regulations could mean for your business, you know, you have good visibility on engine platforms.', ""At this point, can you talk about the range of content increases that you expect to see on the new specifications? And then, you know, part of the warranty program that's essentially going to be included, it will be a five-year-type warranty on the entire engine platform. So, to what extent could you see higher market share as a result of that essentially extended warranty on every truck?"", 'Steph Disher -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Yeah. Thanks, Jerry. I -- you know, I think we are a leader in fuel filtration and crankcase ventilation. We're certainly actively pursuing all opportunities ahead of us to move on to new platforms."", ""And as we look to the change in 2027 emissions, that's been a big focus for our sales team, our OE sales team. We've secured those platforms with Cummins. And as you would expect, without going into all the specific details of this, rising emissions regulations gives rise to more significant content for filtration products because the complexity that's required in those filtration needs. So, we certainly see that with the 2027 platforms that we're on, and we've had, you know, really strong wins in the fuel filtration and crankcase ventilation space."", 'In terms of your question about, you know, warranty and ownership, we really -- we see, you know, a very high aftermarket retention in that first owner. So, certainly, the way I would have you think about this is as we see extended periods of warranty, I would expect our aftermarket capture to extend would be the trend I would see associated with that.', 'Jerry Revich -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', ""Our next question comes from the line of Joseph O'Dea with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead."", ""Joe O'Dea -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst"", 'Hi, Good morning, everyone.', 'Steph Disher -- Chief Executive Officer', 'Good morning, Joe.', 'Jack Kienzler -- Chief Financial Officer', 'Good morning, Joe.', ""Joe O'Dea -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst"", ""Hey. Wanted to -- just wanted to touch on the aftermarket share gains and sort of talk about your approach to that a little bit. I would think, in terms of like-for-like replacement, you know, the incumbent has the natural advantage. And so, when you're gaining share in the aftermarket, what efforts have been going on there, you know, whether that's introducing new product to more broadly sort of compete, what you're doing on the pricing side, and any quantification of how much share you think you're picking up?"", 'Steph Disher -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Yeah. So, I would say there's a number of things driving aftermarket share. And as you think about our strategy of accelerating profitable growth in the aftermarket, that pillar, it has a number of focus areas underneath that we've been very disciplined in working on, and we're starting to see those many initiatives, I would say, come to fruition. And so, the first is just making sure we've got a highly capable distribution network that is very focused on aftermarket customers and having product availability where we need it."", ""I think I've mentioned this several times before, previously, our distribution centers were intermingled with Cummins' supply chain management. Cummins is predominantly a first-fit market, and so that meant we weren't focusing on our customers in the right way in terms of their availability needs in product. And we've just been able to capture gains because, actually, our customers preferred to have our products. It was just we weren't putting it where they needed it to be."", ""So, that's been a big part of driving our share gain. It's been predominantly in the U.S., I would say. But also, we've seen that across other markets across the world. So, that's the first thing, I would say, is seeing that come to life."", ""This strategy of winning with the winners and partnering with those that are successful in growing their share, I would say, that's playing out in our market share gains in aftermarket as well. So, you know, we see that we're partnered with those that are really capturing share as well, and we're seeing the flow on benefits of that. In addition, I would say there's a number of other initiatives that we've been pushing on the aftermarket front. We have revamped our branding and marketing around our Fleetguard brand, starting to see that in the filtration science capability that we have that, you know, competitors are not able to match."", ""And we're starting to see the benefits of that flowing through as awareness, you know, increases across our aftermarket. So, I wouldn't point to one thing ever in aftermarket. This is about doing a lot of things well. But if I was to lean to where is most of it coming from, it's really tailoring that distribution and availability network to drive outcomes for our customers."", ""Joe O'Dea -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst"", ""I appreciate all the details. And then also just wanted to ask on the aftermarket outlook for the year. It seems like the quarter trended in line, maybe even better than anticipated, but if you can comment on that and sort of what aftermarket revenues did for you in the quarter. And then in terms of what you're seeing the rest of the year that would lead you to think that, you know, maybe it's a point lower than what you previously had in terms of the outlook?"", 'Steph Disher -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Yeah. So, I guess without laboring, I think the quarter in aftermarket was stronger than we expected, largely due to these share gains that I talked about. As we look ahead to the market outlook, we really are, I guess, relying pretty heavily on the external market sources. The Cass Freight Index we've seen, that's a pretty reliable source for us as a predictor of the U.S."", ""market and correlated pretty closely with our aftermarket revenues. So, as we see freight activity increase, we tend to see our aftermarket, you know, revenues follow that. And so, that -- they have -- the Cass Freight Index have revised down their outlook for the year. They're slightly softer Q2 and a slightly softer Q4 is kind of the way that played out from memory."", 'I think Q2 will be interesting to watch here. And, you know, as we monitor our guidance and outlook for the future, as -- and we see Q2 hopefully move freight activity more into positive territory year over year, and so that will be an important sign for us as we look to the health of the aftermarket throughout the rest of 2024.', ""Joe O'Dea -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst"", 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Bobby Brooks with Northland Securities. Please go ahead.', 'Bobby Brooks -- Northland Capital Markets -- Analyst', 'Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. So, just kind of starting with switching it up and wanting to talk about the first-fit, you know, could you discuss how the share gains within the first-fit market have progressed now that we are, you know, almost one year post the initial split off from Cummins.', ""I know, Steph, you mentioned a win in the -- in your prepared remarks. Maybe talk about that road map of winning that contract. Or maybe more just broadly, have you felt you've made inroads with those larger OEMs who previously wouldn't use Fleetguard in their first-fit production because they looked at it as helping a competitor? Were some maybe still not willing to engage pre-share exchange since that ownership? And I'm sorry to interrupt, but you go ahead."", 'Steph Disher -- Chief Executive Officer', ""No, thank you, Bobby, for the question. I appreciate it. You know, firstly, I would call out, as you noted in my prepared remarks, obviously, it's always tricky to work out how I give you a sense of this in advance while managing commercially sensitive information. So, I'll do my best to straddle that."", ""I will emphasize where we're seeing wins here is where we have clear technology advantage, right? And so, on the fuel filtration side, on the crankcase ventilation side, we are seeing more and more wins with our customers on that first-fit side beyond Cummins. And so, I referenced one that we've won recently that has driven, you know, gains for us in the North American market and in Europe. So, that's been a great win here. And then I would say we've made really good progress with the initial discussions with other target growth customers."", ""And I'd say they're not only U.S.-based but also in other parts of the world, we are making very good progress. We have invested consciously and deliberately in our sales team to increase the resources there, focus on canvassing and winning this business. And so, hopefully, as we move ahead here, you'll -- I'll be able to see the profits of that effort and also be able to share those with you, probably not in advance of them, unfortunately."", 'Bobby Brooks -- Northland Capital Markets -- Analyst', ""Yeah, no, I can definitely appreciate how that works, and thank you for the color there. And maybe just sticking with that, you know, obviously, with my discussions with investors, one of the things that I think people are most interested in and positive on with Atmus is just your high aftermarket exposures. But to flip that back to the first-fit, am I right in thinking that you could make notable new first-fit wins while keeping that, you know, 80% aftermarket weighting? Like new -- like winning new first-fit job doesn't necessarily mean your aftermarket exposure drops, I don't know, say, 70%, 60%. You can still win those -- make notable wins while keeping that high aftermarket exposure."", 'Steph Disher -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Yeah, we certainly see that flywheel impact. I'll just make a couple of comments on that. We're very focused in our first-fit activity, that we're doing that where we have a technology advantage, where that also drives further aftermarket growth. We already have a significant installed vehicle base, which continues to grow our aftermarket naturally anyway from the installed base that is out there."", ""So, I think that 80-20 is about the right mix for our business. And certainly, while we're looking to grow both sides of that, I think the mix holds."", 'Bobby Brooks -- Northland Capital Markets -- Analyst', ""Terrific. That's awesome. And then maybe just last question for me is, so in my view, one of the most exciting parts of the Atmus story is, you know, being able to reinvest in the business after years of being, you know, a Cummins cash cow. And you've previously talked about some exciting reinvestment initiatives such as the fully automated manufacturing line and your France facility."", ""So, could you just maybe discuss -- and curious to hear Jack's thoughts on this as well, but can you just discuss maybe early learnings from that specifically, and maybe more broadly, how the overall reinvestment programs have progressed versus expectations and, you know, just generally, any early learnings from them?"", 'Steph Disher -- Chief Executive Officer', 'Jack, do you want to take this one?', 'Jack Kienzler -- Chief Financial Officer', 'Yeah. Sure. So, I think -- thanks for the question, Bobby. I think, absolutely, one of the key initiatives for us as we, you know, move outside of the Cummins environment is to make targeted, you know, capital expenditures to increase both capacity and to accommodate growth initiatives as our sales teams engage with customers and we work to meet their expectations.', ""And so, you know, you highlighted one of those, which is in our Quimper, France facility fully automated green cartridge line. You know, it is the first fully automated line that we put in. So, of course, there are some learnings there, but it's been a really good to see that now come into -- largely into full production, which has allowed us to continue to meet our customer's needs and then potentially leverage those learnings into other markets as we continue to win new business. I do think, you know, the range of 2% to 3% is still largely what we're thinking from a capital expenditure standpoint to accommodate that top-line growth."", ""But as we identify new opportunities, we'll continue to assess, you know, as -- where we need to invest from an organic standpoint, on top of all of the initiatives that we've discussed in the inorganic space."", 'Bobby Brooks -- Northland Capital Markets -- Analyst', ""That's terrific. Thank you very much, Jack and Steph. I'll jump back in the queue. Thanks."", 'Jack Kienzler -- Chief Financial Officer', 'Thanks, Bobby.', 'Steph Disher -- Chief Executive Officer', 'Thanks, Bobby.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Please go ahead.', 'David Ridley-Lane -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', 'Hey. This is David Ridley-Lane on for Andrew. You know, you had very good growth in the independent distributor channel last year. I wanted to just, you know, see if you could share some of the most, you know, relevant stats for you.', 'Is this about signing up new distributors? Is this about initiatives to kind of grow share within the distributors? How are you, you know, getting this kind of market share gain as that has continued here in the first quarter?', 'Steph Disher -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Yeah. Thanks, David, for the question. I would say, really, it is a bit different by different region is how I would best describe that. You know, we see that we've got the best footprint in the U.S."", ""to service, in particular, our on-highway customers with our established partners today. So, I'd say that's a very mature, established, well-operating distribution network, very capable distributors. I talked about being partnered with the winners that are also growing their share and how that has a flow-on consequence in the U.S. aftermarket."", ""So, I really think that's about doing it better largely with those customers, although there is some expansion opportunity. Whereas in other markets like Latin America, for example, we really see an emphasis on expanding that network of distributors, growing those consciously. And we've seen the significant benefits of that coming through the aftermarket as well. So, tailored region by region is how I would describe it to you."", ""The way I would think about it is those where we've got mature, established, capable distributors, and we're really looking to be partnered with the winners, and doing that really well is the focus. And then in other regions that are growth emerging regions, really looking to expand a capable distribution network quickly to support our profitable growth in the aftermarket."", 'David Ridley-Lane -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', 'Thank you. And, you know, now that you are formally separated from Cummins and with an updated board, do you have any update on sort of the priorities for free cash flow or possible cash return to shareholders? Thank you.', 'Steph Disher -- Chief Executive Officer', 'Thank you. I did make some mention of this in my prepared remarks. The way I think about our capital allocation is, first and foremost, our focus is on funding our growth strategy, both organically through our core markets where we still see significant growth opportunity, and inorganically as we expand into industrial filtration markets. After that, we certainly are assessing now what return to shareholders would look like, both in the form of a dividend and in share buybacks.', ""Obviously, that's a decision for our new independent board. So, we're working through those discussions with them. And, you know, we'll be able to provide updates as and when is appropriate on returns to shareholders."", 'David Ridley-Lane -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', 'Thank you very much.', 'Jack Kienzler -- Chief Financial Officer', 'Thanks, David.', 'Operator', ""There are no further questions at this time, so I'll turn the call back over to Todd Chirillo."", 'Todd Chirillo -- Executive Director, Investor Relations', 'That concludes our teleconference for today.

Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to Chris Clulow, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you, Chris. You may begin.', 'Chris Clulow: Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our teleconference today to discuss Cummins’ results for the first quarter of 2024. Participating with me today are Jennifer Rumsey, our Chair and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Smith, our Chief Financial Officer. We will all be available to answer questions at the end of the teleconference. Before we start, please note that some of the information that you will hear or be given today will consist of forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. Such statements express our forecasts, expectations, hopes, beliefs and intentions on strategies regarding the future. Our actual future results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements because of a number of risks and uncertainties.', 'More information regarding such risks and uncertainties is available in the forward-looking disclosure statement in the slide deck and our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, particularly the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.

Our press release with a copy of the financial statements and a copy of today’s webcast presentation are available on our website within the Investor Relations section at cummins.com. With that out of the way, I’ll turn you over to our Chair and CEO, Jennifer Rumsey, to kick us off.', 'Jennifer Rumsey: Thank you, Chris and good morning everyone. I’ll start with a summary of our first quarter financial results, and then I will discuss our sales and end market trends by region. I will finish with a discussion of our outlook for 2024. Mark will then take you through more details of both our first quarter financial performance and our forecast for this year. Before getting into the details on our performance, I want to take a moment to highlight a few major events from the first quarter. In March, Cummins successfully completed the separation of our Filtration business, Atmus Filtration Technologies. Cummins will continue its focus on advancing innovative power solutions, while Atmus is now well-positioned to pursue its own plans for profitable growth.', ""We are proud of our employees' hard work and all who were involved to ensure successful separation, and we are excited to see what the future holds for both Cummins and Atmus. The final step in the separation of Atmus resulted in a tax-free exchange of shares, which reduced common shares outstanding by 5.6 million. In addition, we reintroduced our fuel-agnostic platforms with the name that captures the innovation that powers us forward, Cummins HELM platform. With higher efficiency, lower emissions and multiple fuels, the Cummins HELM platforms give our customers control of how they navigate their own journeys as part of the energy transition. As the next product in the Cummins HELM 15-liter platform, we announced we will launch the next-generation diesel X15 in North America for the heavy duty on-highway market, which will be compliant with the U.S. EPA and CARB 2027 aligned regulations at launch."", ""Lastly, in April, Cummins Power Generation introduced four new generator sets to the award-winning CentumTM Series, powered by Cummins QSK50 and QSK78 engines. These new models have been engineered specifically for the most critical applications such as data centers, health care facilities and wastewater treatment plant. I was excited to attend the launch event with our customers and hear about the growing demand for these critical applications and high interest in our genset products, which build on decades of experience meeting our customers' needs and deliver a step change improvement in power density, assured reliability, sustainability and low emissions. Now, I will comment on the overall company performance for the first quarter of 2024 and cover some of our key markets."", 'Demand for our products remained strong across many of our key markets and regions. Revenues for the first quarter were $8.4 billion, a decrease of 1% compared to the first quarter of 2023. EBITDA was $2.6 billion or 30.6% compared to $1.4 billion or 16.1% a year ago. First quarter 2024 results include a gain net of transaction costs and other expenses of $1.3 billion related to the Atmus divestiture and $29 million of restructuring expenses as we continue to work to simplify our operating structure and improve the efficiency of our business for the long term. This compares to the first quarter 2023 results, which included $18 million of costs related to the separation of the Atmus business. Excluding the onetime gain and the costs related to the separation of Atmus as well as the restructuring expenses, EBITDA percentage decreased by 80 basis points as improved pricing partially offset lower volumes and higher research and development expenses as we continue to invest in the products and technologies that will create advantages in the future.', 'Gross margin dollars improved compared to the first quarter of 2023 as the benefits of pricing more than offset the impact of lower volumes and supply chain cost increases. Our first quarter revenues in North America were flat with 2023. Industry production of heavy-duty trucks in the first quarter was 73,000 units down 5% from 2023 levels, while our heavy-duty unit sales were 26,000 down 7% from 2023. Industry production of medium duty trucks was 41,000 units in the first quarter of 2024, an increase of 8%, while our unit sales were 36,000, up 22% from 2023. We shipped 38,000 engines to Stellantis for use in their RAM pickups in the first quarter of 2024, down 2% from the 2023 levels. Revenues for North America power generation increased by 21%, driven by continued strong data center and mission-critical power demand. Our international revenues decreased by 1% in the first quarter of 2024 compared to a year ago.', 'First quarter revenues in China, including joint ventures, were $1.6 billion, a decrease of 5% as weaker domestic volumes were partially offset with the accelerating data center demand. Industry demand for medium and heavy duty trucks in China was 305,000 units, an increase of 14% from last year. However, shifts in the market share during the first quarter led to a decline in our volumes year-over-year. The light duty market in China was up 2% from 2023 levels at 486,000 units, while our units sold, including joint ventures, were 37,000, an increase of 3%. Industry demand for excavators in the first quarter was 50,000 units, a decrease of 13% from 2023 levels. The decrease in the market size is due to weak property investment, high equipment population, and slowing export demand.', 'Our units sold were 9,000 units, an increase of 10% as a result of the QSM15 penetration and export growth. Sales of power generation equipment in China decreased 7% in the first quarter as accelerating data center demand was offset by softening in other markets. First quarter revenues in India, including joint ventures, were $758 million, an increase of 1% from the first quarter a year ago. Industry truck production decreased by 7%, while our shipments decreased by 5% as the market slowed ahead of elections in April. Power Generation revenues increased by 37% in the first quarter as economic activity remains strong. Now, let me provide an outlook for 2024, including some comments on individual regions and end markets. Our full year guidance now excludes Atmus from the March 18 separation date onwards and also include -- excludes the first quarter gain related to the divestiture.', 'The guidance provided previously included Atmus for the full year as it preceded the transaction announcement. We are happy to share that our expectations for 2024 have improved from our initial guidance issued in February. Our forecast for total company revenue in 2024 remains the same at down 2% to 5%, which implies higher base business revenues of approximately $1.3 billion compared to our prior guidance as Atmus is now excluded from future quarters. We are increasing our forecast for heavy-duty trucks in North America to 255,000 to 275,000 units in 2024 compared to our prior guide of 245,000 to 265,000 units, though we do still expect softening in the second half of the year. In North America, medium-duty truck market, we maintain our prior guidance of 140,000 to 150,000 units, down 5% to flat from 2023, consistent with our prior guidance, our engine shipments for pickup trucks in North America are expected to be 135,000 to 145,000 in 2024, down 5% to 10% from 2023 as we prepare to launch our model year 2025 in the fourth quarter.', 'In China, we project total revenue, including joint ventures, to increase 3% in 2024, consistent with our prior guidance. We project a range of down 5% to up 10% in heavy- and medium-duty truck demand and expect a range of down 5% to up 5% in demand in the light-duty truck market. We expect replacement demand to be in the range -- to be the biggest driver, but the effect may be weakened by a sluggish economy and potentially slower export demand. The short-term shifts in the market share that I noted earlier are expected to normalize as we progress through the remainder of the year. In India, we project total revenue, including joint ventures, to increase 9% in 2024, primarily driven by strong power generation and on-highway demand, consistent with our prior guidance.', 'We expect industry demand for trucks to be flat to up 5% for the year. For global construction, we project down 10% to flat year-over-year, up from our previous guidance of down 5% to 15%. We continue to expect weak property investment and slowing export demand in China. We project our major global high horsepower markets to remain strong in 2024. We are raising our guidance for global power generation markets to be up 10% to 15% compared to our prior guidance of about 5% to 10%, driven by continued increases in the data center and mission-critical markets. Sales of mining engines are expected to be down 5% to up 5%, consistent with our prior guidance. While a smaller market for us, we continue to anticipate demand for oil and gas engines to decrease by 40% to 50% in 2024, primarily driven by decreased demand in North America.', ""For aftermarket, we've maintained our guidance of down 5% to up 5% for 2024, as we are through the inventory management efforts and de-stocking that happened throughout the industry in the second half of 2023. In Accelera, we expect full year sales to be $450 million to $500 million compared to $354 million in 2023, consistent with our prior guidance. We are ramping up electrolyzer manufacturing capacity and capability to deliver orders to our customers as well as expect continued growth in electrified components. In summary, coming off a strong first quarter, we are maintaining our sales growth outlook for the year of down 2% to 5% as stronger demand in our base business has offset the removal of Atmus for future quarters from our guidance."", 'We have also revised our forecast for EBITDA to be in the range of 14.5% to 15.5% compared to our previous guidance of 14.4% to 15.4%, reflecting stronger North America heavy-duty truck and power generation markets, which more than offsets the loss of profitability of Atmus. In addition, we are taking steps to reduce cost, optimize our business and position Cummins for continued success in 2024. We are in a strong position to keep investing in the future, bringing new technologies to customers and returning cash to our investors. During the quarter, we returned $239 million to shareholders in the form of dividends, consistent with our long-term plan to return approximately 50% of operating cash flow to shareholders. In addition, we reduced the overall Cummins share count by $5.6 million as we completed the Atmus share exchange, which will be more fully reflected in the average share count in the second quarter and beyond.', ""I am impressed and grateful for the commitment of our employees and leaders around the world for delivering for our customers and generating strong financial performance at the same time. Our results further enhance Cummins' ability to keep investing in the future growth, bringing sustainable solutions that will protect our planet for future generations and returning cash to our shareholders. I look forward to discussing our long-term strategy further in our upcoming Analyst Day on May 16. And now let me turn it over to Mark."", ""Mark Smith: Thank you, Jen, and good morning, everyone. We delivered solid first quarter revenue and profitability and generated positive operating cash flow. Given the strength of first quarter results and our improved outlook, we've raised our full year expectations for 2024 after adjusting for the separation of Atmus. First quarter revenues were $8.4 billion, down 1% from a year ago. The separation of Atmus in mid-March resulted in a year-over-year sales decline of around 1% to our -- to Cummins consolidated sales. Our underlying revenues increased in North America and Latin America and were offset by weaker demand in China and Europe. EBITDA was $2.6 billion or 30.6% of sales for the quarter. We completed the tax-free full separation of Atmus in March, which resulted in a onetime gain on the divestiture of $1.3 billion, net of transaction costs and other expenses."", ""First quarter results also included $29 million of restructuring expenses. This compares to first quarter of 2023, which included $18 million of costs related to the separation of Atmus. To provide clarity on operational performance and allow comparison to prior year, I am excluding the one-time gain and the costs related to the separation of Atmus as well as the restructuring expenses in my following comments. Financial results of Atmus through March 18 are included in our first quarter consolidated sales and EBITDA. EBITDA was $1.3 billion or 15.5% of sales for the quarter compared to $1.4 billion or 16.3% of sales a year ago. The lower EBITDA percentage was driven by investment in new products and capabilities and lower sales volumes. Now let's look into more detailed by line item."", 'Gross margin for the quarter was $2.1 billion or 24.5% of sales compared to $2 billion or 24% even last year. The improved margins were primarily driven by favorable pricing and operational improvements, especially in the Power Systems business. Selling, administrative and research expenses increased by $72 million, driven by higher research costs as we continue to bring to market new products and capabilities to support future profitable growth, particularly the development of the HELM product line within the Engine business. Joint venture income of $123 million increased $4 million from the prior year, primarily due to increased earnings in the Power Systems segment. Other income was $21 million, a decrease of $50 million from a year ago.', 'The decrease in other income is driven by the relative negative impact of foreign currency revaluation and lower gains on investments related to company-owned life insurance compared to a year ago. Interest expense was $89 million, an increase of $2 million from the prior year, driven by higher outstanding, long-term borrowings related to the bond issuance we completed in February. The all-in effective tax rate in the first quarter was 8.7%, mainly due to the tax-free gain on the separation of Atmus. All in, net earnings for the quarter were $2 billion or $14.03 per diluted share, which includes the net gain related to the separation of Atmus of $1.3 billion or $9.08 per diluted share and restructuring expenses of $29 million or $0.15 per share.', 'Just to reinforce what Jen said, full impact of the lower share count from the Atmus separation will be seen in future quarters since the diluted share counts counted on a weighted average basis. All-in operating cash flow was an inflow of $276 million compared to an inflow of $495 million in the first quarter last year. Now let me comment on segment performance and our guidance for 2024. As a reminder, prior guidance for 2024 assume that the operations of Atmus would be included in our consolidated results for the full year. Components segment revenue was $3.3 billion, a decrease of 6%, while EBITDA, excluding costs related to the separation of Atmus, increased from 14.6% of sales to 14.8% driven primarily by improved performance within Cummins Meritor.', ""For Components, we've updated the guidance for the segment following the separation of Atmus and expect 2024 revenues to decrease 9% to 14% and EBITDA margins in the range of 13.5% to 14.5%. Our latest guidance reflects an increase in both revenues and EBITDA margins after adjusting for the separation of Atmus. For the Engine segment, first quarter revenues were $2.9 billion, a decrease of 2% from a year ago. EBITDA was 14.1%, a decrease from 15.3% a year ago as the benefit of pricing offset by lower volumes and higher research costs. 2024, we now project revenues for the Engine business to be down 5% to flat, an improvement of 2% at the midpoint from our prior year projections, reflecting a revised outlook in the North American truck markets and stronger-than-expected demand from our construction customers."", '2024 EBITDA is projected to be in the range of 12.7% to 13.7%, an increase of 20 basis points at the midpoint due to higher volumes. In the Distribution segment, revenues increased 5% from a year ago to $2.5 billion. EBITDA decreased as a percent of sales to 11.6% compared to 13.9% of sales a year ago as aftermarket sales, particularly to industrial customers declined from the record levels that we experienced a year ago. We expect 2024 distribution revenues to be flat to up 5% and EBITDA margins to be in the range of 11.5% to 12.5%, an increase from the prior guide of 3% for revenues and a modest improvement to margins for the full year. Power Systems segment revenues were $1.4 billion, an increase of 3% and EBITDA increased from 16.3% to 17.1% of sales driven by higher volumes, particularly in the power generation markets, improved pricing and operating improvements, all of which contributed to a strong trend of improving performance in that segment.', '2024, we now expect Power Systems revenues to be flat to 5%, up 3% at the midpoint and EBITDA has also increased to be approximately 16% to 17%, up 80 basis points from our previous guide. Accelera revenues increased 9% to $93 million, driven by increased electrolyzer installations. Our EBITDA loss was $101 million compared to an EBITDA loss of $94 million a year ago as we continue to invest in the products and capabilities to support future growth. In 2024, our guidance is unchanged. We expect revenues to be in the range of $450 million to $500 million and net losses to be in the range of $400 million to $433 million consistent with our prior guide. As Jen mentioned, given the strong performance in the first quarter and the outlook in our key regions, end markets, we are adjusting the full year company guidance, and we project company revenue -- consolidated company revenues to be down 2% to 5%, consistent with the prior year guidance despite the separation of ass.', 'Company EBITDA margins are now projected to be approximately 14.5% to 15.5%, up 10 basis points from prior guidance, all of which excludes the net gain related to the separation of Atmus and the restructuring expenses. Our effective tax rate is expected to be 24%, excluding the tax-free gain related to Atmus and other discrete items. Capital investments will be in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion, unchanged from our outlook three months ago as we continue to make critical investments in new products, capacity expansion to support future growth. In summary, we delivered solid sales, profitability, and positive cash flow in the first quarter. We do still expect moderation in some of our key markets in the second half of 2024, but we have raised our expectations of our own performance relative to our prior guide.', 'We took some steps to reduce costs in the fourth quarter of 2023 and continue to identify ways to streamline our business going forward leaving us well positioned to navigate any economic cyclicality and continue investing and delivering strong financial performance. Our priorities in 2024 for capital allocation are unchanged. We will reinvest for growth, plan to raise the dividend, and reduce debt. Thank you for your interest today, and I look forward to seeing some of you in person in New York at our upcoming Analyst Day. Now, let me turn it over to Chris.', ""Chris Clulow: Thank you, Mark. Out of consideration to others on the call, I would ask that you limit yourself to one question and a related follow-up. If you have an additional question, please rejoin the queue.

We appreciate you joining us for our first quarter earnings call. We continue our focus on strong execution. We have started the year with solid operational performance and are on track to meet our financial expectations, and we are making good progress on the regulatory front having concluded ComEd's rehearing process almost two months ahead of schedule. But before I get into the details of today's call, I want to start by acknowledging all of the thoughtful outreach we received on the passing of my predecessor, Chris Crane. Exelon and really the energy industry wouldn't be what it is today without his leadership. All 20,000 of our employees are committed to furthering the legacy of the platform he established and the culture of operational excellence he promoted permeates all aspects of the performance you see today."", 'Beginning with our key messages on Slide 4. We earned $0.66 per share on a GAAP basis and $0.68 per share on a non-GAAP basis. We again faced well below normal weather across our jurisdictions, along with significant storm activity, but having approximately 3/4 of our revenues decoupled from load, balanced cost recovery mechanisms and strong operating earnings guidance of $2.40 to $2.50 per share. We are on track to deliver that. We also continue to perform in the top quartile operationally across all of our operating company utilities. On the regulatory front, we have continued to make good progress. As laid out in our fourth quarter call, a key goal this year is to improve our regulatory outlook in Illinois. We took a large step forward on March 13 when we filed our updated grid plan with the Illinois Commerce Commission.', ""Upon hearing from the Commission in December, the ComEd team got to work the day after the order and worked tirelessly with key stakeholders over the next 90 days to create an updated grid plan that addressed the Commission's feedback. I am so proud of the ComEd team for their efforts to refile an updated grid plan that is thoroughly responsive to the ICC's direction and we look forward to a final order, which the Commission has stated should be received by the end of the year for rates effective at the beginning of next year. And in the meantime, we are pleased that the commission approved an updated revenue requirement for ComEd in its rehearing almost two months ahead of the statutory deadline, which recognizes the investments made last year and the prudent expectations for continued investment in new business in Illinois."", ""We also filed electric and gas rate cases at PECO in late March. These rate cases will support PECO's expanded investment in infrastructure, and they will enhance programs and services for customers, including assistance for low-income customers and support for customers embracing cleaner energy options. And lastly, the Delaware Public Service Commission approved a settlement in Delmarva Power & Light's electric distribution rate case, supporting continued investment in the reliability and resiliency of its grid. Jeanne will review more details around our regulatory activity shortly. Finally, we continue to reaffirm all of our long-term guidance, including an expected 5% to 7% annualized operating earnings growth going forward. This will be driven by the significant investment needed to support our jurisdiction's energy goals, which we are committed to doing as affordably and equitably as possible."", 'Turning to Slide 5. Our streak of operational excellence continues despite the significant storm activity we saw across our territories in the first quarter. In both outage frequency and outage duration, ComEd and PEPCO Holdings achieved top decile performance, while BGE and PECO achieved top quartile performance. This also includes extremely high performance on the gas side of the business, where gas odor response rates were perfect at both BGE and PECO. We also maintained strong performance in our customer satisfaction scores at ComEd and PECO with ComEd achieving top decile. In light of its lower performance at the start of the year, BGE has created several working groups to identify and address customer pain points highlighted in customer surveys and direct interactions.', ""With team initiatives underway that include enhanced community outreach for energy efficiency programs, especially targeted towards limited and moderate income customers and a continuous improvement plan for new business. Results are trending favorably in the second quarter. Lastly, I'll spend some time speaking about our safety culture and performance. We achieved top decile performance on our metric through the first quarter at BGE and PEPCO Holdings, while ComEd and PECO sit in the second quartile. As many are familiar, the measure we have historically used for safety has been OSHA recordables in line with the industry standard. This metric has been in place for decades, resulting from legislation pass over 50 years ago. While OSHA recordable served as a useful starting point to drive safe behaviors and accountability, it has limitations in its ability to focus efforts on the most critical areas."", ""While the total injury rate for the industry has declined, the most severe outcomes, fatalities have not. The power sector occupies a unique space in today's economy and the nature of our work entails significant physical risk, more than most other business sectors. And our efforts to advance our capabilities as a learning organization we have worked with the industry to adopt a more targeted and comprehensive framework to monitor high safety risk situations to harness key learnings and further engage our employees. Such framework is better suited for our industry to drive safety performance to the next level. And this approach not only better ensures our efforts are focused on the highest potential risk but also helps measure the success of those efforts, evaluating the presence of safeguards as opposed to the absence of injuries."", ""In alignment with this strategy to focus on the highest risk safety situations, we are now reporting on our safety performance through the serious injury incident rate or SIIR. Given this safety metric now measures serious injuries, we're more focused than ever on doing as much as we can to operate at industry-leading levels and any incidents are unacceptable. Based on performance to date, ComEd is refreshing all employees on serious injury prevention tools, including recognition of their empowerment to stop work if a situation is deemed unsafe. And PECO is focused on strategies to improve safety performance around motor vehicles, including a copilot program to identify and communicate passenger responsibilities for safe driving. I am very proud of our operations team for its industry leadership on an issue as paramount as safety, and I look forward to driving continuous improvement in this area."", ""Jeanne, I'll now turn it over to you to cover our financial and regulatory update."", ""Jeanne Jones: Thank you, Calvin, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will cover our first quarter financial update and progress on our 2024 rate case schedule, including key developments in Illinois. Starting on Slide 6, we show our quarter-over-quarter adjusted operating earnings lock. As Calvin mentioned, Exelon earned $0.68 per share in the first quarter of 2024 versus $0.70 in the first quarter of 2023, reflecting lower results of $0.02 per share over the same period. Earnings are lower in the first quarter relative to last year driven primarily by $0.04 of higher interest expense due to the rise in interest rates and higher levels of debt at the holding company and at some of our utilities. $0.03 of higher restoration and damage repair costs associated with the challenging storm season across the Mid-Atlantic and $0.02 of lower return on ComEd's distribution investments, including no return on its pension asset resulting from the December rate order."", ""This was partially offset by $0.07 of higher distribution rates at our other utilities associated with incremental investments net of other expenses. Results of $0.68 per share in the first quarter represents an approximate 28% contribution of the midpoint of our projected 2024 operating earnings guidance range, which is right in line with historical patterns, but slightly behind where we expected to be for Q1. This is a direct result of the continued warmer-than-normal temperatures in our non-decoupled jurisdictions, and the challenging storm activity experienced throughout the first three months of 2024. As we look ahead to the next quarter, the relative EPS contribution is expected to be approximately 15% and of the midpoint of our projected full year earnings guidance range, which contemplates the update to ComEd's revenue requirement approved by the Illinois Commerce Commission to go into effect in May builds."", 'In combination with Q1 results, this would result in recognizing 43% of projected full year earnings which is slightly behind how we have performed historically, but in line with our latest outlook, given various new rates expected to go into effect towards the second half of the year across several jurisdictions. As we demonstrated in 2023, weather-related volatility is a risk we expect to manage alongside other changes in the plan. The ComEd rehearing provides for incremental revenue relief relative to the final order, which underpinned our base case for the year. As we progress through the year, you can expect us to balance this opportunity with management of our costs and utility work plans, regulatory outcomes and weather over the remaining quarters to deliver against the expectations laid out for the year.', ""We remain on track for full year operating earnings of $2.40 to $2.50 per share in 2024 with the goal of being at midpoint or better of that range. Lastly, we are reaffirming the fully regulated operating EPS compounded annual growth target of 5% to 7% from the 2023 guidance midpoint through 2027 with the expectation to be at the midpoint or better of that growth range. Moving to Slide 7. There are several positive developments to highlight in the ongoing regulatory matters in Illinois. Starting with the most recent on April 18, the ICC issued an order on the rehearing of ComEd's December MYP order that reset rates, which went into effect in May, providing for an increase of $150 million in 2024 relative to the December 2023 order. The order also increased the 2025 to 2027 revenue requirements over the approved revenue requirements in those years."", ""While we are encouraged the revenue requirements on rehearing, we're largely uncontested and the rehearing process was completed nearly two months ahead of schedule. Obtaining approval of the refiled grid plan remains top priority. That leads me to the next key development. After three months of robust stakeholder engagement to address feedback from the commission in which ComEd hosted two public meetings and a series of six workshops on 10 different topics, the revised grid plan was filed with the ICC on March 13. Based on this engagement, ComEd have made a number of changes to the original grid plan, including the following: first, we reduced overall investment levels and bill impacts by up to 30% to better ensure affordability for customers."", 'We also included additional affordability analysis anchored around energy burden, which is the total home energy cost as a percentage of household income, and we demonstrated that new rates under the proposed grid plan result in electric bills at levels well less than half the threshold considered to be energy burdened. And third, we outlined in detail how every customer and community benefits from the clean energy transition. Specifically, through focused grid investments in disadvantaged communities, more than 40% of the benefits of grid modernization and clean energy have been demonstrated to support equity investment eligible communities customers. Lastly, we enhanced our support for the value of grid investments to ComEd customers through a new cost effectiveness framework.', ""ComEd's analysis details the present value benefits, of grid plan investments totaling over $7 billion, as compared to the present value of the revenue requirements of $4.4 billion. These quantifiable benefits driven largely by reliability and - the emissions reductions, do not capture other qualitative value like cybersecurity protection, safety, customer engagement, low income customer assistance, and health improvements from improved air quality. The refiled grid plan not only satisfies all statutory requirements and supports the achievement of statutory objectives. It also represents a collaboration among ComEd, commission staff ,and other stakeholders on implementation of the groundbreaking Climate and Equitable Jobs Act. CEJA has put the state of Illinois on a path to advance ambitious plans, to combat climate change, a goal that is equally important to policymakers and utilities alike."", 'In support of these objectives, on March 7, the commission issued an order that a procedural schedule to be adopted for the grid and rate plan proceeding that, will allow the commission to issue a final order in December 2024, and implement rates that will go into effect by the start of 2025. The administrative law judges subsequently adopted a proposed procedural schedule in line with this timing. ComEd also filed its final distribution formula rate reconciliation with the ICC on April 26, seeking a one-time recovery of $627 million in rates effective January 1, 2025. A key driver of the increase includes the impact of U.S. treasury yields that increased in 2023 relative to the prior year. As a reminder, the formula rate construct was historical and that it set rates based on prior year expenditures.', ""As such, in addition to collecting actual costs from 2023, trued up from '21 and '22 costs, the reconciliation reflects higher O&M expenses, due in part to the inclusion of beneficial electrification, and credit card convenience fees required by CEJA, as well as additional investments in infrastructure to support safe, reliable service for customers, and growth of new business in the state supported, by its economic development policies. Storm recovery was also a material driver of the under recovery, per statute in order is expected on the reconciliation in December. As I mentioned, obtaining approval of ComEd's refiled grid plan is our priority. Early approval of the rehearing, coupled with the adoption of a procedural schedule for an order on the refiled grid plan, before the end of 2024, are the first steps to getting Illinois back on track, to achieve its clean energy goals."", 'Turning to Slide 8. As Calvin mentioned, there have been some important developments on the regulatory front for our East Coast jurisdictions, since the beginning of the year. Let me begin with the most recent filing. On March 28, PECO filed both electric and gas distribution rate cases with the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission. In its electric rate case, PECO is requesting a $399 million net revenue increase by 2025, to support significant investments in infrastructure to maintain and improve safety, reliability and customer service for its customers. To reduce the impacts of severe weather, PECO has proposed a storm reserve mechanism, designed to defer storm cost variances to the balance sheet, to be collected, or refunded in the next base rate case.', ""Additionally, PECO is seeking to recover $111 million in its gas distribution rate case to support continued replacement of existing natural gas mains and service lines, with new plastic pipe intended to enhance safety, improve service and reduce methane emissions. As part of the case, PECO has requested a weather normalization adjustment, designed to adjust customers' gas bills for actual versus normal weather, on each individual customer bill when bills are issued. Both the proposed storm reserve and weather normalization adjustments, would reduce the variability of revenues relative to our costs and at the same time, benefit customers by ensuring that they only pay for actual storm costs, and by making their gas bills more predictable. Further strengthening the experience for our customers are the planned infrastructure investments, to modernize the electric grid, make it stronger, more rather resistant and less vulnerable to storm damage."", ""Despite the impacts of several severe storms in 2023, PECO customers experienced the lowest power outage in company history, with 86% of PECO customers experiencing zero or one outage in 2023. PECO's investment plans outlined in the electric and gas rate cases, are designed to build upon this strong foundation, delivering enhanced reliability performance to its customers. Orders are expected from the PAPUC for both rate cases, before the end of 2024. On April 18, the Delaware Public Service Commission unanimously approved Delmarva Power settlement agreement with modification for its electric distribution rate case. The settlement was for a $42 million gross increase in distribution rates premised on an ROE of 9.6%. The decision improves recovery of investments in infrastructure, to mean safety and reliability, and improved service for our customers."", ""It also helps better align revenues with costs, specifically high storm expenses through a newly established rider that allows for deferral of storms exceeding $5 million. As permitted by Delaware Law, Delmarva Power implemented full allowable rates on July 15, 2023, subject to refund. I'll close with an update on the progress in Pepco's electric distribution rate cases in Washington, D.C. and Maryland. The procedural schedule and Pepco DC's multiyear rate plan filing has been adjusted to accommodate an intervenor's request for additional time, to review rebuttal testimony from Pepco. Pepco anticipates DC's Commission to issue a subsequent order, with an updated hearing and briefing schedule in the coming weeks. A final order is expected by the third quarter."", ""Additionally, in Maryland, evidentiary hearings were conducted and brief filed in March and April, respectively, as part of Pepco's pending multiyear electric rate case. The hearings allowed Pepco Maryland, the opportunity to demonstrate the benefits afforded by a multiyear rate plan relative to traditional rate making. Multiyear plans in Maryland have enabled investments necessary to improve reliability and customer service, modernize the distribution system and support state environmental goals that, have served our customers and community as well. We continue to believe Pepco's proposed investment plans are well suited for Maryland, to meet its aggressive clean energy goals in an affordable manner. A final order is expected from the commission, by June 10 per statute."", ""More details on the rate cases can be found on Slides 19 through 29 of the Appendix. I will conclude with a review of our balance sheet activity on Slide 9. As you heard on our last earnings call, we project to continue to have approximately 100 basis points of cushion on average for our consolidated corporate credit metrics above the threshold specified by the agencies. And while we continue to await specific guidance and implementation of the corporate alternative minimum tax, I'll remind you that our plan continues to incorporate the assumption that the regulations will not allow for repairs. It's implemented in a way that mitigates the cash impact, we'd expect an increase of approximately 50 basis points, to our consolidated credit metrics on average over the plan, putting us more on the higher end of our targeted 100 to 200 basis points of cushion."", 'From a debt financing perspective, we successfully raised $1.7 billion at corporate, and approximately $1 billion for the PHI entities in the first quarter. To-date, we have completed 55% of our planned 2024 long-term debt financing needs, including all of our corporate needs, positioning us well for any market volatility in the balance of the year. As a reminder, we continue the pre-issuance hedging program that was initiated in 2022 to manage the ongoing interest rate volatility. In addition, we continuously monitor the capital markets, and regularly assess our plans for future issuance timing, sizing, tenor and tranching strategy to ensure we achieve optimal outcomes. The strong investor demand for our debt offerings continues to be a testament to the strength of our balance sheet, and to our value proposition as a premier T&D utility with a low risk platform.', ""To reiterate our equity needs, there has been no change in our guidance to issue $1.6 billion over the 2024 to 2027 period, to fund the estimated $34.5 billion capital plan in a balanced manner. Specifically, we expect to issue $150 million of equity at the holding company in 2024 and the balance of approximately $475 million annually, over 2025 through 2027. We will continue to update you as we make progress on that plan. Thank you. I'll now turn the call back to Calvin for his closing remarks."", 'Calvin Butler: Thank you, Jeanne. I will close on Slide 10, by reminding you of your 2024 - of our 2024 business priorities and commitments and the unique power of our platform. As always, we start with operational excellence providing safe and reliable power to our customers as the demands on the grid continue to increase. We remain committed to achieving regulatory outflows, and adequately balanced stakeholder interest, supporting the necessary progress on the energy transformation. This includes completing the ComEd grid plan process in a way that, allows sufficient investment in the grid to support Illinois energy goals. We are focused on delivering on all of our financial commitments for the year, investing $7.4 billion of capital expenditures, while earning a consolidated ROE of 9% to 10%, and delivering operating earnings per share of $2.40 to $2.50 per share.', 'And we expect to achieve this while executing on our financing plan, to maintain a strong balance sheet. We continue our strong advocacy for equitable and balanced energy transition, taking advantage of the unprecedented federal support through IIJA for investment across the ecosystem, while continuing our industry-leading efforts to strengthen our communities. As you may have seen, we are proud to partner with the Cal Ripken Senior Foundation to open 81 stem centers across various cities. We serve, including Atlantic City, Chicago, Philadelphia, Wilmington and Washington, D.C. We opened the very first of those in April in Lansdowne, Maryland, and we are excited give students an opportunity to gain hands-on knowledge, skills and confidence in areas like coding and engineering, which are indispensable in the energy industry.', ""We also continue to focus on maintaining a long-term O&M trajectory that supports customer affordability while relentlessly pursuing opportunities to operate more efficiently as one Exelon. Executing against our established priorities and commitments year in and year out, is what you would expect of a premier utility. In many ways, those priorities and commitments aren't new. The foundation of operational excellence, and a commitment to values that support the diverse communities we have, the privilege and responsibility to serve, was established long ago by Chris. He demanded continuous improvement from the businesses he ran, while relentlessly advocating for sensible and long-sighted policies. And he was an equally strong champion of diversity and inclusion, including industry-leading efforts to advance equitable recruitment, retention and promotion of women along with award-winning programs in workforce development, and supply diversity."", 'Indeed, he laid the foundation for the Stem Academy initiative that I highlighted moments ago. We will all miss Chris, and we look forward to honoring his legacy by pushing Exelon to lead the energy transformation with the platform and culture that he helped establish. Gigi, that concludes our prepared remarks and we welcome any questions from the audience.', 'See also', '12 Most Unfriendly Cities in Canada and', 'Top 25 Stocks in the S&P 500 by Index Weight Right Now.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

PECO is seeking a $464 million rate hike, with a 10.95% return on equity. The Pennsylvania Public Service Commission is expected to make a decision on the request late this year, according to Exelon.', 'In Illinois, Exelon’s Commonwealth Edison subsidiary in March refiled a grid plan after the Illinois Commerce Commission rejected its initial proposal\xa0in December. ComEd is seeking a $670 million rate increase over four years for its grid plan. The revised plan is 30% less costly than ComEd’s first proposal, and 40% of its benefits will go to disadvantaged communities, according to Jeanne Jones, executive vice president and chief financial officer at Exelon.', 'ComEd is also seeking a one-time $627 million distribution formula rate hike, with a decision expected in December, Jones said.', 'Meanwhile, a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission audit found that ComEd misallocated certain construction costs and the utility may be required to issue refunds to some customers, Exelon said in its latest 10-Q report filed Thursday with the U.S.\xa0Securities and Exchange Commission.\xa0', 'ComEd determined that a loss was probable and recorded its regulatory liability to reflect its best estimate of that loss,\xa0pegged at $27 million —\xa0up from a previous $11 million estimate — but a resolution of the issue could result in higher losses that could affect Exelon and ComEd financial statements, the Chicago-based utility company said.', 'Exelon’s first-quarter update marks an “intermediary period” between its fourth quarter strategic update and upcoming traction on key regulatory initiatives, such as its Illinois grid plan and PECO rate case, Shahriar Pourreza, a Guggenheim Partners equity analyst, said in a client note Thursday.', 'Looking ahead to potential catalysts for Exelon in the second half of this year, Pourreza said the utility company has yet to fully lean into the dialogue on data centers to the same degree as some utility companies such as PPL, which has signed interconnection deals with data centers with more than 3 GW of load.

The bank's financial tables from the filing reveal a complex landscape of investments, cash flows, and comprehensive income, with a balance sheet that reflects the bank's strategic financial management.

GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Sign with MTB.', ""Diversified Funding Sources: M&T Bank Corp's strength lies in its diversified funding sources, which include a stable base of core deposits and various short-term and long-term wholesale borrowings. Core deposits increased from $146.5 billion at the end of December 2023 to $151.5 billion by March 31, 2024, indicating a growing trust among its customer base. The bank's ability to supplement its funding through secured borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) of New York and the Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) of New York further solidifies its financial foundation. This diversity in funding sources provides M&T Bank with the flexibility to navigate economic fluctuations and maintain liquidity."", ""Strong Commercial Lending Portfolio: M&T Bank's commercial lending portfolio is a significant strength, with a $1.3 billion growth in average commercial and industrial loans across various industry types. The bank's expertise in commercial real estate lending, as evidenced by its participation in the Fannie Mae DUS program and other initiatives, has contributed to a robust loan portfolio that drives revenue and supports regional economic development. This strength positions M&T Bank as a key player in the commercial lending space, capable of leveraging its portfolio to generate consistent income."", ""Interest Rate Risk Exposure: M&T Bank Corp's financial performance is susceptible to interest rate fluctuations, as indicated by the narrowing of the net interest margin on loans and deposits by 13 basis points and 4 basis points, respectively, in the first quarter of 2024. This exposure to interest rate risk could lead to reduced net interest income, which is a critical component of the bank's overall earnings. Managing this risk is imperative for maintaining profitability and requires strategic hedging and asset-liability management."", ""Regional Market Concentration: While M&T Bank has a strong presence in its operational regions, this geographical concentration also presents a weakness. The bank's performance is closely tied to the economic conditions of the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions, which could limit growth opportunities and increase vulnerability to local economic downturns. Diversifying its market presence could mitigate this risk and provide a more balanced revenue stream."", 'Digital Banking Expansion: The ongoing digital transformation in the banking industry presents significant opportunities for M&T Bank Corp to expand its digital banking services.

This competition can pressure margins, customer acquisition, and retention. Staying ahead of the competition will require continuous innovation, competitive pricing strategies, and exceptional customer service.', ""Regulatory Changes: The banking industry is subject to stringent regulatory oversight, and any changes in capital requirements or other regulations could impact M&T Bank's operations.

When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period."", ""Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Colgate-Palmolive ', ""Over the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Chairman, Noel Wallace, for US$1.2m worth of shares, at about US$84.17 per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even below the current price of US$92.88. We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. We note that the biggest single sale was only 3.6% of Noel Wallace's holding."", ""In the last year Colgate-Palmolive insiders didn't buy any company stock.

This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap."", ""Looking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Insiders own 0.09% of Colgate-Palmolive shares, worth about US$69m. While this is a strong but not outstanding level of insider ownership, it's enough to indicate some alignment between management and smaller shareholders."", ""An insider sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. But since Colgate-Palmolive is profitable and growing, we're not too worried by this. Insider ownership isn't particularly high, so this analysis makes us cautious about the company. We're in no rush to buy!

Today, I'll begin, as usual, by providing a summary of our recent performance, Glenn will cover Q1 financial results and the full year outlook. And I will finish by providing an update on our strategic operating plan. Now starting on Slide 3. In Q1, organic sales declined by 1.9%, driven by lower sales in Connected Technology Solutions and Essential Dental Solutions, partly offset by growth in Orthodontic and Implant Solutions and Wellspect HealthCare. Within CTS, imaging equipment experienced larger-than-expected headwinds, driven by continued unfavorable macroeconomic conditions and competitive pressure. Regionally, the macroeconomic environment in Germany remains challenging."", 'For the quarter, organic sales were roughly flat, excluding Germany. In April, we conducted our quarterly global customer survey covering 12 countries with nearly 1,500 respondents. Survey results indicate that in the US patient volumes are stable and dentist sentiment is relatively unchanged. In Canada, a new government health policy designed to help lower and middle-income families is rolling out in the first half of 2024, which we believe has resulted in patients delaying treatment until this benefit is in effect. In Germany, we are pleased to see procedure utilization and dentists outlook improved slightly. All other European markets included in the survey remained relatively stable. In Asia Pacific, dentists in Australia continued to exhibit more negative sentiment.', 'We saw mixed feedback in Japan. Although, there was a decline in patient volumes, dentists were positive around the imminent change in reimbursement for intraoral scans. Finally, in China, patient volumes are stable, but remained low compared to other markets. As we execute on our strategic objectives, it remains crucial that we consistently seek input from customers to inform our decisions so that we can validate that we are on the right path. We appreciate so many taking the time quarter-after-quarter to provide us with this substantial and valuable input. Our first quarter adjusted EPS was $0.42, which was an increase of nearly 8% and in line with our expectations despite softer sales. For the full year, we are maintaining our outlook range for organic sales and adjusted EPS, but trending towards the low end of both ranges.', ""We're taking a cautious stance here with the macro uncertainties that continue to impact parts of our business, most notably imaging. We're also adjusting net sales for an additional FX headwind. Though we believe these headwinds are transient, we are actively taking additional measures, such as tightening cost controls to better position us to deliver on our profitability and EPS targets for the year. We remain confident in our long-term trajectory. We have a comprehensive portfolio and are making progress on our strategic objectives. In fact, today, we announced that we plan to execute up to $150 million in share repurchases in the second quarter. Moving to Slide 4, I would like to share some select business highlights. We are advancing innovation and progressing initiatives across our business."", ""DS Core remains a key focus of our innovation. We are delivering enhancements and seeing strong uptick in adoption rates from new users and increased utilization rates from existing users. We also piloted DS Core enterprise with a large DSO in the US. Given the shared experience to date, we are jointly exploring increasing the scope and size of this pilot. I've already shared the dynamics impacting our imaging business. To better position our portfolio, we expanded our offerings through the relaunch of Orthophos SL, a 2D and 3D imaging line in Europe. Bringing this product line back to market broadens our imaging portfolio and provides flexibility to our customers with more options at different price points. Therefore, we believe bringing this solution back to our customers will improve performance in imaging."", ""Additionally, in CTS, we recently launched Axano Pure, a new treatment center with advanced features at an improved price point and Midwest Energo, a portfolio of electric handpieces. These innovations bring new efficiencies and enhanced capabilities to our customers, a continued key demand from customers captured in our quarterly survey. In EDS, we continue to roll out X-Smart Pro+ in additional markets, which included Japan in Q1. X-Smart Pro+ is an endo motor solution that enables dentists to focus more on the procedure rather than the tools. Our data shows that the motor optimizes performance of DENTSPLY SIRONA's endodontic filing systems and has differentiated attributes that sets it apart from its competition, and we are pleased with the uptake of this technology thus far in Europe and in Japan."", 'We also remain committed to advancing sustainability. We are a mission driven organization focused on improving health and access to care, and we are proud to partner with organizations, such as the International Association for Disability and Oral Health, who promote equitable access to high quality oral healthcare for patients with disabilities. This partnership builds upon the work we have already done in this area with the University of Pennsylvania to provide equipment for their care center for persons with disabilities, which serves several thousand patients each year. Lastly, our Wellspect HealthCare business achieved a new milestone with the validation of its emission reduction target by the science based targets initiative. We believe Wellspect HealthCare has long-standing leadership and expertise in sustainability that can benefit our entire company.', 'And with that, I will hand the call over to Glenn for a more detailed financial update.', ""Glenn Coleman: Thanks, Simon. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us. Today, I'll provide more detail on our first quarter results and an update on our full year 2024 outlook. Let's begin on Slide 5. Our first quarter revenue was $953 million, representing a decline of 2.6% over the prior year quarter. On an organic basis, sales declined 1.9% as foreign currency negatively impacted sales by approximately $7 million or 70 basis points. On a constant currency basis, sales highlights in the quarter included approximately 53% growth in China, 14% growth in our global aligners business, 9% growth in CAD/CAM and 5% growth in Wellspect HealthCare. These improvements were offset by declines in imaging equipment where we continue to experience the effects of market conditions and increased competition."", 'In addition, our Essential Dental Solutions segment had year-over-year declines, largely due to a tougher comp. Despite lower sales, EBITDA margins expanded 30 basis points due to restructuring savings and net investment hedges. Gross margin was flat year-over-year but improved 140 basis points on a sequential basis. Adjusted EPS in the quarter was $0.42, up 8% from prior year, largely due to higher EBITDA margins, a lower share count and a lower effective tax rate. In the first quarter, we generated $25 million of operating cash flow compared to an outflow of $21 million in the prior year quarter. The year-over-year improvement is attributed to improved cash collections and a lower build of inventory. We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet with cash and cash equivalents of $291 million on March 31st.', ""Our Q1 leverage ratio was 2.6 times, slightly higher than our long term targeted rate of 2.5 times. We expect leverage to increase marginally in the second quarter with a plan to end the year at approximately 2.5 times. These projected leverage ratios reflect the share repurchases that Simon noted earlier. Let's now turn to first quarter segment performance on Slide 6. Starting with the Essential Dental Solutions segment, which includes endo, resto and preventive products. Organic sales declined 5.5% due to a tough year-over-year comp. As a reminder, EDS organic sales grew 11.5% in the first quarter of 2023, which benefited from a strong rebound in patient traffic and pre-buying ahead of price increases. Shifting to the Orthodontic and Implant Solutions segment, organic sales grew 5.6% with strong growth from aligners, up 14%."", ""SureSmile, our professional aligner brand, grew 9% and continues to benefit from market share gains, new product offerings and differentiated outcomes. We're expanding further in certain international markets, including Japan and Brazil, which we believe will lead to continued momentum in SureSmile. Byte, our direct-to-consumer aligner brand, grew 18% over the prior year quarter. Byte growth accelerated through the period as the increase in customer interest in impression kit orders that we discussed on our last earnings call began to convert to aligner cases. Implants and Prosthetics grew low single digits in the quarter, highlighted by growth in China due to VBP and partially offset by declines in the US and Europe. Our value implant segment delivered double digit growth."", 'And on the premium side, the new EV family of implants and prosthetic solutions grew double digits outpacing the declines we have seen in legacy brands. Wrapping up our dental performance, CTS, our Connected Technology Solutions segment. So organic sales declined 5.7% versus the prior year quarter and was below our expectations, largely due to double-digit declines in imaging equipment. Our global CAD/CAM business was a bright spot and grew high single digits driven by increased demand in the US. Moving to Wellspect HealthCare. Organic sales grew about 5% with sales growth across all regions as we continue to benefit from new products launched in the last 12 months. We expect Wellspect to grow faster in the second quarter with high single-digit growth over the prior year.', ""Now let's turn to Slide 7 to discuss first quarter financial performance by region. US organic sales grew 1.4% due to strong growth in aligners and CAD/CAM, partially offset by lower sales of imaging equipment as well as a tougher comp in EDS. US CAD/CAM had a strong quarter with double-digit growth in intraoral scanners, mills and 3D printers at both the wholesale and retail level. Distributor inventory levels increased sequentially by approximately $9 million, consistent with normal seasonality. We expect US CAD/CAM distributor inventory levels to fluctuate quarter-to-quarter and be roughly flat by the end of the year compared to current levels. Turning to Europe. Organic sales declined 5.8%, primarily due to lower Essential Dental Solutions and Equipment and Instruments’ volume across the region."", ""This decline was partially offset by SureSmile, which grew over 20% in the region, highlighted by higher demand in Spain, France and Italy. Germany, our largest market in the region, was down double digits versus the prior year quarter. We continue to see prolonged recessionary trends in Germany, largely affecting our equipment business. Excluding Germany, Europe organic sales declined 1.9%. Rest of world organic sales were approximately flat in the quarter, a significant implants growth in China was offset by softer demand for equipment in Japan and Canada. With that, let's move to Slide 8 to discuss our updated outlook for 2024. We're lowering our reported sales range by $50 million to reflect the additional FX headwinds due to the recent strengthening of the dollar versus the euro and other major currencies."", 'At current FX rates, we now expect reported sales to be within the range of $3.91 billion to $3.97 billion. We are maintaining our outlook range for organic sales, which is for flat to 1.5% growth, but trending to the low end of that range based on our first quarter results and the current macro environment largely impacting our imaging business. Our current outlook assumes strong organic sales growth in the second half of the year, primarily driven by double-digit growth in aligners, strong CAD/CAM demand and improvements in EDS and US implants. Moving to profitability. Our outlook for adjusted EBITDA margin of greater than 18% remains unchanged from our prior guidance. Adjusted EPS is trending towards the low end of the outlook range of $2 to $2.10 due to the lower sales expectations.', ""Consistent with the trends we saw in the first quarter, we expect that second quarter organic sales will decline low single digits versus the prior year period. We also expect about a $20 million headwind from foreign currency. Sequentially, reported sales are expected to increase in the second quarter based on normal seasonality. We anticipate second quarter adjusted EPS will be down slightly year-over-year, primarily due to a higher tax rate, partially offset by a slight improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin. With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Simon."", 'Simon Campion: Thank you, Glenn. Moving on to our strategic update on Slide 9. On our last earnings call, I shared the progress we plan to make in 2024 on our foundational initiatives, including supply chain transformation and SKU optimization. We expect these programs to contribute meaningfully to enhancing and sustaining profitability over the long term. We are actively executing each initiative with financial benefits expected to begin in the second half of 2024. We expect that accelerating enterprise digitalization will enable both our customers and our organization to benefit from digitalizing and harmonizing workflows. I already shared the uptick in DS Core adoption rates, which includes both dental practices and labs and which we believe reflects the value it can bring.', ""The new products in our pipeline with expanded connectivity will further enhance the value of embedding DS Core in digital workflows. We've heard firsthand that customers appreciate the workflow efficiencies that we envisioned with this unique, differentiated and unifying platform. We expect our ERP modernization to also play a part in accelerating enterprise digitalization. It is more than a system rollout. It is a true business transformation. Through our phased approach, we plan to transition each country to a single commercial entity, enabling consistent business processes and implementing a range of enhancements to simplify how we conduct business with our customers, improve our operations and accelerate our innovation. We are currently piloting this rollout in several locations with phased deployments expected to start midyear."", ""Lastly, on enterprise digitalization, we are also advancing our data and AI strategy. We are leveraging the expertise of a leading cloud service provider that supports our digital platforms. We expect this important work will improve our customer experience and increase efficiency as we implement our new ERP and bring more functionality to DS Core. Next, let's cover our progress on our objective to win in high-growth categories such as ortho, implants and continence care. In ortho, we have invested in SureSmile reps in Japan and frontline support for Byte. We are already seeing the growth in Byte with sales increasing nearly 18% in Q1 and we expect more than 20% growth for the full year. Byte Plus, our hybrid solution with in-office scanning and connectivity, also continues to expand and has now moved from pilot phase into commercial launch."", 'Feedback has been positive and the business is exceeding its KPIs on this initiative as we continue to ramp the model. SureSmile remains on track to launch in Brazil in the second quarter. We believe this is an important market to further drive geographic expansion in this business. In the US, we have invested in our implants business, expanding the team and enabling them with tools, trainings and growth orientated compensation plans. Implants in China has been a bright spot for our business with the first year of VBP exceeding our expectations. While we expect the program to continue to result in increased volume, we anticipate growth rates in China will moderate for the remainder of the year given the tougher comps. We are also investing in capacity expansion for our Wellspect HealthCare business to support the growth in vision from new product launches.', 'The business delivered mid single-digit growth in Q1. And with its innovation pipeline, we expect the momentum to continue through the remainder of the year and beyond. Lastly, supporting our ability to drive a high-performance culture, we started this year off with well-defined strategic and operational goals. We set clear 2024 KPIs across the company to monitor progress and drive performance. We believe this rigor will enable us to make better decisions as we navigate the dynamic external environment. Moving to our final slide. I would like to reinforce a few key points. First, I want to reiterate that fulfilling our commitments is essential. In Q1, we delivered nearly 8% adjusted EPS growth despite softer sales. While we see this as a positive, we know it is only part of what we need to deliver on.', ""And as such, we remain focused on achieving all of our commitments. Second, we have and will continue to take proactive steps to improve our competitive position, like our global investments in our aligners business and the reintroduction of the Orthophos SL imaging line. In addition, we're continuing to put additional measures in place to improve cost and efficiency. To that point, our strategic initiatives remain on track. We have a clear strategy, detailed plans and well-defined KPIs that we watch closely and refine as needed. As we execute these initiatives, we believe our business will be better positioned for profitable growth as laid out in the schedule shared at Investor Day in a more normal macro environment. And with that, let's now open it up for questions."", 'Operator?', 'See also', '12 Best Alternatives to Adidas Samba and', '20 Beautiful Places in the World Ruined by Overtourism.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

A few years ago, the oil company launched the industry's first fixed-plus-variable dividend framework. It aimed to pay a fixed base dividend each quarter and up to 50% of its excess free cash flow in variable dividends. Higher oil prices in 2022 sent its free cash flow and variable dividend payments soaring. "", 'However, the company shifted its capital return framework this year to give it more flexibility. As a result, its dividend payment was much lower in the first quarter as it emphasized repurchasing its shares. That change could pay off for shareholders in the long run. ', ""Devon Energy recently reported its first-quarter results and declared its latest dividend payment. The company is paying $0.35 per share in dividends, consisting of a $0.22 per share base dividend (which it increased by 10% earlier this year) and a $0.13 per share variable dividend. That combined payout was near Devon's lowest level since it launched the new framework in 2021. "", ""Devon Energy's most recent combined dividend payment cost the company $225 million ($143 million fixed and $82 million variable). It easily covered its dividend with cash flow. The company's operating cash flow totaled $1.7 billion in the quarter (up 4% from the year-ago period), while its free cash flow was $844 million after funding capital projects. That put Devon's total dividend outlay at about 27% of its free cash flow, well below its former target of paying at least 50% of its excess free cash flow in variable dividends (and that was after paying its fixed quarterly dividend). "", 'The company made the strategic decision to use more of its free cash flow to prioritize share repurchases and improve its balance sheet in 2024. It repurchased $205 million in shares during the first quarter. On top of that, Devon has been increasing its cash balance (it grew by $274 million to $1.1 billion at the end of the first quarter). That positions the company to retire $1 billion in debt over the next two years as it matures. ', ""Devon Energy has shifted its capital return focus to share repurchases because the stock trades at a very compelling level compared to the broader market. It trades at a 9% free cash flow yield, assuming oil averages $80 a barrel this year (around the recent level). That's three times higher than the Nasdaq (3% free cash flow yield) and more than double the S&P 500 (4%), implying it's significantly cheaper than those broad market indexes. "", ""That's not unique to Devon Energy. Energy companies currently contribute about 10% of the S&P 500's earnings. However, the sector only makes up about 4% of that broad market index. That's well below the historical average of a little more than 10%. "", 'Given its discounted valuation, Devon can repurchase a meaningful number of its outstanding shares. The $205 million spent on share repurchases in the first quarter retired 4.7 million shares. That brought the total to 49.5 million ($2.5 billion) since it started the program in late 2021. That has retired more than 5% of its outstanding shares. ', ""The company has $500 million remaining on its current $3 billion authorization. That's enough to retire an additional 1.6% of its outstanding shares at its recent market cap. Given its preference for share repurchases, Devon will likely increase its capacity as it gets closer to exhausting the current authorization. "", ""Continued share repurchases will drive higher earnings and production growth rates on a per-share basis. They will also enable the company to continue increasing its base dividend at an attractive rate, since it will make future payments across fewer shares. This faster growth should eventually help boost Devon's valuation. "", 'Devon Energy shifted its capital return strategy this year, giving it more flexibility to prioritize share repurchases. This allows it to take greater advantage of its low valuation, which should help boost its per-share growth rate in the future.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Rick."", ""Rick Muncrief : Thank you, Scott. It's a pleasure to be here this morning. We appreciate everyone taking the time to join us. By all measures, Devon delivered an outstanding set of results in the first quarter that surpassed the operational and financial targets we had set by wide margin. This start to 2024 demonstrates the impressive momentum that we've quickly established setting the stage for our business to continue to strengthen. At this time, I want to personally thank our employees, our service providers and our infrastructure partners in helping us get 2024 off to a great start. For the remainder of my comments for today, I will focus on the drivers of our first quarter outperformance and the factors underpinning our improved outlook for the remainder of the year."", ""So to start off on Slide 6, let's do a quick review of our first quarter results where we had several noteworthy highlights. Starting with production, our delivered volumes came in about 4% higher than planned for the first quarter, averaging 664,000 BOE per day. This production beat was across all products and driven by three key factors. First, and the most significant contributor to this performance was the excellent well productivity we achieved from the 100-plus wells we placed online during the quarter. On average, these high-impact wells exceeded our top curve expectations with strong well productivity in the Delaware Basin, once again, driving our results. Overall, this activity achieved initial production rates that were more than 20% higher than those that we placed online last year."", ""As we progress through this year, I anticipate that these strong recoveries will continue. Secondly, another key factor that drove production higher in the quarter was the improved cycle times we delivered across our drilling and completion operations. Clay will go into much more detail a little later. But simply put, these efficiency gains allowed us to bring forward activity in the quarter and capture more days online than we had planned. And third was a factor that positively contributed to our performance during the quarter was the easing of infrastructure constraints across our Delaware Basin assets. This improvement was directly related to the steps we've taken along with our third-party partners to invest in the build-out of incremental gas processing, compression, water handling and electrification."", ""These crucial capacity additions have positioned us to achieve better run times for our base production and allow us to deploy more activity to the core of this world-class basin. Another notable achievement from the quarter was this team's effective cost management. This was demonstrated by delivering operating costs that were 3% lower than guidance and capital expenditures that were in line with expectations even with an accelerated pace of activity. This positive start to the year puts us in a great position to deliver better cost efficiencies in 2024, especially if we realize incremental savings from deflation as we go through the year. Cutting to the bottom line, the team's comprehensive execution across all aspects of the plan resulted in our 15th consecutive quarter of free cash flow showcasing the durability of our plan to consistently create value through the cycle."", 'With this free cash flow, we continue to reward shareholders through our cash return framework, which was led by stock buybacks and supplemented by another attractive dividend payout. Now moving ahead to Slide 12. And with the strong operational performance achieved year-to-date, we are raising guidance expectations for the full year of 2024. As you can see on the top left, a key contributor to this improved outlook is our 2024 production target increasing by 15,000 BOE per day or 2% to a range of 655,000 to 675,000 BOE per day. To reiterate what I touched on earlier, these higher volume expectations are due to the better-than-expected well performance achieved year-to-date and our confidence in the quality slate of projects that we have lined up over the course of this year.', ""Importantly, we are delivering this incremental production within the confines of our original capital budget of $3.3 billion to $3.6 billion. This level of investment is expected to maintain a steady production profile of about -- for about 10% less capital compared to last year. This program is fully funded at ultra-low breakeven of around $40 per barrel, which equates to one of the lowest breakeven levels of any company in the industry. With our improved full year outlook, we are now positioned to generate greater than 15% more free cash flow in 2024 versus last year at today's pricing levels. This translates into attractive free cash flow yield of 9%, which is nearly 3x higher than what the broader market can offer. With this growing stream of free cash flow, we remain unwavering in our commitment to capital discipline and will seek to reward shareholders with higher cash returns."", 'With our flexible cash return framework, we will allocate our free cash flow toward the best opportunity, whether that be buybacks or dividends. Given that the equity market is still heavily discounting valuation to the energy sector, we plan to continue to prioritize share buybacks over the variable dividend to capture the incredible value that Devon offers at these historically low valuations. So in summary, 2024 is off to an excellent start. We delivered on exactly what we said we would do and much more in the first quarter. Our business continues to get better and build momentum, and this is reflected in our improved outlook for the year. And with the current valuations in this space, the best thing we could do is buy back our stock to capture this value.', ""It's going to be a great year for Devon and the team is energized to build upon this strong start. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Clay. Clay?"", ""Clay Gaspar: Thank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. Devon's first quarter outperformance was the result of strong operational execution across the board, where each asset team delivered results that exceeded targets for production and capital efficiency. As Rick touched on, the great start of the year was underpinned by three key factors: excellent well productivity, improved cycle times and outstanding base production results. For the remainder of my prepared remarks, I plan to cover asset-specific highlights that are driving this positive business momentum and provide insights and observations that drive Devon's improved outlook for 2024. Let's begin on Slide 7 with an overview of our Delaware Basin activity, which accounted for 65% of our capital investment for the quarter."", ""We operated a program of 16 rigs and 4 completion crews across our 400,000 net acre position in the play, resulting in a production growth of 5% compared to the same period last year. This volume growth was driven by 59 new wells brought online that predominantly targeted the Wolfcamp formation. In aggregate, these wells impact -- these high-impact wells achieved average initial flow rates of more than 3,200 BOE per day. This performance results in the best well productivity from our Delaware Basin assets in more than two years. On Slide 8, while we delivered high economic results across the basin, I'd like to drill down on 3 impressive projects that were the biggest drivers of our outperformance for the quarter. On the far left side of the slide, Devon's largest development area in the quarter was the 13-well Van Doo Dah project in our Cotton Draw area of Lea County."", 'With a thoughtful upfront planning and improved efficiencies from our simul frac operations, the team brought Van Doo Dah online nearly two weeks ahead of plan. The massive scale of this project was showcased by the peak flow rates that reached nearly 30,000 gross barrels of oil per day. This further -- this success further reinforces why I believed the STACK pay potential in Cotton Draw to be one of the best tranches of acreage in all of North America. Another networthy project that achieved the highest initial rates of any project in the quarter, was a CBR 1510 in our Stateline area. This three-mile Upper Wolfcamp development was made possible by an acreage trade, recorded average 30-day production rates of 5,600 BOE per day. Very few projects in the history of the Delaware Basin have reached this level of productivity and the expected recovery from this project are also extraordinary projected to exceed 2 million BOE per well.', ""And lastly, I would like to cover a key appraisal success that we had in the quarter and the Wolfcamp B interval of our Thistle area. This proof-of-concept well came in significantly above our predrill expectations with peak rates for the single appraisal well exceeding 5,000 BOE per day. This positive result adds to our resource depth in the Delaware by derisking approximately 50 locations in the area. While the hydrocarbon stream in the deeper Wolfcamp intervals generally shift towards the higher gas rates, the oil cuts are strong enough for this opportunity to compete very effectively for capital in our portfolio. Given this, we expect to incorporate more Wolfcamp B wells into our future multi-zone developments as we plan for our '25 program and beyond."", ""Turning to Slide 9. We are clearly off to a great start with our 2024 plan in the Delaware. As you can see on the left, our well productivity is on track to materially improve year-over-year. As a reminder, this improvement is driven by returning to a higher allocation of capital to New Mexico, where our inventory depth is the greatest. It is important to note that we have not changed spacing or lateral length to achieve these improvements. Importantly, as you can see to the right of this slide, we're also pairing this with improved well productivity in the Delaware Basin with efficiency gains. The adoption of simul frac across the board segment -- across the broader segment of our activity has been a key driver of compressed cycle times, but the high-grading of rig fleets also drive down overall well cost is contributing."", ""I want to congratulate the teams for this success, and expect this momentum in the Delaware to continue as we work our way through the year. We included Slide 10 to remind everyone of the recent infrastructure build-out that we either led, participated in or just are benefiting from. Our patience in giving this highly prolific area, some breathing room for this infrastructure to mature was the right decision from an economic perspective as well as an environmental standpoint. Slide 11 is an updated view of Enverus' remaining inventory of the top Delaware Basin producers. As you can see from this credible third parties perspective, we have one of the largest inventories among operators in the basin, providing us with a multi-decade resource that will drive enterprise-wide performance for many years to come."", ""While the Delaware Basin is the driving force behind our performance, we do value a diversified portfolio across the very best oil and liquids-rich basins in the United States. I would also like to briefly highlight a few items from those basins. In the Eagle Ford, the steps we have taken to tighten our capital efficiency are yielding results. In the first quarter, we brought online 26 infill wells and a handful of highly successful refracs that resulted in oil growth rate of 7% year-over-year. Importantly, we're able to deliver this growth while spending 13% less capital versus the average run rate of 2023. This improved capital efficiency is driven by less appraisal requirements to tactically advance our redevelopment of the field, along with the benefits of a more balanced program across our assets in DeWitt and Karnes Counties."", 'In the Williston Basin, production increased 9% in the quarter. This performance exceeded our internal expectations due to excellent well productivity in the core of the play from our [indiscernible] and North John Elk projects and better uptimes from our base productions. For the full year, the oil-weighted production stream for this asset is on track to generate up to $500 million of cash flow for the company. Moving to the Powder River Basin. Our activity in 2024 is designed to build upon the well productivity gains we achieved last year where our Niobrara wells increased flow rates by 20% from historic levels. For the rest of 2024, we plan to bring online around 10 Niobrara wells across our acreage in Converse County. The objective of this activity is to refine our view on spacing and optimize completions designs to drive down costs as we advance this area towards full field development.', ""Lastly, in the Anadarko Basin, with the recent weakness in gas price, our capital activity was limited to 1 project placed online in the first quarter, but the flow rates were very impressive. The Allen pad that co-developed both the Meramec and Woodford formations achieved peak cumulative rates for this pad of five wells exceeding 20,000 BOE per day with liquids comprising nearly 40% of the production mix. As we look to the rest of 2024, we're reducing activity to 2 rigs in our Dow JV area and intend to bring online the majority of the activity in the second half of the year to capture the higher gas price expected in the winter months. In summary, I'm proud of the capital-efficient results that our team has delivered this quarter and the strong momentum that we have built as we look to execute on our plan over the remainder of the year and beyond."", ""And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff for a financial review. Jeff?"", ""Jeff Ritenour: Thanks, Clay. I'll spend my time today covering the key drivers of our first quarter financial results and provide some insights into our outlook for the rest of the year. Beginning with production. We had very strong results across the board in the first quarter, driving our improved full year outlook. Looking specifically at the second quarter, we expect this production momentum to continue with volumes increasing to a range of 670,000 to 690,000 BOE per day. This expected growth is driven by higher completion activity in the Delaware Basin, resulting from the fourth frac crew we put to work at the beginning of the year in the core of Southeast New Mexico. On the capital front, we remain confident in our guidance range for the full year."", 'Spending will be slightly skewed to the first half of the year, roughly 55% of our budget due primarily to the cadence of Delaware completion activity. This spending will begin to moderate as we move from four to three frac crews in the Delaware resulting in a lower capital spending profile in the second half of the year. With regard to pricing, the recent strength in price of oil has provided a meaningful impact to our returns and cash flow generation capabilities. For every dollar uplift in WTI, we generate around $100 million of incremental annual cash flow. On the gas side, we are experiencing weakness in Waha pricing within the Permian. But as a reminder, our exposure is limited given our firm takeaway and basis hedging. Looking ahead, we expect the situation to improve with the Matterhorn pipeline scheduled to come online later this year.', ""Moving to expenses. We did a good job controlling field level costs during the quarter. Our lease operating and GP&T costs totaled $9.27 per BOE in the quarter coming in below the bottom end of our guidance range. Looking ahead to the rest of the year, we expect our field level cost to remain relatively stable, and we feel very comfortable with our full year guidance ranges. Moving to the bottom line. We generated $1.7 billion of operating cash flow during the quarter. This level of cash flow funded all capital requirements and resulted in $844 million of free cash flow for the quarter. With this free cash flow, we continue to prioritize share repurchases in the first quarter. We repurchased 205 million of stock in the quarter, bringing our total activity to $2.5 billion since the program's inception in late 2021."", ""With a $3 billion authorization in place, we have plenty of runway to compound our per share growth as we work our way through the year. In addition to our buyback program, another key use of our excess cash in the quarter was the funding of our fixed plus variable dividend with the Board declaring a payout of $0.35 per share. This distribution will be paid at the end of June. And to round out my prepared remarks this morning, I'd like to give a brief update on our investment-grade financial position. In the first quarter, our cash balances increased by $274 million to a total of $1.1 billion. With this increased liquidity, Devon exited the quarter with a very healthy net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0.7x. Looking ahead, with the excess free cash flow that accrues to our balance sheet, we plan to build liquidity and retire maturing debt."", ""Our next debt maturity comes due in September of this year, totaling $472 million, and we'll have the opportunity to retire another $485 million of notes in late 2025. And with that, I'll now turn the call back over to Rick for some closing comments."", ""Rick Muncrief: Thank you, Jeff. To wrap up our prepared remarks this morning, I want to reinforce a few key messages. Number one, we're delivering on exactly what we promised to do and then some in the first quarter. Our disciplined execution and outperformance of the plan demonstrates the momentum that we've established setting the stage for our business to strengthen as we go through the year. Secondly, with this great start to the year, we're raising our 2024 production guidance. This improved outlook is underpinned by efficiency gains from excellent well productivity, faster cycle times and better base production results, anchored by our franchise asset into Delaware. Number three, furthermore, this improved outlook is also manifested in higher free cash flow that will translate into higher cash returns for our shareholders."", ""Given the value proposition that we offer, the best thing we can do is prioritize repurchasing our shares. And lastly, our long-duration resource base is one of the deepest of any company out there. We continue to find ways to add resource. You heard some of that this morning. This was evidenced by our continued success in Wolfcamp B, positive redevelopment results in Eagle Ford and productivity breakthroughs in the Powder River Basin. And with that, I'll now turn the call back over to Scott for Q&A."", ""Scott Coody: Thanks, Rick. We'll now open the call to Q&A. Please limit yourself to one question and a follow-up. This will allow us to get to more of your questions on the call today. With that, operator, we'll take our first question."", 'See also', '30 Wealthiest People in India and', 'Top 10 Artificial Intelligence (AI) SEO Tools in 2024.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

They say: ""Have you heard about [the latest headline-grabbing thing]? You should look into it because it\'s going to be big.""', 'Many investors are looking to find the next big thing with their investments, and it\'s possible to make a lot of money that way. But strong returns are found in mature businesses as well. And whereas very few ""next-big-thing"" stocks actually work out, mature businesses give investors a much higher probability of success.', 'Two such mature businesses are United Rentals (NYSE: URI) and Waste Management (NYSE: WM). They specialize in equipment rentals and garbage disposal, respectively. Investors yawn at these boring businesses. But both are outpacing the returns of the S&P 500 by a wide margin over the last 10 years.', 'Moreover, both United Rentals and Waste Management just reported quarterly financial results, showing once again that these are unstoppable businesses for the long haul.', ""With more than 1,500 locations in North America, United Rentals is the market-share leader for equipment rentals with 15% of the market. The company has a fleet of equipment valued at $21 billion as of March. And by managing this fleet well with both rentals and sales when appropriate, it's become a free cash flow machine."", 'On April 24, United Rentals reported financial results for the first quarter of 2024. It generated free cash flow of $869 million during the quarter. This puts it on track to generate $2.1 billion for the year. If it hits its full-year goal, the company will have earned over $10 billion in free cash flow in just five years. Not bad for a company with a market cap of $46 billion as of this writing.', ""United Rentals doesn't idly sit on its cash. It buys other businesses to increase its market share. Most recently, in March, it acquired Yak Access (a company that facilitates access in right of ways) for $1.1 billion in cash. Management also habitually buys back stock, which partly explains why its earnings per share are reaching record highs."", ""In 2024, United Rentals' management hopes to generate around $15 billion in revenue. But in 2028, it hopes to generate $20 billion in revenue. Therefore, there's still upside for investors who buy shares of this unstoppable business today."", 'Like United Rentals, Waste Management reported financial results for the first quarter of 2024 on April 24. And as is usually the case, revenue is up for the company and profits are hitting new records.', 'Waste Management has competitive advantages. It operates various landfills and recycling plants, which require permitting and are costly to get started. It also has an incredibly high customer retention rate, since trash removal and recycling are services that are constantly needed.', ""Waste Management already generates plenty of free cash flow -- it expects at least $2 billion in 2024 alone. But the company's free cash flow isn't quite where it could be because it's been spending heavily on a project that harvests gas from its landfills and converts it into usable fuel."", ""The cost to invest in this project is already going down for Waste Management and is expected to unlock higher profitability in coming years. In Q1, the company finished one of its landfill-to-natural-gas projects and expects to commission four more facilities this year. These facilities add to the company's profits by harvesting something it already has just sitting in its landfills."", 'Waste Management uses much of its profits to give back to shareholders. The company had $714 million in Q1 free cash flow. In comparison, it returned $557 million to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks. This shows that management is intent on rewarding shareholders.', ""I believe that both United Rentals and Waste Management are top dogs with competitive advantages that will make their businesses unstoppable for years to come. That said, I wouldn't say that either stock is necessarily a good deal right now."", 'From a free-cash-flow perspective, Waste Management stock is clearly trading at an above-average price. For its part, the chart makes it look like United Rentals is trading at a relative bargain. But the average is thrown off by a couple of anomalies. United Rentals stock often trades at half of its current valuation.', ""United Rentals and Waste Management are great businesses -- and, consequently, great stocks to buy and hold for the long term. However, neither is a timely opportunity.

Value investors who like to invest in profitable companies with high gross margins and net income have made shrewd investments in businesses with a solid track record over these twenty years. For example instead of NVDA, we identified the cheapest AI stock that is trading at less than 5 times market value excluding cash and investments using the value investing approach.', 'The present condition of the stock market is better understood in the context of a recent research report by investment advisory Deutsche Bank.

Our view on the cycle risk was simple – the long-term growth outlook was tremendous given the proliferation of electronics and software in everyday objects, and the downturn had already begun, and a healthy amount of it was known. We ignored the near-term outlook for profits, assuming they would be down substantially. It turned out that the downturn was more severe than most other investors or industry observers had forecasted.

So, it could witness a trend reversal down the road.', 'While the formation of a hammer pattern is a technical indication of nearing a bottom with potential exhaustion of selling pressure, rising optimism among Wall Street analysts about the future earnings of this chipmaker is a solid fundamental factor that enhances the prospects of a trend reversal for the stock.', 'What is a Hammer Chart and How to Trade It?', ""This is one of the popular price patterns in candlestick charting. A minor difference between the opening and closing prices forms a small candle body, and a higher difference between the low of the day and the open or close forms a long lower wick (or vertical line). The length of the lower wick being at least twice the length of the real body, the candle resembles a 'hammer.'"", ""In simple terms, during a downtrend, with bears having absolute control, a stock usually opens lower compared to the previous day's close, and again closes lower. On the day the hammer pattern is formed, maintaining the downtrend, the stock makes a new low. However, after eventually finding support at the low of the day, some amount of buying interest emerges, pushing the stock up to close the session near or slightly above its opening price."", 'When it occurs at the bottom of a downtrend, this pattern signals that the bears might have lost control over the price.

Now, I’d like to turn the call over to David Gibbs.', 'David Gibbs: Thank you, Matt and good morning everyone. I am pleased to report that Yum! grew core operating profit 6% this quarter despite a challenging operating environment, demonstrating the resilience of our business. As we communicated last earnings, 1Q should represent our most challenging sales quarter this year as we work through tough year ago lapse returned to a more normal inflationary environment and navigated discrete consumer demand pressures. While the impacts from the Middle East conflict have been scattered and difficult to measure, we have begun to see improvement in the most impacted markets. Taco Bell U.S. outperformed the industry on same-store sales and delivered industry-leading margins, while 1Q unit openings at KFC International set us up for a strong unit growth story in 2024.', 'We continued to make significant progress scaling our proprietary digital and AI-powered platforms and are excited by plans to accelerate deployment. Digital sales continued an upward trajectory approaching $8 billion and were up 11% year-over-year. Through continued kiosk deployment, greater adoption of click-and-collect and stable third-party aggregator sales, digital mix improved 5 points and for the first time ever, represented over 50% of system sales in Q1. We now have $30 billion in annualized digital sales, which by itself would represent one of the largest restaurant companies in the world. Overall, despite a more challenged operating environment, we have reached impressive new milestones and remain on track to deliver on our long-term growth algorithm target of at least 8% core operating profit growth for the full year.', 'Now I’ll discuss our Relevant, Easy and Distinctive brands, or R.E.D. for short, followed by our Unrivaled Culture and Talent and Good Growth strategy. Chris will then provide an update on our first quarter results, followed by our bold restaurant development, unmatched operating capabilities and balance sheet position. Starting with the KFC division, which accounts for 51% of our divisional operating profit. KFC grew system sales 4% this quarter, owing to an 8% unit growth and a 2% decline in same-store sales. The same-store sales pressure was partially attributable to impacts from the conflict in the Middle East, which have begun to ease and we expect a 2-year trend for KFC International overall to accelerate in the same quarter. We saw strong top line growth in other parts of the world, including Latin America, Africa and Greater Asia.', 'System sales in Latin America grew 22% on the heels of a strong marketing calendar and continued success of the KFC original nuggets. In Africa, system sales grew 11%, thanks to 5% same-store sales growth driven by product innovation and 6% net new unit growth. In Greater Asia where system sales grew 8%, we recently partnered with a new franchisee in Korea, who is driving transaction growth with a calendar focused on core, value and expanding consumer access, which resulted in a 26% growth in same-store sales. At KFC U.S., same-store sales were pressured from unfavorable weather events and chicken value promotions from QSR competitors. Moving on to the Taco Bell division, which represents 35% of our divisional operating profit and 75% of our U.S. divisional operating profit.', 'System sales at Taco Bell U.S. grew 4%, led by 2% same-store sales growth and a strong outcome on top of last year’s 9% same-store sales growth. Sales improved throughout the quarter after difficult weather events in January. Taco Bell focused on key levers within its magic formula to drive growth, including building brand buzz, providing value to our consumers and expanding into new category entry points. We know that when we execute on this magic formula, Taco Bell puts itself at the center of the cultural conversation. There was no better example of this than the Live Más LIVE event Taco Bell held in Las Vegas to share its upcoming innovation calendar, an industry-first event. Of course, it was not surprising that Fast Company named Taco Bell the Most Innovative Company in Dining and #8 overall.', 'Early in the quarter, the team launched a new cravings value menu and ended the quarter with a successful launch of the Chicken Cantina menu. The cravings value menu features industry-leading value with 10 items priced under $3 providing consumers with craveable everyday value offering. Nearly one-third of transactions contain an item off the cravings value menu, and when purchased, 80% have at least one other item added, translating to a nearly 10% check uplift compared to non-cravings value menu checks. The impressive performance of such product launches is compounded by Taco Bell’s ability to deliver industry leading margins on top of a great consumer experience. At Taco Bell International, system sales grew 6% this quarter. The team is focused on building brand and category awareness globally.', 'This included markets such as Canada and Latin America, where the team elevated the core menu and launched the Chicken Cantina menu to expand their consumer base. Next, at the Pizza Hut division, which comprises 15% of our divisional operating profit. During the first quarter, system sales declined 4% with 5% unit growth and a 7% decline in same-store sales. The year-over-year growth rate in same-store sales was suppressed from difficult year ago lapse and the ongoing impact from the conflict in the Middle East. The team continued to focus on the individual meal occasion this quarter with the India market launching the Melts platform. At Pizza Hut U.S., same-store sales declined 6% as we lapped the launch of Melts and Big New Yorker Pizza. However, the 2-year trend was positive and improved from last quarter.', 'Lastly, at The Habit Burger Grill, for the first quarter, system sales declined 2% with 6% unit growth. Margin trends improved throughout the quarter with a combination of initiatives leading to a 60 basis point improvement in store level margins year-over-year. Now, I will turn to our Good Growth strategy, starting with our people pillar. Effective June 1, Alex Barsk will join KFC Global as the new Chief Financial Officer. Alex is joining from Pizza Hut, where she most recently served as Global CFO. Alex joined Pizza Hut in 2015 and has held several leadership roles across strategy, finance, development and supply chain. Alex’s transition is another great example of Yum! leveraging its talent across brands to help share unique learnings and experiences.', 'To round out our people pillar, I’d like to congratulate and thank Yum!’s Senior Vice President of Finance, Corporate Controller and my friend, Dave Russell, who recently celebrated his 25th anniversary at Yum! with today marking his 100th quarterly earnings announcement. Dave has been with the company since 1999, always serving as a trusted leader who brings his deep knowledge and analytical perspective to our finance and accounting function. Thank you, Dave, for your dedication to our growth over the last 25 years and I look forward to your continued partnership in the future. Before I hand it over to Chris, I would like to share a few thoughts on the future of our digital and technology strategy given we achieved an important milestone this quarter with more than half of our sales coming from digital.', 'You will recall that the first phase of our journey to become the leading global digital restaurant company began in earnest in 2019. That first phase focused on building or acquiring a comprehensive suite of owned platforms, spanning Easy Experiences, Easy Operations and Easy Insights and accelerating deployment of those platforms across our brands and markets. While we still have further to go in deploying these platforms, we have achieved critical mass in several areas. Taco Bell U.S., one of our twin growth engines, has achieved the most extensive deployment of key platforms, including the Poseidon POS system, the Yum! e-commerce platform and the AIM inventory management platform. Our other primary growth engine, KFC International, has been accelerating the rollout of those same platforms and is our leader in deploying in-store kiosk technology.', 'Pizza Hut, of course, has been our leader in deploying Dragontail to thousands of restaurants around the globe. Behind the scenes, our global data hub houses data generated from these platforms. The deployment of our capabilities in this first phase of our journey has driven the dramatic increase in our digital sales from approximately 20% in 2019 to over 50% now. The impact of this growth has been significant. To share just a couple of examples of impact, our consumers enjoy more convenient and frictionless experiences, leading to high frequency and check sizes. Our franchisees enjoy significant productivity benefits as their team members no longer spend time taking orders and payments for half of all transactions, leading to stronger unit economics.', 'We believe we are still only scratching the surface of the full value creation potential of our capabilities. While the first phase of work in deploying our platforms will continue, given the critical mass we have achieved, we have initiated a second parallel phase in our technology journey. This second phase will focus on maximizing the value creation potential of our platforms through the acceleration of AI capabilities in combination with fully leveraging the immense data assets we now own. With our platform-driven approach, we can now more easily integrate AI capabilities across our digital ecosystem. We currently have more than 40 AI initiatives in progress across the company spanning marketing, operations, insights, engineering and our internal back-office functions.', 'While many of these initiatives will remain confidential for now, one example that we have shared publicly is Voice AI to enhance our consumer experience. We have been testing this capability at the drive-thru in 5 Taco Bell stores in California. We are expanding that test to 30 stores in Q2 based on positive consumer feedback. Another example is our piloting of AI-powered technology in our SuperApp restaurant general manager support tool, making it even easier and faster for managers to access critical operational information to make better decisions. Of course, our Dragontail platform was the first AI-enabled next-gen restaurant operational system to enhance the consumer and team member experience in a multi-channel fulfillment environment.', 'As an example of how we are elevating the use of our data assets, in Q1, we launched the R.E.D. 360 U.S. Consumer Data Insights system. As of Q1, both Pizza Hut U.S. and Taco Bell U.S. have integrated into the system and KFC U.S. will integrate in the second quarter. This system allows us to leverage insights into consumer behavior across our brands in the U.S. After full deployment, R.E.D. 360 will be the first scaled cross-brand U.S. restaurant consumer data engine in the quick service industry and will pave the way for unique insights and personalization opportunities on digital and social channels. For those who may have missed it Joe Park, our Chief Digital and Technology Officer, was recently interviewed in The Wall Street Journal, bringing to life many of these plans as we become more focused on pursuing AI and data-driven innovation.', 'As we do all of this, we are also continually innovating how our technology teams work internally to better leverage our scale so that we can continue to bend the curve on the net investment impact of these digital and technology initiatives. To sum it up, we are excited about having ramped up this second phase in our journey and are doubling down and pursuing the ultimate goal of our digital and technology strategy, which is to better serve our franchisees, providing them with more, better, faster, cheaper and safer technology while simultaneously delighting consumers and maximizing Yum! shareholders’ returns. We will continue to provide updates on both phases of our journey on future calls, organized around our easy capability framework.', 'In closing, as I look back over the quarter, I am proud of our teams and their ability to navigate any environment as our brands stand for unmatched value and convenience, providing a range of products and price points to meet any consumers’ needs. Our resilient business model, coupled with our strategy to leverage our technology platforms on a global scale, gives me confidence we will continue to improve both franchisee and Yum! economics. Looking ahead, our initiatives to become an even more nimble and data-driven organization are underway and I am excited for the shareholder value we will create. With that, Chris, over to you.', 'Chris Turner: Thank you, David and good morning everyone. Today, I’ll discuss our financial results, our bold restaurant development and unmatched operating capability growth drivers, followed by an update on our balance sheet and capital strategy. Starting with our results. First quarter system sales grew by 2% driven by 6% unit growth. As we communicated on our last call, we expected the first quarter to be our most challenged from a same-store sales perspective due to prior year lapse, a return to a more normal inflationary environment and discrete consumer demand pressures, including markets impacted by the Middle East conflict. We believe the markets most impacted by the conflict collectively created a low single-digit headwind on Yum!’s overall Q1 same-store sales.', 'Despite these challenges, I’m pleased to report Yum! delivered 6% core operating profit growth exceeding our internal plan and demonstrating the resilience of our profit model. First quarter ex special general and administrative expenses were $265 million, down 4% year-over-year, a continuation of the G&A momentum we had in the fourth quarter. Reported G&A was $286 million and includes $21 million in special expense related to ongoing resource optimization, which we expect to generate additional savings in the second half. Reported operating profit included a 2-point impact in the quarter from foreign currency translation. First quarter ex-special EPS was $1.15, which includes negative after-tax impacts of $0.08 from investment losses and $0.03 from foreign currency translation.', 'As a reminder, we shared on our last call the intent to purchase 218 KFC UK and Ireland stores. We’re excited to report we officially closed this acquisition at the end of April. These stores have average unit volumes above $2 million and healthy store level cash margins. We expect the addition of these units to provide approximately $40 million of incremental EBITDA in the 12 months after acquisition while the benefit to our operating profit will be largely offset over the next several years due to depreciation and amortization, including amortization of reacquired franchisees. Now let me share greater detail on our first quarter unit growth in the context of our Bold Restaurant Development growth driver. Yum! opened over 800 units in the first quarter.', 'We reached the incredible milestone of opening KFC’s 30,000 restaurant globally. As the number one brand on Entrepreneur Magazine’s Top Global Franchise rankings, KFC continues to demonstrate strong desirability among global franchisees with a new store opening every 3 hours. We continue to see an incremental store opportunity of 50,000 KFCs over the long-term. Across the global system, the outlook for development in 2024 is strong. We expect to continue to open units in a broad range of markets, which last year included over 100 markets, and to cross the 60,000 unit milestone. Further solidifying Yum!’s position as the world’s leading multi-brand restaurant franchisor. There are several reasons we remain confident in these trends. First, we entered 2024 with broad-based development momentum.', 'In Q1, we grew units across 81 brand-country combinations. Second, we have large, committed franchisees who have entered into more unit development commitments for 2024 than in each of the prior 2 years. Approximately 80% of 2024 exceeded new builds for KFC outside of China are part of development commitments. Third, the development white space remains massive. We have just 6% of the global QSR market. China is a prolific developer and serves only one-third of the China population. In India, which is the fastest-growing global economy, KFC and Pizza Hut have been the fastest and third fastest-growing QSR chains, respectively, since 2019. Finally, our brands unit economics remain attractive across key markets where scale and first-mover advantages put our franchisees in a position of strength.', 'Scale leads to unique advantages including access to alternative financing solutions, dedicated development teams and in-depth market knowledge. Scale also offers operating advantages. For instance, our largest partner, Yum China, has AI-enabled digital tools to allow its restaurant general managers to oversee multiple restaurants, creating unmatched savings that can be passed to consumers. The Serrano Group based in Latin America and Ramcar based in the Philippines run their own poultry processing facilities in addition to distribution capabilities, giving them cost and reliability advantages. At a brand level, KFC has food innovation kitchens in Canada, the U.S., Latin America and the Caribbean, United Kingdom, Thailand, Australia, South Africa, India and Singapore.', 'Perhaps underappreciated, our global innovation capabilities are real sources of differentiation. Moving now to the digital and technology front. Recall that our vision is to empower our franchisees with leading-edge technology solutions with advantaged economics. As David put it, we want to deliver more, better, faster, cheaper and safer technology to our franchise partners. We are advantaged by owning important foundational platforms such as our Poseidon POS system, Yum! e-commerce, Dragontail, SuperApp and our global data hub, and the impact of these platforms will grow exponentially as we deploy more of them to more stores. Data is becoming a crucial differentiator, enabling us and our franchisees to generate better insights and make better decisions.', 'On this front, quick service restaurants will benefit disproportionately because of the high frequency nature of our consumer visits, which results in more data. Within quick service, a few characteristics will separate us from our competitors, including our multi-brand portfolio, our scale and global footprint, our ownership of key platforms and the increasing integration between our platforms. We will leverage our data for insights and to drive more effective marketing and loyalty engagement, and we will deploy advanced AI tools to all aspects of our business. As we leverage our scale more and more in these areas, we can be faster, cheaper and safer through consistency and standardization across our environment. Let me now discuss the digital and technology accomplishments for Q1 across our Easy Experiences, Easy Operations and Easy Insights pillars.', 'Beginning with our Easy Experiences pillar. We continued to onboard Pizza Hut U.S. to the Yum! e-commerce platform with a full cutover planned by Q3, followed by three Pizza Hut international markets by year-end. For Taco Bell U.S., where the Yum! Commerce platform is fully operational, we have accelerated viral promotions and have seen Taco Bell’s digital ordering capacity increase tenfold relative to the legacy system. Within Easy Operations, the expansion of our world-class technology products and platforms continued. We expanded Poseidon to 1,800 Taco Bell U.S. restaurants, bringing our total to over 7,000 restaurants. We onboarded over 500 Pizza Hut restaurants onto the Dragontail AI platform, bringing our system total to over 7,000 restaurants.', 'In the near future, we plan to nationally roll out Dragontail’s kitchen display system and Poseidon to our KFC U.S. restaurants. Finally, our custom-built SuperApp, which provides smart, automated routine management tools for our restaurant managers, is now used in nearly 9,500 Pizza Hut and KFC restaurants with significant expansion plans underway for KFC. For the third pillar of our Easy strategy, Easy Insights, KFC and Pizza Hut have continued to scale a new experienced management program allowing the brands to draw insights from an expanded source of consumer reviews across digital channels, including third-party aggregators and social media in addition to guest survey responses. KFC is now live in 10,000 restaurants and has seen a fivefold increase in per-store data point.', 'Pizza Hut expanded this service to 7,000 restaurants across more than 50 countries. Talking about all of the tremendous advancements underway excites me about the future. This work will be vital as we embark on further innovation behind voice AI, restaurant automation and better leveraging our loyalty programs. Next, I’ll provide an update on our balance sheet and liquidity position. Net capital expenditures for the quarter were $38 million, reflecting $49 million in gross CapEx and $11 million in refranchising proceeds. Our net leverage ratio ended the quarter at 4.1x. In the quarter, we sold our minority investment in Devyani for $104 million, representing a $73 million increase in value since acquisition. Our cash balance ended at $652 million, reflecting proceeds from the Devyani investment sale and modest accumulation in cash to finance the KFC UK acquisition.', 'With the KFC UK deal behind us, our cash balance will return to a normalized rate of around $400 million, excluding the unrepatriated Devyani proceeds. Thereafter, with no significant debt maturities in 2024 or 2025, we plan to use our excess free cash flow primarily to fund share repurchases, absent accretive investments we choose to make. I will reiterate that our capital priorities are guided by maximizing shareholder value. This includes investing in the business, maintaining a resilient balance sheet, offering a competitive dividend and returning excess cash to our shareholders. Subsequent to the quarter end, we renewed our pro rata credit facility, including our revolving credit facility and Term Loan A. We were pleased to renew the $2 billion facility with the same pricing and terms that we achieved in 2021 while also increasing the revolver from $1.25 billion to $1.5 billion.', 'Now let me discuss our latest outlook on full year 2024. We are confident that 2024 will showcase a strong unit development story at or above 5% unit growth, led by KFC International as franchisees capitalize on our brand’s attractive paybacks. In the U.S., Taco Bell continues to balance core everyday value to cater to a more discerning consumer across income groups with premium innovation to attract new consumers. We expect full year Taco Bell company-operated margins to be in the range of 23% to 24%. Excluding the 53rd week, we now expect ex special G&A to be flat to down slightly for the year, including incremental G&A associated with the KFC UK acquisition. Finally, we are confident we will deliver at least 8% core operating profit growth excluding the benefit of the 53rd week.', 'To close, I am incredibly proud of the progress we have made over the last few years in the areas to which we dedicated our focus and internal resources. Our team continues to manage through industry challenges to position us for a strong year and deliver our long-term operating profit plan, reinforcing the resilience of our business, strength of our talent and commitment to our shareholders. Going forward, we are moving to solidify ourselves as the multi-brand franchisor of choice through a more efficient adaptable, data-driven organization. We are only in the early innings of unlocking the value of our unmatched data, which will help power our aspirations and deliver sustained above-market shareholder returns.

Fools great to have you both here."", 'Ron Gross: How you doing Dylan?', ""Dylan Lewis: Yeah Ron, we've got to look at banking, real estate, and observance of financial literacy month and of course stocks on our radar but we're going to start off with the earnings parade. We're going to start off one of the most highly followed Fool stocks out there. Ron, Netflix reported this week shares down 7% following the report. The OG streamer posted what looked like a pretty good report, revenue, earnings, subscribers all ahead of expectations. Ron, stock is down. What gives?"", ""Ron Gross: Exactly, you nailed it. Big report from Netflix, we'll get into some of the metrics but the stock sold off I think mostly because of some disappointing revenue guidance for the rest of this year and also a bit of lack of transparency from the company going forward which the analysts community for sure does not appreciate. But we can talk about that in a bit. Let's look at some of the numbers. They added 9.3 million subscribers in the quarter, particular strength in the US and Canada."", ""That's even more impressive when you consider that expectations were only for 4.8. They did 9.3, expectations were 4.8. Pretty good. Was a drop from last quarter's 13 million though I don't think anyone expected to be anywhere near that but they did a really nice job. Their total subscribers now almost 270 million. Again, pretty impressive as we know streaming not the easiest business to get right. Revenue up 15% helped by recent price increases for some plans. A crackdown on password sharing that has annoyed my family to no end and the new ad-supported tier which now make up 40% of all sign-ups in markets where they offer that plan and those ad supported memberships grew 65%."", ""The company will stop reporting paid quarterly membership and revenue per subscriber data starting with the first quarter of 2025 investors not a fan of that. Analysts don't like that. It hurts them in creating their models. They want more transparency not less, turn some people off. That could be because why the stock is a bit weak there but margins were up, operating margins approach 28%. That's up seven percentage points EPFs up a whopping 83%. Guidance was weak, 16% for the quarter, 13%-15% for the year on the revenue side, that sounds good to me but if you don't really knock the cover off the ball with the way the stock has been, you're going to get into some trouble. Trading at around 40 times free cash flow right now not cheap but this is a good report."", ""Dylan Lewis: Ron, it sounds like your family with the password crackdown might be helping juice those subscriber numbers that are going away. My question for you is, and I think Netflix's management acknowledges. They said we used to be accompany that wasn't profitable so we said focus on the subscriber numbers. Now we're profitable. Don't worry about the subscriber numbers. What should we be watching here if we're losing this key metric?"", ""Ron Gross: Well, we definitely need to understand the subscriber base for sure. Now because they pay different prices now some ad supported some higher-priced, it's not as easy. It's not one for one anymore. That's their reason for saying we're going to stop being as transparent. More transparency would actually help solve that problem if they gave us a breakdown of all of their memberships but they seem to not want to do that so we can treat this mostly as a regular company. How is revenue doing? How are margins doing? How is profitability? But then we for sure need to know the direction of the subscriber base as a whole."", 'Dylan Lewis: Matt, are you buying that narrative? Focus on this not that?', ""Matthew Argersinger: I'm going to buy whatever Reed Hastings is showing me because this is as you called it the OG streaming network. It's remarkable actually to me to see whatever Netflix is reporting, the fact that subscriber numbers are still growing the way they are. Especially in the US, I know that password crack down is having an effect. Just to see the other streaming players especially the ones who seemed like they had the playbook. Netflix wrote this playbook over a decade."", ""They came in, great content, grabbed a lot of subscribers but they're flailing around now and Paramount's in the process of probably going private. I'm just continually impressed by the core Netflix audience. I don't know if this is true but the portfolio of streaming apps that everyone has nowadays, it feels Netflix is the one that no one's letting go of. Maybe Netflix and Disney Plus everything else is like I'll subscribe to it if I see something interesting but probably not sticking with it. That's an incredible position of strength for them."", ""Ron Gross: The others including behemoth Disney or finding out it turns out that streaming is a tough business. It's a member acquisition business, it's a content business, and it's an expense cost structure business and you can be unprofitable for a long time until you get all three of those things correct."", 'Dylan Lewis: This week we also got an earnings update from arguably the most important company in the world, Matt Taiwan Semiconductors management called AI related demand insatiable in their commentary with earnings. Did that show up in the results?', ""Matthew Argersinger: It certainly did and I'm glad it's right for them to point that out because it is the area of the business that it's growing really fast. In fact, the super computing business, the high performance computing technology part of the business,the five-nanometer and three-nanometer wafers seems really small. I don't know how small but I guess that's microscopic. But these are the chips that power essentially all the big artificial intelligence language models applications. That makes up almost 50% of TSM's revenue and it's expected to double in 2024."", ""That's really impressive. It plays right into the results. You're seeing in a revenue up 16.5% in a quarter. Revenue in the current quarter, the second quarter is expected to increase 28%. That's an acceleration and well ahead of expectations. I would say the reason though the TSM is really focusing on the AI part the high performance part of their business is because the other side of the business, the smartphone side of the business which is still the lion's share of revenue and earnings, that's in a bit of a slump right now and it's interesting that to me it points to maybe a larger concern with Apple in particular."", ""The next iteration of iPhone, iPhones don't really capture the imagination as they've had in the past. People aren't replacing their phones fast enough. I know my phone is going on three years old. I don't see a need to replace it as fast as they used to. I wonder if TSMs earnings actually tell a bigger story about Apple and the smartphone market and where that's heading. As great as the AI growth is, at least in the near-term it can't really offset the slump in that business and so that's got me a little concerned about TSM."", ""Dylan Lewis: One of the other things that pops up with TSM was in April, the company's home Taiwan was hit by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake. We got some commentary from management around the impact of that and met so far it seems it won't be that disruptive. I know that was a big concern just with the global chip trade being so reliant on Taiwan."", ""Matthew Argersinger: That's right. They spent some time touting we're opening assets, we're developing assets all around the world so really diversifying our manufacturing. But the reality is that's going to be a really long expensive process to get there. The lion share of course for the development slowdown remain Taiwan. So any disruption there and not just we're not just talking about things like earthquakes but of course any increased tension with China just puts a little more risk on that."", ""I have to say though I haven't really ever taken a close look at Taiwan Semiconductor stock but now trading for about 20 times forward earnings, earnings are that are expected to grow by about 15% year over the next few years. It's not exactly a rich valuation for a company that is growing like this and as you mentioned is probably one of the most important technology companies in the world."", 'Dylan Lewis: Before we had to break, we want to check in on healthcare. We got an update this week from United Health. Ron, heading into earnings story was not looking particularly great for United, company had to pay two billion to providers tied to the change healthcare cyber attack stock was down 15% after news of the attack broke over the last month or so. But how an earnings report can change the story? Share is up 12% following earnings. What got investors excited?', ""Ron Gross: But yes, this is a strong report for sure and the shares did react appropriately but you nailed it. It's it's against the backdrop of that significant hack to the Change Healthcare unit. It disrupted much of the healthcare financial system had a major impact on United Health's own operations. The company has restored most of functionality. It's working to retain and win back customers. It's an uphill battle. They expect a full-year hit to earnings of at least $1.6 billion."", ""A big deal not to be swept under the rug. But for the quarter revenue up 9% healthcare unit was strong, the Optum unit was strong. The insurance unit had a bit of a higher medical care ratio, which is the share of premium spent on medical care. That's due to some government affects Medicare funding reductions that came from the government. The cyber attack hurt that business mix, hurt that. So some negative there."", 'But overall, if you strip out all these onetime items including cyber attack, to get an understanding of how the business is operating, you get earnings per share up about 10%, which is pretty good. The whole sector has really been dealing with the Medicare issue coming from the government. But management said things are on track, their expenses are running on track and things look fine. So only 17 times forward earnings pays at 1.6% dividend yield. Not too bad. May take a look.', ""Dylan Lewis: All right, listeners, if the united story has you interested in cybersecurity opportunities, stick around. We have some ETFs to watch in cybersecurity coming up later on the show, we're going to have to break. But after, we've got a rundown on big bank earnings and a look at the industrial real estate market. Stay right here. This is Motley Fool Money. Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. I'm Dylan Lewis, joined over the airwaves by Matt Argersinger and Ron Gross. We're going to keep the earnings parade going with a look at Schwab. Matt, this is a fun one for us to check in on because it's not only a business in and of itself, but a look at investor activity overall, you dug into the earnings results. What do you see this week?"", ""Matthew Argersinger: Right, Dylan, the results weren't that relevant to me looking at the report. I mean, if you look at this quarter, for example, these results year-over-year compared to the last year's first-quarter, right after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and all the issues that came out of that with regional banks. It's an apples to oranges comparison. Schwab owns a regional bank. So they got treated pretty harshly beginning then. But to me, the real and compelling story, it's just look at the assets for Schwab. Just in the first-quarter, $96 billion in core net new assets, one million new brokerage account openings."", ""Trading volume was up 15% quarter-over-quarter, net inflows and their managed assets for instance, which is a growing part of the business that was up 60% year over year. They're finally down to the last 10% of TD Ameritrade accounts that have yet to be moved over to Schwab. So within a month or so they think they're going to be finally done integrating the merger. You put it all together, total client assets at the end of the quarter. Now part of it was driven by it was a healthy return for the stock market, but still reached a record $9.1 trillion."", 'I mean, it\'s up there with BlackRock, of course. Fidelity is one of the largest asset holders in the world that sits incredible. But I think this might have been the most impactful quote from the conference call. This is from CFO Peter Crawford, ""We\'ve seen meaningful progress back toward our historic pace of organic growth. A continued moderation of client cash realignment activity, with the pace slowing, in fact, even faster than our expectations. Quote, if you remember, Schwab and the regional banks beginning really a year-ago, saw this new realizations among a lot of their depositors that, hey, I\'m not getting anything from my checking and savings accounts.', ""They started moving those assets in large amounts to treasuries, money market accounts, CDs, that had an outsized impact on Schwab, which pays low rates on its bank accounts and brokerage deposits. So if that's moderating, assets are picking up. People are keeping more of their money at Schwab. They're trading more actively as they were in the first quarter, it's a very positive momentum shift for Schwab, and I think it's going to be a good year for them."", ""Dylan Lewis: We're going to stick with financials. Ron, we saw most of the big banks reporting earnings that were actually pretty good, equal or better than expectations from Goldman, BofA, Morgan Stanley. But better than expected doesn't necessarily mean good in all cases, it seems."", 'Ron Gross: That is so true. Yeah, there were some common themes across the six big banks, but it was a mixed bag. For example, Bank of America reported an 18% drop in first-quarter profit, but Goldman and Morgan Stanley reported higher earnings thanks to their investment banking units, there were several positive factors that impacted all the banks across the board. Consumer spending remained strong, pent-up demand for deal-making, including stock and bond sales helped results from the more Wall Street focus banks, the Goldmans and the Morgans, as we discussed, strong stock market in the first quarter, increased fees the banks collect on Monday they manage for clients.', ""But investment banking clearly the bright-spot, Goldman Sachs and Citigroup's investment banking fees each increased 32% from a year ago, Bank of America's was up 38%. Pretty, impressive. Now these positive factors were offset by a significant pressure from higher interest rates, which hurt profit margins and will continue to hurt profit margins into the foreseeable future. Banks are warning that the recovery in capital markets is fragile. We have to really keep an eye, as with most things nowadays, on those interest rates."", ""Dylan Lewis: Ron, I'm going to ask you a question on behalf of all BofA customers here, because I am one. We have seen the big banks continue to get away with offering low-interest rates on savings accounts, pocketing some really nice interest rate spread there. Are they going to be able to continue to get away with this?"", ""Ron Gross: I will answer that anecdotally, Dylan. I was a Citibank customer for 30 years as a former New Yorker and just in the last month-and-a-half, I moved my account over to capital 1 to capture that 4% plus interest rate that they're offering on their savings accounts. The other guys better step up or I will not be the only one moving away."", 'Dylan Lewis: Matt, are you moving money around as well?', ""Matthew Argersinger: I'm always moving money around Dylan. But I have to say it's the same issue with Schwab. Schwab's seems to face the same challenges, but it looks like for whatever reason people are sticking with those low-interest rate accounts and there's no pressure to increase them really, it's amazing."", ""Dylan Lewis: Never underestimate the friction of making change. It's one of those things that thinking that this is a powerful competitive advantage. We're going to wrap our earnings takes with a look at real estate. Matt, you dug into the results from Prologis. This is the world's largest, leading industrial property company and they have a thing or two to say about the state of warehousing. What do you see in the results?"", ""Matthew Argersinger: I would put this up not quite at Taiwan semiconductors level as important to the global economy for Prologis is pretty important to the global economy. The results were good. Same store net operating income key metric that was up 5.7% year over year. Average occupancy fell a bit. But I thought it was interesting. Management noted that occupancy for the broader industrial real estate market, it's down about 310 basis points since peaking in 2022. Prologis' occupancy rate has fallen to only 80 basis points over that same time."", ""They're doing better on occupancy overall, rent growth on new leases was up 48% in the quarter. He saw this big spread between rents on current leases versus the market. It's a spread of almost 2.2 billion in incremental earnings that they're going to get on the next several years. What the market didn't like though and why the stock is down about 12%. They are seeing slower leasing activity, lower net absorption of space. We had this post pandemic boom in industrial real estate leasing."", 'If you remember, companies were racing to increase their e-commerce space, increase their supply chain capabilities, and so there was a lot of excess buying in those years. That hangover is still with us and you have a lot of customers today who are just not utilizing a lot of their space.', ""So that's weighing on results a little bit. Prologis thinks it's a short-term problem and by the way, yes, they cut their full-year guidance, but they cut it from $5.58 at the midpoint to $5.50 on the core FFO per share, $0.08 and yet the stock lost about 8 billion in market cap in the last two days. It just seems way overdone and if I look at the stock right now on that revised guidance, it's trading but at 19 times forward FFO, 3.7% dividend yield, you just don't get that in Prologis' stock very often."", ""Dylan Lewis: Matt, last week on the radio show we were talking about the confounding macro picture and how it is a little hard to make sense of so many things moving in a very similar, very positive direction. We actually saw some commentary from Prologis CEO on that saying it is a perplexing environment. You have indicators that are moving in the right direction, GDP, retail sales, e-commerce sales, and yet it is not converting into leased space. It seems like everyone is a bit confused with what we're seeing here."", ""Matthew Argersinger: Yeah, higher rates got geopolitical issues. So everyone's just a little hesitant and I think people are just cautious and that's what it's all adding up to right now."", ""Dylan Lewis: All right, Matt Argersinger, Ron Gross, fellas. We're going to see you guys a little bit later in the show. Up next, we're going to celebrate financial literacy month. They'll look at how to talk about money with your loved ones. Stay right here. You're listening to Motley Fool Money."", ""Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. I'm Dylan Lewis. April's financial literacy month. In observance, I cut up with Malcolm Ethridge. He's the Executive VP at CIC Wealth Management, a certified financial planner, and he's got a new book out this April; Financial Independence Doesn't Happen By Accident. Malcolm, walked me through why he's having a hard time getting some of his clients to de-risk their portfolios as they get older, how he's viewing interest rate outlook and two ETFs for exposure to his favorite industry. You're a CFP and I'm guessing you have a lot of conversations with folks in different ages, in different phases of life, looking at money and thinking about what's in their portfolios. Do you notice anything generationally about how people are thinking about saving, retiring, and investing? We're both millennials and I know everyone's approaching this stuff differently."", ""Malcolm Ethridge: Well, you would think everyone's approaching it differently, but the thing that really jumps out to me is that the boomers who we technically advise them to go 60-40 at the point that you retire and then also work your way down to more of a 50-50 stock to bond ratio and further and further down the chain, getting our boomer clients to be willing to take some risk off the table has been a serious challenge. For the last, call it, five years where the getting has been really good and the stock market. It's very tough to get any person who's even retired and taking income from their portfolio to take any risk whatsoever out of the portfolio."", ""Dylan Lewis: Is that people just seeing the opportunity cost of de-risking and saying, you know what, I'm excited with the gains that I'm getting."", ""Malcolm Ethridge: A hundred percent and it's all fun and games while the market is going up into the right, but what we're more concerned about is everything that goes up must come down. We're more concerned about what happens when the getting is no longer good, and we're coming back down the other side of that mountain, but it's really hard to think about that when every time you talk to your friends, you turn on the news, anything else, it looks like the party is so much fun. They're like, why would I leave the party now when everything is going so well? It's like, this is the part where you grab your keys and get out of here."", ""Dylan Lewis: I think I had a conversation with my mom about two months ago that hit that exact note. She's like she went from working to retiring last year and I think has had that moment of, I'm going to start pulling on some of the soon and all of a sudden it is a massive shift from going from accumulating to actually needing that money. It's a major mindset shift. I imagine it's something that you have to talk through with your clients and it adjusts the way they're looking at things."", ""Malcolm Ethridge: Well also, making them aware that they've already won the game. If your mom is comfortable enough and in position to feel like she can step away from full-time work. She's already won the game. Now is when you're supposed to be living off of the fruits of your labor and sowing the seeds of those crops you planted for all those decades while you were delaying gratification and saving for this rainy day, you're here."", ""Now is the time to sit back, relax, put your feet up and not be watching your portfolio and worrying. That's the part that's really hard to get across to people. It's like, it's not that the game is over, but you've already won. You've got a significant lead, sit your starters on the bench and let everybody else just run out the clock. That part is hard for them to wrap their minds around."", ""Dylan Lewis: Your book that's out this April focuses on financial independence. There's a distinction between investing for retirement and investing for financial independence. How do you break that down?"", ""Malcolm Ethridge: Hundred percent. Yes. The thing to focus on when you're thinking about retirement in the traditional sense. I'm going to work for 35, 40, 45 years in a profession and I'm going to save and invest all along the way and I'm going to put a healthy portion of my savings into the stock market, which on average, somewhere 9-10% is what I can expect. Over that time period, it's going to compound, my employer is going to give me a portion as a match and so forth and so on. That's the traditional way to invest for retirement."", ""When we talk about financial independence, we talk about people who generally want to leave the game earlier than the government says that they should be allowed to. I want to be gainfully unemployed, is the way that I like to say it, in my 40s, maybe in my 50s. The way that you invest for that is different because you have to be putting money into vehicles that are going to pay you back income at some point while you're still younger. Also, the way that our system is set up, you're allowed to pull money out of your retirement savings after 59.5. You're allowed to apply for and start to receive security benefits after 66."", ""Now, I'm saying I'm going to be pulling money back out of my portfolio in my 40s and 50s. That means that I'm going to have to use vehicles that aren't tax-deferred or have the same treatment related to them that our retirement accounts do. That's things like real estate. Obviously, most people who talked financial independence talk about real estate, but the real important part of that is that those rents you receive are income that pay you to stay in bed, basically. Or I'm investing these dollars into a business maybe that 10 years down the road is going to start to payback dividends and I'm going to live off of those dividends. It's very different. The mindset is different, the tactics that you're taking are different from the way that we invest for traditional retirement."", 'Dylan Lewis: One of the other things I know you get into in the book is the idea of talking about money with family and talking about money with loved ones. I will be your straw man here. I am recently engaged. My fiance and I are passed that euphoria period and are now rationally looking at practically how do we put our lives together? What advice do you have?', ""Malcolm Ethridge: Yeah, that's a tough one. I don't say that to say it's not worth doing. I say that to say, if you feel like this is a very tough thing to approach, you're not alone. I'm a person who does this for a living, as you can probably tell, I get excited talking about money. I probably talked about it in my sleep. My wife is the opposite and so even I have to find the right time to approach these conversations. What I've done is said, we're going to actually set aside two times per year, an hour on a Saturday morning where we're going to sit down and have our financial planning meeting. I am going to prepare and present to you, the exact same way that I would a client, our financial situation."", ""I'm a business owner and so I want to make sure that she understands all the different things that are going on with all the different business interests that I have and everything else. We have a one-page financial plan, it's literally one-page, with us on it and all the different assets that we own and what their income streams are and so forth and so on. I sit down with just that and try my best not to overwhelm her, but what I would say directly to you is as the person who I assume is you is most interested in talking about the money, you have the other person who's at best neutral."", ""It's making sure that you only give them the facts in the information they need to know. Not trying to overwhelm them with all the things that you are excited about. You went and found and research and you're passionate about and making a pitch the same way you would to our board room at work. You have to make it so that it's digestible enough that it brings the other person in, gives them what they need to know to feel comfortable and confident when they walk away."", ""That's it. Just because you know all the things that the wide NAB community wants to know and you've got your spreadsheet down you're a zero budgeter, and you've got all the different buckets that those dollars go into. That's great for you, but for the other person in this relationship they could care less, and so you got to meet them where they are and maybe eventually you drag them into the deeper end, because they start to see how it comes together and get as excited, but you can't expect them to share your passion from day one."", ""Dylan Lewis: You've got me pegged. You need a budget. All the subreddit's. That's exactly where I'm spending my time. I will say thank you. I'll say also on behalf of Jess. Thank you. I'm sure she'll Appreciate that advice as well. In addition to your financial planning work, I know you're an investor and someone who is paying attention to the market. I see you on CNBC and so I want to get your take on a couple of different things. You mentioned the 9-10% annualized folks can generally expect from the market, and also the difficulty in convincing people to de-risk. Are you surprised that is an issue when we're in an environment where rates are higher and you can generally earn some pretty easy risk-free money?"", ""Malcolm Ethridge: One hundred percent. The stock market has not made sense to me in over a year. Where you look at the fact that I know you are a follower of the yield curve and the implications of the two year treasury being above the 10 year. To keep from getting too wonky here, just the fact that it's been inverted for how long it has and nothing bad has happened befuddles me, because going back to 1950, going back to that period, 10 times out of 10, where the two year treasury has gotten above the yield of the 10 year, a recession follows."", ""The one thing that's unique and different about this particular scenario is that the unemployment rate has stayed historically low. As long as the labor market is as strong as it is, that phenomenon can go on longer than anyone including Jerome Powell ever imagine. What that makes me fearful for though, is that the moment that reckoning does happen, it's going to be significant. That's the one thing that I have to caution people about that we can't just declare mission accomplished and soft landing is here."", ""Malcolm Ethridge: There's still room for us to hit pretty hard on this landing, but the labor market holds all the cards. It's shocking to me, yes, that rates could be above 5% for this long and nothing bad has happened. But I also I'm a student of history and a student of economics enough to know that higher interest rates usually take the longest to work their way through the labor market, usually about 18 -24 months. Our first rate hike was in March of 2022 which then means that were just that that two-year mark and so we could be right around the corner from finally seeing the impact of raising rates and what that means for the labor market. But I hope not as an investor, I hope the party keeps going. But as a pragmatist, it can't."", ""Dylan Lewis: On last week's radio show, we were talking about how wild it is for basically everything to be at or near highs. S&P 500, gold, your go-to crypto, Bitcoin, and interest rates all at the same time. It's wild and it seemed like we were heading to a very clear interest rate picture than we saw inflation data come out recently. That was a little hotter than people were expecting. If we wind up in a spot where rates do wind up being higher for longer, are there any types of businesses you're particularly worried about?"", ""Malcolm Ethridge: I would be worried about anything that's not a major tech company. I mean, literally, if you go back to the fang labeling that we had once upon a time, anything that's not one of those big 15-20 tech companies that's got more than 40, $50 billion of cash on their balance sheet, I'd be concerned about those companies. The reason that I say that is because most corporations borrowed to grow. They've been borrowing to grow at 0% almost interest rates for a decade and so everything was growing. We're seeing the fruits of those investments that a lot of those companies were able to make back then."", ""We're still in this love affair with AI and ChatGPT and Gemini and everything else. The companies that can continue to invest in those developments, Microsoft, Amazon, so forth and so on, they've got hundreds of billions of dollars on their balance sheet to fund their operations for however long it takes us to work our way through a bad market and so if and when we hit that skid, everyone has to slam on the brakes and can't really fund that next wave of growth. Maybe they even have to start laying folks off. You know who has the most cash on their balance sheet? Apple."", ""You know who didn't lay anybody off in 2022, when all the other tech companies were kicking people to the curb? Apple, and that's the dynamic that I'm leaning on here. There's about 10-20 companies that have the fortress balance sheet to allow themselves to fund their operations that way, the rest of everyone else's in trouble. Especially the small and mid-sized businesses that have already borrowed as much as they possibly could just to get through the last two years and that's who I'm most concerned about."", ""Dylan Lewis: Okay. Your caveats on small and mid-cap companies noted. But outside of the bigger tech names, what are some companies that you're following right now and you're excited about?"", ""Malcolm Ethridge: I'm really big on cybersecurity. To me if this doomsday scenario that I just painted for you actually comes to fruition the exact same way I just drew it up. You know what's a non-discretionary budget item for any corporation or government entity out there? Cyberdefense. We just saw UnitedHealthcare got a billion-dollar bill basically for a breach that happened, that's how much it has and will cost them to clean up that mess and UnitedHealthcare has the money to cover it."", ""But if we just think about, I'm in Ohio as I record this, the government of Ohio does not have a billion-dollars laying around for a breach if one was to occur at the state level. They have to spend however many, 10s of millions of dollars they do have available fighting that. Then extrapolate that not only across 50 states plus DC, but globally, so now, everyone's spend on cyberdefense gets better and better and bigger and bigger because you know what cybercriminals now have at their disposal? AI. Now we've got to fight not only the human element, but we've got to fight the machine-learning element of cybersecurity as well and so short story long, that's a sector specifically to me, one I think is ripe for consolidation."", ""There's about 10, maybe 12 mid-sized cybersecurity companies. I think there's probably room for five or six because there's a lot of overlap. A lot of them either are on-premise or they're in the Cloud. Some of them try and do both like Fortinet for example, which I don't believe can do both. But if you think about a company that's already in the Cloud, like CrowdStrike, for example who needs the on-premise capability of a Fortinet, maybe there's a marriage that happens there, or if you think about a much larger company who wants to nab that, Fortinet I think does something like $5 billion of revenue, last I checked."", ""I think about an Amazon, for example, who's got an entire Cloud business that they need to protect. An Amazon does something like 575 $580 billion of revenue, so not even 1%. That's a company they could gobble up in a second and it probably gets through FTC scrutiny even because of how small it is. I think there's room for five, six, seven of those marriages to happen within this year. Cybersecurity, to me is a place that I'm very excited about, if you can't tell that I, as an investor think that it makes a ton of sense probably to just buy one of the ETFs, BUG or CIBR or something like that, rather than trying to pick the perfect, one individual name within that space. But in there, there's going to be a lot of deal making that happens back half of this year, early next year."", ""Dylan Lewis: Listeners, you can get Malcom's book Financial Independence Doesn't Happen by Accident, this April.

Ron, you're up first, what are you looking at this week?"", ""Ron Gross: I'm going with discount retailer Five Below F-I-V-E and I love how my friends over at our Rule Breaker service described this business. They say imagine if Target and a Dollar Store had a baby, I think that gets an image in your head. I don't know if you like it or not but it's a good description. There 1,500, Five Below stores across the country focused on selling merchandise at $5 or less. They expect to grow that to 3,500 stores by 2030. More than a doubling in seven years, rapidly expanding the stocks 25 times, not the cheapest for me, so I'm going to dig in a bit. The Dollar Store industry has been at a little bit of trouble right now so there is an overhang and stocks have been weak, but I think it's interesting enough to take a look at."", 'Dylan Lewis: Dan, a question about Five Below.', ""Dan Boyd: Ron, I'm an almost 40 year old father. What's getting me into a Five Below?"", ""Ron Gross: When your kids get a little older and they find out that they can walk in with $5 bill and by almost everything in the store, that'll get you there."", ""Dylan Lewis: Dan, anything in this store could be yours, what a pitch for a kid. That's easy. You're father of the year right there. Matt what's on your radar this week?"", ""Matthew Argersinger: Going with UPS, ticker UPS, we just add this to our Dividend Investor watch-list. My partner in crime, Anthony Shavonne, has done some great work on this. The company reports results next week, they're going to be bad, package volumes have been slumping.

Three of those are megawatt charging system (MCS) dispensers with 1.2 megawatts each collectively powered by 3,000 amps. Such amperage is more powerful than lightning and would vaporize anything in its path.', 'WattEV can use the MCS units at lower output to charge multiple vehicles at one time. A prototype Mercedes-Benz eActros 600 in Germany recently received the first MCS test of a 1,000-kilowatt charge from a Siemens dispenser. But battery-electric trucks capable of accepting such a large load are years away.', 'The WattEV site also features 32 power dispensers with 16 dual-cord, 360-kilowatt chargers, allowing two trucks to charge at 175kW, in line with current receiving capability of many current-generation electric trucks.

(NYSE:RMD) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next 4 days. The ex-dividend date occurs one day before the record date which is the day on which shareholders need to be on the company's books in order to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. Therefore, if you purchase ResMed's shares on or after the 8th of May, you won't be eligible to receive the dividend, when it is paid on the 13th of June."", ""The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.48 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$1.92 to shareholders. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, ResMed has a trailing yield of approximately 0.9% on its current stock price of US$218.15. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. So we need to check whether the dividend payments are covered, and if earnings are growing."", ' See our latest analysis for ResMed ', ""Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. That's why it's good to see ResMed paying out a modest 29% of its earnings. A useful secondary check can be to evaluate whether ResMed generated enough free cash flow to afford its dividend. Thankfully its dividend payments took up just 26% of the free cash flow it generated, which is a comfortable payout ratio."", ""It's positive to see that ResMed's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut."", ""Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends."", ""Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. That's why it's comforting to see ResMed's earnings have been skyrocketing, up 24% per annum for the past five years. ResMed is paying out less than half its earnings and cash flow, while simultaneously growing earnings per share at a rapid clip. This is a very favourable combination that can often lead to the dividend multiplying over the long term, if earnings grow and the company pays out a higher percentage of its earnings."", ""Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. In the last 10 years, ResMed has lifted its dividend by approximately 6.7% a year on average. It's encouraging to see the company lifting dividends while earnings are growing, suggesting at least some corporate interest in rewarding shareholders."", ""Is ResMed worth buying for its dividend? ResMed has been growing earnings at a rapid rate, and has a conservatively low payout ratio, implying that it is reinvesting heavily in its business; a sterling combination. ResMed looks solid on this analysis overall, and we'd definitely consider investigating it more closely."", 'With that in mind, a critical part of thorough stock research is being aware of any risks that stock currently faces. For example - ResMed has 1 warning sign we think you should be aware of.', ""Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see. Here's a curated list of interesting stocks that are strong dividend payers."", 'Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock.

Jorden', ""Thank you, Dan, and welcome to all of you who are joining us on the call this morning. We're pleased to report that Coterra had an excellent first quarter. Our total equivalent production for the quarter was 686,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which was near the high end of our guidance. Oil production averaged 102,500 barrels of oil per day, which was 3,500 barrels of oil per day above the high end of our guidance. This beat in oil production was driven by a combination of well performance that exceeded expectations, production optimization and timing.Natural gas production averaged 2.96 billion cubic feet a day, which was slightly above the high end of our guidance. Capital expenditures came in at $450 million, which was below the guidance range. This was a combination of timing and cost reductions and completions. Blake will provide further detail on this. We have raised our full year oil guidance while leaving our natural gas guidance unchanged. Shane will provide commentary here.As we previously said, our capital guidance for 2024 includes room for adding additional Marcellus activity, if our received prices in the Marcellus were to rebound. Of course, any additional activity will be evaluated against other shovel-ready opportunities in our portfolio. Rapid and severe commodity price swings are feature of our business. As much as we try to anticipate and predict market movements, there is an inherent humbling unpredictability to them.During Q1, we saw upward movement in Oil, coupled with downward movement in Gas. Despite these swings, Revenue at Coterra for Q1 2024 came in roughly flat with revenue for Q4 2023. This stability in revenue allows us the luxury of maintaining a consistent level of activity, while retaining significant upside exposure to a gas price recovery.We did, however, delay some Marcellus turn-in-lines during Q1. We currently have 2 pads comprising 12 wells completed and waiting to be brought online. We have ongoing completion activity and are making the go/no-go decision on bringing wells online on a monthly basis. Blake will provide further detail on this.In spite of near-term headwinds, we remain wholly optimistic on natural gas. With coming LNG export capacity, near-term power demand and the evolving discussion about the long-term power demands of AI-driven data center needs, it is hard not to be constructive on the future of Natural Gas. We watch this conversation closely and have heard forecast for incremental Natural Gas demand driven by growing data center consumption that range from 3 Bcf per day to 30-plus Bcf per day, by the year 2030. We will welcome increased demand anywhere within that range.Finally, we are pleased to once again be reporting results that exceed expectations. Our organization is highly focused on operational excellence, costs, safety, emission reduction and on being responsible members of our communities. I want to acknowledge the tremendous work and dedication of our entire organization from the field on up. This includes, in addition to field office staff, contractors and service partners.At Coterra, we continually choose progress over comfort. And our strong culture of optimization, innovation and financial discipline continues to be an important competitive advantage.With that, I'll turn the call over to Shane."", 'Shannon E. Young', ""Thank you, Tom, and thank you, everyone, for joining us on today's call. This morning, I'll focus on 3 areas: first, I will summarize financial highlights from the first quarter results, then I will provide production and capital guidance for the second quarter, as well as update our full year 2024 guide. Finally, I'll provide highlights for our recent bond offering and the progress we're making on our shareholder return program.Turning to our strong performance during the first quarter. First quarter total production averaged 686 MBoe per day, with Oil averaging 102.5 MBo per day and Natural Gas averaging 2.96 Bcf per day. Oil and natural gas production came in above the high end of guidance, driven by strong well performance and a modest acceleration of Permian TIL timing. In the Permian, we brought on 22 wells versus 21 wells at the midpoint of our guidance. In contrast, in the Marcellus, we tilled 11 wells below our guidance of 23 wells. I will discuss this further later in my remarks. During the first quarter, prehedge revenues were approximately $1.4 billion, of which 62% were generated by Oil and NGL sales. In the quarter, we reported net income of $352 million or $0.47 per share and adjusted net income of $383 million or $0.51 per share. Total unit costs during the quarter, including LOE, transportation, production taxes and G&A totaled $8.68 per BOE, near the midpoint of our annual guidance range of $7.45 to $9.55 per BOE.Cash hedge gains during the quarter totaled $26 million. In current capital expenditures in the first quarter totaled $450 million, just below the low end of our guidance range. Lower-than-expected capital was driven primarily by timing and we are maintaining our full year capital guide. Discretionary cash flow was $797 million, and free cash flow was $340 million after cash capital expenditures of $457 million. Looking ahead to the remainder of 2024. During the second quarter of 2024, we expect total production to average between 625 and 655 MBoe per day. Oil to be between 103 and 107 MBo per day and Natural Gas to be between 2.6 and 2.7 Bcf per day. In other words, we expect Oil to be up approximately 2.5% quarter-over-quarter on continued strong execution. Regarding investment, we would expect total incurred capital during the second quarter to be between $470 million and $550 million. As a result of low natural gas prices, we have chosen to defer the turn in line of 2 separate Marcellus projects totaling 12 wells. Based on current in-basin pricing, we don't anticipate bringing any projects online in the Marcellus during the second quarter, resulting in lower gas volumes quarter-over-quarter before flattening in the second half of the year. Yesterday, we increased our full year 2024 Oil production guidance range by 2.5 MBo per day to between 102 and 107 MBo per day for the year. Or up approximately 2.5% from our initial guide in February. There is no change to our full year 2024 BOE and natural gas production guidance. Similarly, there are no changes to our unit cost guidance or turn in well -- turn-in-line well counts for the year.For the full year 2024, we are reiterating our incurred capital guidance to between $1.75 billion and $1.95 billion, which is 12% lower at the midpoint than our 2023 capital spend. As previously discussed, our 2024 program will modestly increase capital allocation to the liquids-rich Permian and Anadarko Basins, while decreasing capital by more than 50% in the Marcellus year-over-year. Moving on to shareholder returns. As previously announced, during the first quarter, we successfully issued Coterra's inaugural bond offering of $500 million of senior notes carrying a coupon of 5.6% and a maturity of 2034. We were pleased with the timing of the transaction and the reception of the Coterra story in the market. We intend to use the proceeds of this offering along with cash on hand to retire a $575 million 2024 notes at maturity during the third quarter. Until the maturity, we have invested the proceeds and time deposits at a similar interest rate to the coupon of the notes. Coterra continues to maintain its low leverage profile with a ratio of 0.3x at the end of the first quarter. Our target leverage ratio remains below 1x even at lower price scenarios. This refinancing allowed us to extend our maturity profile, maintain a high liquidity position and affords us modest deleveraging, while maintaining a robust shareholder return program in 2024.During the first quarter, Coterra continued to execute on its shareholder return program by repurchasing 5.6 million shares for $150 million at an average price of $26.94 per share. In total, we returned $308 million to shareholders during the quarter or over 90% of free cash flow. We remain committed to our strategy of returning 50% or more of annual free cash flow to shareholders through a combination of our healthy base dividend and our share repurchase program. Last night, we also announced a $0.21 per share base dividend for the first quarter, maintaining our annual base dividend at $0.84 per share. This remains one of the highest yielding base dividends of our peers at approximately 3%. Management and the Board remain committed to responsibly increasing the base dividend on an annual cadence. In summary, the team delivered another quarter of high-quality results in the field, which resulted in another successful quarter financially. Our business has significant operating momentum and we are poised for a strong 2024 and are on track to meet or exceed the differentiated 3-year outlook we provided in February.With that, I will hand the call over to Blake to provide details on our operations. Blake?"", 'Blake A. Sirgo', ""Thanks, Shane. This morning, I will discuss our capital expenditures and provide an operational update. First quarter accrued capital expenditures totaled $450 million, coming in just below the low end of our guidance. Our strong execution in the field continued in Q1, with our oil production coming in at 102,500 barrels of oil per day, above the high end of our guidance. We are seeing continued completion gains in the Permian, led by reduced transition times on our diesel crew as well as strong initial performance from our electric simul-frac crew in Culberson County. During the first quarter, our 2 Permian crews and 1 Anadarko crew hit all-time highs in efficiency with record pumping hours per month. These efficiencies are coupled with new contracts that ensure when we gain efficiencies, it is realized in our dollar per foot and not just in our cycle times.We are currently running 2 frac crews and 8 drilling rigs in the Permian. We continue to benefit from operational efficiencies, including cost savings on electrification, leveraging existing facilities and infrastructure as well as improved cycle times. Faster cycle times drives more footage in the year, also contributing to lower dollar per foot. As a result, we estimate our Permian cost around $10.75 per foot, roughly 8% below our 2023 dollar per foot. Our Windham Row project is off and running with 34 wells now drilled and our simul-frac operations underway. Our electric simul-frac crew is powered directly off our Coterra-owned grid with no generation in the field required. We are seeing encouraging initial performance from our simul-frac crew with an increase of 1,000 completed feet per day versus our normal zipper performance with a decreased cost of $25 per foot. When we combine our simul-frac efficiencies with the current cost spread between diesel and grid power, we are realizing a total cost savings of $75 per foot, compared to current diesel-powered zipper operations. One update to the Windham Row project is the addition of 3 Harkey wells to the western part of the Row, bringing the project total to 54 wells. Recent tests in our Culberson asset have shown a possible benefit to codeveloping the Upper Wolfcamp with our Harkey Shale landings. This observation is different than what we've seen with our other Harkey projects across the basin. And these 3 new codeveloped wells will help us further understand the interaction between these zones.Due to strong execution on the project so far, we were able to fit these 3 new wells to our existing schedule without incurring additional facility or infrastructure costs. As previously discussed, we expect to execute large Row development for many years to come in Culberson County. Our Permian team continues to build momentum and is off to a strong start in 2024.In the Marcellus, we are currently running 1 rig and 1 reduced frac crew. Our focus in the Marcellus continues to be decelerating activity and reducing costs as near-term gas markets remain challenging. Our Marcellus program is buoyed by our long-term sales portfolio, which contains multiple indices and price floors, which come into play at lower NYMEX pricing. We currently have 2 pads consisting of 12 wells in total that we are delaying turn-in-lines. Each incremental molecule we bring on receives in-basin pricing compared to the rest of our portfolio. Therefore, we are choosing to delay these TILs until we see stronger local pricing. We have also chosen to delay a portion of our wellhead compression program into 2025, so as not to accelerate volumes into a weakened market. Our teams are focused on reducing costs in the field and looking for ways to optimize our capital spend. As we have discussed, our Marcellus business unit has several strong projects that are teed up and ready to execute later in the year, should macro conditions warrant. In the Anadarko, we are currently running 2 rigs and 1 frac crew. We are in the middle of a large block of completion activity, with 3 projects being fracked over the first half of 2024. These projects are focused on liquids-rich portions of our asset, which maintains strong economics in the current gas environment. Our consistent activity in the Anadarko is starting to bear fruit. As we have seen our drilled feet per day increased 15% year-over-year, as well as an increase of 10% in pumping hours per day compared to a year ago.Our Anadarko team continues to compete for capital and the returns across the basin remains strong. Our operating teams at Coterra are firing on all cylinders. We continue to make positive strides across all areas of operations, including new initiatives that are materially reducing well trouble costs, minimizing production downtime, beating our emissions targets, improving our cycle times and gaining new efficiencies. Our field operations are the heartbeat of our company, and they continue to fuel our momentum.And with that, I'll turn it back to Tom."", 'Thomas E. Jorden', ""Thank you, Shane and Blake. We're pleased with our continued execution momentum as we march through 2024. We appreciate your interest in Coterra and look forward to discussing our results and outlook. As always, we like talking about results, more the future promises, and we're always pleased to deliver them.With that, we'll turn it over to questions."", 'Operator', ""(Operator Instructions)We'll take our first question from Nitin Kumar at Mizuho."", 'Nitin Kumar', ""Tom and Shane, congrats on the great results. Tom, I want to start off in the Marcellus, and you deferred 12 completed wells for later in the year. The plan still calls for about 29 wells to be put online. Could you maybe talk us through how are -- what are the market conditions? Is there a specific price? Or is there a supply or demand equation that you're looking at to, one, bring on the 12 wells? And 2, how would you think about the rest of the program for the year?"", 'Thomas E. Jorden', ""Thank you, Nitin. Well, first, I'm going to say if there's a specific price or a complex formula, nobody has shared that with me yet. But we're looking at our received price. And quite frankly, we sell into indices. Leidy is the one that we typically point to. And when it's -- I would say, when it's sub $1.50, we really look at that and we say, okay, what's the outlook for that? And we do have transportation and LOE that comes off of that. And I wouldn't say there's a particular price. But I'll say this, we do have a very low cost of supply.But I think we probably would like to see our netback north of $1. And so we're watching that. We're making -- as I said in my remarks, we're making that on a month-to-month go/no-go basis. We -- our current model has us bringing additional wells online in July. Whether we do that or not, we're optimistic, but we're not going to be driven by our model. We will be driven by the way the terrain looks on the ground.I want to say that there's 2 issues, when you ask what price. There's the price for when we bring wells online, but it's also the price of when we would increase our investments. As I said, our capital program has room for a ramp-up. And if we were to do that, we really see a strong rebound in our volumes going into 2025 and '26. And that's a whole different price comparison. But as I said, we're really constructive on Natural Gas. But look, we're in a real hostile near-term environment, and we think just moderating these turn-in-lines just the way to go. We're also going to look and see what others do. There's a lot of gas, a lot of players doing what we're doing. And when we bring these wells online, we're going to be thoughtful and look at the market conditions and if there's a flood of gas coming online, that may impact our decision."", 'Nitin Kumar', ""Great. Tom, and I appreciate that. I want to shift to the Permian and talk about the Windham Row. Could you maybe talk a little bit about what have you seen, obviously, adding a few wells in the Harkey is a positive. But what are you seeing? And what are some of the lessons learned? And if you can walk us through the 5% to 15% cost reduction that you're seeing, if I think about $1 billion spend in the Permian this year, could we look at something which is 10% less capital spend in the Permian for the same result down the road?"", 'Thomas E. Jorden', ""Yes. I'm going to hit the Harkey and let Blake look at the cost reduction. Our general observation in a lot of our Delaware program is that in our assets, our observation has been that whether we exploit these reservoirs 1 layer at a time or not that we don't really see any incremental recovery out of a drilling spacing unit.So doing them in stages allows us to really take full advantage of our infrastructure because we can stage volumes in and not have to build facilities for the absolute peak production because these wells do decline. And if you build your facilities for absolute peak production, you find that they're very early in the life underutilized. But we did on another project in Culberson County, where things are a little different. It's on the western side of the basin, a little lower pressure. We did see on an experiment we did over the last year or 2, that codeveloping the Harkey and the Wolfcamp at the same time versus waiting 12 to 18 months and coming back with the Harkey, I'd say 12 to 24 months, we did see what we think is an incremental boost in recovery.We're not concluding that but we prudently added the Row and a few Harkey wells. And I'll say this, while we continue to learn, I think on new projects, you're going to see that in Culberson County is probably our default option. As we continue to learn, and we're not chiseling and granted final conclusions here."", 'Blake A. Sirgo', ""Yes. I'll take the cost question. When we talk about Windham Row and simul-frac. The simul-frac is going very well. I mean, right out of the gate, the performance has been strong. We were hoping we would see at least $20 per foot. To date, we've seen about $25. And there's room for that to go even further, but we're early in the game there. We're watching it very close. As far as how we can expand these learnings, we're only simul-fracking 27 wells in the Permian this year as part of Windham Row. But with this initial success, our Permian team is looking hard at how we could exploit this across our whole drilling program. I wouldn't take that and slap a 10% cost change on the whole program because you got to have just the right number of wells per pad to make simul-frac really cost effective, but our teams are looking at that now, and we're excited to see where it goes."", 'Operator', ""We'll go next to Arun Jayaram at JPMorgan."", 'Arun Jayaram', 'My first question is on cash return. You returned 90% of free cash flow this quarter. But I wanted to get maybe some broader thoughts on just the overall philosophy given your views on the valuation of the stock. You recently issued $500 million of notes to help refund the payment of the $575 million maturity later this year. How did cash return, Tom, attractiveness of the valuation of the stock play into that decision?You have about $1 billion of net cash on the balance sheet today, excluding that recent notes issue. How do we think about the minimum cash balance and perhaps thoughts on leaning in the balance, on the balance sheet in addition to free cash flow to buy back the stock?', 'Thomas E. Jorden', ""Yes, I'll let Shane handle that one."", 'Shannon E. Young', ""Yes, I appreciate the question. I'll take it. Look, we look at a variety of things. We think about the return program and the pace. And look, you've touched on many of them. First and foremost, we look at valuation, and we believe our stock is a compelling valuation. And if so, then we're going to be inclined to do more there. The second is liquidity and where does liquidity sit and you know what our target is and we're sitting above our target as of the end of the first quarter. And then the third is the free cash flow of the business in any given period. And there's other things, but I think if we triangulate around those, it's helpful.As we were getting into late last year, we were having a discussion around here about how to handle the 2024 maturity. And we looked at a variety of scenarios. We had good cash on hand and liquidity. So that was one option to do cash. We had -- and as we got into the early part of this year, the market began to really improve for new issuances of debt and that's been an option for us, and that ended up being generally speaking, the path we took.So we'll be repaying $575 million of debt later this year, largely with the proceeds of the $500 million new issue and a little bit of cash on hand. But that really clarified that question for us as to what kind of impact that maturity could have on our liquidity. And once it did, with a combination of free cash flow and attractive stock price, you saw us lean into the share buyback program in the first quarter."", 'Arun Jayaram', ""Great. And Shane, what do you view as the minimum cash you'd like to keep on the balance sheet?"", 'Shannon E. Young', ""We've gone as low as $600 million over the last, call it, 7, 8 quarters. And -- and again, I think that probably as low as we go. We target $1 billion. We've been as high as $1.4 billion. And I think you'll continue to see us live somewhere in that range. It's a broad range. But I think you'll continue to see us reside within that range."", 'Thomas E. Jorden', ""So it's -- If I could just add some color. We have relaxed a little bit our $1 billion number on cash on the balance sheet. We have plenty of liquidity. Our buyback is really because we see value in our stock, quite frankly, we look at net asset value, and we think our stock is a really prudent buy. And then as far as our overall leverage, I don't think anybody is going to accuse Coterra being overlevered. You've heard me say before, I'll never lose a minute of the sleep worrying about how low our debt is. I know that somehow violates financial theory. I just have good balance sheet management. But when you live in a cyclic commodity business, you find that people that read those business school textbooks on financial theory into the filing on the way with their bankruptcy papers. And we're going to manage Coterra for the long run."", 'Arun Jayaram', ""Yes, it's a sleep [well] at night balance sheet. My follow-up is just maybe for Blake is your Marcellus well costs are guided down to $950 a foot in the second half versus $1,200 a foot in the first half. Talk to us about that decline? And what's the good go-forward run rate?"", 'Blake A. Sirgo', ""The decline is really just driven by the well set that we're bringing on that part of the year. We have some great, really long laterals that are in there and they trend on a lower dollar per foot. Run rate is kind of hard to pin down exactly, one, it depends if you're talking upper Marcellus lower Marcellus. I think it could be anywhere from $1,000 to $1,200 per foot. It's probably going to flow in there. Lateral lengths could drive that a little lower."", 'Operator', ""We'll move next to Neil Mehta at Goldman Sachs."", 'Neil Singhvi Mehta', ""Tom, really great quarter. The first question I had was just -- we've seen so much consolidation across the landscape -- the energy landscape. And certainly, you guys did your large deal a couple of years ago, but I just love your perspective on the role of Coterra and future consolidation and where do you see bid and ask and do you see any gaps in the portfolio?"", 'Thomas E. Jorden', 'Yes. I\'ll see that let Shane comment. We\'re -- the fact that we haven\'t announced the transaction. As you\'ve heard me say before, shouldn\'t be misinterpreted that we\'re not active in the space. We\'re evaluating a lot of assets. We\'re looking at how they may fit into our portfolio and really evaluating them against what we think the market demands for those assets.And I\'ll just slide out, say, as we\'ve recently reviewed the landscape of deals, there\'s probably only 1 or 2 that we say, ""Oh, we might have liked to have had that. But those were small bolt-ons. I think we feel pretty good about as we review the decisions we made on that. But we look at everything. And we have a lot of confidence in our operations team and would love to find more assets for them to say gray/silver. And we\'re going to remain curious and active on that. But I just don\'t want it to be misinterpreted that we\'re sleeping on the sidelines. We are actively engaged and have made tactical decisions to both firm.Shane, do you want to comment on that?', 'Shannon E. Young', ""Yes. I'll just add on a couple of things. I wholeheartedly agree. The team has been executing incredibly well, and we'd love nothing more than to have an opportunity to put more assets and opportunity under their stewardship. And we think it helps in terms of execution in the field. We think it also plays into our strengths of capital allocation. I think the bar has been and remains very high. And -- but I think if we were to find something that had the right strategic fit, the right valuation parameters and left the balance sheet in good shape, that would be something we'd be highly interested in."", 'Neil Singhvi Mehta', ""And the follow-up also on M&A. You have been commodity agnostic. It seems to us and focus more on where you can generate the highest return. Is that the way you think about M&A as well? You're less focused on the product type and more focused on what's the best fit just perspective on Oil versus Gas and consolidation?"", 'Thomas E. Jorden', ""Yes. I think our first lens is always financial on everything we do. Now all else being equal, things are never equal. And you get structural changes in the markets, both for Oil and Natural Gas. I would say all else being equal, we'd probably add a little more Oil to our portfolio. But check back with me 6 months from now on that. I mean we really have a history of feedback that if we focus on sound financials, we focus on asset quality, if we focus on the amount of windage we have between our price file and our cost of supply, that's the right focus. And whether it's Gas, Oil or NGLs. I would say in our DNA, we have a fundamental indifference to that. But not to say we're not also interested in a balance. I mean completely, we want to balance our revenue mix."", 'Operator', ""We'll go next to Betty Jiang at Barclays."", 'Wei Jiang', ""I want to ask about the 3-year outlook. You have beaten 2024, and that's flowing into a better 2025 and '26 numbers, which is great to see. With all the efficiency gains that you're talking about, is it fair to think that they would just continue to translate into a better outlook over the entire 3-year period and that you will just be delivering that 5-plus type of growth for maybe seeing to lower CapEx?"", 'Thomas E. Jorden', 'Yes, I\'ll see that and I want Blake to comment. I think sometimes people give us credit for being better modelers than we are. We really do try to come out with outlooks that are aggressive and what we think we can achieve. We do not model in future cost reductions or future efficiencies unless we have line of sight to them. And that\'s kind of -- I have to kind of apologize for that because we are an innovative organization. We wake up every morning and we say, we\'ve been highly successful and we\'re very sick of it because we never want success to get in our way of progress. You\'ve heard us talk about progress versus comfort. So I\'ll tell you with great humility that when we laid out our 3-year plan in February, we were going to say 0 -- 5% oil growth, and we had a debate internally as to whether we say 5-plus percent. And that plus was hotly debated. And we said, ""No, let\'s put the plus sign in because we might beat that."" And here in the last 2 years, we\'ve added 10% Oil growth. It\'s not that we\'re sandbagging our model. It\'s that our organization is really innovative. But we can\'t -- we\'d rather talk about results, than promise things that we can\'t solidly look in the eye and say, we will deliver it. So in some sense, it\'s a cultural issue, (inaudible) company. And if we end up under promising, we\'d rather have that than overpromising.', 'Shannon E. Young', ""Yes, Betty, I would just say, as I said in my earlier remarks, we still have strong conviction in the outlook that we put out in February. So 5% plus Oil growth, 0% to 5% BOE and Gas growth, all at $1.75 billion to $1.95 billion of annual capital. I think the results that we have delivered in the first quarter only gives us further conviction around that outlook. So we're still excited about it. And believe we'll be able to deliver it."", 'Thomas E. Jorden', 'Blake, do you want to say anything about the future position?', 'Blake A. Sirgo', ""I would just echo what Tom said. We don't bake in any efficiency gains in our 3-year outlook. What we're doing today is what we show. But as Tom said, the expectation here is that we get better every single year. We have a culture of operational excellence. That means what we did yesterday, will not cut it for today. And our teams are constantly looking for ways to drive our cost structure and efficiencies are expected. Now there's lots of other things that affect costs, what's the market going to do? How many rigs are running, how many crews are running? There's lots of things around our cost structure, we don't control.So -- we don't bake in anything. We don't bake in inflation, we don't bake in deflation, we don't bake in further efficiency gains. When we put out a guide, it's the way we see the world today."", 'Wei Jiang', ""That's great. And it definitely can see the operational momentum across the board, and that's not an issue at all from a culture perspective. On a -- my follow-up, I want to ask about the Harkey. I think in your slide deck, you mentioned that you will go back to the Harkey on the Windham Row in Phase 2 within the next 12 months. Just wondering, is there any incremental savings that you can extract from that second phase Harkey, both from shares facilities or anything along that line that you can expect on the cost side? And then secondarily, Tom, you mentioned that you saw some benefit from codevelopment. So what does that -- what could that mean for the Harkey pad -- Harkey road development?"", 'Blake A. Sirgo', ""Yes. This is Blake. I'll take that one. The -- there are cost efficiencies when we come back. The biggest ones our pads are built, our facilities are built. This is why, historically, we like if we can develop benches separately, you can let a bench decline in volume, come right back in at another bench for very little incremental cost. So we will enjoy some of those cost savings when we come back from the Harkey possible codeveloped benefits, that's really what we're interested in learning about. We've just seen some results lately that says the performance of the Harkey is better when we codevelop with the Upper Wolfcamp versus overfill. And we're interested in learning more about that. But as Tom said, until we do, we're leaning in. We're going where the data takes us, and we'll see what these next round of codeveloped wells tell us."", 'Operator', ""We'll move next to David Deckelbaum with TD Cowen."", 'David Adam Deckelbaum', ""I wanted to ask maybe a little bit of just a cost benefit analysis. You guys have been beating production now steadily largely on what appears to be cycle times and just finding ways to do things faster in the field, which is quite commendable. I think you guys articulated the benefits of cost savings on things like the Windham Row in the 10% range. As you get better with some of the smaller projects, how do you think about that balance versus larger project savings? Or should we think that even with some of the faster accomplishments that you've achieved with smaller developments that you would be able to exponentially improve upon that as you get to larger developments?"", 'Blake A. Sirgo', ""Yes, David, this is Blake. I'll take that one. I think it's important to iterate cost is an output of our decision-making. And so while lower cost really helped drive some of our economics, we are focused on total returns of our projects and the highest PVI. And so, if that ends up being a 3-well project in Lea County versus a 54-well project in Culberson County, we go where the PVIs tell us to go. And obviously, continued cost gains really help. Cycle times really help, but it doesn't drive where the rigs go. It really drives us that full economic analysis, and that's what we lean into."", 'Thomas E. Jorden', ""An example of that, I love what Blake said, the cost isn't a first order driver. For now and again, we'll have a project either underway or soon to be underway. And our teams through additional science analysis, we'll propose spending more on completions on a project and drives the cost up. But we always look at the incremental benefit financially and make the best decision we can. We learned -- we all learned early on that you can't save yourself rich. You have to create value."", 'David Adam Deckelbaum', 'I appreciate the color on that. Maybe just pivoting to the Marcellus, a similar line of questioning on just how you thought through deferring completion activity versus curtailing existing production and keeping up with the completion kins, if there is sort of the inefficiency of drilling programs and frac crews that gets lost in that process or how you guys approach that sort of thought train?', 'Blake A. Sirgo', ""Sure. This is Blake. I'll take that one. Yes, it absolutely as a trade-off, you're spot on. Our preference is to run a frac crew continuously. We know that's when we get our best efficiencies. But, once again, it's back to that investment case and what are the economics of the project. And while that might give us better efficiencies, given where gas prices are, we just can't have that level of investment in the Marcellus right now. We need to slow down. We need to throttle down. And so that does mean usually giving up a little bit of efficiency but that's still the prudent capital decision to make, and that's why we're doing it."", 'Thomas E. Jorden', ""I want to give a little different spin on an answer here, David. The Marcellus is a great operating area, and we are very constructive on natural gas prices. But I'm also going to tell you that, as you know, we've reentered a part of the field that hasn't seen drilling over time. And we're very pleased to be doing that. And this just gets to my being a responsible operator and communities we operate. Susquehanna County 20 years ago was one of the Forest Counties in Pennsylvania. And because of the resource development there, that county is thriving. And there's a whole group of landowners that have participated in that because we've been -- had an area we are precluded from drilling it. And so we want to be really thoughtful before we just defer completions there. And we're going to continue to have an ongoing activity and not that we're going to be financially reckless because we won't. But our impact on the community is part of our decision-making."", 'Operator', ""We'll go to our next question from Scott Gruber at Citigroup."", 'Scott Andrew Gruber', ""Tom, long-dated gas because they have been moving higher on all the data center growth excitement, how would you think about capital allocation between Anadarko and the Marcellus, if the forward curve is right, and we're in the $3.50 to $4 range, in late '25, '26? And Oil is still healthy, call it, in the 70s. How would you think about that allocation?"", 'Thomas E. Jorden', ""Well, I wouldn't have to thank very hard. I'd look at the incremental economics and we go where the best economics are. We have tremendous gas resources in both basins. The -- and Anadarko has natural gas liquids, which really provides an economic boost. But the Marcellus has amazingly low cost of supply, and we produce pure methane, which we just have to compress and put into an air state line, so -- or a pipeline. And so we would look at the economics. I think if we were -- if some of the promise comes through on the increased need for natural gas and electricity generation, you probably see us increase activity in both basins and also seek creative long-term contracts that might give us exposure to electricity pricing.Blake, you want to comment on that?"", 'Blake A. Sirgo', ""Yes, sure. I mean we're all learning this AI power demand story together, and there's a lot of unknowns, but there's a lot of excitement the power gen that's going to be required is huge. Lots of it looks like it's going to come on the East Coast. That's very proximal to our asset. There's a lot of existing pipes there that we can easily get our gas to those markets. And we're very interested. We're talking to a lot of these folks directly trying to understand their business and their needs, and we will be ready to participate."", 'Scott Andrew Gruber', ""It's exciting. We'll wait for a word. And then just turning back to Windham Row. Just curious, you mentioned doing simul-frac on half the wells. What's the limitation there, why not doing on all the wells? Is it comfort with the technique or tag configuration or scheduling the frac crews? Just some color on the limitation there? And if there's any upside to doing it on more than half?"", 'Blake A. Sirgo', ""Yes, Scott, it's Blake. I'll take that. That's a great question. And I think it's something that gets missed sometimes in simul-frac is you really have to have an optimal pad with a lot of wellheads on one pad to optimize the cost savings. There is sometimes where you might some frac and save no money because a simul frac crew is just basically 2 frac crews smashed together. So you're paying a lot of money for that crew to be there. The efficiencies come when you have a lot of wells on one pad. And just the layout of these drill spacing units doesn't always give us enough wells per pad to use simul-frac optimally. So it's back to that whole cycle analysis. The goal is not to simul-frac everything. The goal is to make the most economic wells. And so we're only chasing it where it makes sense."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Neal Dingmann at Truist.', 'Neal David Dingmann', ""My first question comes for you or Blake, maybe on inventory, specifically. Looking at Slide 5, you had an interesting comment that I think makes a lot of sense, and that's you all suggest that the total fluctuates based on things like well spacing cost, cadence and the like. And I'm just wondering how aggressive or conservative would you consider your estimates versus what you've seen play out in the trends in recent quarters?"", 'Thomas E. Jorden', ""Well, I'll just say, we have future landing zones that are not modeled in that inventory. But we want to be very careful with how we talk about inventory. And when I say that, I mean, we want to deliver what we promise. And so we don't throw the kitchen sink in, although our inventory today has zones that we didn't have in our inventory a few years ago. There are still zones to be tested, both shallow and deep. And we're pretty optimistic about our ability to extract maximum value out of an acre of land. But the inventory we published is one that we think we can deliver."", 'Neal David Dingmann', ""Very good. And then just a second question on capital spend. Specifically, I noticed what I think now what is about 70% of CapEx is directly from Upper Marcellus. Is this a result of just productivity that you highlight on Slide 19 or what's driving the spend in the upper area?"", 'Blake A. Sirgo', ""Well, we have some great upper locations in the field. Our Tier 1 uppers really long lateral lengths, competitive economics. And so they're just competing for capital. But also the upper is the future of the assets. So we're -- we like having activity in the upper. We're still learning about it. We're still trying to understand our well spacing and our frac design. And it's important, we continue projects in that zone."", 'Operator', ""We'll go next to Derrick Whitfield at Stifel."", 'Derrick Lee Whitfield', 'Tom or Shane, a bit of a build on an earlier question. If gas prices were to continue to underperform throughout 2024. How would you weigh or evaluate the decision between reallocation of CapEx and increased return of capital? I suspect your Anadarko and Permian teams would like more capital.', 'Thomas E. Jorden', ""Yes. You're saying the Marcellus pricing stays kind of in and around where it is like this through the rest of the year?"", 'Derrick Lee Whitfield', 'That is correct.', 'Thomas E. Jorden', ""Yes. Well, look, here's what I'd say is we do build in a lot of flexibility into our capital planning. And a couple of that's really foundational to that and a couple of things. One, some plans to accelerate if market environment changes and things get better and also to decelerate if they deteriorate or, in this case, don't firm up a little bit.I think the second element is we don't engage in a lot of long-term contracting. And that's really what gives us the flexibility to make those adjustments as we go. And I would say we maintain that flexibility as we get to the end of this year and into next year, if that's what the market signals say, and that's what translates through into the economics. We certainly have a great set of inventory that we just talked about throughout the portfolio that would have a call on, on capital if prices remain like this for an extended period of time."", 'Derrick Lee Whitfield', ""As my follow-up, regarding the deferred turn-in-lines in the Marcellus. How long would you technically be comfortable in deferring the wells before you'd be concerned with compromising the effectiveness or integrity of the completion?"", 'Thomas E. Jorden', ""We've looked at that long and hard and we don't see a degradation in shut-in time. There's a history as you go back a decade of fairly significant shut-ins. We don't really have a time clock attached to it. But I -- we're anticipating turning these wells online later in the year. And we're -- our data tells us that those reservoirs will not suffer because of it. And part of that is because we don't produce much water there. And so you don't really have the issues that you might have in the other basins."", 'Operator', ""We'll go next to Leo Mariani at Roth MKM."", 'Leo Paul Mariani', ""I wanted to just dive in a little bit more to CapEx here. I wanted to kind of get a sense on sort of how the numbers are trending. See second quarter CapEx is going higher, do you expect CapEx to kind of come down a little bit in the second half versus the first half, is kind of second quarter, potentially the peak here and -- when you talk about flexibility in the program, I know you mentioned a couple of times, potentially room for more activity. Is that more just kind of a function of some of the savings you've seen year-to-date?"", 'Shannon E. Young', ""Leo, thanks for the question. And look, there's a couple of things I would just point to, one, Hana put together a great slide, a new slide in the deck, in the appendix 33 that sort of shows where some of the activity is over the course of the year. And your point that you just made around, does it feel like the second quarter could be a peak capital quarter and then the back half of the year, if you take the residual and divide by 2, that may be a lower number than that. And that sort of bears itself out, I think, on this page. So I don't -- yes, I think you're interpreting the data the right way in terms of what the pace could look like for 2024."", 'Leo Paul Mariani', 'Okay. I appreciate that. Then I just wanted to follow up a little bit on kind of Upper Marcellus. As you look out the next couple of years, do you see the Upper Marcellus becoming kind of a increasing percentage of your overall Marcellus activity. Is that going to be just kind of driven by somewhat the depletion of the lower Marcellus in the inventory stack here?', 'Blake A. Sirgo', ""Yes, Leo, you nailed it. It's -- the Lower Marcellus has been a wonderful zone, and we know all the remaining sticks, and we plan on drilling them here in the next few years. And the remaining is all the upper. That's the future of the asset. And so as we are chewing through our lower inventory, you'll see more upper come in each year. We're really focused on testing and delineating the upper and just proving it out. But yes, depending on capital spend, the upper will be a bigger and bigger portion of our program."", 'Leo Paul Mariani', ""Okay. No, that's helpful. But it sounds like the message is you think the upper can be very, very competitive with other gas assets as you look at it today?"", 'Blake A. Sirgo', ""Yes. I mean there's parts of the field that are super competitive, but I'll just caveat the Lower Marcellus in this asset is some of the absolute best rock in all of the Lower 48. And I don't think it's going to compete with the cream with a crop lower that's been drilled. But there's -- it's still very competitive in our capital allocation."", 'Thomas E. Jorden', ""Yes. And Leo, competitiveness is always a function of well performance, but also price. And that's a nice thing about Coterra where we said is we really do have an asset mix allows us to shift capital and allocate it based on those changes. So competitiveness of assets is not a static thing."", 'Operator', ""Next, we'll go to Charles Meade at Johnson Rice."", 'Charles Arthur Meade', ""Just one question for me, and it's around the way you guys are going to approach the Marcellus in the back half of the year. I think you -- I heard you mentioned in your prepared comments that your plan has you guys turning some wells on in July. And as I think about recent history up in the Marcellus, a lot of times, we can see a good price bounce in the summer, but then we see another bout of weakness in the fall when the cooling demand goes away.So is there a scenario where you guys bring some wells on in July and then curtail them or kind of you shut them in again in the fall? Or is it more along the lines of once you guys decide to bring them on? You're just going to -- you're going to keep them on and does that bias you to turn them on later?"", 'Thomas E. Jorden', ""Yes. I'll just -- I'll answer your question with the analogy. We've said from day 1 that the way we manage our program is not a rifle shot, it's a guided missile. So sitting here and saying we're going to turn wells on in July, that's talking about a rifle shot. We're going to guide that missile every step of the way. We typically don't manage our production up and down with the near-term price file. It usually takes something structural for us to make production decisions around price. And that's the luxury of having low-cost supply, by the way. Right now, we have a structural issue with low gas prices, which is why we've turned those in line. And I'll just say that July is what we're carrying in our current model, and we're going to make the best business decision and model will be down. So I want to make sure of that. But I don't think you'd see us ramp our production up and down with a changing price file. We just like to get north of a place where with the low-cost supply, we don't have to worry about it."", 'Operator', 'And that concludes our Q&A session. I will now turn the conference back over to Tom Jorden for closing remarks.', 'Thomas E. Jorden', ""Yes. I just want to thank everybody. Great set of questions. We are very pleased to present the results we presented last night and look forward to repeating that. And as I said many times on this call, it's our -- talking about results is the conversation we want to have. So thank you all very much for your participation this morning."", 'Operator', ""And this concludes today's conference call. Again, thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.""]"

Vote on the BLUE Proxy Card to elect the entire Shareholder Slate at the Annual Meeting.', '***', 'Norfolk Southern Shareholder,', 'I appreciate that many of you are evaluating what my colleagues and I have said in recent weeks about moving Norfolk Southern forward. Both sides have obviously sent you a lot of information to consider and digest before votes are cast at the Annual Meeting. Rather than ask you to read another long letter, I’m writing to you to share just a few personal thoughts on why I want to be part of the railroad’s turnaround and what I plan to deliver for you and the other constituents.', 'When Ancora approached me in 2023 about serving as a proposed director and its suggested CEO, I spent a lot of time independently analyzing Norfolk Southern and considering whether my skills could speed up a turnaround. I am blessed to be able to be selective at this point in my life, and I don’t have any unfulfilled goals in my career after 35 great years at UPS. This enabled me to take my time assessing Norfolk Southern’s challenges and opportunities from the perspective of each of the Company’s key constituents: shareholders, customers, employees, regulators and the communities that trains run through each day. After thinking everything through and reflecting on the transferability of my experiences, I knew I could help move this great brand in the right direction – whether that be as a director, CEO or both.', 'In terms of what our slate wants to deliver, it starts with a culture of accountability, integrity, safety, sustainability and teamwork – all of which underpin highly-efficient and service-oriented logistics companies. These priorities are core to our three-year strategy for initiating a network redesign and implementing true Precision Scheduled Railroading (""PSR""). This strategy, which is distinct from Norfolk Southern’s resilience model, involves laying a foundation that positions proven operators to deliver quantifiable improvements in three primary areas:', 'Service – Transitioning to a true scheduled network will dramatically increase on-time delivery for customers, leading to more trust and more high-margin revenue over time. The Company’s Merchandise Trip Plan Compliance has dramatically underperformed the Surface Transportation Board’s 82% compliance target for years. This weak service has nothing to do with the East Palestine derailment, but rather maintaining a poorly designed network with excess assets and lax scheduling. Fortunately, our strategy provides a roadmap for getting Trip Plan Compliance well above the federal compliance target in the coming quarters.', 'Safety – A true scheduled network will allow Norfolk Southern’s most valued asset, its people, to return home in the same condition they report to work in while also reducing catastrophic incidents that absorb shareholder capital and hinder the brand. In terms of KPIs, we will target a decline in severe derailments and a reduction in the number of reported accidents relative to total network activity. Although accidents periodically occur, Norfolk Southern’s current resilience model has led to the industry’s most costly and severe derailments over the past two-and-a-half years. Safety isn’t a buzzword to me, but an output of tangible policies that are deeply ingrained in an organization. Our strategy accounts for concrete initiatives that will cut down on train switches, decrease dangerous train congestion, and reduce burnout and hours unpredictability.', 'Shareholder Value – I am a true believer that the organization with the best network wins for all constituents. With our scheduled network in place, Norfolk Southern will have a transparent path to balancing service and safety enhancements with operating ratio and share price improvements. A redesigned network powered by PSR will benefit from a permanent reduction in assets, delays and touch points. As assets come out of the network, we will rely on annual attrition (not job cuts or furloughs) to right size our workforce. All of this should ultimately translate to approximately $1.1 billion in annualized savings and an operating ratio in the mid-to-high 50s.', 'When we first hit the road in this campaign, it was clear some of the Company’s constituencies would need to be convinced about what our slate brings to the table. After all, it’s not enough to diagnose problems and speak in broad terms about solutions. On a personal level, one of the most rewarding parts of this contest has been earning the belief of the BLET Teamsters and BMWED Teamsters. As a former Teamster, I’m incredibly grateful for the opportunity to earn their support. My goal is to bring this same spirit of constructive thinking and teamwork to Norfolk Southern and its boardroom.', 'Thank you again for your consideration and time, and we will reward you and all the constituents for a vote of confidence in us.

Reported EPS is $0.72, expectations were $0.7. The Coca-Cola Company isn’t one of the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds at the end of the third quarter (see the details here).', ""Operator: At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to The Coca-Cola Company's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. All participants will be on listen only mode until the formal question-and-answer portion of the call. I would like to remind everyone that the purpose of this conference is to talk with investors and therefore questions from the media will not be addressed.

Please limit yourself to one question. Re-enter the queue to ask any follow-up. Now I will turn the call over to James.', ""James Quincey: Thanks, Robin, and good morning everyone. We're off to a good start this year as our first quarter results continue the momentum we've been building by executing our all-weather strategy. The operating backdrop differed greatly across our markets once again, but our powerful portfolio, coupled with our systems capabilities, equip us with the agility we need to deliver on our 2024 guidance, which we are updating today. This morning I'll discuss the drivers in the quarter and how we used our scale and growth mind-set to deliver these strong results. Then I'll highlight how we continue to meet consumer needs and grow our total beverage portfolio. Finally, John will discuss our financial results and updated 2024 guidance."", ""In the first quarter we grew volume and expanded comparable margins and we continued to invest across the business. We're managing currency fluctuations to deliver earnings growth, as shown by the 7% comparable earnings per share growth despite 9% currency headwinds. And we gained value share in both at home and away from home channels. Across the world we're continuing to win in the market by leveraging our scale and relying on our local expertise about bottling partners. In Asia Pacific, momentum continued across a large portion of our business, including Japan and South Korea, Philippines and Thailand. We gained traction in Indonesia with return to volume growth. India's momentum was impacted by some temporary factors but recovered at the end of March."", ""In China, retail sales growth continues to improve, but consumer confidence is below 2019 levels. We remain optimistic about the many opportunities ahead of us and we're stepping up our execution in a number of ways; for example, greater focus on our core business through a more segmented market approach and more surgical horizontal market execution. In EMEA, we're seeing gradual improvement in macro trends in Europe, leading to improved consumer confidence. We've paired Sprite with spicy meal occasions to drive momentum in a way from home channels. Fuze Tea and Powerade also generated strong performance and Jack Daniel's & Coca-Cola expanded to six more European markets during the quarter. Africa saw continued volume momentum from last quarter, while navigating a number of markets with significant currency devaluations."", ""Geopolitical and economic challenges in Eurasia and the Middle East continue to affect our business in the region. We're working closely with local partners to manage these challenging dynamics and we're committed to investing behind the strength of our brands for the long term. North America volume had a slow start to the quarter before posting sequential improvement in each of the last two months of the quarter and elasticities remain favorable leading to ongoing share gains. The launch of Coke Space featured compelling in-store displays. Across our sparkling soft drink brands Zero Sugar performance was strong and we introduced 12-ounce slim cans to further drive premiumization. Value-added dairy growth continued across fairlife and core power."", ""In sports drinks, notwithstanding the non-cash impairment charge that John will speak to in more detail, we believe our two brand strategy with Powerade and BODYARMOR is gaining traction and we've seen improved share trends. While we still have work to do, the stepped up execution by our dedicated sales force is driving improved on-shelf execution and we're encouraged by the continued growth in sports water and the more recent BODYARMOR innovations including Zero Sugar and Flash I.V. While inflation has moderated and wages continue to trend upward in North America we are closely monitoring consumer sentiment and traffic trends between at home and away from home consumption. In Latin America volume momentum continued. Performance was driven by strength in Mexico, Brazil and Colombia while Argentina continued to experience highly inflationary conditions."", ""We have quality leadership across our portfolio in Latin America with Coca-Cola Zero Sugar continuing its strong performance. Sparkling Flavors, sports, juices and alcohol ready to drink also perform well during the quarter. Commercial initiatives are driving improved shelf space and basket incidence supported by ongoing outlet digitization. We have suggested order capabilities in digital platforms that reach more than 3 million customers in the region. Across developed markets the overall inflationary environment is normalizing. However, across developing emerging markets there continues to be a handful of markets that are experiencing intense inflation which is driving elevated pricing offset by incremental currency headwinds. We're proactively managing these volatile environments and we feel confident we have the playbook to navigate challenges locally while continuing our momentum at a consolidated level."", ""We're continuing to spin our strategic flywheel faster across total beverage portfolio. As discussed at CAGNY, we're building loved brands and innovating and delivering bigger, bolder, bets. In the first quarter we launched K-Wave as part of the Coke’s creations platform in markets across five operating units. K-Wave celebrates Korean pop or K-Pop fans. They include the global collaboration with three K-Pop groups and an AI based fan experience. Our growing number of Coke creations are different with each iteration and by design are only available for a limited time. This generates buzz and excitement building relevance for the brand and reconsideration for Coke with Gen Z drinkers. We also know that sometimes the most successful lasting innovation is simply improving the taste of existing drinks."", 'Using our deep in-house flavor expertise and understanding of the science of taste we have worked to refine the recipes for Fanta and Sprite to meet consumer preferences across many markets. These changes bring new consumers to our brands, as well as remind current consumers what drew them to their favorite beverages in the first place. The strong Fanta performance in markets from Brazil to Germany to the US this quarter is largely due to this type of innovation, which was supported by marketing messages focused on taste and on tying the brand to snacking occasions and local festivals like Carnival in Brazil. Elsewhere in our total beverage portfolio, Minute Maid Zero Sugar kicked off its global campaign in North America, leveraging influencers, social media, and connected commerce activations with key customers.', ""We're building on our innovations by driving awareness and excitement through an increasingly digital marketing media mix. Our total beverage portfolio plays a lead role as shown by the New Guy campaign in the US this quarter, which featured multiple brands across categories. Innovation is woven into the fabric of our culture, and we're encouraged by our innovation pipeline as we look forward to the rest of 2024. Moving across the flywheel, we're leaning into integrated execution to drive basket incidents and create incremental value for customers. We work closely with our bottling partners and went bigger with in-store displays to inspire transactions around key events like NCAA March Madness in the US, and we'll do this again later this summer with the Olympic and Paralympic Games."", ""As a system, to improve quality availability, we increased outlets by 2%, added more than 600,000 cooler doors, and increased our share of cold space and overall shelf space in stores. We've benefited from global scale while maintaining local relevance by tying our brands to regional meals occasions. For example, in Japan, we've associated Coke with Wagyu and Yakiniku through the path to purchase, using end-to-end consumer messaging and partnering with key customers in the modern trade and convenience retail. We have seen strong Coca-Cola revenue growth in Japan. While we continue to grow our business, we also strive to positively impact the communities we serve. We do this by focusing on the issues that matter most to our system, and we share our statements and learnings each year when we publish our business and sustainability report."", ""Putting it all together, it's early in the year, but we're off to a good start. We have confidence we will achieve our guidance for the year. With that, I'll turn the call over to John."", ""John Murphy : Thank you, James, and good morning everyone. Our first quarter results mark a continuation of the underlying momentum in our business, driven by a strong and focused system. We delivered another quarter of volume growth, even as we cycled strong results. Additionally, we completed the refranchising of several bottlers during the quarter, leading to further comparable margin expansion. We've progressed on our refranchising agenda while making sure we best position our system to deliver long-term growth, and we earn a fair return on our investments. We continue to invest behind our portfolio with discipline and flexibility, thanks to our enhanced resource allocation agenda. During the quarter, we grew organic revenues 11%."", 'We had 1% unit case growth. Concentrate sales were behind unit case volume by three points, driven by one less day in the quarter and the timing of concentrate shipments primarily in Mexico and the Middle East. Our price mix growth of 13% in the quarter was driven by approximately six points of intense inflationary pricing across a handful of markets to offset significant currency devaluation, pricing actions across a number of markets, and a couple of points of favorable mix. Excluding impacts from intense inflationary pricing, organic revenue growth in the first quarter was at the high end of our long-term growth algorithm. Comparable gross margin for the quarter was up approximately 130 basis points, driven by underlying expansion and a benefit from bottler refranchising, partially offset by the impact of currency headwinds.', 'Comparable operating margin expanded approximately 60 basis points for the quarter. This was primarily driven by strong top-line growth and bottler refranchising, partially offset by currency headwinds and an increase in marketing investments. Markets experiencing intense inflation represent only a single-digit contribution to our volume, but continue to have an outsized impact on the shape of our P&L. Putting it all together, first quarter comparable EPS of $0.72 was up 7% year-over-year, including 9% currency headwinds, which were driven by currency devaluation in markets experiencing intense inflation. Free cash flow was approximately $160 million, an increase from the prior year. Before moving on, I want to discuss two items that are included in our first quarter reported results.', ""A $765 million charge related to the remeasurement of contingent consideration liability for our acquisition of fairlife. Our final payment related to the fairlife acquisition will take place in 2025. This payment has grown as fairlife has outperformed. We continue to be encouraged by our ability to scale fairlife organically. Secondly, a non-cash impairment charge of $760 million related to BODYARMOR. While we are taking a charge to reflect revised projections and a higher discount rate since the acquisition date of BODYARMOR, we believe in the power of our two sports brand strategy with Powerade and BODYARMOR. We're taking actions to help create long-term value, and we're seeing signs that this strategy is working. Our balance sheet remains strong, and our net debt leverage of 1.6 times EBITDA is below our targeted range of 2 times to 2.5 times."", ""This gives us ample capacity for potential upcoming payments in 2024 related to the IRS tax case, which we continue to vigorously defend, and the upcoming fairlife payment in 2025. We continue to remain consistent in our approach to prioritizing our capital allocation. We're committed to investing to drive growth and to support our dividend, which we have raised for 62 consecutive years. We're confident our business model has the flexibility to allow us to deliver on our overall objectives. Our updated 2024 guidance reflects the underlying momentum of our business, and we now expect organic revenue growth of 8% to 9% and comparable currency neutral earnings per share growth of 11% to 13%. Our revised top-line guidance is solely driven by higher than expected inflationary pricing in a handful of markets, which we expect to moderate throughout the year."", 'Bottler refranchising is still expected to be a four to five point headwind to comparable net revenues and a two point headwind to comparable earnings per share, but will have a positive impact on both our margins and the return profile of our business. Based on current rates and our hedge positions, we anticipate an approximate four to five point currency headwind to comparable net revenues and an approximate seven to eight point currency headwind to comparable earnings per share for full year 2024. This increase in currency headwind is driven by intense inflationary markets, while the rest of the currency basket is relatively neutral to our results. Our underlying effective tax rate for 2024 is now expected to be 19%. All in, we continue to expect comparable earnings per share growth of 4% to 5% versus $2.69 in 2023.', ""There are some considerations to keep in mind. We estimate the ongoing conflict in the Middle East has approximately a point of impact on volume growth during the first quarter of 2024. It's unclear how long this impact will last. The cadence of structural impact will be larger in the second and third quarters due to the timing of transaction closing during the first quarter and the seasonality of the businesses we refranchised. Finally, there will be two additional days in the fourth quarter. To sum it up, and as James said, the year has started off well. We remain focused on the execution of our all-weather strategy. Thanks to the partnership of our system and the ongoing dedication of our people, we're confident we can create value for our stakeholders and deliver on our guidance for the year."", ""As we said at CAGNY, we're primed for performance in 2024 and over the long term. With that, operator, we are ready to take questions."", 'See also', '15 Cheapest European Countries to Visit in 2024 and', '20 Countries with the Highest Share of Youth Not in Education, Employment or Training (NEET).', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

PEP and The Coca-Cola Company KO for the top spot is endless. While investors are always perplexed about choosing either of these stocks over the other, the two global soft drinks biggies have attracted investors for several reasons, including expansion efforts and shareholder returns.', 'The beverage soft drinks industry has evolved in the recent years, with consumers looking for healthier alternatives, moving away from the initial charm of carbonated drinks. With this, the industry’s two heavyweights — Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, commanding market caps of $267.1 billion and $241.2 billion, respectively — have expanded their product portfolios to include juices, bottled water, functional beverages like sports and energy drinks, and coffee and tea.Coca-Cola has retained its position as a market leader in the global non-alcoholic beverages industry, with more than 40% market share. With a key focus on non-alcoholic ready-to-drink beverages, Coca-Cola has expanded its portfolio over the years, comprising brands like Powerade, SmartWater, Minute Maid, BODYARMOR, Costa, Dasani, dogadan, FUZE TEA and fairlife.Coming to its arch-rival, PepsiCo has slowly diluted its position in the beverage industry, expanding in the complimentary convenient food segment, including snacking brands like Frito-Lay, Lay’s Chips, Cheetos and a range of Quaker cereals. Then again, the company’s beverage range includes brands like Gatorade, Pepsi-Cola, Tropicana juices, Mountain Dew, 7UP and Mirinda, garnering a market share of around 20% in the soft drinks industry.Based on market share and market cap, Coca-Cola commands a lead over its non-alcoholic beverage competitors, generating nearly 50% of the industry’s global sales. However, PepsiCo continues to claim the second place in the industry.Although both soft drink behemoths are attractive long-term buys, with the first-quarter 2024 results of these companies reported in about two weeks, it is ideal to evaluate these stocks on the earnings ground.', 'Both PepsiCo and Coca-Cola posted strong results for first-quarter 2024, notching neck-to-neck earnings per share growth rates of 7.3% and 7%, respectively. These also reflect a positive earnings surprise of 5.9% for PepsiCo and 4.4% for Coca-Cola compared with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Meanwhile, revenues improved 2.3% year over year for PepsiCo and 3% for Coca-Cola, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Revenue growth for both beverage behemoths mainly resulted from the recently implemented price increases across all markets.Looking ahead, both companies have provided positive revenue and earnings outlooks, anticipating continued momentum in their businesses. PepsiCo expects at least 4% year-over-year organic revenue growth for 2024, with core constant-currency EPS growth of at least 8%. PEP anticipates 2024 core EPS to increase 7%, indicating continued gains from operational efficiencies.Coca-Cola plans organic revenue growth of 8-9% for 2024, with comparable currency-neutral earnings per share estimated to increase 11-13% year over year. The company anticipates 2024 comparable earnings per share to improve 4-5%.', 'From the earnings and outlook perspective, both PEP and KO have scored full marks. Additionally, analysts’ earnings expectations for both companies have moved higher following their results, indicating positive near-term prospects.PepsiCo’s EPS estimates for 2024 moved up by a penny to $8.16 per share in the last 30 days. Notably, PEP’s 2024 revenues are projected to grow 3.4% year over year to $94.6 billion and EPS are expected to ascent 7.1% year over year to $8.16.Then again, Coca-Cola’s EPS estimates for 2024 moved up by a penny to $2.82 in the past seven days. KO’s 2024 revenues are expected to increase 0.1% year over year to $45.8 billion and EPS is likely to advance 4.8% year over year to $2.82 per share.Therefore, we can clearly see that PepsiCo and Coca-Cola have seen analysts raising estimates after their earnings releases. However, PepsiCo has higher expected growth rates for sales and earnings for this year. Consequently, PepsiCo currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Meanwhile, Coca-Cola currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

And whereas very few ""next-big-thing"" stocks actually work out, mature businesses give investors a much higher probability of success.', 'Two such mature businesses are United Rentals (NYSE: URI) and Waste Management (NYSE: WM). They specialize in equipment rentals and garbage disposal, respectively. Investors yawn at these boring businesses. But both are outpacing the returns of the S&P 500 by a wide margin over the last 10 years.', 'Moreover, both United Rentals and Waste Management just reported quarterly financial results, showing once again that these are unstoppable businesses for the long haul.', ""With more than 1,500 locations in North America, United Rentals is the market-share leader for equipment rentals with 15% of the market. The company has a fleet of equipment valued at $21 billion as of March. And by managing this fleet well with both rentals and sales when appropriate, it's become a free cash flow machine."", 'On April 24, United Rentals reported financial results for the first quarter of 2024. It generated free cash flow of $869 million during the quarter. This puts it on track to generate $2.1 billion for the year. If it hits its full-year goal, the company will have earned over $10 billion in free cash flow in just five years. Not bad for a company with a market cap of $46 billion as of this writing.', ""United Rentals doesn't idly sit on its cash. It buys other businesses to increase its market share. Most recently, in March, it acquired Yak Access (a company that facilitates access in right of ways) for $1.1 billion in cash.

But in 2028, it hopes to generate $20 billion in revenue. Therefore, there's still upside for investors who buy shares of this unstoppable business today."", 'Like United Rentals, Waste Management reported financial results for the first quarter of 2024 on April 24. And as is usually the case, revenue is up for the company and profits are hitting new records.', 'Waste Management has competitive advantages. It operates various landfills and recycling plants, which require permitting and are costly to get started. It also has an incredibly high customer retention rate, since trash removal and recycling are services that are constantly needed.', ""Waste Management already generates plenty of free cash flow -- it expects at least $2 billion in 2024 alone. But the company's free cash flow isn't quite where it could be because it's been spending heavily on a project that harvests gas from its landfills and converts it into usable fuel."", ""The cost to invest in this project is already going down for Waste Management and is expected to unlock higher profitability in coming years. In Q1, the company finished one of its landfill-to-natural-gas projects and expects to commission four more facilities this year. These facilities add to the company's profits by harvesting something it already has just sitting in its landfills."", 'Waste Management uses much of its profits to give back to shareholders. The company had $714 million in Q1 free cash flow. In comparison, it returned $557 million to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks. This shows that management is intent on rewarding shareholders.', ""I believe that both United Rentals and Waste Management are top dogs with competitive advantages that will make their businesses unstoppable for years to come. That said, I wouldn't say that either stock is necessarily a good deal right now."", 'From a free-cash-flow perspective, Waste Management stock is clearly trading at an above-average price.

Rodriguez', ""Thank you, Nic, and thank you all for joining our call today. Through the first quarter, we continued building on the momentum generated through 2023, demonstrating operational discipline while continuing to find opportunities to invest, innovate and most importantly, deliver clinical excellence. Today, I will cover our first quarter results, provide color on our expanding international business and wrap up with an update on Change Healthcare claim disruption. Before we get into our first quarter performance, I'll start as we always do with a clinical highlight.One of our strategic goals is to provide solutions for patients at every stage along the kidney care journey, including helping to support transplantation. Our aspiration is to enable as many patients as possible to receive this life-changing gift. Let me highlight 3 ways that DaVita is helping to address the systemic challenges of kidney transplant. The first is patient referrals to transplant centers. We recently achieved our highest monthly rate with more than 2/3 of DaVita patients under the age of 75 years old being referred for transplant. The second is living donation. The number of living donors in the United States has essentially been flat over the past 2 decades. To encourage more living donors, we partnered with the National Kidney Foundation on its Big Ask, Big Give campaign to educate the community on living donation. We also offered patients a range of resources to support them through the conversations about living donation. And finally, because there is a gap on transplant rates across race and ethnicity, we created a new Health Equity Learning Lab. By deploying transplant navigators, we're testing novel approaches to drive a more equitable distribution of patients succeeding on their quest to receive a transplant. Through these and other efforts, more than 8,000 DaVita patients received a kidney transplant in 2023, the highest number of annual transplant in our history. Unfortunately, the largest challenge continues to be constrained organ supply. You may have seen recent stories about compassionate care cases involving genetically engineered-pig kidneys. This is an exciting first step as society aspires to a future where organ availability is no longer a constraint for patients living with kidney disease. It is still in its early days for this technology as human trials will take some time. In the meantime, we will continue to invest in transplant and participate in innovations that will improve access to this life-changing outcome. Transitioning to our first quarter performance. Adjusted operating income was $463 million, and adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations was $2.38. We had a strong quarter across our core financial trilogy with treatment volume and patient care costs performing in line with our expectations and incremental upside driven by revenue per treatment. Our Q1 performance provided increased confidence in our full year expectations, and therefore, we're raising the bottom of our adjusted operating income guidance putting our updated range at $1.875 billion to $1.975 billion. Within these consolidated results, our international business is a growing piece of DaVita's portfolio. As a reminder, our international strategy is focused on 3 primary principles, first, identify markets that enable us to invest in clinical differentiation and provide excellent standards of care to our patients. Second, operate in countries where we have a path to achieve meaningful scale led by strong local management teams. And finally, hold ourselves to the same discipline of capital-efficient growth and attractive risk-adjusted returns that we use for all of our business segments.Following these principles, in March, we signed an agreement to invest $300 million to expand our operations in Brazil and Colombia and enter Chile, and Ecuador through the acquisitions of high-quality centers in those 4 markets. The Chile acquisition has closed and the transaction in Ecuador, Colombia and Brazil remains subject to each country's respective antitrust and regulatory approval process, which we expect to be completed at various times throughout 2024. Opportunistic transactions such as this one are consistent with our overall enterprise capital allocation strategy. Going forward, we will continue to monitor the market for acquisition opportunities that meet our investment criteria and we otherwise expect international investment to be roughly consistent with our historical levels.Upon completion of these transactions and combined with our existing business, we would be the largest dialysis provider in Latin America. Once these acquisitions close, we will provide care in 13 countries outside the United States with more than 500 centers treating approximately 80,000 patients and employing nearly 20,000 health care professionals. In 2024, we expect international growth to contribute approximately $20 million or about 1 percentage point to DaVita's overall enterprise growth in adjusted operating income. Most importantly, our international clinical outcomes continue to excel. We outperformed the clinical benchmarks of every international market in which we operate, and we have reduced hospitalizations across all countries by 11% since 2021, which has driven a reduction in unnecessary health care expense and represents a meaningful improvement to our patients' lives. And finally, let me cover our experience with the Change Healthcare outage and where we stand today. Historically, the vast majority of our U.S. dialysis claim went through the Change platform. Similar to many providers, this presented a challenging situation in the back half of Q1 as we were unable to submit claims through this channel. As reflected in our first quarter balance sheet, the increase in our days sales outstanding and borrowing on our revolving credit facility were entirely related to the Change outage. Joel will provide more detail, but to summarize, we have resumed billing activity, and we're collecting cash well in excess of our typical levels as we catch up from the claims backlog. As of today, we believe that the operational impact from the Change Healthcare disruptions are largely resolved.I will now turn it over to Joel to discuss our financial performance and outlook in more detail."", 'Joel Ackerman', ""Thank you, Javier. First quarter adjusted operating income was $463 million. Adjusted earnings per share was $2.38, and free cash flow was negative $327 million. Our Q1 results reflect strong core operating performance as well as the impacts from delayed submission and payment of claims due to the Change Healthcare outage, which I will expand on shortly. With that, let me dive into the detail for the quarter.U.S. dialysis treatments per day were slightly lower in Q1 as compared to Q4, consistent with our expectations for the quarter. Q1 was our fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year new-to-dialysis admissions growth, although mortality remains elevated relative to pre-COVID levels. For the full year, we maintain our expectations of 1% to 2% treatment volume growth. Revenue per treatment was down approximately $2 quarter-over-quarter. This is primarily due to typical seasonality related to patient coinsurance and deductibles offset by typical rate increases, contracted escalators and mix improvements. We continue to see strength in RPT as the result of revenue cycle improvements and we're trending towards the top of our original RPT range of 2.5% to 3% growth year-over-year.Non-GAAP patient care cost per treatment declined $8 sequentially, down from the seasonally elevated fourth quarter. As a reminder, Q4 seasonality was higher than typical and we see this reflected in the sequential quarterly change. International adjusted operating income increased $15 million sequentially, a return to normal from a low in Q4 related to higher bad debt reserves. Additionally, Q1 benefited from foreign exchange tailwinds. As Javier mentioned, this quarter, we announced acquisitions in 4 Latin American countries, including our entrance into Chile and our anticipated entrants into Ecuador. These acquisitions are expected to close at various points during 2024 and we anticipate that their partial year operating income in 2024 will largely be offset by expenses related to the acquisitions. Transitioning to cash flow and capital allocations. As you'll see in our quarter end numbers, U.S. dialysis days sales outstanding increased by 19 days. And at the end of the quarter, we were drawn $765 million on our revolver, reflecting an increase in our leverage ratio to 3.3x at the end of Q1. As Javier noted, these increases are directly attributable to the Change Healthcare outage. Since the Change platform has come back online, these metrics have improved dramatically. We have caught up and are now current on primary claims submission. Cash receipts are catching up and we have fully paid down the $765 million of revolver draw through a combination of strong April cash flow and interest-free funding from UnitedHealth Group, Change's parent company. By the end of Q2, we expect the majority of the DSO increase to have reversed.In Q1, we repurchased 2.1 million shares, but out of an abundance of caution, we temporarily suspended our share repurchases in March in light of the Change disruption. Given where we are today, we expect to resume share repurchases subject to our typical capital allocation considerations. As we look to full year 2024, we are updating adjusted operating income guidance to $1.875 billion to $1.975 billion, a $25 million increase in the midpoint relative to our previous guidance. We are also updating EPS guidance to a range from $9 to $9.80.That concludes my prepared remarks for today. Operator, please open the call for Q&A."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Andrew Mok with Barclays. You may go ahead, sir.', 'Andrew Mok', ""Treatments per day. I want to follow up on those comments. I think they're in line with your expectations. They were down sequentially and the normalized growth was up 40 basis points year-over-year. So one, trying to understand if there was any impact, whether it's weather or other seasonal impacts on the quarter? And two, any confidence on your levels to get back to 1% to 2% treatment growth for the year? Like what sort of visibility do you have on that? And what's going to drive that from here?"", 'Joel Ackerman', ""Yes. Thanks, Andrew. So the big difference between the year-over-year number on treatments per day versus the NAG number or the treatment number is actually day mix. So Q1 in '24 had an extra Tuesday and it also had New Year's Day on a Monday and what happens then is about half the volume gets pushed to Sunday. Those 2 things combined can lead to more than 0.5 point of volume swing. So I think of Q1 year-over-year as a positive number of 40 or 50 bps of year-over-year growth, but as you highlighted, below the 1% to 2% range. As I think about how do you bridge the range of 1% to 2% versus the Q1 number, I'd point to 2 things. First is clinic closures. The timing of clinic closures in the back half of 2023, and the pattern we're expecting for '24 is a drag on volume early in '24, but much less so towards the next 3 quarters. That would be one. The second is there's a lot of seasonality, both in new to dialysis admits as well as to mortality, and that could move from month to month. And just looking at the pattern of what we saw in '23 versus what we're expecting in '24, we still feel good about the 1% to 2% growth but we think it's going to come a little later in the year than anticipated. So I'd emphasize again, Q1 was in line with what we were expecting, the general pattern of new-to-dialysis admits being strong, offset by continued challenges on mortality. None of that has changed, and we feel good about the 1% to 2% for the year."", 'Andrew Mok', ""Got it. And then I think on that mortality comment, I think you said mortality remains elevated relative to pre-COVID levels. Any trends on how that's been tracking kind of year-to-year or quarter-to-quarter post COVID?"", 'Joel Ackerman', ""It has generally come down significantly since its peak. It does move around from quarter-to-quarter, and it's frankly, still a little early to know exactly where Q1 landed. As you know, we don't find out mortality until a few months after the period. So we're keeping a careful eye on it. It's -- as I said, it's come way down, but remains elevated."", 'Andrew Mok', 'Got it. Okay. And then maybe just one more on patient care costs. Cost per treatment were down another 1% year-over-year, and I think 3% sequentially. Anything in particular to call out there that helped drive the strong results.', 'Joel Ackerman', ""Yes. So sequentially, it's a lot about the higher seasonality we saw in Q4 that we called out. Year-over-year, wage pressure continues, as we've said, it's offset versus Q1 of '23 by lower contract costs and also a productivity pickup in the quarter."", 'Operator', 'Our next caller is Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank.', 'Philip Chickering', 'So revenue per treatment, really strong in the quarter. Was that due to sort of HIX enrollment or any other one-timers in there? Usually, it goes up sort of $4 to $5 sequentially as we burn through copays and deductibles. Is that the way to think -- is that the right way to think about it for rest of the year?', 'Joel Ackerman', ""Yes. I think that is right. The seasonality of, call it, $5 a treatment that we typically see in Q1, we saw this quarter. So we'd expect to pick that up in RPT in Q2 and the rest of the year. In terms of anything unusual in the quarter, nothing that I would highlight. I think the Q1 number is a pretty clean number off of which to model the rest of the year."", 'Philip Chickering', ""Okay. So that's sort of tracking above your guidance, like, if we move back to kind of where you guys are guiding revenue per treatment, you're basically guiding sort of almost mid-single digits. I mean sort of -- above sort of 3% range, and already and this continues, right?"", 'Joel Ackerman', ""We're right around the high end of the range, right around the 3%. If you think of the guide as being up $25 million at the midpoint, and you attribute that to RPT, which is, I think, a fair way to think about it, that would put you right around 3% year-over-year."", 'Philip Chickering', ""Okay. Fair enough. Was the Street mismodeling the first quarter operating income looking at the adjusted operating income beat of $39 million and the raise of $25 million. It looks [again like you] didn't raise the high point of the range. Just curious if you're missing it. And then is there any reason why you can't analyze the first quarter in OI sort of 23% to get to sort of $2 billion. I guess, why would that -- assuming trends don't change, why would that not be the right way to thinking about sort of where things could go if first quarter trends continue?"", 'Joel Ackerman', ""Yes. So look, seasonality is something that's -- I think there are clear patterns in our seasonality, but it does vary from year to year. The RPT pickup from Q1, I think, is probably the clearest part of our seasonality. Other things would be wage pressure tends to grow over the course of the year as does other parts of RPT, but the wage pressure tends to be higher. And then we often see Q4 expenses going up for year-end and other items. So we've seen, as we did in '23, some real negative seasonality in Q4. That's all around U.S. dialysis. .IKC is tougher to call out. We tend to do a little bit better in the back half of the year. But as you know, that can move around from year to year. So annualizing Q1, I don't think is the best way to get you there. I think actually, if you annualize our OI, you'd come in a little bit below our range. So I think you've got to adjust for the RPT. You've got to think about the Q4 seasonal weakness, and you'd get a number in our range."", 'Philip Chickering', 'Okay. Great. And then one quick numbers question. Can you quantify the number of new patients to dialysis in this quarter versus where that was this time last year?', 'Joel Ackerman', ""I don't have a number for you. That number typically grows with -- around the volume growth -- around our historical volume growth numbers, and I think it's right in there with that this quarter as well."", 'Operator', 'Our next caller is Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.', 'Kevin Mark Fischbeck', ""Great. I guess, it does kind of seem like going back to the RPT that like it feels more like you're raising the guidance for the outperformance in the quarter on that rather than a continuation of that higher rate sustaining? Is that true? Or you're saying the guidance now assumes that this higher rate is actually sustained throughout the rest of the year?"", 'Joel Ackerman', ""We're not raising it, assuming that this beat persists throughout the year. We're -- the quarter came in better than expected, but I don't think you can multiply that by 4 to get to the new number."", 'Kevin Mark Fischbeck', ""So why is that the case? It sounds like you're saying there is something unusual in it. So why -- Pito's question before, like why isn't it the seasonal kind of growth for the space and then therefore flow through every quarter?"", 'Joel Ackerman', ""It's -- I think part of it is how we were modeling it for the year, and it came in -- the pattern came in a little bit different than we expected."", 'Kevin Mark Fischbeck', ""Okay. So you had a higher year-end number and you're just getting there faster according to what you've seen in [Q1]."", 'Joel Ackerman', 'Yes.', 'Kevin Mark Fischbeck', ""Okay. And then, I guess, just on the IKC business, obviously, there's a lot of focus on cost trend within Medicare Advantage companies seem to be all over the place on in another year. Your experience is going to be a little bit different to Medicare Advantage broadly, but just love to kind of hear how you're seeing utilization play out under your managed programs there?"", 'Javier J. Rodriguez', ""Yes. Let me grab that one. I think the question that comes often is why are the MA players in kidney saying different things. And the reality is the utilization in the broader MA population has more volatility. Our patients while have many comorbid conditions, they're more predictable, so we have less volatility. In addition, as you know, broader MA had some coding changes that didn't apply to our population. And so that, again, removes some of the volatility that they're experiencing. And so our trends are a lot more stable in our population. Does that answer your question?"", 'Kevin Mark Fischbeck', ""Yes. No, it does. I guess you're basically saying that it's coming in line, not -- it's not higher or lower than what you were predicting so far in Q1."", 'Javier J. Rodriguez', 'Correct.', 'Kevin Mark Fischbeck', 'Okay. And then maybe just last question. International business acquisition, it sounds like you guys are really excited about it. We always just kind of wondered that sometimes like when one large-scale player exits an asset and another large-scale player comes in? Like how do you think about what you can add to those assets? Or how do you just think about what the opportunity was there, if someone else in theory had similar optionality felt like it was time to get out.', 'Javier J. Rodriguez', ""It's a great question, and we're not arrogant enough to say that we're better operators. What we're looking at is that there's some efficiencies to be gained by economies of scale. We were present in these countries, and we had offices that we could leverage. So in essence, the fixed part of the business was levered in a more meaningful way. And so I think that that's how one entity can exit and the other entity, you can see, it is an attractive asset. But as we said in the beginning, we look at our normal filters of clinical differentiation. We wanted to scale and help them with the scale, and we thought we could get to a good attractive risk adjusted return."", 'Operator', 'And our next caller is Justin Lake with Wolfe Research.', 'Dean L. Rosales', 'This is Dean Rosales on for Justin. Any color you can share on wage inflation. What are you assuming for the year? And my second question would be any update on how mistreatment rates are tracking sequentially, yearly. Any trends there?', 'Joel Ackerman', ""Yes. So on wage inflation, we called out at the beginning of the year, we were expecting something around 5%, and it's tracking pretty consistent with what we were expecting. So not a lot to update on that. .In terms of mistreatment rate, it's doing what we had largely expected, which is slowly improving year after year post COVID, not a lot to call out. It's a pretty small magnitude. We think we'll get back to our historical mistreatment rate over a few years. So in any given year, it's not really a significant number."", 'Dean L. Rosales', 'Got it. And last one, what should we expect in terms of center consolidations for the remainder of the year?', 'Javier J. Rodriguez', 'Thanks, Dean. I think the number will be somewhere in the 30 or so closures sort of net, that would be the right number to have on the net build and closures.', 'Operator', 'Gary Taylor with Cowen.', 'Gary Paul Taylor', ""Maybe just to follow up on that last one. That's a [30] net for the next 3 quarters or that's the full year number?"", 'Javier J. Rodriguez', ""That's a full year number."", 'Gary Paul Taylor', ""Got it. I just -- I wanted to ask, first, I'm going to commend you for producing margin growth well in excess of what the Street is able to model. I think there's a third quarter in a row where you've produced 30% to 50% OI growth on 6% to 8% revenue growth. So it's really stunning cost management, productivity, all the things you guys are doing. Once we anniversary that, so maybe there's another quarter there, but when we get into the back half of '24, are there still some good reasons to believe that, that operating leverage can sustain at something above your long-term 3% to 7% OI guidance, like what would be a couple of key swing factors to be optimistic about some level of operating margin leverage continuing?"", 'Joel Ackerman', ""Yes. So first, thank you, Gary, for those kind words. As we look forward, I don't think we're changing our long-term OI growth number from 3% to 7%. So I'd start with that. That said, I also don't think we're running out of opportunities to continue to run the business well and deliver high-quality clinical care to our patients and continue to improve our bottom line and potentially our margins. we've done this not just on the back of cost cutting, I would highlight, right? We've done a lot on the revenue side that has kicked in nicely. But I think there are other opportunities as well. Continued progress on IKC would be on the list. I think capacity utilization improvements would be another important one that I point to. I think there are other components of our cost structure, which could be productivity, could be other things nonlabor-related that we can continue to manage. So I don't feel like we're running out of ideas. That said, we're also not ready to raise our long-term OI guidance above 3% to 7%."", 'Gary Paul Taylor', ""Maybe last one for me. I just want to maybe understand tender [consolidations] a little bit. When we look at average patients per center, certainly multi-multiyear high. And just in the last couple of years, I think, patients per center is up 9% in a couple of years and your margins improved, I think, nearly 300 basis points as that's happened. Some of that's the consolidation. Some of that is expansion of your home programs driving that. Is this still a key lever going forward or beyond the 30 centers Javier talked about."", 'Javier J. Rodriguez', ""Well, I think the -- let me clarify because a couple of those numbers didn't resonate, but maybe we can clarify them here. I think the better way to think about it is how are we doing in utilization of our centers and preclosing of these centers pre the excess mortality, we were in the mid-60s of utilization. And right now, we're at [58-ish] percent utilization. And so we have more capacity available, and therefore, we're less likely to have a need to deploy capital to build centers. And while our home has improved, it hasn't improved that much. Our mix continues to be around 15% of our patients at home. And so hopefully, that clarifies a couple of those points there."", 'Joel Ackerman', ""Yes. And Gary, just to add one thing on to what Javier said, we can improve capacity utilization without closing any more centers. We're just absorbing treatment growth in our existing footprints."", 'Gary Paul Taylor', 'Adding shifts, adding machines.', 'Joel Ackerman', 'Right.', 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our next caller is A.J. Rice with UBS.', 'Albert J. William Rice', ""Thanks, everybody. First, maybe just to ask on the trajectory on IKC, I know you were forecasting for '24 a loss of about $50 million. And I think in the first quarter, you're at $26 million. I know there's seasonal factors and a variety of things going on. But I just wonder if you would say you're on track? Are you running a little better? Or how should we put that in perspective?"", 'Joel Ackerman', ""Yes. I would say we're largely on track. There's a lot of seasonality in this business. And obviously, you learn more as the year progresses, but there was nothing surprising to us in the Q1 results."", 'Albert J. William Rice', ""Okay. And then another coming off the fourth quarter, I think we had triangulated -- I don't think it's your specific guidance but triangulate it that you're sort of expecting share repurchases to be in the $1 billion to $1.5 billion range for '24. With your comments about how the first quarter played out, do you think you'll still get to something that maybe approximates that? Or should we just assume that the first quarter share repurchase activity has gone and you'll continue in the last 3 at the previous rate."", 'Javier J. Rodriguez', ""I think we still aspire to that goal. There's obviously a timing component to it, and we'll watch it, but we're still aspiring to get it all done."", 'Albert J. William Rice', ""Okay. And just lastly, a follow-on question and comments about the international acquisition. I guess, it sounds like that is, in your mind, more of an opportunistic deal that came along that allows you, like you said, to leverage in certain markets and enter some new ones. Is there anything that's happening on the international front that makes you think that the pace of activity there could step up?"", 'Javier J. Rodriguez', ""No. I think you've got it in the right light, which is we are opportunistic, and we're always looking for a transaction that meets the criteria that we've outlined. And if we don't find it, we don't execute. And if we find it, we do. And so there's no urgency or rush but rather just doing business with discipline and according to our plan."", 'Operator', 'Our next caller is Lisa Clive with Bernstein.', 'Elisabeth Decou Bedell Clive', ""A few questions for me. On the utilization figures that you mentioned, that's just looking at your in-center population, right? I'm just trying to think about how to layer in whole patients on top of that, assuming that population continues to grow faster than your in-center patients, whether essentially that improves the number of patients per clinic, but then in terms of utilization, you just think of the in-center.And then second question, could you tell us what percentage of your patients are on MIRCERA today? Just trying to understand how much more costs you could potentially squeeze out from that transition. And then lastly, do you have any preliminary thoughts, comments on online hemodiafiltration. I assume in your European centers, you use that technology. It obviously remains to be seen how quickly FMC can launch those machines and ramp up scale to be able to sell them in the U.S., but just would love your thoughts on that."", 'Javier J. Rodriguez', ""Sure. Let me take them in order. And if I miss anything, please remind me. On utilization, that number is the chronic center utilization, and the way to think about a home is, of course, it can add patients much easier and with much lower capital deployment. And so you got it right that utilization that we gave is in-center. As it relates to MIRCERA, that's pretty much the vast majority if not all are now on MIRCERA. And so that's played out. And then on hemodiafiltration, I think it will be interesting to see how that plays out in the United States because it's -- as you know, it's allowed in many different countries. And the numbers that we have are really all over the place, meaning in some countries, the vast majority of patients get it. While in others, it's a tiny percentage of the patients that get it. And so while there is 1 or 2 studies that say that it could be better because it gets the mid molecules through. There's a lot of holes that you can poke in those studies and so we'll have to see how that plays out. And then, of course, the FDA approved the machine, but we don't have any reimbursement guidance. So at the end of it, you'll have to incorporate, a, what the doctor wants, what the patient wants because it might take more time to do that treatment and then put the economic model on top of that. So we've got too many variables there that are still to be defined to be able to size it in a helpful way."", 'Operator', ""And at this time, I'm showing no further questions. Speakers, I'll turn the call back over to you for any closing comments."", 'Javier J. Rodriguez', ""Okay. Well, thank you, Michelle, and thank you all for your questions and interest in DaVita. As we discussed on the call, we're off to a strong start of the year. And of course, we'll continue to work hard to stay on this trajectory. First and foremost, we remain vigilant in providing great clinical care for our patients. Thank you all for joining the call, and be well."", 'Operator', ""And thank you.

Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether LyondellBasell Industries' current trading price of US$99.12 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at LyondellBasell Industries’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change."", ' Check out our latest analysis for LyondellBasell Industries ', ""Good news, investors! LyondellBasell Industries is still a bargain right now. According to our valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $143.64, but it is currently trading at US$99.12 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. Although, there may be another chance to buy again in the future. This is because LyondellBasell Industries’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company's shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity."", ""Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares.

It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation."", 'Are you a shareholder? Since LYB is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock. With a positive outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price.

And with that, I'll turn the call over to Tom."", 'Thomas Hill: Thank you, Mark, and thank all of you for joining our Vulcan Materials earnings call this morning. Our first quarter results moved us towards delivering on a fourth consecutive year of double-digit adjusted EBITDA growth. Although the weather was unusually cold and wet across many geographies for much of the quarter, our teams executed well and improved our Aggregates cash gross profit per ton by 10%. Their commitment to our Vulcan Way of Selling and Vulcan Way of Operating Disciplines is driving solid results. In the quarter, we generated $323 million of adjusted EBITDA and expanded our adjusted EBITDA margin. Importantly, several key trends continue: pricing momentum, cost deceleration, unit profitability expansion, robust cash generation, disciplined capital allocation and return on invested capital improvement.', 'In the Aggregates segment, year-over-year shipments declined by 7%, but the durability of our Aggregates business and the consistency of our execution stood out in a weather impacted quarter. We again improved our trailing 12 months Aggregates cash gross profit per ton, pushing it to $9.66 per ton and making further progress toward our current $11 to $12 target. The pricing environment remains positive and year-over-year Aggregates cash cost of sales continues to moderate. Aggregates freight and adjusted price improved 10% in the quarter and increased $1.25 per ton sequentially from the fourth quarter, a clear illustration of the success of January increases and the continuous execution of our Vulcan Way of Selling disciplines. Our first quarter cash cost of sales performance resulted in a fourth consecutive quarter of trailing 12 months cost deceleration and improving sequentially by another 230 basis points.', ""Our relentless focus on improving efficiencies in our plants through our Vulcan Way of Operating Disciplines remains a key driver of managing costs, expanding unit profitability and ultimately generating attractive free cash flow. There is a healthy pipeline of opportunities to deploy this free cash flow for both attractive acquisitions and complementary strategic greenfield development. These targeted opportunities are at varying stages. But as an example, earlier this week, we closed on a bolt-on Aggregates and Asphalt acquisition in Alabama, a top 10 state. I'm proud of how our teams continue to execute our two-pronged growth strategy. They are focused on expanding our reach in addition to enhancing our core with consistent expansion of unit profitability by controlling what we can control, even in a dynamic macro environment and demand environment."", 'On the demand side, I want to provide a few comments about each end use, starting with private demand and then moving to public. Momentum in single-family continues to accelerate across our footprint and points to growth in 2024. However, we continue to expect weaker multifamily residential construction to largely offset the single-family approval this year. Overall, affordability and elevated interest rates remains a challenge, but the underlying fundamentals of population growth and low inventories in Vulcan markets support recovery in residential construction. An improving residential backdrop is also a positive sign for future activity in certain categories of non-residential construction. And recent data has shown some signs of stabilization in overall starts.', 'However, the landscape continues to vary across categories. As expected, continued moderation in warehouse starts will be the biggest headwind to private and non-residential demand this year. Currently, light commercial activity remains weak, but over time, we expected to follow the positive trends in single-family housing. We continue to see and capitalize on opportunities in the manufacturing category. Our unmatched Southeastern footprint and unique logistics capabilities positions us well to service these large aggregate intensive projects. Our footprint is also an advantage on the public side with over two-thirds of federal highway spending allocated to Vulcan states. Additionally, other public infrastructure activity, which benefits from IIJA funding is growing faster in Vulcan states than the country as a whole.', ""A sustained elevated level of highway starts of over $100 billion, coupled with record 2024 state budgets, supports healthy growth in highway and infrastructure demand both in 2024 and for the next several years. Now I'll turn the call over to Mary Andrews for some additional commentary on our first quarter. Mary Andrews?"", ""Mary Andrews Carlisle: Thanks, Tom, and good morning. Tom discussed our solid Aggregates results in the quarter and shared some important ongoing trends. In addition to providing a few more details about our first quarter results, I'd like to first expound upon four of the trends Tom highlighted earlier in his remarks, unit profitability expansion, robust cash generation, disciplined capital allocation and return on invested capital improvement. For the last four quarters, we have consistently expanded our trailing 12-month unit profitability in all three of our operating segments. Increasing cash unit profitability by nearly $1.50 per ton in Aggregates, almost $6 per ton in Asphalt and nearly $5 per cubic yard in Concrete. Our trailing 12 months gross margin has also steadily improved in each product line."", 'This organic growth is underpinned by our daily focus on execution and driving results through our Vulcan Way of Selling and Vulcan Way of Operating Disciplines. Better unit profitability yields better free cash flow. Our free cash flow conversion over the last five years has averaged over 90%, enabling us to strategically allocate capital to reinvest in our franchise, grow our business and return cash to shareholders. During the quarter, we invested $103 million in capital expenditures and returned $81 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We continue to expect to spend between $625 million and $675 million on capital expenditures for the full-year. Our current balance sheet positions us well to continue to deploy capital to each of our priorities.', ""At the end of the first quarter, our net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage was 1.5x, with $300 million of cash on hand, following the March 1 redemption of our 2026 senior notes at par for $550 million. Our liquidity position and financial flexibility are competitive strengths as we look to continue to grow and create value for our shareholders. Over the last 12 months, we've achieved a 260 basis points improvement in return on invested capital. Invested capital has increased less than 1%, while adjusted EBITDA has improved 20%. Adjusted EBITDA margin has also improved by 350 basis points through consistent operational execution and disciplined SAG cost management. SAG expenses in the quarter were in line with our expectations, and we continue to expect to spend between $550 million and $560 million for the full-year."", ""Most importantly, we reaffirm our expectations of delivering adjusted EBITDA between $2.15 billion and $2.3 billion for the full-year. At the mid-point, a double-digit year-over-year improvement for a fourth consecutive year. I'll now turn the call back over to Tom to provide a few closing remarks."", 'Thomas Hill: Thank you, Mary Andrews. At Vulcan, our number one priority will always be our people, keeping them safe and fostering our Vulcan culture. They are the foundation of our great company. As a team, we are focused on the daily execution of our Vulcan Way of Selling and Vulcan Way of Operating Disciplines to ensure attractive cash generation in any macro backdrop. We will be strategic and disciplined in allocating capital to continue to grow our business and deliver value for our shareholders. And now, Mary Andrews, now will be happy to take your questions.', 'See also', '30 Most Miserable Countries in the World and', '10 Best Languages to Learn for the Future.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

Possible interest rate cuts in 2024 are expected to make way for rebounding merger and acquisition (M&A) deals. Though technology investments are made to boost operational efficiencies, they often escalate costs and erode margins for these players. A shortage in the availability of medical personnel across the United States continues to be a concern. Despite the challenges, companies like UnitedHealth Group Incorporated UNH, The Cigna Group CI, Centene Corporation CNC and Humana Inc. HUM\xa0appear well-placed to counter industry headwinds.', 'About the Industry ', 'The Zacks HMO industry consists of entities (either private or public) that take care of subscribers’ basic and supplemental health services. Companies in this space primarily assume risks and assign premiums to health and medical insurance policies. Industry participants also provide administrative and managed-care services for self-funded insurance. Services are generally offered by a network of approved care providers (called in-network), which include primary care physicians, clinical facilities, hospitals and specialists. However, out-of-network exceptions are made during emergencies or when it is necessary. Health insurance plans can be availed through private purchases, social insurance or social welfare programs.', '4 Trends Shaping the Fate of the HMO Industry ', 'Elevated Technology Expenses: Telehealth services were prevalent in the United States prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, but their usage was not as widespread as it has been since the onset of the pandemic. The convenience and affordability of these services send a clear indication of the same continuing to stay in high demand in the days ahead. To stay up-to-date with the ongoing digital trend, the HMO players are compelled to undertake technology investments to build telehealth platforms. The platforms undoubtedly attract more customers and fetch a steady revenue stream for industry players. However, the technology advancements undertaken in relation to such platforms require significant expenses. This may erode the margins of health insurers.', 'A Scarcity of Medical Staff: A shortage of nurses and other medical personnel continues to be a nationwide concern, which is taking a toll on the efficient functioning of hospitals as they have to treat a growing number of patient volumes. An increase in the number of nurses reaching retirement age, a higher burnout level and inequitable workforce distribution are some of the factors triggering a scarcity in the nursing workforce. Health insurers collaborate with hospitals, physicians and other facilities to offer discounted care access to plan members. The effectiveness of services remains a crucial factor behind the renewal of a health insurer’s health plan. A shortage in the nursing workforce can reduce a hospital’s ability to deliver quality care services and indirectly affect the customer base of HMO companies.', 'Rising Membership: Most of the participants in the HMO space distribute cost-effective health plans and upgrade them with some eye-catching features from time to time. The strength of such plans continues to fetch federal or state contract wins for HMO players, which serves as a means to boost membership growth. A steady membership growth brings continual improvement of premiums, the most significant top-line contributor of a health insurer. Given an aging U.S. population, the solid demand for Medicare plans (meant for 65 years and above) distributed by health insurers is expected to remain on an uptick in the days ahead. However, persistent inflationary headwinds can exert strain on uninterrupted healthcare premium payments by customers.', 'Active M&A Moves: Apart from technology investments, an M&A strategy is often pursued by the industry players to advance their capabilities, enter new regions, delve deeper into existing ones, grow their customer base and solidify their nationwide presence. These initiatives also aim to bring diversification benefits, which are in dire need to sustain one’s competitive edge. As the Fed points to interest rate cuts in 2024, borrowing costs are expected to witness a decline, thereby making it easier for industry participants to opt for loans to enter M&A deals and avoid complete exhaustion of cash reserves. After facing a roadblock in 2023, M&A activities are expected to rebound in 2024, per Morgan Stanley Investment Banking.', 'Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bearish Outlook', 'The group’s\xa0 Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all member stocks, indicates tepid near-term prospects.

We had another really solid quarter, in line with our expectations and driven by a continuation of very healthy leasing fundamentals. Robust tenant demand is driving significant leasing activity across all of our shopping centers, and this is evident in an even higher percent leased rate and strong rent growth. With this robust demand and activity, we are poised to accelerate growth into 2025. As you will hear more from Alan, we are having great success quickly re-leasing space. And I will [note], some of which we've intentionally recaptured with upgraded merchandising of leading operators and at higher rents. As a result, our pipeline of executed leases is larger than it's ever been, and we look forward to these tenants coming online propelling our future growth. I'm also really excited about the progress our team has made, executing on our value creation pipeline. Sustained development activity over the long term, which creates value and enhances growth is an important part of our business and is a differentiator for Regency in our sector today. The strength of our platform provides us an unequaled strategic advantage. Our talented and experienced national development team, our relationships with top grocers and retailers, and ready access to capital, all are enabling strong execution on an impressive lineup of great in-process projects and continued growth in our pipeline of opportunities. As you'll hear from Nick, following our impressive execution in 2023 with over $250 million of development and redevelopment starts, we expect to drive a similar level of success this year. The benefits from this ramp-up in activity will continue to grow as NOI comes online in 2025 and beyond. Importantly, the strength of our balance sheet and our liquidity position is what provides Regency with the ability to sustain a meaningful value creation pipeline through cycles to remain opportunistic in our capital allocation strategy and to consistently grow our dividend. And we are really gratified to see this position of strength acknowledged by Moody's with a credit rating upgrade to A3, which occurred in February. We are currently the only REIT in the open-air shopping center sector with an A rating, and we are already seeing the benefits in our relative bond market pricing, further supporting our cost of capital advantage. This is a big accomplishment and a direct result of our team's consistent track record of operational excellence and balance sheet strength over the long term. It's a reflection of what I speak to often, which is what we believe to be Regency's unique and unparalleled combination of strategic advantages that differentiates us from our peers and allows us to drive above-average earnings per share, dividend and free cash flow growth. It's the favorable attributes of our portfolio, including quality tenants and merchandising mix, format, and trade area demographics driving rent growth and durability of occupancy. It's the expertise of our people and the strength of our operating platform. It's our ability to create value through development and redevelopment consistently over time. It's the strength of our balance sheet, and it's our commitment to corporate responsibility and stakeholder stewardship. High-quality suburban shopping centers, especially with the particular strength of our portfolio and the trade areas in which we operate will continue to benefit from structural tailwinds that support continued excellent performance and long-term growth of our business. Alan?"", 'Alan Todd Roth', ""Thank you, Lisa, and good morning, everyone. We had another great quarter of leasing activity in Q1 as tenant demand for our centers remained very strong. The tremendous appetite for space that we saw in 2023 has continued unabated, enabling our team to achieve both higher rents and push our leased rate to even higher levels. We are executing leases with high-quality tenants, further improving upon the strength of our merchandising and creating value at our centers. Our same-property percent leased rate increased by another 20 basis points this quarter to 95.8%. This is especially impressive given the significant anchor move-outs that I discussed on last quarter's call, which I'll come back to in a moment, coupled with the seasonality of higher move-outs we historically experienced in the first quarter. Our shop lease rate was up 10 basis points sequentially in the first quarter reaching yet another new record high for shop of 93.5%. Base rent growth in 2024 is benefiting from shop commencement activity given our record year of lease-up in 2023. You'll recall that a quarter ago, we discussed an expected decline in our commenced occupancy rate in the first quarter, driven by anchor move-outs consistent with our plan, while our leased rate has moved even higher, our same property commenced rate ended the first quarter down 70 basis points from year-end. Roughly half of this decline was attributable to the intentional recapture of a Walmart store in Norwalk, Connecticut. Some of you were with us on a recent tour of the property, seeing firsthand this great opportunity to create value from an anchor tenant lease expiration in an exceptional location. We will experience some downtime impact while the space is built out and the center undergoes a transformative redevelopment, but the new lease of Target has already been executed with significant accretion. This is just one example of similar scenarios within the portfolio. On the surface, this disconnect between leased occupancy and rent paying occupancy would appear counterintuitive, but the strength in the leasing environment, coupled with our deliberate approach to asset management, is enabling us to take advantage of these accretive opportunities quickly and in many cases, before the tenant vacates. We are remerchandising with upgraded stores and at higher rents, improving and growing the long-term value of our centers, and we look forward to getting these new anchors open for business in the coming months. As we've replenished this vacating space with new leases, our pipeline of executed leases has grown. We stand today with a 370 basis point delta between our same property leased and commenced occupancy rates, which is an all-time high for us, reflecting an incremental $50 million of annual base rent that will be very rewarding as these leases commence within our operating portfolio. Beyond what's already based, we have another 1.4 million square feet of space under letter of intent or in negotiation with consistent demand across the portfolio from a wide variety of categories, including grocers, restaurants, health and wellness, off-price and personal services. Cash re-leasing spreads in the first quarter were more than 8% on a blended basis including the highest spread for renewals that we've seen since 2019, an indication of our ability to increase rents further as occupancy rises and available spaces limited, a reflection of the strong demand in today's environment. Both GAAP and net effective rent spreads were in the mid-teens this quarter, given strength contractual rent steps in the majority of our leases and our prudent use of leasing capital. Our team across the country is energized by the unwavering strength and leasing activity we are seeing, supported by a limited supply of high-quality retail space available and a surplus of great retailers actively looking to expand. We look forward to harvesting the benefits of our record high SNO pipeline, getting those tenants open and operating and continuing to move the occupancy needle higher in the months ahead. Nick?"", 'Nicholas Andrew Wibbenmeyer', ""Thank you, Alan. Good morning, everyone. Motivated by our tremendous success in 2023, including the start of more than $250 million of new projects, our team remains very active, both executing and growing our development and redevelopment pipelines. Among our first quarter starts was the shops at Stone Bridge in Cheshire, Connecticut. This $67 million ground-up development will be anchored by Whole Foods as well as T.J. Maxx and while we just broke ground last month, we are already seeing significant leasing demand. The project serves as the retail component of a new master plan community, a format with which we've had great success over the years. We recognize the mutual benefits and value that these relationships with master plan developers can provide for our shopping centers as well as the communities they serve. In addition to new starts, we continue to make great progress executing on our in-process pipeline and bringing NOI online. In total, we now have more than $0.5 billion in process, which is nearly 90% leased with blended returns of 9%. And in 2024, we plan to complete over $200 million of these projects. Some examples of the tremendous progress are several exciting recent anchor openings that are worthy of highlighting. At our Glenwood Green ground-up development in Old Bridge, New Jersey, both Target and ShopRite celebrated successful grand openings last month and the project is now nearly 95% leased. Exciting shop tenants opening soon include Honeygrow, Duck Donuts and Playa Bowls.At Westbard Square and Bethesda, the new giant grocery store opened in January, and rent will start commencing from the shop space over the coming months, including tenants such as Tate, Stretch zone, Silver and Sons BBQ and Oak Barrel & Vine. Turning to the private transactions market. Although data points and deal volumes remain below historical norms, we are seeing increased activity in deeper bidding pools in the marketplace and cap rates remain low. The implications of the recent move in treasuries remains to be seen, but our team is actively underwriting acquisition opportunities that fit within our portfolio quality, growth and earnings accretion requirements. This includes a great asset that we are buying in Westport, Connecticut, immediately adjacent to one of our existing centers, adding to our already strong portfolio in that region. As we look ahead, our team is focused on sourcing accretive investment opportunities across our national platform. We expect to execute on acquisitions opportunistically, and we have great visibility on development and redevelopment activity as we continue to grow our pipelines. We are planning for another year of project starts north of $200 million and remain on track to meet our strategic objective of completing more than $1 billion of projects over the next 5 years. We are partnering with leading grocers looking to grow their footprints in high-quality centers within our attractive trade areas and our recent project successes are also driving additional opportunities to further grow our pipeline. The strong momentum within our program is supported by macro tailwinds within the shopping center business, but more importantly, by Regency sourcing and execution capabilities. As you hear me repeatedly say, we have the best development team in the business, which combined with our free cash flow and balance sheet give us an unequaled ability to fund and drive significant value creation within our investment program. Mike?"", 'Michael J. Mas', ""Thank you, Nick, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with some highlights from our first quarter results and then walk through updates to our 2024 guidance and forward expectations before ending with comments on our balance sheet position. We reported Nareit FFO of $1.08 per share and core operating earnings of $1.04 per share for the first quarter. Same-property NOI growth, excluding term fees and COVID period reserve collections was 2.1%. It's worth a reminder that while bad debt this quarter trended closer to our historical averages, we are comping against a year ago bad debt number that was net positive, which we know is unusual. This anomaly impacted our first quarter growth rate by 60 basis points. At 2.7%, base rent was the largest contributor to same-property NOI growth and continues to be the best indicator of portfolio performance. This was largely driven by our team driving rec growth through embedded rent steps and re-leasing spreads as well as executing on our redevelopment pipeline. Our same-property leased occupancy rate is 95.8%, up another 20 basis points in the quarter, reflecting the continued strong leasing environment. First quarter earnings results benefited from a $0.01 of timing-related items outside of the same property pool as well as $0.01 of straight-line rent, which you can see in our increased full year noncash guidance. Additionally, recall that we typically recognize more than half of our annual percentage rents in the first quarter, benefiting Q1 by about $0.03 compared to the implied run rate for the balance of the year. I also would like to point out our new AFFO disclosure on Page 9 of our supplemental, which highlights what in our view, is one of the most important performance metrics, reflecting a REIT's ability to grow dividends and to invest back into its business in order to grow earnings. This added disclosure also provides transparency around the level of capital used to drive same-property NOI growth and allows for greater apples-to-apples comparison across the peer group. Turning to our guidance updates. As always, I'll refer you to the helpful detail on Slides 5 through 6 in our earnings presentation. We raised our Nareit FFO outlook by $0.01 at the midpoint, which corresponds to the increase in our guidance for noncash items. Our guidance for same-property NOI growth remains unchanged at 2% to 2.5%, excluding term fees and COVID period reserve collections. We also adjusted our full year transactions outlook. As Nick referenced earlier, the asset we are buying in Westport is now included in our acquisition guidance, and we modestly increased our dispositions guidance to include the potential sale of a few smaller noncore lower growth assets. Notably, our core operating earnings per share guidance, excluding COVID period reserve collections, implies growth of more than 3% at the midpoint despite higher interest rates and the impact of our debt refinancing this year. As we look beyond the calendar year, we wanted to highlight some tailwinds we see impacting our growth, especially as it relates to items where we have greater visibility. We've discussed the meaningful growth coming from our pipeline of executed leases where outsized commencement activity will begin as we approach year-end and move into 2025. As Alan mentioned, our SNO pipeline sits at a historical high of more than $50 million of annual base rent, of which about 65% is scheduled to commence by the end of this year. In fact, we expect our spot commenced occupancy rate to end this year, roughly 50 basis points higher as compared to year-end 2023. As these lease commencements are weighted to the second half of the year, the NOI and earnings impact will largely occur in 2025. And as Nick discussed, we've continued to ramp-up our in-process development and redevelopment activity and look forward to completing these projects delivering space and commencing rent. We expect same-property NOI to benefit from this redevelopment activity and for growth to accelerate into 2025. The positive contribution to same-property NOI is likely to exceed 100 basis points next year, leading to above-trend overall growth, and total NOI growth will also benefit from the continued momentum of our ground-up development program, which will also start to bear more fruit as we head into next year.   Finally, turning to our balance sheet. The recent credit rating upgrade from Moody's to A3 further validates Regency's balance sheet strategy and liquidity position. we are relatively insulated from the current volatility in the debt capital markets as our balance sheet is in phenomenal shape. The majority of this year's maturities have been prefunded following our bond issuance in January, which we are gratified to price at a 10-year treasury yield meaningfully below where it sits today. And our next unsecured bond maturity is not until November 2025. Nearly all of our debt is fixed. Our weighted average maturity is close to 7 years, and we remain near the low end of our targeted leverage range of 5 to 5.5x net debt preferred to EBITDA. We have approximately $1.7 billion of liquidity today including nearly full capacity on our revolver, and we remain on track to generate free cash flow of more than $160 million this year. With that, we are happy to take your questions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Comes from the line of Jeff Spector with Bank of America.', 'Elizabeth Yang Doykan', '(technical difficulty)', 'Lisa Palmer', ""We cannot hear the question. I don't know if it's us or if it's."", 'Jeffrey Alan Spector', 'Hello, can you hear me now?', 'Lisa Palmer', ""Lizzy, you're breaking up a bit."", 'Elizabeth Yang Doykan', ""So I was asking (technical difficulty) if any of the benefit to same-store flowed through in the first quarter? Just seeing if maybe you [saw] any upside (inaudible) or additional sources of accretion might have exceeded your expectations as we're through the early part of the year."", 'Michael J. Mas', ""I think, Lizzy, you're still breaking up a little bit in the early parts, but I think I understand the gist of your question. Maybe cadence on earnings given the beat in the first quarter versus the run rate for the balance of the year. I think that's what I heard you ask. Let me just kind of go back to some of the comments I made in the remarks and maybe color some of that up a little bit for you. Let me start by saying at a very high level, we thought we delivered a really solid quarter. We were very happy with our performance. We met our plan. Our confidence in our outlook was simply confirmed as you can see through our limited guidance changes. There was some timing in the first quarter that I -- as I outlined in the remarks that do impact our forward run rate, right? So percentage rent is the biggest one. That is a seasonal issue. It's 50% or more of that rent is collected in the first quarter. That does lead to about a $0.03 kind of deceleration from an earnings impact perspective going forward on a run rate. And then there were some timing a little timing issues coming out of the non-same property portfolio, which as, again, as a reminder, is a little larger than it customarily is because we have our entire Urstadt Biddle merged portfolio designated as non-same for 2024. But what -- but those timing issues didn't change our outlook for the year, right? So those aren't going to flow through in any kind of additive way. So at this point, we continue to have a lot of confidence in the guide that we shared last quarter. We did raise Nareit FFO by $0.01. That is incremental to the plan that's coming from noncash revenue and specifically straight-line rents coming out of -- improved straight-line rents coming out of the development pipeline. We also had a mark-to-market adjustment following a mortgage paydown that we executed on this quarter. So those -- that led to the $2 million that we increased our noncash guidance and that's what you're seeing flow through from [an] AFFO perspective. Let me just end with this. From a same-property growth, we didn't modify the range. We have a lot of conviction in that range. We -- the fallout in percent commenced that we anticipated and communicated last quarter happened as we planned. And the best part of that is we've re-leased as much space as we've gotten back and then some, done a remarkable job there. And our outlook for the balance of the year and commencing that rent going into end of '24 and into '25, we feel really good about."", 'Elizabeth Yang Doykan', ""That's helpful. And I apologize for the connection issue. Just as a follow-up, I know you all said that you're viewing external growth opportunities opportunistically, and there's a lot to go on the development, redevelopment front. But just curious on maybe what kind of opportunities would look most -- the most interesting to you today, maybe what you're seeing out in the market. More color on that would be helpful."", 'Lisa Palmer', ""I'll take that and allow Nick to come over top of me if he wants to add a little more detail. Really unchanged, our investment strategy, whether it's for acquisitions, which we've had recent success with or whether it's for development, is aligning with our operating portfolio. So above-average quality with regards to merchandising mix, the tenants and to the extent that we can add our expertise to make that happen, we're looking for those opportunities as well. Grocery anchored primarily and also in great trade areas with above-average demographics. We've had success from both the acquisition and the development strategy and doing that and remaining disciplined. And we continue to find opportunities. I really want to reiterate because I know that we continue to get questions about our development pipeline. Remember, we're generating ample free cash flow and the best use of that free cash flow is into our developments and redevelopments, and we have had a really impressive track record in that, especially of late 2023 was an exceptional year. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we expect that to continue into 2024. And I'm not saying that it's easy, but when you take what we have, which is a talented, experienced development team across the country, when you have access to capital with the strength of our balance sheet, and when you have the relationships that we have with top grocers, top retailers, master plan community developers, it's equaling success, and we're really proud of that."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Michael Goldsmith with UBS.', 'Michael Goldsmith', 'Same-property NOI growth of 2.1% in the quarter. Mike, you called out a tough bad debt comparison of 60 basis points with base rent contribution at 2.7%. So looking forward, can you remind us of maybe any other moving pieces in the comparisons that if we should use that 2.7%, the high 2% range is the rate, base rent growth is the forward trajectory? And did you say that next year should be about 100 basis points above trend?', 'Michael J. Mas', ""Thanks, Michael. As I -- as we look into the balance '24, 2% to 2.5% guide range. We still have a lot of confidence in that expectation. It's going to hover around, it's going to hover within that range quarter-over-quarter and really pretty consistent, I would say, as we look through the balance, and I appreciate you highlighting the fact that Q1 did have a unique anomaly in the prior year basis. I did say plus 100, let's make sure we understand what that means. That's the positive contribution coming from redevelopment deliveries to our same property growth rate. We are really excited about the -- and have growing conviction in that pipeline and that delivery of projects. And you can see it on our redevelopment disclosure page, by the way, and get really comfortable yourself with thinking about when that income will be delivered. Remember, and we spent a lot of time kind of talking about our steady-state growth rate generally, redevelopments are going to provide about a plus or minus 50 basis point positive contribution to our growth plus 100 basis points in our outlook for 2025 is materially better than that. And again, I would just come back to the conviction we have over that, given the projects that we see, the leasing that the team has executed on and really, it's just a matter of executing on deliveries and commencing those rents, which you'll start to see happen in [Urstadt] towards the end of this year and into 2025."", 'Lisa Palmer', ""I'll just add, and I promise, Mike, I won't give guidance for 2025. But what I would like to add, Michael, if you just go back and you look at long-term growth rates, same property NOI growth, AFFO growth rate, I picked 5 years, you will see that Regency is at the top of the sector with that. And that is the result of our strategy. It's all of the things, right? It's our unequaled strategic advantages that I talked about in my prepared remarks. And with that, given 2024 is a temporary dip from those long-term expectations, we would expect 2025 would kind of make up for that. And that -- with the growth of 2025 that we expect all else being equal with regards to the economy, we would still -- we will rise to the top of the sector."", 'Michael Goldsmith', ""And my follow-up is on the SNO pipeline. It took a step up here now currently sitting at 370 basis points or $50 million with the SNO pipeline. What's the elevated -- what's the trajectory from here? Should we expect that to be worked down through '24 and '25 or should it kind of still remain elevated and choppy. Just trying to understand better around how you -- how quickly you can monetize this elevated pipeline."", 'Michael J. Mas', ""Listen, I hope for the right reasons, I hope it grows, and I'm looking at Alan when I say that and he'd say the same thing. I think we have a lot of conviction in our leasing team's ability. We know our properties and how well they are desired by the (inaudible) and we have a lot of conviction in continuing to lease at a high rate. So I wouldn't be honestly, I'd like to see that number increase. But from an economic impact perspective, our commenced -- it's about our commenced occupancy rate is the essence of your question. And we do think as we look at our plans, we do think that we've troughed on a spot basis from a commenced perspective. All planned, we knew these move-outs were going to occur in the first quarter of this year. And now it's about moving and delivering space, moving that commence rate up. Let me give you something to help you with your question. A little bit over $50 million of SNO pipeline from an ABR perspective, 65% of those leases will commence by year-end, but that's not rent, right? So $14 million, plus or minus, I'm going to be in the area. We should recognize in the earnings in '24. So that's only 1/4 of that pipeline. So that tells you that, that adds to that conviction we have in 2025, the balance of that ABR is going to come online as we deliver units into 2025."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets.', 'Juan Carlos Sanabria', ""Just curious on the decisions, in some cases, to be proactive and trying to increase the -- or improve their merchandise mix and increase rents and if that -- how are you making that decision? And it seems like that's obviously a product of a stronger market here. Could you do more of that in '25 that could temporarily offset growth? Just trying to play devil's advocate here."", 'Alan Todd Roth', ""Juan, this is Alan. Thank you for the question. We've always taken the long-term view of intense asset management. And so to answer your question, we're absolutely all about what is the right long-term decision for the asset, for the portfolio and for the future success of Regency. It's interesting. I said last quarter that we moved 3 office supply stores out of our portfolio. I'm not so sure that I actually identified who's replacing them. But to take those units and replace those with Sprouts in one location, HomeSense in another location, and a Baptist Health medical facility in a third location. I think it's just really good examples of how we look at enhancing the merchandising, providing durability to our occupancy through better tenant credit and to your point, getting significant rent growth. So it's certainly the mindset of how we're trained. It's certainly the mindset of how we think about managing our portfolio, and I would expect that to continue."", 'Juan Carlos Sanabria', ""And then just curious on how Urstadt is performing if that would have been -- if included in the same-store numbers additive and presumably, there's more lease-up opportunities there. Does that maybe then create a tough comp issue next year as that's folded into the same-store pool?"", 'Michael J. Mas', ""Let me take it first, and then I'd like Alan to give some color on what you've seen in the portfolio. But from my perspective, the Urstadt portfolio is performing right on plan. And we had high expectations for the portfolio, and the team is doing a remarkable job of delivering on those expectations. So just to reiterate that, we called for about 1.5 points worth of accretion. We're going to deliver that and that we haven't come off plus or minus that expectation. And there's a little bit of timing noise from a cadence perspective as I indicated in the first quarter, and that will level off by year-end. Is additive or would have been additive, had we called it same property by about the same amount I mentioned last quarter, which we said we're up to about 0.25 point. So I'll leave it at that. And if Alan has a comment."", 'Alan Todd Roth', ""Yes. Juan, the only thing I would add is we continue to be thrilled with the expanded platform, but I am personally probably more thrilled with the great people that have come into the organization as a result of it. And we did have another productive quarter. We signed about 50 transactions in that portfolio. And as I said, the last few quarters, there's runway there. We are going to grow that 93% formerly leased portfolio and leverage the platform, certainly that we have, and that is the hyper focus of the company right now relative to that acquisition. Redevelopments are something that are more medium to long term, but we're doing some small little [pad deals] out in the parking lot, maybe evaluating a couple of multi-tenant deals, but largely, it's a hyper focus on leasing and the team is doing well."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Greg McGinniss with Scotiabank.', 'Viktor Fediv', ""This is Viktor Fediv for Greg McGinniss. So we've noticed that your new leases, tenant allowances and landlord work as a percentage of new base rents have increased both on a quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year basis. Just curious, was it something unique this quarter or it's a current market environment. So you need to provide higher TAs and [landlord] work to get new leases done."", 'Alan Todd Roth', ""Viktor, this is Alan. Thank you for the question. The short answer is we're not seeing any material shift at all, although there is a slight elevation this quarter. I'll start on the renewal front. The elevation you see there is one tenant that we did a turnkey relocation to make way for a larger junior box. If you take that one out, our capitals are absolutely in line with historic levels. And again, I think that ties back to the intense asset management mindset of what's right for the asset.On the new leasing front, I would just tell you, it's largely elevated by anchor leasing. And we had 4 anchor transactions. Notably, one of them was a space that was vacant for over 7 years. And so again, I think there's some mix issue in terms of just anchor transactions that's driving that, but we're not seeing any market shifts as a result."", 'Lisa Palmer', ""I think it's -- yes, it's important to just reiterate that, our strategy and our approach hasn't changed. We're very judicious with our leasing capital and do believe that, that is clearly leads to again, ample free cash flow growth, but also helps drive our AFFO growth, which if you were to look at long-term AFFO growth, we do lead the sector."", 'Viktor Fediv', ""And then as a follow-up, could you please provide some additional color on the remaining $75 million of dispositions. So far, both dispositions in '24 were in Florida. And apart from properties being noncore, was it also driven by just relatively more attractive pricing than transaction market in Florida now, and should we expect other dispositions be within the same submarket or there are no other noncore assets in that submarket."", 'Nicholas Andrew Wibbenmeyer', ""Viktor, this is Nick. I appreciate the question. As you referenced, I mean, you answered part of the question in your question, which is we are always looking to fortify our growth profile. And we're always looking to potentially sell noncore, nonstrategic assets at attractive cap rates. And so as we look into the future, as you see in our guidance now, we do expect to continue to sell assets at attractive cap rates, recycle that capital into more accretive opportunities that we may see. And so it just so happened, these 2 were in Florida, but I would now tell you, strategically, we are trying to exit Florida, as you know, we have a tremendous portfolio in Florida. And so these are really case-by-case decision to asset by asset, trade area by trade area. And so I would not expect these additional assets necessarily be in Florida."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley.', 'Ronald Kamdem', 'Just 2 quick ones. So one on -- just on the acquisition front, obviously, the $46 million added in the guidance. Maybe can you talk about just how that came about? And has sort of opportunities sprung up or change given sort of the move in rates has that sort of slowed activity?', 'Nicholas Andrew Wibbenmeyer', ""Ronald, this is Nick again. I appreciate the question. So let me talk first to the first part of your question, which is about the acquisition we've now guided to. And so that asset, we're very excited about. It's a 76,000 square foot shopping center in Westport, Connecticut at CVS anchored, and for those of you recently on our tour in the Northeast, you'll be familiar with it. The center directly across the street from our Trader Joe's asset that we own at the corner of Compo Road and Post Road. And so just a tremendous opportunity to bring a great asset into a region that we already are really, really familiar with and excited about, again, adding to that great portfolio. And so that asset was fully marketed. And so we competed in on-market process. And I think given our reputation and our presence in the market definitely helped us and related to that competition. And so excited to get that closed here very, very soon, maybe even as soon as today. And so beyond that, we continue to be, again, opportunistic, as Lisa indicated earlier, which is looking across the country for opportunities that we believe we can create and add value to shopping centers. And so there is definitely more opportunities on the market over the last quarter than they were in the quarter before. But as we all know, treasuries have moved here in the last couple of weeks. And so it's TBD of does that slow transaction volume or not. But from the chatter we're hearing, we do expect transaction volume to stay pretty darn steady and we're going to take advantage of any opportunity we see that we think we can add value to."", 'Operator', 'Does that complete your question?', 'Ronald Kamdem', ""Yes. My second question was just on the same-store. Look, I'm getting the theme of the call, which seems to be acceleration in 2025 on the same-store. I guess the question is, is the conviction coming from sort of the fact that you have sort of the [signed-out] lease pipeline and you have visibility or is it more that the sort of the tenant health, there's no sort of larger move-outs or bankruptcies, that could be a headwind next year or both, right? Just trying to figure out where the conviction is coming?"", 'Lisa Palmer', ""I'll answer that just very high level and to the extent that my partners here want to add any more specific color, but it is both. I'm glad that you added that at the end. I mean, I think you can see with our leasing success and results, the health in the portfolio and where -- we can say, some records are meant to be broken and we continue to drive our percent leased higher and higher. And that SNO pipeline is real. And so that does create real visibility to rent that will commence and we also have been really successful with our redevelopment pipeline. And Mike talked about those in the prepared remarks and in one of the questions. And we have real visibility to that also being additive in 2025. So it's all of the above."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho.', 'Ravi Vijay Vaidya', ""This is Ravi Vaidya on the line for Haendel. I hope you guys are doing well. We've heard from you and your peers that the leasing environment is very strong and robust. But I just wanted to ask, particularly around [Med care] and urgent care centers and things along that line. We've started to hear some softness in demand from some of the operators there, notably Walmart. And just wanted to hear your thoughts on what you're seeing from a leasing demand perspective."", 'Alan Todd Roth', ""Ravi, it's Alan. So our current medical exposure is about 7% of ABR, and that has grown from 5% where we were pre-COVID. We are very comfortable not only with where it is, but certainly comfortable if it were to continue to grow. Interestingly, we signed nearly 20 new medical leases in the first quarter, and that was our second highest category for new leasing from a square footage perspective. And it was largely dentists, optometrists, physical therapy, primary care and it included a new ground lease that we also did with the largest primary care operator in Houston, where they're going to build a new medical building where Regency didn't even invest any capital on that. But overall, we're comfortable certainly with that category. From an urgent care, specifically to answer that question, it's just not a significant piece of our medical exposure, it's less than 1% of our ABR. We, interestingly also have all the medical transactions we did in the first quarter, none of our new leasing activity this quarter was in the urgent care facility arena. But I would just take us back to the strict vetting process that we do for all of our operators, whether medical, personal services, restaurants, et cetera. And I think the team does a really nice job to make sure we're aligning with the right operators."", 'Unidentified Analyst', ""Just one more here. Where do you think CapEx goes as a percentage of NOI goes from here for you and I guess, broadly for the sector, as we're seeing occupancies are -- more, more leases are renewals than new ones. How do you think this could impact AFFO growth maybe over the next couple of years and maybe is there -- are we approaching an inflection point, I guess, is the crux of the question?"", 'Michael J. Mas', ""Ravi, it's Mike. Maybe I'll give you a bit of a boring answer, but we don't see any change. I've been pretty -- we've been pretty consistent on this topic for some time. 11% area is kind of our run rate, and that's all CapEx, right? So that's maintenance and leasing capital. And we don't see that changing on balance, on average over the long run. You're going to have periods of time where as you're adding to commenced occupancy as we are now where that could increase over that line -- that average line, again, because of the volume of activity you're doing, but the team does an incredible job of ensuring that we're investing the right amount of money into the operator's business, and we're getting a fair -- market-leading rent in those cases and market-leading terms and they're just very judicious with our capital spend, and I think that's appropriate. Capital is precious. We're going to generate as much free cash flow as we can so that we can reinvest that to Lisa's point back into our development and redevelopment business. And when we have available capital outside of that, by properties, like the great asset we're going to add to the portfolio in Westport. So I don't see that 11% area changing over the long run."", 'Lisa Palmer', ""And I do just -- I want to reiterate because it's an intentional strategy to maximize rent while limiting leasing capital, trying -- staying within our parameters of our expectations and it's the strength of our asset quality and our shopping centers that allows us to do that, and we are successful in doing so. And it is a reason that we -- it does drive our AFFO growth."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman with Citi.', 'Craig Allen Mailman', 'Just want to follow up. I know you guys increased dispositions a little bit here to partly pay for the Westport acquisition. But just from a need of capital, $125 million with the free cash flow you guys throw off. Is this just a placeholder because you think you could get more acquisitions? Or is this necessary to fund the redevelopment? Just trying to get that accelerated pace of dispose just given the spending you guys have.', 'Michael J. Mas', ""Yes, I think this will help you, Craig. We don't need to sell the properties to afford or pay for the Westport acquisition. That is -- we have the free cash flow in position, we have the balance sheet capacity. We have -- on a leverage neutral basis, if you take our free cash flow expectations, we have over $300 million of kind of investment capacity at our fingertips, so to speak. So honestly, the $25 million add was simply identifying some small noncore assets in our portfolio where we have received indications of interest that show pretty low cap rates. And when we think about that trade of exiting a noncore asset on an accretive basis, into either our developments or redevelopments on acquisition. Some of these assets, you could argue you can pay down debt and that's accretive. So when we see that trade opportunity, we're going to take it. And that's all we're doing here. It's just a little bit of pruning why, I think kind of smartly and over time, that's going to lead to a more durable income stream and earnings growth as well."", 'Craig Allen Mailman', 'And the remaining $95 million that you guys have kind of dialed in, how much of that do you have visibility on at this point? And maybe what do you think timing could be on some of these sales?', 'Michael J. Mas', ""I think -- I mean the $25 million that we've added, we have visibility on all of it, and it's on the market, it's actively being discussed. The $25 million is going to be back-end weighted. And I think I still have a lot of confidence that we're going to execute on that plan. The other transactions are known. They're going to occur. These aren't speculative disposition assumptions. These are -- these are actionable disposed that we have a lot of confidence in."", 'Craig Allen Mailman', ""Okay. So I guess I was getting at -- you guys have done $30 million, $25 million is incremental you kind of think, but then the other $70 million is kind of known, what's the timing on those?"", 'Michael J. Mas', ""Timing, I'm going to look to the team to help me out, but Q3 -- end of Q3 estimate on the $70 million roughly is how I would think about it. I think about it at the kind of end of third quarter."", 'Christy McElroy', ""And Craig, we also announced that we did another disposition in the second quarter, it was Tamarac, and we disclosed that in the press release. It's just not in the transaction list yet."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim with Truist.', 'Ki Bin Kim', ""So there's been a couple of retailers in the media like Starbucks, McDonald's. And I think grocers has been talking about smaller basket sizes and certain consumers being stretched for some time. I was just curious if you've noticed any of that conversation and your dialogue with tenants today. And I know both things can coexist where demand could be good for a while, even though there might be some challenges. Just curious what you're seeing on the ground."", 'Lisa Palmer', ""Let me just take it generally first, and then I'll let Alan talk about the actual discussions with tenants. I mean the future is always uncertain, right? And in today's world, the macroeconomic, I don't know any of us can predict what is going to happen. But what we do know is that we have high-quality centers and our trade areas have been to this point, and we expect to be able to -- and we expect to continue especially given the types of, the types of uses within our centers, right? It's value, convenience, service that we would expect that our shopping centers, the trade areas, the consumers and our trade areas are going to be capable of absorbing the macro pressures that we're seeing today. We are generally seeing that through the results in our shopping centers. I want -- you also made a comment about stress for time, which I think is really important because this even goes to the medical that we spoke about. It's a real structural tailwind that there's -- and you've heard us say this, a renewed appreciation for a physical presence of the shopping centers near and close to people's homes to service their needs, and to buy goods because they are stretched for time. And it is why that we really do have this tailwind, the suburban shopping centers for all the types of uses that we are offering at our shopping centers. And I think that, that is -- we don't see that softening today. (inaudible) handset he thinks I hit it. So he's not going to add."", 'Ki Bin Kim', ""And on development, I don't think you guys have a large land bank and -- but you guys have been very successful in starting some projects at high yields. Also just curious about the second round of development that you might be pursuing. How might that be different in terms of yields versus the current pipeline, especially given your kind of land bank position?"", 'Nicholas Andrew Wibbenmeyer', ""Sure, Ki Bin, this is Nick. Appreciate the question. You're absolutely right. We do not land bank as a strategy for our development program. And so we are very, very thoughtful about derisking these projects as part of our diligence while we control the real estate prior to closing. And so our process is we make sure we have control of the real estate. We make sure we have really high-quality tenants committed to the projects, especially our grocery tenants. We work through the entitlement process. We work through the pricing exercise. And as we've talked about in previous quarters, it is a challenging environment to bring all of those pieces of the puzzle together, but it is a core competency of ours, and our teams continue to do a really, really tremendous job of finding those opportunities across our platform, across the country. And as we've said on multiple occasions, we feel really bullish about the future of our development program. We continue to lean into it and our teams are continuing to find more than our fair share of those opportunities. And as you -- in terms of your question of yield, as you can see in our in process, our yields range between 7% and 9% and on our development and redevelopment program, and that's where we're still targeting and we expect to have additional success in that range."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Floris Van Dijkum with Compass Point.', 'Floris Gerbrand Hendrik Van Dijkum', ""I guess it's more of a follow-up question. In terms of the development versus redevelopment. One of Regency's core competencies has always been the development, I think, Lisa. You guys have -- you're somewhat unique as I think most of your peers are saying that rents probably need to rise by anywhere -- over 25% in order to justify new development on a national basis. But obviously, there's always unique opportunities. And I suspect Cheshire is one of those. But how much of an advantage or how much of your development -- future development pipeline do you think is going to come from your existing portfolio versus brand-new opportunities like Cheshire. And also, what's the difference in return on those kind of opportunities in your view?"", 'Lisa Palmer', ""I'll start, and then I'll let Nick finish. I think you've been following us since you do -- you have seen that the percentages were more weighted towards redevelopment in the recent past, but we have created a ton -- we've generated a ton of momentum in the ground upside. And again, this goes back to the renewed appreciation for bricks and mortar and for being close to customers' homes. And for the retailers to be able to service their customers through all channels, and one is for the customer to walk through the front door and also to buy online and pick up in store all tailwinds for our business. And you're correct, and I appreciate the acknowledgment that development has been a differentiator for us and a competitive edge, for as long as I've been at the company, and I've been here almost 28 years. And we have an extremely successful track record in that regard. And that matters because we have an experienced, talented national team with these relationships that is helping us find and Nick and the team reminds me all the time, and I'm not saying that it's not easy, but that's what makes us so good. And so that I would expect that we're going to continue to see more momentum on the ground upside. Redevelopments will also continue to happen, as Alan talked about. We intensely manage our existing portfolio, and it's an important part of fortifying our future NOI growth. But I do expect that you're going to see ground-up grow over the next few years."", 'Nicholas Andrew Wibbenmeyer', ""And all I would add to that, Floris, is as Mike alluded to earlier, and we continue to be very vocal about, the great news is, for us, it's not an either/or process. We are an enviable position with our capital that we are going to take advantage of opportunities that we see in our existing portfolio. And as you see in our in process, the team has found a lot of opportunities at very accretive and attractive returns to invest new capital into our existing portfolio. But we also are going to continue to take advantage of every opportunity we see on a ground-up basis that we know we can derisk and we can put a shovel on the ground at an attractive return there. And we have capability. We have the team that's across the country focused on that, and we have the capital. And so we are blessed to be in a position of not choosing between the 2. We're going to do both."", 'Floris Gerbrand Hendrik Van Dijkum', ""And maybe in terms of the return thresholds, I guess, maybe if you can talk about like I would imagine that some of the redevelopment opportunities are going to have higher returns, but how does that compare to buying, for example, something today in the market like a West border or other things that you're looking at? How much higher does the return need to be in order for you to pull the trigger on opportunities?"", 'Lisa Palmer', ""Sorry, I was just going to reiterate, Nick, what you already said earlier, and that was the 7% to 9%, the target threshold hasn't changed for developments. And acquisitions are going to -- it's going to vary. It's going to depend on the total return, if you will, what's the future growth right? We acquired Nohl Plaza, which had a tremendous amount of upside and a much lower cap rate, for example. We did our Chicago acquisition, higher cap rate, not as much -- there's not as much leasing upside or redevelopment upside. So that's acquisitions are going to really vary depending upon the actual individual opportunity. Development 7% to 9%. Historically, we have always -- we've tried to target a minimum of 150 basis point spread over what that shopping center upon completion would sell in the market. And I think we're still pretty successful with that."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Linda Tsai with Jefferies.', 'Linda Tsai', ""For the 39 anchors that have signed, but not yet commenced, just wondering who some of those anchor tenants are? Like how many of those are grocers. And then I guess just my second question is do you think your grocer penetration, if it's plus 80% right now could get much higher?"", 'Alan Todd Roth', ""Linda, this is Alan. I don't have the actual number of what percent were grocers, but there certainly were a number of transactions that are in there. The target that we had mentioned in Norwalk, we are very excited about the first Whole Foods Daily Shop. I think that was announced here a few months ago in Manhattan, which will be opening likely in the fourth quarter of this year. And if you haven't heard about that concept, that's their new quick and convenient shopping experience for that urban customer. We've got a couple of public deals that are under redevelopment right now. So I would tell you there's a pretty significant amount of grocer activity that is within that number. We're excited to get both of those Kroger deals -- excuse me, Publix deal is open, which are down in Atlanta. And so it's a significant part of it. Second part of your question? I'm happy in a moment with it."", 'Michael J. Mas', ""We're not grocer penetrated. We're 80% grocery-anchored. And I don't think we see that number materially changing from this point forward. The bias here is around grocery, and we'll continue to pursue grocery-anchored shopping centers as a rule. But I don't think you're going to see that go materially or change materially from here."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Mike Mueller with JPMorgan.', 'Michael William Mueller', ""So for the Stone Bridge development that's part of a master plan community, how mature or early stage is the community? And as being part of a project like that changed the risk profile or economics, you compare to a development, not one of those communities?"", 'Nicholas Andrew Wibbenmeyer', ""I appreciate the question. This is Nick. I'm glad you actually pointed out that it is part of the master plan community because to us, these partnering and working with master plan developers is a real competitive advantage of ours. And so if you put yourselves in the shoe of a master plan developer, one of the most important things you can have to make sure that you continue to sell high-quality homes to high-quality purchasers is retail amenities and grocery being a really important part of that. And so in the communities that we're servicing, these are wealthy areas with expected high purchase prices for the homes. And so they want high-quality grocers. We have the relationships with the high-quality grocers. We have the expertise to design those assets at a really high level. They know we have the capital to build them. And they know we anticipate owning those. And so we're making every decision along the way from a long-term ownership perspective. And so when you put your shoe -- yourself in the seat of a master plan developer, we're really one of the best partners that you could hope for to execute on that important amenity. And therefore, that's why we've had a lot of success in that. And so as you mentioned, Cheshire is an example of that. Our Baybrook development, our HEB development down in Houston is an example of that. Our Sienna project is an example of that, and we continue to work with a lot of large master plan developers around the country, and that's part of our pipeline. But I'll just add to that. These are not greenfield areas. These are not tertiary markets. These are infill master planned communities that have been underway for, in some cases, decades. And so that's where the sort of perfect formula coming together where there is demand at high enough rents to make our deals pencil, and that's the sweet spot we're working in and continue to focus on."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Omotayo Okusanya with Deutsche Bank.', 'Omotayo Tejumade Okusanya', ""So based on all the commentary, on the call, everything seems to be going really, really well at the company. So I guess, just going back to guidance, Again, I'm trying to understand the solid beat in 1Q, understanding all the items. Mike, that doesn't kind of translate to a bigger increase in guidance? And kind of what's trying to connect those 2 dots of -- what am I missing?"", 'Michael J. Mas', ""Tayo. Listen, I think it's timing. Really on every -- just about every line item in our outlook, we've delivered on a full year basis, what we anticipate delivering but some of that timing was front loaded. Again, I'll just reiterating the percent rent. That's kind of a classic first quarter issue, but it occurs largely in the first quarter. Again, over half of our percentage rents are earned -- and the balance is coming from other line items like other income, where the income streams within those line items can be nonlinear. And it just so happens that some of that was occurred in the first quarter, for example, rather than our plan, which was in the second. So some of those items are just kind of idiosyncratic. But on a full year basis, as we kind of zoom out, we are delivering on all of them at the level that we anticipated. So it's just not translating to the full year expectations. What you're sensing though, in our commentary is that the incredible quarter we have from a leasing perspective and combined with the incredible momentum we continue to generate on the development side of the business leading to this added conviction over our future growth. And that's what we're trying to convey today is that, that plus 100 basis point contribution on same-property NOI from (inaudible) as a '25 event, you didn't hear us talk about that last quarter. That's, I think, what's happening. The quality of Q1 is translated into our conviction over the end of '24 and full year '25."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of R.J. Milligan with Raymond James.', 'Richard Jon Milligan', ""First off, I really appreciate the AFFO disclosure, hopefully, the rest of your peers that don't already provided, follow your lead. But aside from the lack of disclosure from some of your peers, there's always a lot of different bucketing of CapEx. And sorry, I have more of a philosophical question. In your AFFO calculation, you don't include redevelopment CapEx and I think as an industry, some of your peers are pretty discerning as to what's really redevelopment, i.e., growth CapEx. Well, I think some are pretty liberal and throwing a lot of re-tenanting into that redevelopment bucket, which really looks a lot more like maintenance CapEx. So I'm just curious how you think about bucketing those costs to get to your AFFO calculation?"", 'Michael J. Mas', ""I'm happy to take it. And RJ, I appreciate the question. The team did a nice job, really nice job enhancing our disclosure. So thank you for the kudos. I would encourage you to look at it on a look-through basis. That's my simple answer to it. And I understand that redevelopments are hybrids. They are -- they can be challenging to differentiate between maintenance capital and added capital. We -- as we think about our bucketing, it is -- we're densifying the site. We're adding GLA. We're significantly repositioning the asset within the market. And when that occurs, we are designating that as a redevelopment. If it's straight lease-for-lease, box-for-box [refinancing] that space as is, that's leasing CapEx, and we're going to put that into the leasing bucket. But I would encourage you, as you think about Regency versus others, put it all in, call redevelopment capital. We're happy for you to do it and then compare us on an apples-to-apples basis, and we like how we stack up."", 'Lisa Palmer', ""I think what Mike is trying to say is that whether you look at it on just the leasing only, we're at the low end. And if you bump -- if you throw everything together, we're still at the low end. And it goes back again to just our intentional approach to leasing capital."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Powell with Barclays.', 'Anthony Franklin Powell', ""Just a question on the Kroger, Albertsons merger and the back and forth with the FTC in that with the dispositions. Any concerns that, that merger may be taking a bit longer to completely expected or any impact if it's not commenced, got a few questions on that from clients in the past few months."", 'Lisa Palmer', ""I can appreciate that you probably are getting questions from that. But we don't have any new information. We're reading what you're reading -- and it has not -- it doesn't -- the timing of it isn't impacting our operations whatsoever. They're still operating as 2 separate companies. They're talking with us as 2 separate companies. I mean -- and they're key customers of ours. So we do have real -- we do have good relationships with them, but they're not allowed to give us any inside information. We continue to feel really good about our real estate. And I think you've heard us and you've heard us and you've heard me say this before, if the merger goes through, we believe that, that will create a stronger, more well-capitalized grocer that will better be able to compete with some of their competitors and will be a really strong operator for us. And if it does happen, the spin-off of stores that would -- that would happen certainly is the greatest area of uncertainty. But again, we feel really good about our stores. And those are productive grocery locations and we would expect them to continue to be so. If the merger doesn't happen, they're really good operators, and we're happy to have both of them operate in our portfolio."", 'Operator', 'Ms. Palmer, we have no further questions at this time.

It's a far higher rate than the S&P 500 average, which yields just 1.4%. But the danger with Altria is that its payout ratio is high, and its long-term future is questionable given the waning demand for cigarettes. Investors who buy the stock are taking on considerable risk, especially if they are relying on its dividend payments to continue."", ""Rather than investing in a high-risk dividend stock, investors may be better off buying shares of a company which offers a more modest payout but whose future is much safer in the longer run. One of the best and safest dividend stocks that you can buy and forget about today is consumer goods behemoth Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG). Here's a closer look at why it may be a no-brainer buy for long-term income investors despite its much smaller yield of 2.5%."", 'On April 9, Procter & Gamble announced that it would be increasing its quarterly dividend. At $1.0065, the new dividend is 7% higher than the $0.9407 that the consumer goods company was previously paying. And over the past five years, Procter & Gamble has increased its dividend by 35% from the $0.7459 that it was paying investors back in 2019.', ""The dividend increase marks the 68th consecutive year which Procter & Gamble has raised its dividend. Even among Dividend Kings, Procter & Gamble has one of the longest dividend streaks going. Altria is part of the group as well, but it has increased its dividend by just 23% in five years. And more importantly, in the years ahead, it's less certain that it can continue raising its dividend at all. Currently, Altria's payout ratio is at more than 81%; Procter & Gamble's payout ratio is at around 61%."", ""It's not just dividend streaks or payout ratios which investors should consider when looking at dividend stocks. What matters the most is the long-term outlook for the business, and this is where Procter & Gamble distances itself as a much safer investment than Altria."", ""With top consumer brands such as Pampers, Bounce, Gillette, and many others in its portfolio, Procter & Gamble has a broad product mix which reaches many different customers. The company is also able to pass on rising costs to consumers to help offset the effects of inflation. In its third-quarter earnings for fiscal 2024, for the period ending March 31, Procter & Gamble's net sales rose by 1% to $20.2 billion, and its diluted per-share profits jumped by 11% to $1.52. The company anticipates that for the full-fiscal year its sales growth will be between 2% and 4%."", ""Altria, by comparison, reported a 2.5% revenue decline in its most recent quarter (also for the period ending March 31). And while the company's net earnings did rise by 19%, that was with the help of income from investments; its operating income actually fell by 3%."", ""While Procter & Gamble may only generate modest growth, its business looks safe in the long run. Meanwhile, over time, as there is less demand for tobacco cigarettes, Altria's numbers may deteriorate. Although the company is trying to transition to oral tobacco products and safer options for consumers, it could be a long and uncertain road ahead for the business. Altria's dividend still looks safe today, and its financials aren't all that bad, but they could be worse in the years ahead."", ""Procter & Gamble's dividend yield may not look nearly as attractive as Altria's. But if you're planning to invest for the long term, the risk is that a dividend cut could happen if Altria's business struggles. Its payout ratio is already a bit high and with such a high yield, investors aren't snapping up the tobacco company's shares, which may be a sign that they are wary of the stock, despite what may normally be a tempting dividend."", ""The sounder and safer approach for investors is to buy Procter & Gamble's stock. Over the past 10 years, it has generated total returns (including dividends) of around 160% versus 100% for Altria. And with a brighter future ahead, it's likely to remain the better investment for the long haul."", 'Before you buy stock in Procter & Gamble, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Procter & Gamble wasn’t one of them.

Consequently, this has contributed to consumer awareness of these products.', ""As per the aforementioned research, the Korean cosmetics sector expanded gradually during the COVID-19 epidemic as more people became familiar with the products' multiple benefits. Furthermore, this study has found that, due to K-Beauty’s rise in recognition among consumers, significant companies are engaging in projects such as R&D, new product developments, and mergers and acquisitions to maintain their market position and adapt to market shifts by releasing an array of products. For example, L'Oréal debuted Shihyo, a new Korean brand, in November 2022 and catered to K-Beauty, C-Beauty, and J-Beauty consumers.

If you have additional questions, please re-queue. And with that I will turn the call over to Don Wood to begin the discussion of our first quarter results. Don?', ""Donald Wood: Thanks, Leah, and good afternoon, everyone. Well, it's a New Year and Federal continues to charge forward with a very solid $1.64 recorded in the first quarter, along with 3.8% same-center growth when excluding term fees and COVID repayments. And an all-time first-quarter record 567,000 square feet of retail leased at 9% higher rents, the answer to the often-asked question of do demographics matter post-pandemic become quite evident. They sure do. The level of leasing activity in the quarter is particularly notable. Our record retail leasing was impressive, but maybe more so with the 190,000 square feet of office space leased at our mixed-use properties. Supplementing the long-awaited 141,000 square-foot lease to accounting consulting firm PWC at One Santana West, bringing that building to nearly half leased was an additional nearly 50,000 feet leased elsewhere in the mixed-use portfolio, including two deals at 915 Meeting Street at Pike & Rose, bringing that building to nearly 80% leased."", 'The remaining vacancy at 915 Meeting Street at Pike & Rose and One Santana West represents considerably less than 2% of the value of the Company. Tenant interest in the remaining space at both buildings remained solid. All-in all, for the quarter, we signed 117 commercial leases, retail plus mixed-use office for over 775,000 square feet of space with strong economics, not including our residential portfolio, which itself generated record first quarter property operating income of over $17 million. Make no mistake, our product, primarily retail, but also including complementary office and residential is very desirable in the marketplace and a huge positive differentiator. Now obviously, higher interest rates take away some of that operating positivity when you get down to the FFO line, but we still grew at over 3% in the quarter and at $1.64 at the higher end of our guidance range.', 'We did 104 comparable retail deals in the quarter that cumulatively were written at 9% higher cash basis rent than the final year of the previous tenant or 20% on a straight-line basis. And just to pound the point home one more time, those cash-based rollover increases come on top of leases that have had what we believe to be the highest contractual rent bumps throughout their term in the sector, making that rollover all the more impressive. Contractual rent bumps for the deals done in the first quarter were roughly 2.3% blended, anchor and small-shop. The weighted average contractual rent bumps for the entire retail portfolio, not just one or two or three quarters worth, approximates 2.25% and higher when considering the office business, best in the business as far as we can tell.', ""The sustained leasing volume and related economics bode well for the future, especially the contractual rent bumps. Now I spoke last quarter about the upside in our occupancy, especially with respect to shop space and felt that another 100 basis points over the 90.7% that we reported at last year -- at year-end was doable. In the first quarter of 2024, we picked up 70 of those 100 basis points, bringing our small-shop lease percentage to 91.4%. There's more to come here. Our anchored lease percentage is 95.8%, there's another 200 basis points to come there too. Those two components combined at 94.3% leased overall, pretty strong, but as we're demonstrating room to grow. We take a very proactive approach to leasing and often lease space well in advance of an existing lease expiration or vacancy, all in the name of improved tenant health and merchandising mix and as an insurance policy towards potential gaps in future cash flow."", ""We've got some impactful anchor renewals coming up later this year and early next that should continue the positive trajectory. In terms of a tenant watchlist or other indications of a shift in demand, there is nothing out-of-the-ordinary that we can point to. We have little exposure to those tenants that are most talked about these days Express, Big Lots, Jo-Ann's, Family Dollar and 99 Cents Only as they tend to cater to a lower-income demographic. Our tenants have been largely been able to pass on cost of goods and labor increases to their customers. Those customers may grumble at the higher prices, but thus far, they've been both able and more importantly willing to pay them. In addition, our retail tenant base is very well-diversified by both in terms of tenant concentration as well as property type."", ""And while we'll always have one-off tenant failures as just part of the business, portfolio-wide collectability issues haven't been and are expect -- are not expected to be outside our historical experience or specific 2024 guidance. Business looks good. The last topic I want to address before turning it over to Dan relates to external growth. While we've turned down the dial a bit on immediate development projects, the residential development at Bala Cynwyd Shopping Center notwithstanding, we turned up the dial and level of intensity on sourcing acquisitions. It's an interesting and unique time in the acquisition marketplace right now. While there is a limited supply of Federal Realty type opportunities out there, there's also less viable competition for those centers than there has been historically."", 'We look for shopping centers that are generally larger in size than the average center with opportunities for remerchandising, redevelopment, higher rents and potential site intensification. We look for shopping centers in markets that have strengthened significantly over the past 15 years and especially post-pandemic markets like Phoenix, Central and South Florida and Northern Virginia among others. We look for shopping centers that are immediately accretive to earnings based on the cost of cap -- based on our cost-of-capital advantage, but even more importantly, produce returns meaningfully above our long-term cost-of-capital. We look for shopping centers that will be immediately financed through combination of other asset sales and our largely undrawn $1.25 billion credit facility and then refinance for the long-term subsequently.', ""We've begun our due diligence process on one such large asset currently and have a growing pipeline on others. Obviously, it remains to be seen if and how much success we'll have in this buy versus build cycle, but using both our operating strength and reputation as well as our balance sheet strength and flexibility, is a specific focus of ours for the balance of this year and next. That's all I wanted to cover in prepared remarks this afternoon. So I'll turn it over to Dan to provide more granularity before opening it up to your questions."", 'Dan Guglielmone: Thank you, Don, and hello, everyone. Our reported FFO per share of $1.64 for the first quarter was up 3.1% versus a year ago, and came in at the upper end of our quarterly guidance range of $1.60 to $1.65, which we provided on our earnings call back in February. Property operating income was up 5.6%, also above our expectations, highlighting the overall strength of our real estate. Primary drivers for the strong start to 2024, POI growth in our comparable portfolio, up almost 4% excluding prior period rents and term fees, driven by resiliency in our occupancy levels, continued strength in our residential portfolio and stronger contributions from specialty and temp leasing. This was primarily offset by lighter term fees than forecast and some timing noise with respect to collections.', ""We have an expectation of reversing that over the balance of the year. Comparable POI growth, excluding the impact of prior period rent and term fees was 3.8%. Comparable minimum rents grew 3.6% and comparable total property revenues were up 4.1%. Portfolio occupancy levels showed greater resiliency than we forecast, as our leased rate increased up to 94.3% and our occupancy rate staying at the 92% level, both metrics better-than-expected, as retail leasing volumes hit record levels with our leasing and tenant coordination teams, getting tenants open sooner and keeping tenants in place longer. Testament to our ability to grind down revenue growth at the property level while curating best-in-class tenant lines. Given the tremendous start to the year from a leasing perspective, coupled with a strong pipeline of lease deals in process, which are some of the highest levels we've seen post-COVID, we are extremely well-positioned to drive our occupancy metrics over the coming quarters."", ""It's too soon to increase our targeted year-end occupancy levels, but we are in a good spot at this point in the year. Another part of our business worthy of note is our residential portfolio, which continues to be a source of strength. Same-store residential POI growth was 6% in the first quarter on the heels of a similarly strong fourth quarter. This was driven by 5% plus revenue growth against 3% expense growth, leading to results well ahead of focus. While we are dialing down new development starts, are still substantial in-process development pipeline continues to make meaningful contributions as lease-up continues at these projects. Darien Residential continues to exceed expectations and is 99% leased. Darien Retail is over 90% leased with several store openings set over the coming quarters."", 'Huntington Shopping Center is 94% leased with Whole Foods and others set to open by third quarter. And as Don mentioned, 915 Meeting Street and One Santana West continue to view solid progress at almost 80% and 50% leased, respectively. Note that global foodservice giant Sodexo moved into its new North American headquarters at Pike & Rose during the quarter. Now on to the balance sheet and an update for liquidity position. All of our refinancing requirements for 2024 were handled at the very start of the quarter with our $485 million, 3.25% exchangeable notes offering. This leaves us with no material maturities until 2026. We stand with over $1.33 billion of available liquidity of our $1.25 billion credit facility and cash-on-hand. And have redevelopment and expansions spend remaining of only $100 million for the balance of 2024.', 'Additional funding sources this year approach almost $0.5 billion and include expanding leverage neutral debt capacity as EBITDA comes online in the $150 million to $175 million range, free cash flow of $50 million to $75 million as we approach pre-COVID levels and a sizable asset sale pipeline under consideration. Our leverage metrics continue to be solid as first-quarter annualized net-debt to EBITDA stands just inside six times. That metric is targeted to improve over the course of 2024 to 5.7 times by year-end and to 5.5 times in 2025. Fixed charge coverage was 3.5 times at quarter-end. And that metric should also improve as incremental EBITDA comes online over the balance of 2024. Now with respect to guidance. With a first solid first quarter behind us and leasing demand continuing at a stronger pace than expected, we are tightening and raising our 2024 FFO guidance from $6.76 per share and the midpoint to $6.77, with a range refined upwards to $6.67 to $6.87.', 'This represents 3.4% bottom-line FFO growth at the midpoint and almost 5% at the upper end of the range. Keep in mind, this is being done with the realization that interest rates will likely remain higher for longer and provide roughly $0.02 to $0.03 of greater headwinds in 2024 than we originally forecast 90 days ago. This upward revision and guidance is driven by stronger underlying portfolio performance than expected as leasing and occupancy metrics outperform expectations, as well as a more optimistic outlook for such difficult to forecast items such as parking, specialty leasing and percentage rent. Add to that, some of our first quarter headwinds are expected to be timing issues that should reverse themselves in the coming quarters. As a result, we are also revising our comparable growth outlook upward.', ""Comparable growth is now forecast at 2.25% to 3.5%, up from 2% to 3.5%, and our comparable growth excluding prior period rents and term fees is now forecast at 2.75% to 4%, up from 2.5% to 4%. While we made significant leasing progress at One Santana West and 915 Meeting Street in the first quarter, none of those leases are expected to impact our forecast in 2024. We'll see the impact in 2025. More to come on that outlook as the year progresses and additional leases get signed. All other guidance assumptions as outlined on Page 27, our 8-K, remain unchanged. Although please note, we do not include prospective acquisitions and dispositions activity in our guidance. We will update our forecast for that activity as it gets completed. Now before we go to Q&A, I'd like you to please listen up for this is important."", 'For the first quarter -- with the first quarter in the books at $1.64 per share, our quarterly FFO outlook for the second quarter is $1.63 to $1.69, again, $1.63 to $1.69 for the second quarter. Consistent with the cadence presented on our call in February, the third and fourth quarters should increase sequentially from there, reflecting the continued momentum we are seeing across our business.

Joining me on the call are Don Wood, Federal's Chief Executive Officer; Jeff Berkes, President and Chief Operating Officer; Dan G., Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; Jan Sweetnam, Executive Vice President, Chief Investment Officer; and Wendy Seher, Executive Vice President, Eastern Region President.

If you have additional questions, please requeue.And with that, I will turn the call over to Don Wood to begin our discussion of our first quarter results. Don?"", 'Donald C. Wood', ""Thanks, Leah, and good afternoon, everyone. Well, it's a new year and Federal continues to charge forward. With a very solid $1.64 recorded in the quarter, along with 3.8% same-center growth when excluding term fees and (inaudible) repayments and an all-time first quarter record 567,000 square feet of retail leads to 9% higher rents. The answer to the often asked question of do demographics matter post pandemic become quite evident, that sure do.The level of leasing activity in the quarter is particularly notable. Our record retail leasing was impressive, but maybe more so was the 190,000 square feet of office space leased at our mixed-use properties. Supplementing the long-awaited 141,000 square foot lease to accounting consulting firm PwC at One Santana West, bringing that building to nearly half leased was an additional nearly 50,000 square feet leased elsewhere in the mixed-use portfolio, including two deals at 915 Meeting Street at Pike & Rose, bringing that building to nearly 80% leased.The remaining vacancy at 915 Meeting Street at Pike & Rose and 1 Santana West represents considerably less than 2% of the value of the company. Tenant interest in the remaining space at both buildings remain solid.All in all, for the quarter, we signed 117 commercial leases, retail plus mixed-use office for over 775,000 square feet of space with strong economics, not including our residential portfolio, which itself generated record first quarter property operating income of over $17 million. Make no mistake, our product, primarily retail, but also including complementary office and residential is very desirable in the marketplace and a huge positive differentiator.Now obviously, higher interest rates take away some of that operating positivity when you get down to the FFO line, but we still grew at over 3% in the quarter and at $1.64 at the higher end of our guidance range. We did 104 comparable retail deals in the quarter that cumulatively were written at 9% higher cash basis rent than the final year of the previous tenant or 20% on a straight-line basis.And just to pound the point home one more time, those cash-based rollover increases come on top of leases that have had what we believe to be the highest contractual rent bumps throughout their term in the sector making that roll over all the more impressive. Contractual rent bumps for the deals done in the first quarter were roughly 2.3% blended, anchor and small shop. The weighted average contractual rent bumps for the entire retail portfolio, not just 1 or 2 or 3 quarters worth, approximates 2.25% and higher when considering the office leases, best in the business as far as we can tell. The sustained leasing volume and related economics bode well for the future, especially the contractual rent bumps.Now I spoke last quarter about the upside in our occupancy, especially with respect to shop space and felt that another 100 basis points over the 90.7% that we reported at last year -- at year-end was doable. In the first quarter of 2024, we picked up 70 of those 100 basis points bringing our small shop lease percentage to 91.4%. There's more to come here. Our anchored lease percentage is 95.8% is another 200 basis points to come there too. Those two components combined at 94.3% leased overall. Pretty strong, but as we're demonstrating, room to grow. We take a very proactive approach to leasing and often lease space well in advance of an existing lease expiration or vacancy. All in the name of improved tenant health and merchandising mix and as an insurance policy towards potential gaps and future cash flow. We've got some impactful anchor renewals coming up later this year and early next that should continue the positive trajectory.In terms of a tenant watchlist or other indications of a shift in demand, there is nothing out of the ordinary that we can point to. We have little exposure to those tenants that are most talked about these days, Express, Big Lots, JOANNs, Family Dollar and 99 Cents Only, as they tend to cater to a lower income demographic, our tenants have been largely been able to pass on cost of goods and labor increases to their customers. Those customers may grumble at the higher prices, but thus far, they've been both able, and more importantly, willing to pay them.In addition, our retail tenant base is very well diversified by both in terms of tenant concentration as well as property type. And while we'll always have one-off tenant failures that's just part of the business, portfolio-wide collectability issues haven't been and are not expected to be outside our historical experience or specific 2024 guidance. Business looks good.The last topic I want to address before turning it over to Dan, relates to external growth. While we've turned down the dial a bit on immediate development projects, the residential development of Bala Cynwyd with shopping center notwithstanding, we turned up the dial and level of intensity on sourcing acquisitions. It's an interesting and unique time in the acquisition marketplace right now. While there is a limited supply of Federal Realty type opportunities out there, there's also less viable competition for those centers than there has been historically. We look for shopping centers that are generally larger in size than the average center, with opportunities for remerchandising, redevelopment, higher rents, and yup, potential site intensification. We look for shopping centers in markets that have strengthened significantly over the past 15 years and especially post pandemic.Markets like Phoenix, Central and South Florida and Northern Virginia, among others. We look for shopping centers that are immediately accretive to earnings based on the -- based on our cost of capital advantage, but even more importantly, produce returns meaningfully above our long-term cost of capital.We look for shopping centers that will be immediately financed through the combination of other asset sales and our largely undrawn $1.25 billion credit facility and then refinance for the long term subsequent.We've begun our due diligence process on one such large asset currently and have a growing pipeline of others. Obviously, it remains to be seen if and how much success we'll have in this buy versus build cycle, but using both our operating strength and reputation as well as our balance sheet strength and flexibility is a specific focus of ours for the balance of this year and next.That's all I wanted to cover in prepared remarks this afternoon. So I'll turn it over to Dan to provide more granularity before opening up to your questions."", 'Daniel Guglielmone', ""Thank you, Don, and hello, everyone.

Free cash flow of $50 million to $75 million as we approach pre-COIVD levels and a sizable asset sale pipeline under consideration.

That metric is targeted to improve over the 2024 to 5.7x by year-end and to 5.5x in 2025. Fixed charge coverage was 3.5x at quarter end, and that metric should also improve as incremental EBITDA comes online over the balance of 2024. Now with respect to guidance, with a first -- solid first quarter behind us, leasing demand continuing at a stronger pace than expected, we are tightening and raising our 2024 FFO guidance from $6.76 per share at the midpoint to $6.77, with a range refined upwards to $6.67 to $6.87.

Again, $1.63 to $1.69 for the second quarter. Consistent with the cadence presented on our call in February, the third and fourth quarter should increase sequentially from there reflecting the continued momentum we are seeing across our business.With that, operator, you can open up the line for questions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Juan Sanabria of BMO Capital Markets.', 'Juan Carlos Sanabria', ""Good afternoon. Thank you for the time. Just wanted to ask a little bit more about the acquisitions and the funding. I think, Dan, you said that there was a fair amount of product that you're looking to maybe monetize. So hoping you could give a little more color on the dispositions and what kind of values you could get there, cap rates and the spend the spread in terms of what you're thinking on some of these assets that you're looking at in some of these (inaudible) south markets?"", 'Daniel Guglielmone', ""Yes. Look, we have -- as I've mentioned kind of throughout the beginning of the year, we've got upwards of $300 million to $400 million of assets that we currently have under consideration for sale, kind of the initial cap rates or yields on those assets are kind of in the low 6s. And if we include maybe a couple more assets there, it probably dips below 6% on an initial yield basis. So attractive, and more importantly, in our view, the long-term IRRs are very attractive relative to where we feel we can deploy capital in the acquisition market. So a very attractive source of capital. We'll see whether or not all of that pool under consideration will get executed. But we've broadened the pool, and we'll use that effectively as a source of capital."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Dori Kesten of Wells Fargo.', 'Dori Lynn Kesten', 'You had a strong quarter in small shop leasing. Can you give us a sense if this was more driven by national or local tenant demand and then what the blended rent escalators were on that.', 'Daniel Guglielmone', 'You want to take that?', 'Wendy A. Seher', ""I mean, we did have a very strong quarter on small shop leasing, and we were able to move the needle, I think, 70 basis points. So very pleased with that with what the team has been able to pull together. It's really broad-based when you look at kind of the deals that we're making for the quarter in the small shops in terms of national, regional and local, the categories that we're seeing, as you may guess, our restaurants in nature, we have full-service restaurants less of the fast food because it's typically not the demographic that we're attracting in some of our centers. But certainly, (inaudible) and the specialty restaurants have been very active. Apparel has been active, both in value apparel and in full service and full price apparel and our -- where we also have a tremendous amount of activity is when you talk about health and wellness and you talk about beauty and anything in that wide category is very active today. So a lot of good categories that are really helping us boost the overall sales and production of our small shops."", 'Donald C. Wood', ""Yes, Dori, the only thing I would add to that and really just to make the point that Wendy made, it's broad-based. As you know, we own all different kinds of open-air shopping centers and really across the board and certainly including the mixed-use stuff, we've had a very strong broad-based demand on shop space."", 'Daniel Guglielmone', ""And just to add further, the rent bumps on the small shop right in the 3% range, on average. And more importantly, we've done exceptionally well on anchors, where it's across the board. And I think that's a differentiator. That's not appreciated. And so -- and add into that, which Don alluded to, we get 3% or better on the office, which brought our blended up into the mid-2s across the almost 800,000 square feet of leasing that we did in the quarter. Really, really pleased with that."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Samir Khanal of Evercore ISI.', 'Samir Upadhyay Khanal', ""Dan, can you talk more about your guidance same-store, you're certainly tracking at the higher end, right, close to the top end. And everything you've kind of talked about and Don has talked about, it feels like you're probably tracking even above budget in many segments of the business, there is a lot of tailwinds. So help us understand what's kind of dragging that growth lower as we kind of think about the midpoint of your same-store or even the lower end."", 'Daniel Guglielmone', ""Yes. Look, I think we -- our credit reserve, we kept it kind of where it is this quarter. And so we're hopeful that that's something that we can do better on and so forth. Look, it's early in the year, and it's one quarter behind us. Typically, we don't move guidance up even when we beat in a quarter. And so look, we'll look to be -- see how the rest of the year unfolds. And hopefully, we can be up towards that upper end and we'll see how second and third quarter does."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Michael Goldsmith of UBS.', 'Michael Goldsmith', ""We've heard from the industrial REITs that retailers are deferring large capital investments in large warehouses. So have you seen any of that pressure of the capital investment required for retail stores in your shopping centers. Have you seen any of that pressure leak into your space recently?"", 'Donald C. Wood', ""Yes, Michael, this is Don. From my perspective, there is capital pressure from retailers to build out stores, but that's something, frankly, I think we've been talking about for 10 years. I don't see a difference over the past couple of years with respect to that. In fact, frankly, I think we've been pretty successful in limiting capital necessary.So as a result of the industrial space that you're talking about or frankly, other characteristics, the demand-supply characteristics in retail right now are such that, that we've been able to keep capital under control."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Greg McGinniss of Scotiabank.', 'Unidentified Analyst', 'This is (inaudible) on for Greg McGinniss. Cisco (inaudible) still have replaced Splunk as one of your top office tenants. I know Splunk had a couple of years of term left. Can you talk about what happened there?', 'Donald C. Wood', ""Yes, you know that Cisco bought Splunk. They -- and I say just closed within a month or 2 ago. And what they're -- they've assumed the lease so immediately, our credit, which I thought was pretty good with Splunk is a whole lot better with Cisco for the remainder term of that lease. They have not given us any indication at all in terms of what's their long-term plans are, other than in their visits of Santana Row, it wouldn't surprise you to know that they love the place. And frankly, have made that comment while they were there touring at their new space. So what happens after 2027, I think, effect is when we're in, we'll remain to be seen. But I view that, that acquisition is a real positive for us."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb of Piper Sandler.', 'Alexander David Goldfarb', ""Thank you. Good afternoon. Don, a question for you as you look at acquisitions. I know you guys are pretty rigorous in the way you approach acquisitions. But curious, because of what's going on now in the retail environment, dwindling availability, all the good stuff that we talk about. As you look at assets at your team underwrites assets on a, let's say, next 3-year period, are they coming out at higher returns than what you would have seen sort of pre-pandemic or because of natural issues like existing lease roll and time for entitlements and all that stuff that when you're underwriting today, you're not really seeing the benefit of the tighter environment as you underwrite it stuff that comes more once you take hold a meet that occurs over time versus, hey, because of what's going on right now in the next 3 years, we're able to outperform 50 bps let's say, versus what would have been pre-pandemic."", 'Jeffrey S. Berkes', ""Alex, it's Jeff. The acquisitions market is interesting right now. There's probably a lot of people that would like to sell or have to sell. But wish the Fed would provide some clarity on where rates are going and (inaudible) office sidelines. That said, we really leaned into the acquisitions market over the last 6 months or so. And as Don indicated on his opening remarks, we've had some great success over the last few months.And we're seeing, quite frankly, a fairly good range of deals where we think we can apply all the things that we're good at, most of which Tom mentioned. But just to reiterate, our leasing and merchandising skills or redevelopment skills. The fact that we don't look at real estate, shopping centers, super specifically, we're agnostic as to format and more concerned about the strength of location and all of that.And right now, with our cost of capital advantage, there's just not as much competition out there to buy and with our cost of capital advantage. We're seeing some really good opportunities. And yes, they do produce higher returns because not everybody has that advantage and there are buyers out there today. So we're pretty happy with what we're seeing, and we're pretty happy with what we're finding as we're underwriting in terms of our ability to get into a property and work the rent roll and really move the NOI going forward. So all good so far."", 'Donald C. Wood', ""Alex, you asked a very interesting question in there about how we underwrite and what the actual results will be once that underwriting effectively happens, and it's been something that I can tell you, I personally look at very hard because over the past several years, we have very much exceeded the leasing underwriting that we've done in the acquisitions that we've made.And I would expect, frankly, that to happen, that's to continue to happen. There's an inherent conservatism, if you will, in looking at a new property, even within your existing markets, et cetera, that is different once this company gets out there and does what it does. And I do think the combination of our context, frankly, our reputation and our understanding of what it is that we can do with an asset often results in actual results that are above the underwriting.I would expect that to continue to happen. And I'm not sure it's anything about -- specifically about the marketplace today as it is more about the specific shopping center that we would be acquiring and our optimism with respect to what we do with it."", 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Mailman of Citi.', 'Craig Allen Mailman', ""Not to beat a dead horse here with acquisitions. But I guess another question I have is just as you guys are looking at what's out there today, is it all just operating assets that you guys could over the next 3 to 5 years, kind of remerchandise or densify and that's the play? Or are there opportunities out there like you guys have done in Assembly or Santana that are that decade to 2-decade play for the company long term to harvest value?Are any of those available? Or is this just going to be kind of some near-term stuff that you see some opportunities, but maybe the upside isn't as kind of long tail then and big as some of the other kind of bigger mixed-use projects you guys have done in your history."", 'Donald C. Wood', ""Yes, Craig, that's a great question. And the answer is in the middle. No, you should not be thinking about our acquisitions turning into the next Assembly Row or Santana Row or Pike & Rose.Frankly, having those assets are in each of our major markets that we do business in is really important to this company. And each of those assets has a whole bunch more to go and do.Having said that, what we've learned in terms of being able to -- I think we're -- what I call is residential experts, but we're pretty darn good on the residential side and even specifically on specified narrow band of office. I think we're pretty darn good.So when we sit and look at the reason we want a bigger piece of property is yes, to do all those things you said which you're implying are easy and boring, my words, not yours, in terms of improving the merchandising, growing those rents, which is fundamentally critical. I also want a plus to those assets. And the plus to those assets could be incremental residential entitlements. It could be intensified retail plays on other parcels within it that -- the thing I love about this company is all arrows in the quiver.We're not a one-trick pony. So the ability for that lands and that shopping center to be enhanced not only with merchant remerchandising and higher rents, which is critical to it, but with other ways is something we always look at, even if we can't underwrite it on day 1."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Ki Bin Kim of Truist Securities.', 'Ki Bin Kim', ""So Don, as perhaps new development as far as not to start to take a little bit of a less prominent role in the near term versus acquisitions. I'm just curious, some of these projects, maybe you made some choices on leasing, shorter-term deals or maybe give up a couple of dollars in rent for control because eventually you want to do something bigger with it. I was just curious if -- how often is that the case. And if some projects take longer to start, are there some near-term opportunities that maybe you held up on that might -- that we can expect in the near term?"", 'Donald C. Wood', ""Ki Bin, let me make sure I've got what you're really asking. I can tell you that, first of all, and I wanted to make this point on the development side of our business, there will be a development cycle again. And so the notion of us not -- while yes, we're turning down the dial on construction starts. Effectively, we are as active and even more active in terms of entitling and in terms of design of future development projects on our existing properties.Now if you're asking existing properties, that means we give up rent, and we do things so that we can entitlement so that we can construct in the future, the answer is very rarely, very rarely do we do that. Now occasionally, we will when we see at an opportunity at an existing shopping center negotiate within a lease, the ability to effectively get out of that lease in exchange for paying back the unamortized CI or something, something like that or the money that we that they would -- I would say, yes. But that happens very rarely.So no, I don't think you should think of us from the development side is giving up money today, if you will, for the future. Wendy is looking at me."", 'Wendy A. Seher', ""So I just wanted to kind of add a little bit of color to that. We've always been sort of very strict about how we want to be able to control the property from a merchandising standpoint, from a redevelopment standpoint. So we've always highlighted that with our negotiations in this marketplace now with really demand exceeding supply, we can lean in on that a little bit further in terms of getting some of those controls that we absolutely need.And believe it or not, the discussions that we're having are easier to have with national and regional tenants because they know us. They know how we execute, they know how we invest and how we ultimately improve the property. So all of that is happening kind of concurrently at the same time."", 'Donald C. Wood', ""And Ki Bin, if I'm not answering your question, we're not answering your question, please give us a follow afterwards. I'd love to be happy to go through it more."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Mike Mueller of JPMorgan.', 'Michael William Mueller', ""So Dan, given the traction on office and development leasing that you're having, and how the focus seems to be more in acquisitions as opposed to development starts. Can you give us some sort of high-level color on how you see capitalized interest trending, say, through year-end '25."", 'Daniel Guglielmone', ""Yes. Look, I think we've given guidance on 2024, and I think that we're keeping that kind of constant. I think all the leasing that we're doing is not going to impact anything in 2024, some of the recent leasing. And I think I really -- we need to see how additional leasing gets done and really kind of how the timing of possession, timing of build-out and so forth before we can I think, give any color with regards to 2025. And so more to come on that later in the year."", 'Donald C. Wood', ""And the only thing I would say to you, Mike, on that is the (inaudible) 3 out of 4 from the Yankees. Congratulations for the first place on May 2. More to come, just like '25."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Haendel St. Juste of Mizuho.', 'Ravi Vijay Vaidya', 'This is Ravi Vaidya on the line for Haendel. I just wanted to ask about the TIs. I noticed that for the new leases, there were about $10 higher foot this quarter than last. Is there anything in particular with regarding any of the recent bankruptcy backfills or anything any other activity with leasing that may have driven that?', 'Daniel Guglielmone', ""Yes. Look, it is a little bit of a volatile number with the number of new leases that get signed per quarter. Now generally, it's somewhat in line with kind of the last -- maybe not in the last 4 quarters, but certainly the last 6 or 8. I wouldn't read anything into that, except just the general mix. And I don't think that is a trend actually. Our view is that it's probably even coming down more so than heading the other direction. This quarter, notwithstanding."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Floris Van Dijkum of Compass Point.', 'Floris Gerbrand Hendrik Van Dijkum', ""Don, I heard you talk so eloquently about some of the leasing dynamics and about your portfolio and how it's positioned in the market? And why you think you have a competitive advantage? Can you maybe -- obviously, vacancy rates are trending lower, rents are trending higher. Could you maybe talk a little bit about some of the ancillary benefits of the leases that you're signing today. I'm looking forward at your lease expiration for example, and I see that next year, approximately 80% of your shop leases has no option, but there's 20% that does. And if I look at your anchor leases about -- it looks like about 60% of your anchor leases have options. As leases get to the end of your life, are you now agreeing no options on your new transactions? And maybe talk about the bumps that you're getting, not just on your shops space but also on your anchors, obviously, besides the fact that rents are going higher."", 'Donald C. Wood', ""Gosh, Floris, you've got so much there to unpack. I'm going to give you a few things that eloquently you said that, and then I'm going to ask Wendy to jump in here.So the reason I speak eloquently about our ability to lease is it really does come down to in a period of time where everything, Floris, everything, cost 25% to 30% more than it did in 2019. The notion of when a tenant is underwriting for themselves, their sales and their profitability, they've got to be confident that they can push those higher costs through to the customer base. They're obviously more likely and able to be able to do that in places with more affluence and with effectively the customer base that is willing to pay additionally. That -- all of those dynamics, in fact, what happens in the negotiation of a lease and certainly small shop, but anchor too. And so when you think about what that does for us, if we had our way, we would hardly -- we would never give an option because an option is one way. An option is for a tenant to say yes or no, not for the landlord. So if we had our way, we wouldn't give any. That's just not practical. So there has to be a balance here, and we do balance with by looking at the credit of the tenant, the desirability of that tenant in the space, how important they are to the merchandising mix of the entire shopping center. And when we look at all that, that's how we determine what it is on an individual basis, what we're trying to do with terms of the contract that we're getting with them. In nearly all the cases from a small shop perspective, we get very good bumps, 3%, 4%, maybe 2.5%, maybe something a little modified from that, but very good bumps. On the anchor side, as Dan alluded to on his call, are you going to be able to see in this industry broadly defined 3% bumps with anchors generally.No. No. It's not market. It hasn't been market, but the difference is the ability to get 15% after 5 years versus 7.5% is huge when you look at the math, and go through it. We've been able to improve, and that's what Dan was referring to, the anchor leases at a rate that has been -- I've been very happy with relative to what's been able to be done before COVID. So, so I hope that answers most of it. I don't know if there's anything more to add to that, Wendy, but feel free if there's something there."", 'Wendy A. Seher', ""I think I would echo what you just said. The only thing that I will say that I get excited about is when I hear someone say you've got X amount of small shops coming up near term because what we found from a historic standpoint is if we can just get to the real estate, we do better. So, so I think it's a very positive thing that we're getting to it soon."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Lizzy Doykan of Bank of America.', 'Elizabeth Yang Doykan', 'I was just hoping to hear a bit more about the acquisition of the remaining joint venture interest in CocoWalk done in April. And are there more near-term JV buyout opportunities for you guys on the horizon? Or was this more of a one-off opportunity?', 'Daniel Guglielmone', ""Yes. Look, this was a joint venture that started back in 2015, 2016. It was to redevelop CocoWalk, it was hugely, hugely successful in terms of what we accomplished there in terms of trend forming that asset into what it is today and the returns that we achieve we had mechanisms in the joint venture to buy out our partner where they buy us out. And we bought them out, and we think, a very attractive yield for us. I think that there's probably a one-off. I don't see additional opportunities. We don't have a lot of joint ventures like that, but we'll be opportunistic when the opportunity arises. And we just felt like it was important for us to take 100% of the ownership of CocoWalk and to be able to operate it and run it and maximize the cash flows that we would achieve without having a partner in there getting fees."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Tayo Okusanya of Deutsche Bank.', 'Omotayo Tejumade Okusanya', 'Good afternoon. In terms of the mixed-use development projects, I recall at a certain point there was some interest in having a life sciences component to some of the assets. Is there still a thought around that at this point?', 'Donald C. Wood', ""So we'd love to add life sciences to Assembly Row or maybe even Pike & Rose. The math doesn't work today. It just doesn't work today. So the -- you certainly know what's in that industry. You certainly know what's happening in terms of supply in Somerville, Massachusetts, for example, and even here in Montgomery County.So there is some real and that we're sitting with here but whether it is life sciences eventually or whether it's more retail eventually or whether it's more residential or likely. Going forward that land and our ability to move entitlements and get what we need is very strong. So I wouldn't think about life sciences in the near future that way because I think they'll be higher and better use most likely."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Linda Tsai of Jefferies.', 'Linda Tsai', 'You provided guidance for 2Q in the midpoint of 1.66 implies a smaller sequential increase in FFO than usual. Is there anything driving that?', 'Daniel Guglielmone', ""Yes. And I think the previous question with regards to comparable alluded to, when we think about it, we have a tough comp in the second quarter of 2023. Second quarter of 2023, we had all of our Bed Bath in possession, rent paying, [SOFR 1] plus, obviously, we had the headwinds. We had really a more optimal balance sheet. We refinanced our debt in the second quarter of last year, $275 million at 2.75%. So some of those headwinds are really what's driving, I think, the more moderate growth year-over-year in the second quarter. And we're really seeing the acceleration in FFO per share and probably in comparable as well. And -- and I know I'm talking to Linda, I'm addressing [Samir] previous question. So we see a greater acceleration in the third and fourth quarters and a little bit of a flatter second quarter because of that more difficult comp."", 'Operator', 'Thank you.

I will now hand over back to Leah Brady for closing remarks.', 'Leah Andress Brady', 'Looking forward to seeing many of you in the next few weeks.

(NYSE:AWK) Q1 2024 Earnings Call Transcript May 2, 2024', ""American Water Works Company, Inc. isn't one of the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds at the end of the third quarter (see the details here)."", ""Operator: Good morning. And welcome to American Water's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, this call is being recorded and is also being webcast with an accompanying slide presentation through the company's Investor Relations Web site. The audio webcast archive will be available for one year on American Water's Investor Relations website. I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Aaron Musgrave, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Musk, you may begin"", ""Aaron Musgrave: Thank you, Betsy. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us for today's call. At the end of our prepared remarks, we will open the call for your questions. Let me first go over some safe harbor language. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements that represent our expectations regarding our future performance or other future events. These statements are predictions based on our current expectations, estimates and assumptions. However, since these statements deal with future events, they are subject to numerous known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to be materially different from the results indicated or implied by such statements. Additional information regarding these risks, uncertainties and factors as well as a more detailed analysis of our financials and other important information is provided in the first quarter earnings release and in our March 31st Form 10-Q, each filed yesterday with the SEC."", ""And finally, all statements during this presentation related to earnings and earnings per share refer to diluted earnings and diluted earnings per share. After our prepared remarks, we'll then close by answering your questions. With that, I'll turn the call over to American Water's President and CEO, Susan Hardwick."", 'Susan Hardwick: Thanks, Aaron. Good morning, everyone. As we announced yesterday, we started 2024 with solid financial results. As shown on Slide 5, earnings were $0.95 per share for the quarter compared to $0.91 last year. The increased results were as we expected and put us on track to achieve our full year earnings guidance, which we are pleased to affirm. First quarter 2024 results included $0.02 per share of additional interest income from the February 2024 amendment of the seller note related to the sale of HOS, which reflected the higher interest rate and the successful earn-out of the $75 million contingent consideration as we detailed in our February call. Here, you can also see a recap of some of our other key accomplishments so far in 2024, and John and Cheryl will add to these in their remarks.', 'As we announced in late February, we completed a successful long term debt issuance of $1.4 billion. This delivered on the highest priority in our 2024 financing plan. We also invested well over $600 million of capital in infrastructure this quarter. In addition, we completed a large acquisition and filed general rate cases in several states in accordance with the traditional process of earning a return on the capital investments we have made. We did all of this while keeping customer bills affordable and staying true to our high value for quality service and sustainable operations, which we highlighted in our disclosures we published in early April as noted on this slide. The other significant news so far in 2024 for us and the water industry as a whole came on April 10th when the EPA announced the final national primary drinking water regulations for six PFAS chemicals.', ""Cheryl will elaborate further on the PFAS water quality standards, but I want to reiterate that we fully support the EPA's efforts to protect drinking water quality. I want to again assure our customers, regulators, investors and other stakeholders that American Water has the expertise to tackle this issue head on. And in fact, we have demonstrated that in many locations for some time now. Turning to Slide 6. This quarter, we are, again, affirming our long term targets for both earnings and dividend growth at 7% to 9%. This affirmation is based upon clear top-tier capital growth plan and our strong regulatory and operational execution that I believe is a positive differentiator from our peers. As we've done in the past, we expect to consistently deliver on our annual and long term plans, growing earnings and dividends at an industry leading pace over the next five years and beyond."", ""Moving on to Slide 7. As we announced yesterday, our Board of Directors approved an increase in the company's quarterly cash dividend from $0.7075 per share to $0.7650 per share, an 8.1% increase. We have grown our dividend consistently over the last five years, significantly outpacing virtually all of our utility peers, while maintaining a consistent payout ratio of less than 60%. Looking ahead, we continue to expect to grow our dividend at 7% to 9% per year on average, which is in line with our compelling 7% to 9% EPS growth target. Our Board and management team understand and appreciate how important the dividend component of our total shareholder return is to our investors. And with that, let me turn it over to Cheryl to talk more about PFAS, recent regulatory updates, affordability and rate based growth."", 'Cheryl?', ""Cheryl Norton: Thanks, Susan. And good morning, everyone. Let me start by turning to Slide 9 and reviewing the US EPA’s drinking water rule on PFAS published in April. As Susan stated, we fully support the EPA's efforts to protect drinking water quality. These contaminants are among the multiple challenges that the water industry faces regarding water quality, quantity and reliability. We remain steadfast in our commitment to be a leader in the US water and wastewater industry and a provider of solutions to these challenges. EPA's final rule was unchanged in terms of the drinking water limit of four parts per trillion for PFOA and PFAS. However, the federal time line to comply was extended from three years to five years in the final rule."", ""The federal compliance window now includes the two year extension that states would have been allowed to grant the water systems for capital improvements. As always, we will work with our state regulators to incorporate any additional state specific guidance related to implementing the new federal rule, including on maximum contaminant level guidelines. Based upon our preliminary analysis of this new PFAS rule and assuming states don't adopt more stringent limits, we currently do not anticipate any change to our estimate of $1 billion of capital and our estimate of up to $50 million annually of operating expenses to comply with the rule. We also do not currently expect the new limits set by the EPA for three additional PFAS compounds to impact these estimates."", ""Through a separate rule-making in April, US EPA also designated PFOA and PFAS as hazardous substances under CERCLA. As a reminder, we continue to actively advocate and support bipartisan federal legislation that would provide PFAS liability protections under CERCLA for water and wastewater systems as passive receivers of PFAS. Previously, we've disclosed that we remained a party to two settlements so far with 3M and DuPont coming out of the multi-district litigation, or MDL lawsuit. As we shared, we believe this is the best path to recouping the most dollars possible from PFAS manufacturers in an expedient manner for our customers. The MDL Court issued its final approval of the DuPont and 3M settlements in February and March of this year, respectively."", ""The amount of proceeds to be received from each settlement is still pending. Turning to Slide 10. I'll cover the latest regulatory activity in our states. In West Virginia, the commission issued an order authorizing an additional $18 million in annualized revenues effective February 25. We also received an order for $7 million of additional revenue related to our DSIC request, effective March 1st. In Indiana, the commission issued an order authorizing an additional $66 million in annualized revenues effective over a phased three step process through May 2025. They also approved a new rate design that provides 1,500 gallons of water usage at no additional cost above the fixed monthly customer charge for all water customers. The change will allow Indiana American to provide low cost basic water service for customers on fixed incomes that use a lower volume of water than the typical residential customer."", ""With this change, the cost for the typical residential water customer using 1,500 gallons will be approximately $20 per month. This is just one example of the many innovative ways we are addressing customer affordability. Turning to active cases. You can see we have general rate cases in progress in eight jurisdictions. All of these cases are centered around the capital investments we've made and will continue to make in these states. Our cases in California, Virginia, New Jersey and Illinois are progressing well as expected. In Illinois, the next milestones in the case will be staff and intervener testimony in May, followed by our rebuttal in June. In New Jersey, the next milestones in the case will be staff and intervener testimony in July, followed by our rebuttal in September and evidentiary hearings in October."", ""In Kentucky, we expect an order any day now as the statutory deadline for the commission to act is May 7th. Interim rates in Kentucky were implemented in February 6th. In Pennsylvania, we expect new rates to be effective in August for the case we filed last year that was driven by $1 billion of vital capital investment. The next milestones expected in the case are a proposed decision from the ALJ likely in May and a final order in July. We expect a constructive outcome that reflects the state of Pennsylvania's long standing support for needed capital investments that improves infrastructure for the benefit of customers. And finally, on the rate case front, just yesterday, we filed general rate cases in Iowa and Tennessee. And last week, we filed notice with the Missouri Public Service Commission that we plan to file a case by midyear."", ""On the legislative front, three state bills were passed and signed that will incrementally help water utilities in those states in the areas of lead service line replacements, expediency of approval of smaller acquisitions and fire hydrant maintenance. To show the magnitude of our regulatory execution efforts, you can see on Slide 11 that we have $98 million in annualized new revenues in rates since January. This includes $43 million from general rate cases and step increases and $55 million from infrastructure surcharges. In total, we have $636 million of total annualized revenue request pending. Moving to Slide 12 and a topic you've heard us cover just about every quarter, customer affordability. As we've said, we are very focused on balancing customer affordability and the magnitude of the system investments that are needed."", ""Our industry and our company are in very good relative positions in terms of affordability or wallet share. Our system wide average residential water customer bill is $55 to $65 per month. The investment plan we have in place will allow us to stay within our consolidated target for residential water bills of 1% or less of median household income. That analysis is supported by US Census Bureau data specific to the geographies we serve that project rising levels of median household income in these communities. At the same time, we realize we must continue to involve our strategies around rate design and programs to assist our customers who are challenged with affordability, as I described earlier, with what we're doing in Indiana as an example."", ""As another example, just last month, California American Water announced an additional $8 million in bill relief for customers who faced financial hardship due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This funding comes through a California program that utilizes Federal American Rescue Plan Act funds. This brings the total benefit for challenged California American Water customers to $15 million under the program. We also continue to strongly advocate for a permanent federally funded low income water assistance program, similar to what's been in place for many years for electric and gas utility customers. And we are continuing our focus on technology, efficiencies of scale and cost management to deliver on customer affordability, especially as regulatory demands, such as the final PFAS rule and the proposed lead and copper rule improvement increased capital needs."", 'Lastly, Slide 13 shows that our state and corporate leaders and their teams did a great job in the first quarter executing on our increased capital plan. It required significant effort to safely and efficiently deliver the hundreds of projects that improved our systems and drove capital investment higher by almost $200 million in the quarter compared to the same period last year. This result keeps us on pace to hit our goal of approximately $3.1 billion of capital investment in 2024. The pie charts on the right side of the page speak to timely recovery and the nature of our investments across our footprint. As we share with regulators and legislators, our capital spending is driven by a risk based strategy, balanced by a focus on affordability.', 'For us, infrastructure renewal includes the basics of replacing old or damaged pipe but it also includes proactively meeting our standards related to lead service line replacements. As we have said many times before, we firmly believe removing the risk of lead service lines over time is the right thing to do for the health and safety of our customers. Through capital recovery mechanisms and forward test years, we can reduce regulatory lag and lessen the reliance on general rate cases. This not only helps us to seek to earn our allowed return but also to mitigate the size of general rate increases for our customers. We expect at least 75% of capital investments over the next five years to be recoverable through infrastructure mechanisms and through the use of forward test years, which is the key to driving modest bill increases and to unlocking a more consistent annual earnings growth pattern for the long term.', ""With that, I'll hand it over to John to cover our financial results and plans in further detail. John?"", ""John Griffith: Thank you, Cheryl. And good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 15, I'll provide some further insights into our financial results for the quarter. Earnings were $0.95 per share for the quarter, up $0.04 per share versus the same period in 2023. As Cheryl mentioned, we have completed rate cases recently in Indiana and West Virginia in addition to rate outcomes achieved last year and are seeing increased revenues as a result. And looking at O&M, production costs from increased fuel, power and chemicals as well as increased employee related costs caused O&M to increase $0.07 per share. Next, depreciation increased $0.06 per share and long term financing costs increased $0.11 per share, both as expected in support of our investment growth."", 'Long term financing costs include interest on the $1 billion convertible note we issued last June and the $1.4 billion long term senior note issued in February along with $0.04 of dilution related to the $1.7 billion of equity we issued last March. Short term financing provided a benefit of $0.07 per share, primarily from interest earned on the cash reserves we held during the quarter. Other net consists of net unfavorable onetime nonoperating items year-over-year. And finally, as Susan mentioned, we had $0.02 per share of additional interest income from the February 2024 amendment of the seller note related to the sale of HOS. We will continue to break this out quarterly so our investors will be able to track the ongoing growth of American Water from our core regulated strategy without this additional interest income.', ""On Slide 16, you'll see that we successfully closed on the Granite City, Illinois wastewater treatment plant acquisition in the first quarter. This acquisition will help ensure we can provide high quality service to the customers in Granite City we already serve. We continue to be set up for strong growth through acquisitions with over 60,000 customer connections and over $500 million under agreement as of quarter end. Many states in our footprint are contributing to this total, which mirrors the broad based pipeline of opportunities we have in progress across the country. Of the over 60,000 customers represented by signed agreements, nearly 20,000 have already been approved by the State Public Utility Commission. This includes the 15,000 customers in the Butler Area Sewer Authority, or BASA wastewater system acquisition in Pennsylvania."", ""We continue to expect BASA to close in the near future. This also includes the water and wastewater systems in Cape Charles, Virginia, which we closed just last week and marked the second acquisition completed under Virginia's fair market value law enacted in 2020. We look forward to serving our new Cape Charles customers. As we've discussed before and as we lay out on this slide, the environment in Pennsylvania related to acquisitions is undergoing change, which we think is ultimately necessary and positive. We are very confident that the core principles of the original Act 12, fair market value law, will remain in place and continue to have good support since so much consolidation is still needed in Pennsylvania to address the under-investment in infrastructure."", 'In the meantime, closing of current pending transactions will likely take more time than usual. But to be clear, we are confident in our Pennsylvania acquisition pipeline. We are continuing to invest in regulated acquisition opportunities in Pennsylvania driven by the need for system consolidation and upgrading all for the benefit of communities who deserve safe and reliable water and wastewater service. Slide 17 summarizes our successful long-term debt financing completed in February. The offering was for $1.4 billion and included $700 million of 10 year notes at 5.15% and $700 million of 30 year notes at 5.45%. Our treasury team did a very nice job proactively executing on our main financing plan objective for the year amidst a challenging interest rate environment.', ""These proceeds will fund our regulated businesses growth and were used to pay off a maturing senior note and outstanding commercial paper of which we had a zero balance at quarter end. Though the current higher interest rate environment is challenging, we are in a position of strength on a number of fronts in dealing with the challenge. Our strategy of issuing debt at the holding company level allows us to take advantage of our scale and pricing debt issuances, and we will remain proactive in managing risk and achieving a low cost of capital to the benefit of our customers and shareholders. And finally, Slide 18 is a summary of our continued strong financial condition. In March, S&P affirmed our solid single A investment grade credit rating and stable outlook and noted our improved FFO to debt ratio, which followed Moody's affirmation of its rating and outlook for us in January."", ""We are confident our FFO to debt ratio will continue to support our current credit ratings. Our total debt-to-capital ratio as of March 31st net of our $584 million of cash on hand is 56%, which is comfortably within our long term target of less than 60%. In closing, what you've heard today should sound very familiar. Our focus is on execution at every level. We believe our industry leading EPS and dividend growth and ESG leadership will continue to be highly valued and rewarded by investors. We believe these aspects of our business and strategy separate us from all other utilities. And our execution includes the outstanding efforts by our Military Services Group to proudly serve the 18 military installations in our footprint. With that, I'll turn it back over to our operator and take any questions you may have."", 'Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from Richard Sunderland with JPMorgan.', 'See also 15 Best Places to Retire in Ontario and', '10 Best Healthcare Stocks to Buy Under $20.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

We are excited to share some key milestones and provide updates on several areas of the business today. 2024 is off to a solid start, and we remain committed to achieving our strategic objectives while continuing our long track record of solid operational and financial execution. Our company's purpose serving customers and building stronger communities remains at the center of everything we do. I will highlight a few of our key 2024 achievements and then turn the call over to Lisa and Robert to provide more updates as well as additional details relating to our operations financial performance and key regulatory matters. I'll start by highlighting the successful execution of our strategic solar investments. These investments play an important role in our balanced generation portfolio, a portfolio that delivers safe, resilient and reliable energy to our customers. Our final solar project in Wisconsin is near completion, which signifies the culmination of our planned 1.1 gigawatts of solar investment in the state and providing long-term value to our customers. The completion of this investment solidifies our position as the largest owner-operator of solar generation in Wisconsin. When constructing our renewable generation, we follow the Institute for Sustainable Infrastructure framework called Envision. Using this framework, we design projects to enhance environmental, social and economic impacts. I'm pleased to report that so far, we've received platinum Envision certification for 4 of our Wisconsin solar projects. We also made progress on our solar investments in Iowa, our 50-megawatt solar project in Linn County just outside of Cedar Rapids is now operational, and we remain on track for completing the remaining 350 megawatts in the state by the end of 2024. These strategic investments in solar energy are enhancing customer value by providing 0 fuel cost resources, tax credits and creating a more balanced energy mix for our customers. This balance is critical to delivering reliable and resilient energy to our customers. And in addition, these solar projects contribute to local economies by generating new job opportunities and revenues. Another exciting milestone for our company is achieving the halfway mark on our commitment to planting 1 million trees, 1 tree for every electric customer. The effort is to plant these trees is rooted in our commitment to our customers and the communities we proudly serve. Before I turn it over to Lisa, I want to share some exciting recognition we've recently received. We've been named to Newsweek's list of most trustworthy companies in America for the third year in a row. And for the second year in a row, we earn the highly coveted Vets Indexes Employer Award, recognizing our focus on hiring, retaining and supporting our veterans and the military connected community. A special thank you to our dedicated veterans. Thank you for your service. I'm grateful to all our employees for their strong commitment to our customers and their continued dedication to delivering outstanding service to the communities we serve. I'm proud to work for this company and proud of what we have accomplished as a team. Our investment thesis continues to produce consistent performance. We are well positioned for growth and excited for the future. I'll now turn the call over to Lisa."", 'Lisa M. Barton', ""Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. As John stated, we had a solid start to the year, and we are well positioned to achieve our 2024 earnings and growth objectives. Warmer-than-normal temperatures impacted our first quarter earnings, reflecting similar temperatures experienced in the broader region. It is early in the year, and we have focused our efforts to drive efficiencies in the business and have already made progress implementing cost controls and executing on our customer investments in accordance with our plan.As John mentioned, we have a long track record of consistent operational and financial execution, a principal reason for your confidence in Alliant Energy. Delivering on the expectations of our customers, communities, regulators and investors is foundational for Alliant Energy, and we are committed to continuing to evolve and adapt to meet those expectations on a year-over-year basis. Executing on our investment strategy is key to our ongoing success. Building on John's comments about our notable solar progress, we are on track to surpass the 3 gigawatt mark of clean, 0 fuel cost energy resources for our customers. In addition to our utility-scale solar investments, we remain committed to partnering with local businesses interested in hosting solar projects. For example, in Iowa, we recently broke ground on 4 customer-hosted solar projects in Grinell. Alliance Energy operates in business-friendly states that are well positioned for growth and economic development. Recently passed legislation in both states will establish Iowa and Wisconsin for accelerated economic growth opportunities. In Wisconsin, the sales and use tax exemption for data centers supports a traction of these types of customers. The IRA conformance bill aligns federal and state tax policies, enabling a smooth transfer of renewable credits to Wisconsin companies and the electric vehicle bill is intended to advance fleet electrification efforts across the state. In Iowa, two key pieces of legislation were signed into law. The mega project build provides incentives to attract large businesses to our pre-review industrial center in AMES and Big Cedar Industrial Center in Cedar Rapids currently meet the criteria specified in the legislation. The public utilities build makes nuclear and electric storage eligible technologies for advanced ratemaking. This legislation is a clear articulation of the state's support to grow business in the state and to ensure a diverse range of resources are developed to support that growth. I'm proud of our team's impactful and proactive engagement with the legislatures. The implementation of these business-friendly policies will foster an environment conducive to growth opportunities, help us attract new companies to the area and support growth in the communities we serve. Iowa and Wisconsin are open for business and Alliance Energy is here to support not only the customers we currently serve but also to ensure that we are supporting the needs of future customers and community growth across our service territory. Looking ahead, we are evolving and refining our clean energy blueprint. This evaluation is a necessary step as we focus on balancing our energy mix creating greater grid reliability, ensuring customer affordability and addressing MISO's resource adequacy needs. The results of our updated resource plan will be included in our third quarter capital expenditure update. Our open and transparent resource planning process allows us to be nimble in responding and preparing for the needs of our customers and communities. Another key differentiator in the states we serve ensuring our ability to be nimble, support and grow with our customers. Before I turn the call over to Robert, I want to reiterate that we are well positioned to deliver on both customer and investor expectations. We've implemented significant measures to mitigate risk while enhancing reliability. As we continue to execute our strategy, we're uniquely positioned to quickly adapt to a dynamic environment.I would like to echo John's appreciation for our employees who make what we do possible and ensure our continued ability to deliver outstanding value to our customers and meet investor expectations. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Robert."", 'Robert J. Durian', ""Thanks, Lisa. Good morning, everyone. Yesterday, we announced first quarter 2024 earnings of $0.62 per share compared to first quarter 2023 earnings of $0.65 per share. The quarter-over-quarter variances were mainly driven by the successful execution of WPL's customer-focused capital investment program, which supported new electric and gas rates that took effect on January 1, and the higher financing and depreciation expenses associated with such capital investments. However, the quarter-over-quarter variances were also impacted by historically mild temperatures. Our service territory experienced the warmest first quarter on record for both Cedar Rapids and Madison since 2012. Temperature impacts decreased Alliant Energy's earnings by approximately $0.08 per share in the first quarter of 2024. In comparison, temperature impacts decreased Alliant Energy's earnings in the first quarter of 2023 by $0.04 per share. Temperature normalized electric sales to Wisconsin retail customers were relatively flat in the first quarter of 2024. In Iowa, residential sales were higher in the first quarter of 2024 when compared to last year. We continued to experience solid growth in the number of residential customers in both states. However, these positive drivers were offset by decreased electric sales to commercial and industrial customers in Iowa largely due to lower sales to lower-margin cogeneration customers. We continue to make progress with lowering operating expenses to achieve our financial objectives and support customer affordability. In fact, first quarter 2024 other operation and maintenance expenses were almost $15 million less than the first quarter of 2023. Through our diverse generation portfolio, and execution of our robust fuel risk management programs, we are also keeping natural gas and electric energy costs in check. Our natural gas customers benefited from this trend as average retail builds in the first quarter of 2024 were approximately 25% lower than the first quarter of 2023. Turning to cash flows. First quarter 2024 cash flows from operations increased by over $100 million when compared to last year. This increase was primarily due to the timing of WPL's fuel-related cost recoveries and WPL's electric and gas rate increases, which were effective January 1 of this year. Looking forward, we expect continued improvement in our cash flow metrics as a result of the aforementioned drivers as well as increasing levels of tax credit monetization. We recently executed agreements on tax credit transfers that cover both 2024 and '25 credits expected to be generated at WPL and IPO. We are also making progress in executing our $1.7 billion financing plans for 2024, largely to fund our investments in renewable and battery projects and support refinancing $800 million in debt maturities this year. To date, we have issued a $300 million green bond at WPL and refinanced our $300 million term loan at Alliant Energy Finance. Later this quarter, we expect to receive approximately $120 million from the sales of partial interest in West Riverside. And this year, we expect to raise approximately $25 million in equity under our DRIP plan. Finally, I will highlight our regulatory initiatives in progress as well as some regulatory filings we plan to initiate later this year. IPL's rate reviews continue to advance through their procedural schedules. As a reminder, we filed electric and gas rate reviews in Iowa last year. These rate reviews focus on recovery of customer-focused investments in Iowa that support building a more reliable, sustainable and resilient energy future. Strengthening the energy grid as energy demand and extreme weather threats increase and diversifying our generation resources. Last month, interveners in IPL's electric and gas rate review proceeding filed their direct testimony. We were not surprised by the interveners comments as divergent viewpoints are a normal part of the process. We stand by the investments we have made on behalf of our customers and believe in the merits of the case that we put before the Iowa Utilities Board. We look forward to working with the interveners as the process continues. On Slide 10, we have provided the procedural schedule to help monitor the progress of the rate review proceedings. Under Iowa statutes, rate reviews must generally be decided within 10 months after the filing. Therefore, we anticipate a decision in the third quarter of this year. We have requested new rates to be implemented effective October 1. Turning to Wisconsin. We have two pending proceedings in progress. We filed our annual Wisconsin fuel reconciliation for 2023 in the first quarter. At the conclusion of the fuel reconciliation process, we expect to refund over $30 million to our Wisconsin customers. And we requested authority to invest in reliability enhancements at our Riverside Generating Station. We are anticipating decisions from the PSCW on both of these dockets later this year. Turning to our planned regulatory filings in 2024. We expect to make regulatory filings in both Iowa and Wisconsin later this year. For additional renewables and dispatchable resources, following our routine continuous modeling updates of our Clean Energy Blueprint. We expect these projects will enhance reliability as well as further diversify and balance our energy resources to meet customer energy needs. In closing, we are positioning for another year of consistent 5% to 7% growth in adjusted earnings per share. We are reaffirming our 2024 earnings guidance range of $2.99 to $3.13 per share. As a reminder, our guidance is based on constructive and timely outcomes of our regulatory proceedings, execution of cost controls and normal weather in our service territory for the remainder of the year. We will continue to manage our business to mitigate ongoing inflationary pressures, enable operational efficiency and deliver long-term consistency. We very much appreciate the continued support of our company and look forward to meeting with many of you later this month. At this time, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate the question-and-answer session."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions). We will take our first question from Andrew Weisel with Scotiabank.', 'Andrew Marc Weisel', ""Good morning. First, a question on economic development efforts. A lot of good details there. Thank you for the info. I know you have 16 big sites and the new legislation in Wisconsin weighs sales and use tax for data centers and all the other attractive features. I guess qualitatively, what types of customers are you looking to attract? Is it exclusively data centers or other types? And I'm assuming these would be customers with large capacity needs. How do you think about the need for additional generation to service those? And then in timing, any thoughts on how soon we might see announcements?"", 'Lisa M. Barton', ""Great question, and thank you for it. We are open for all types of economic development opportunities in our territory. We have had a fair amount of success with respect to biofuels, great biofuel companies have located in our service territory, particularly in Iowa as well as manufacturing. Data centers are also potential customers for us as we look towards the future. One of the things that I think is a real strategic advantage for customers locating in both Iowa and Wisconsin is the fact that we do not have a litigated IRP process. That means we can be very nimble in adapting to the needs of our customers that choose to locate in our service territory. Because we use the clean energy blueprint, it's our open and transparent process of providing discussions with respect to generation, it's not through any kind of formal process or review that other states have."", 'Andrew Marc Weisel', 'Okay. Great. And timing?', 'Lisa M. Barton', ""So we're in the process this year in both Wisconsin and in Iowa of reviewing our Clean Energy Blueprint. So that's something that we are currently in the process of and we'll have any updates with respect to our capital forecast at the end of the third quarter."", 'Andrew Marc Weisel', ""Okay. Great. Next, I want to ask about the agreement you've entered to sell the tax credit. Can you quantify that? You mentioned you'll generate around $400 million this year. Are you fully committed for about $400 million this year and next?"", 'Robert J. Durian', ""Yes. Great question. This is Robert. So yes, just to give you a sense of where we've been with tax credit transfers, we really see this as a great opportunity to both lower customer costs because we'll be reducing the carrying cost for our tax credit carryforwards. It also provides a lot of cash flows, as you indicated, which helps reduce some of the external financing requirements as well as improve our FFO to debt metrics. We have completed the sales of all of the 2023 generating tax credits. I think of that as roughly $120-some million. And then as you think about 2024, 2025 and going forward, it's going to continue to increase. What we've indicated is roughly somewhere north of $200 million for 2024 tax credits. Growing to somewhere between $300 million to $400 million in 2025. As we continue to build out the solar projects that was mentioned by Lisa as well as continue to implement battery projects that have ITCs associated with them, those will continue to grow. And so we feel very well positioned. The team has done an excellent job of working with different counterparties and negotiating very what I would say fair rates that will be, like I said, cost-effective for our customers. We're also monitoring different guidance that comes from the treasury the IRS periodically. And just more recently, there's some more flexibility with normalization rules on ITC. So the team is currently evaluating might that provide some additional opportunities for us when it relates to PTCs versus ITCs for some projects."", 'Andrew Marc Weisel', ""Very good. One more, if I can squeeze it in. Any update on the timing for approvals for your proposed energy dome? I think you're waiting to hear about a DOE grant, but with Columbia slated to retire in mid-2026, how does that timing look?"", 'Robert J. Durian', ""Yes, I would expect that sometime later this year. We do have to file for regulatory approval in the State of Wisconsin for that through the PSCW. And so Normally, that will take up to a year to get completed. And so expect the filings to be made later this year and then hopefully, we'll learn by early 2025, the completion of that."", 'Andrew Marc Weisel', 'Great. A lot of good things to look forward to in the coming months. Thank you very much.', 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions). We will take our next question from Paul Fremont with Ladenburg.', 'Paul Basch Michael Fremont', 'Thank you very much. In the -- in the advanced ratemaking proceeding, I think you reached a partial settlement in Iowa. If you were to settle, would you expect a settlement to be a partial settlement or unanimous settlement?', 'Lisa M. Barton', ""Good morning, Paul. Good to have you here today. So with respect to -- if we were to have a settlement on the rate review in Iowa, we would expect that to be a total settlement rather than a partial settlement. But currently, the time to watch is mid-May to mid-June. That's the settlement window opportunity. The advanced ratemaking that you were referencing, that was last year, the determination as to whether we're at the 10.25% or the $10.75 million that we had in the last settlement would likely be a part of any settlement that we would have."", 'Paul Basch Michael Fremont', ""Great. And then my other question is you mentioned that there's no required IRP in Iowa. Was there testimony at some point earlier this year before the commission, where I think parties may have recommended that Iowa implement an IRP process? And maybe if you could tell us where that stands."", 'Lisa M. Barton', 'Good memory, Paul. Yes, it was actually part of some legislation that was circulated and that did not go forward. Iowa recognizes the need for the utilities in Iowa to be flexible with respect to the generation. And in fact, we saw the advanced ratemaking and expansion to batteries and to nuclear investments on a going-forward basis.', 'Operator', 'Miss Gille, there are no further questions at this time.', 'Susan Trapp Gille', 'With no more questions, this concludes our call. A replay will be available on our investor website. We thank you for your continued support of Alliant Energy and feel free to contact me with any follow-up questions.', 'Operator', ""This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation.""]"

The variety of such foods that are being sold in the United States is huge and includes anything from olive oil to salmon. There are many food items that are not healthy; hence, one should be wary of their intake of processed meat items like sausages, salami, pâté, and beef burgers because they are frequently heavy in salt and fat. The healthiest option is to consume white meat without any skin; white flesh from chicken is regarded by many experts as the leanest and cleanest meat to consume.

PEP and The Coca-Cola Company KO for the top spot is endless. While investors are always perplexed about choosing either of these stocks over the other, the two global soft drinks biggies have attracted investors for several reasons, including expansion efforts and shareholder returns.', 'The beverage soft drinks industry has evolved in the recent years, with consumers looking for healthier alternatives, moving away from the initial charm of carbonated drinks. With this, the industry’s two heavyweights — Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, commanding market caps of $267.1 billion and $241.2 billion, respectively — have expanded their product portfolios to include juices, bottled water, functional beverages like sports and energy drinks, and coffee and tea.Coca-Cola has retained its position as a market leader in the global non-alcoholic beverages industry, with more than 40% market share. With a key focus on non-alcoholic ready-to-drink beverages, Coca-Cola has expanded its portfolio over the years, comprising brands like Powerade, SmartWater, Minute Maid, BODYARMOR, Costa, Dasani, dogadan, FUZE TEA and fairlife.Coming to its arch-rival, PepsiCo has slowly diluted its position in the beverage industry, expanding in the complimentary convenient food segment, including snacking brands like Frito-Lay, Lay’s Chips, Cheetos and a range of Quaker cereals. Then again, the company’s beverage range includes brands like Gatorade, Pepsi-Cola, Tropicana juices, Mountain Dew, 7UP and Mirinda, garnering a market share of around 20% in the soft drinks industry.Based on market share and market cap, Coca-Cola commands a lead over its non-alcoholic beverage competitors, generating nearly 50% of the industry’s global sales. However, PepsiCo continues to claim the second place in the industry.Although both soft drink behemoths are attractive long-term buys, with the first-quarter 2024 results of these companies reported in about two weeks, it is ideal to evaluate these stocks on the earnings ground.', 'Both PepsiCo and Coca-Cola posted strong results for first-quarter 2024, notching neck-to-neck earnings per share growth rates of 7.3% and 7%, respectively. These also reflect a positive earnings surprise of 5.9% for PepsiCo and 4.4% for Coca-Cola compared with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Meanwhile, revenues improved 2.3% year over year for PepsiCo and 3% for Coca-Cola, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Revenue growth for both beverage behemoths mainly resulted from the recently implemented price increases across all markets.Looking ahead, both companies have provided positive revenue and earnings outlooks, anticipating continued momentum in their businesses. PepsiCo expects at least 4% year-over-year organic revenue growth for 2024, with core constant-currency EPS growth of at least 8%. PEP anticipates 2024 core EPS to increase 7%, indicating continued gains from operational efficiencies.Coca-Cola plans organic revenue growth of 8-9% for 2024, with comparable currency-neutral earnings per share estimated to increase 11-13% year over year. The company anticipates 2024 comparable earnings per share to improve 4-5%.', 'From the earnings and outlook perspective, both PEP and KO have scored full marks. Additionally, analysts’ earnings expectations for both companies have moved higher following their results, indicating positive near-term prospects.PepsiCo’s EPS estimates for 2024 moved up by a penny to $8.16 per share in the last 30 days. Notably, PEP’s 2024 revenues are projected to grow 3.4% year over year to $94.6 billion and EPS are expected to ascent 7.1% year over year to $8.16.Then again, Coca-Cola’s EPS estimates for 2024 moved up by a penny to $2.82 in the past seven days. KO’s 2024 revenues are expected to increase 0.1% year over year to $45.8 billion and EPS is likely to advance 4.8% year over year to $2.82 per share.Therefore, we can clearly see that PepsiCo and Coca-Cola have seen analysts raising estimates after their earnings releases. However, PepsiCo has higher expected growth rates for sales and earnings for this year. Consequently, PepsiCo currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Meanwhile, Coca-Cola currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.', 'Following the earnings outcomes, we have seen upward share price revision trends for Coca-Cola and PepsiCo. Notably, the PepsiCo stock has rallied 2.5% after reporting positive earnings results on Apr 23, 2024. The Coca-Cola stock moved up 0.4% in the last two days after reporting earnings on Apr 30, 2024.', '\xa0', 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', '\xa0', 'Both companies have registered growth above the Zacks Beverage – Soft Drinks industry in the year-to-date period. Notably, PepsiCo and Coca-Cola have risen 3.3% and 5.2% year to date, respectively, compared with the industry’s growth of 2.9%.', 'In the valuation chart below, we see that KO and PEP have similar forward price-to-earnings multiples. PepsiCo trades at 20.93X, which is below its 5-year median of 23.65X, and Coca-Cola is trading at 21.54X, also below its 5-year median of 23.88X. A lower trading multiple than its average indicates that these stocks have good scope for an upside.', '\xa0', 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', '\xa0', 'Meanwhile, the Zacks Beverage – Soft Drinks industry currently trades at a 20.98X forward price-to-earnings multiple, which is essentially above PepsiCo’s multiple and below Coca-Cola’s. Hence, PepsiCo looks relatively cheaper than the broader industry.', 'The earnings season is an exciting time to track and reevaluate the stocks in one’s portfolio. While the long-term fundamentals of both PepsiCo and Coca-Cola look promising, PepsiCo has an edge over Coca-Cola post their first-quarter results based on its positive estimate revisions, the Zacks Rank and cheaper valuation.However, that does not mean that the KO stock has lost sheen. Looking fundamentally, Coca-Cola stands tall amid its non-alcoholic beverage peers.

From 2003 to 2023, the benchmark S&P 500 has registered double digits annual returns thirteen times.', 'Investors at the stock market have made money from this growth by piling into profitable stocks like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). However, even as these tech stocks become the hottest equities, old-school value investing has yet to lose charm. Value investors who like to invest in profitable companies with high gross margins and net income have made shrewd investments in businesses with a solid track record over these twenty years. For example instead of NVDA, we identified the cheapest AI stock that is trading at less than 5 times market value excluding cash and investments using the value investing approach.', 'The present condition of the stock market is better understood in the context of a recent research report by investment advisory Deutsche Bank. The report underlines that the seven biggest companies in the S&P 500 now have a combined market capitalization that make these firms the second biggest stock market in the world, almost double the size of the Japanese market that is in fourth position. Jim Reid, the head of global economics and thematic research at the advisory, has warned that this makes the US market most concentrated in history.\xa0', 'The fortunes of these firms are set to rise even further as AI hype and rate cut expectations serve to increase interest in growth stocks. Businesses are investing heavily in AI tools to keep pace with industry demand in this regard. Satya Nadella, the CEO of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), recently highlighted the role that he expected AI to play in changing work trends in the coming years and months. He made these comments during the second quarter earnings call at the end of January.\xa0', ""“A growing body of evidence makes clear the role AI will play in transforming work. Our own research, as well as external studies, show as much as 70% improvement in productivity, using generative AI for specific work tasks, and overall early Copilot for Microsoft 365 users were 29% faster in the series of tasks, like searching, writing, and summarizing. Two months in, we have seen faster adoption than either our E3 or E5 suites as enterprises, like Dentsu, Honda, Pfizer, all deploy Copilot to their employees, and we are expanding availability to organizations of all sizes. We're also seeing a Copilot ecosystem begin to emerge ISVs like Atlassian, Mural, and Trello, as well as customers like Air India, Bayer, and Siemens have all built plug-ins for specific lines of business that extend Copilot's capabilities.”"", 'Our Methodology', 'To select stocks for this list, we used the FinViz stock screener to identify companies with high gross margins and net income.

Our view on the cycle risk was simple – the long-term growth outlook was tremendous given the proliferation of electronics and software in everyday objects, and the downturn had already begun, and a healthy amount of it was known. We ignored the near-term outlook for profits, assuming they would be down substantially. It turned out that the downturn was more severe than most other investors or industry observers had forecasted. Thus, semiconductor stocks in general remain depressed, and our investments have so far shown mixed results.', 'However, we have not changed our view on the long-term attractiveness of the industry segments in which they operate, nor on the normalized earning power of these companies five to ten years out.

For my remarks today, I'd like to briefly review some of our key performance drivers and then discuss a few of our more differentiated development programs, which have the potential to drive sustainable long-term growth for the company and value for our shareholders. After my remarks, George will provide an update on our pipeline, Marion will then review our commercial performance, and Chris will discuss our financial results. First quarter 2024 revenues grew 7% after excluding last year's revenue contribution from our COVID antibodies."", 'Growth was primarily driven by Sanofi collaboration revenues and Libtayo global net product sales, which grew by 14% and 45%, respectively. Dupixent global net product sales were $3.1 billion, up 24%, reflecting strong growth across all approved indications. EYLEA HD generated $200 million in its second full quarter on the U.S. market, outperforming recent launches in the anti-VEGF category. Now with a permanent J-code in place, improving payer coverage, broad prescriber familiarity and satisfaction with the EYLEA HD clinical profile and direct-to-consumer TV promotion underway, we continue to position EYLEA HD as the new standard of care for retinal diseases. Shifting to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD, where Regeneron and Sanofi have two differentiated opportunities to transform the treatment paradigm for patients living with this debilitating disease.', 'As announced in February, our sBLA for Dupixent for the treatment of COPD with Type 2 inflammation was accepted by the FDA for priority review with the June 27 PDUFA date. During its review of our submission, the FDA has requested additional efficacy analyses, including an information request received earlier this week regarding subpopulations from the BOREAS and NOTUS pivotal studies. Our analyses across these requested patient subgroups indicate a consistent and clinically meaningful reduction in COPD exacerbations. While the FDA has requested these analyses be submitted by the end of May, we anticipate providing them substantially sooner. We and Sanofi are confident that these additional analyses strongly support the approval of Dupixent in eosinophilic COPD.', 'If the FDA determines that they need additional time to review these analyses, a decision on the sBLA could be delayed for up to three months. We and our partner Sanofi are preparing for a launch that many pulmonologists, respiratory key opinion leaders and their patients are eagerly anticipating. If approved, Dupixent would be the only biologic therapy for COPD and the first new treatment approach for this disease in more than a decade. There is a high unmet need in COPD with Type 2 inflammation with approximately 300,000 eligible patients in the United States and another approximately 300,000 eligible patients in the EU and Japan, where we are also seeking regulatory approvals. Turning to itepekimab, our IL-33 antibody, which is being evaluated in former smokers with COPD regardless of the eosinophilic phenotype, we remain on track to report results and enable potential global regulatory filings in the second half of next year.', 'Itepekimab can potentially address up to 1 million patients in the G7 countries, while China also represents a significant opportunity. We are very excited about potentially bringing these important new therapies to COPD patients, while expanding our commercial respiratory franchise. In a moment, George will describe another key opportunity in our pipeline involving Dupixent in combination with our BCMAxCD3 bispecific antibody, linvoseltamab, which we believe has the potential to address any severe allergy and allow the millions of severe allergy sufferers to stop living in fear of an accidental exposure. Moving from linvoseltamab in severe allergy to its differentiated opportunity in multiple myeloma, where it is currently under FDA and EMA review in the relapsed/refractory setting.', ""In our registration enabling data set, while cross-trial comparisons caveats apply, we believe linvoseltamab represents a best-in-class opportunity, because it has the highest objective response rates and complete response rates at similar follow-up observed across the BMA bispecific class to date, requires the least number of days in the hospital compared to other drugs in the category, and is the only BCMAxCD3 agent currently under review or already approved by the FDA that evaluated every four week dosing. If approved, we believe these are all important considerations for patients, caregivers, providers and payers that could drive linvoseltamab adoption. In closing, I'm excited and energized by the differentiated opportunities in our pipeline, which now has over 35 programs in clinical development, spanning many distinct therapeutic areas."", ""Our commercial team continues to execute well and is building momentum in competitive categories, and we continue to deploy capital with the goal of driving shareholder returns over time. With that, I'll turn the call over to George."", ""George Yancopoulos: Thanks, Len. Since Len covered the status of the Dupixent and itepekimab programs in COPD in great detail, I'd like to start with a bit more about our innovative treatment approach for severe allergies, a first-ever combination of an immunomodulatory antibody that is Dupixent with a bispecific antibody. Despite the remarkable benefit demonstrated by Dupixent across multiple diseases characterized by allergic or Type 2 inflammation, Dupixent alone does not immediately reverse severe allergies by itself. These allergies are caused by high levels of an immunoglobulin class known as IgE made by long-lived plasma cells. This has caused some to refer to the E in IgE as E for evil. Although Dupixent will prevent formation of new IgE plasma cells, it does not eliminate those that have already formed."", 'Regeneron scientists have shown that these allergy-causing IgE plasma cells can be rapidly eliminated with a short course of treatment with our bispecific antibody known as linvoseltamab, while Dupixent treatment will then prevent these cells from returning, as recently highlighted in our publication in Science Translational Medicine. We have commenced our proof of concept clinical trial to explore the potential for this combination approach to eliminate severe food allergy. We are hoping to see initial observations from this small study later this year, which will inform next steps. Moving on to oncology and Libtayo combinations. Early clinical results of our LAG-3 antibody, fianlimab, in combination with Libtayo suggest that these antibodies represent one of the most promising checkpoint inhibitor combinations in clinical development.', 'Recall, fianlimab-Libtayo demonstrated potential for best-in-class efficacy in first-line metastatic melanoma with objective response rates of approximately 60% across three independent cohorts from our first-in-human study with a safety profile that is similar to that seen with anti-PD-1 monotherapy. With longer-term follow-up, these initial responses continue to deepen, including patients converting into complete responses. We look forward to presenting updated results from these expansion cohorts in the second half of this year. Encouraged by these initial results, last year, we initiated a Phase 2/3 study of the combination of fianlimab and Libtayo in first-line metastatic melanoma. This study is enrolling faster than expected and will now be conducted solely as a Phase 3 study with the final analysis to be reported during 2025.', 'These pivotal melanoma data will inform whether fianlimab and Libtayo have the potential to emerge as a new standard of care in melanoma. Next, to our bispecifics for hematology oncology. Regarding odronextamab, our CD20xCD3 bispecific, as announced in March, we received complete response letters from the FDA for our BLA for relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma and relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The only approvability issue was related to the limited enrollment of these confirmatory trials, which we intend to address as we continue to enroll patients in these studies. The EU decision on odronextamab application is expected in the second half of this year. Moving on to linvoseltamab. As Len noted, this bispecific continues to demonstrate a potentially best-in-class profile in late-line myeloma in terms of efficacy, safety, dosing and hospitalization burden.', ""In an oral presentation at the recent AACR Medical Meeting, we presented results of an 11-month median follow-up of 117 patients, a 71% objective response rate with 46% of patients achieving a complete response or better. We are planning to present updated 14-month follow-up results at the upcoming EHA meeting, in which we anticipate observing a further deepening of responses. Regarding the ongoing FDA review, we believe the confirmatory study will be sufficiently enrolled to support approval. We're also evaluating linvoseltamab in earlier stages of myeloma and in precursor conditions, such as smoldering myeloma and monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance, or MGUS. Next, to bispecifics for solid tumors. Our costimulatory bispecific antibodies are being tested in numerous studies, including as monotherapies as well as in combination with CD3 bispecifics and with Libtayo."", 'Our EGFRxCD28 bispecific in combination with Libtayo, we are planning to present updated dose escalation results in an oral presentation at ASCO. Most notably, in microsatellite stable colorectal cancer, a tumor historically unresponsive to immunotherapy, EGFRxCD28 in combination with Libtayo demonstrated antitumor activity. Regarding safety, to date, we have not observed severe immune-related adverse events with this agent at our recommended Phase 2 dose. Based on these data, we are enrolling dose expansion cohorts, testing our EGFRxCD28 costim bispecific plus Libtayo in various cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer with or without EGF receptor mutations, microsatellite stable colorectal cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and others.', ""Onto our PSMAxCD28 costimulatory bispecific, which is already demonstrating promising activity in prostate cancer in combination with Libtayo. We will soon initiate combination treatment of our PSMAxCD28 costim bispecific with our PSMAxCD3 bispecific, which based on preclinical studies, may maintain efficacy but with better tolerability. We're also evaluating our MUC16xCD28 costimulatory bispecific with ubamatamab, our MUC16xCD3 bispecific as well as with Libtayo, our CD3xCD28 costim with linvoseltamab for myeloma and our CD22xCD28 costim with odronextamab for lymphoma. Moving on to our classical hematology pipeline. Our C5 approach involves a first-in-class combination of an sRNA with an antibody for a more complete target blockade. And our initial clinical data supports potential best-in-class efficacy in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, or PNH."", 'Results from the preliminary cohort of the PNH Phase 3 study will be presented at the EHA conference in June, with additional results expected later this year. In addition to PNH and myasthenia gravis, which are already enrolling their respective pivotal trials, we are planning on extending the systemic combination approach to geographic atrophy in dry AMD with the first pivotal study in GA expected to get underway this year. We are also anticipating proof of concept data later this year for our two complementary Factor XI antibodies in the setting of prevention of venous thromboembolism after knee replacement surgery. Depending on these data, one or both of these antibodies could remain on a rapid path to registrational studies, which could begin by late 2024 or early 2025.', 'Our first-in-class antibody to TMPRSS6, a genetically validated target for iron overload diseases such as beta-thalassemia, is also making progress. This antibody has potential to meaningfully reduce toxic organ iron in patients for whom iron chelation is inadequate or intolerable. Updated proof of mechanism data in healthy volunteers will be presented at the upcoming EHA conference. These results demonstrated deep sustained reductions in serum iron and robust induction of the liver hormone, hepcidin, supporting the potential to release iron from organs. We are on track to start a Phase 2 proof of concept study in beta-thalassemia patients in the second half of the year. Moving to obesity. Our most advanced approach is designed to address potential negative consequences of widespread use of GLP/GIP receptor agonists.', 'As has been widely reported, the profound weight loss caused by these agents unfortunately can also result in substantial loss of muscle, which is particularly concerning in older obese patients. Our antibodies to myostatin related pathways may prevent this muscle loss. Indeed, our data in obese non-human primates show that combining semaglutide with trevogrumab, our antibody targeting myostatin, with or without garetosmab, our antibody targeting activin A or myostatin 2, demonstrated a comparable reduction in body weight at week 20 relative to semaglutide monotherapy, but with improved quality of weight loss, resulting in more fat loss while preserving or even increasing lean mass. Part A of our proof of concept study in healthy volunteers intended to demonstrate safety of a higher dose of trevogrumab has completed enrollment.', 'Note that over 400 subjects, including healthy volunteers and sarcopenic patients, have been dosed with trevogrumab throughout its clinical development with no meaningful safety or tolerability concerns observed to date. Part B of the study, which will evaluate muscle preservation antibodies in combination with semaglutide in obese participants, remains on track to start enrolling midyear. Assuming a reasonable pace of enrollment, we expect to report top line results, including changes in body weight, fat mass and muscle mass in second half of 2025. I will conclude with our genetic medicines effort. At the upcoming ASGCT conference, we will present updated data from our DB-OTO gene therapy program for genetic hearing loss. The first patient treated with this therapy, a 10-month-old girl, who is profoundly deaf at baseline, now at 24 weeks after treatment, had hearing in the normal range.', ""And the second treated patient is following a similar trajectory of improvement through earlier stages of follow-up. We are aiming to enroll several more patients this year, potentially enabling regulatory submissions by the end of next year. And we also look forward to bringing additional auditory gene therapy programs to the clinic in the coming years with the potential to address more common forms of monogenic hearing loss. Our collaboration with Intellia on CRISPR gene editing continues to advance. We've begun to enroll patients in the Phase 3 MAGNITUDE study of [Intellia-2001] (ph) for a lead indication of TTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy, the first in vivo CRISPR program clear to enter Phase 3 studies in the United States. We're also on track to be the first to use CRISPR technology to insert a corrective gene in vivo for a deficiency disease."", ""We have now achieved clearance from both the U.S. and EU authorities for our insertion program for Factor 9, and we have already enrolled initial patients into the leading portion of this program. Moving on to our sRNA collaboration with Alnylam, which has not only demonstrated successful silencing of genes in the liver, but also for the first time for siRNA in the brain. Additionally, we're excited about potentially initiating later this year a potentially pivotal study for ALN-SOD treatment in ALS patients with SOD-1 mutations. With that overview, I will turn the call over to Marion."", ""Marion McCourt: Thanks, George. Our results in the first quarter demonstrate the strong performance of our commercial portfolio and future growth opportunity. We continue to strengthen and expand our leadership positions across our inline brands and we are preparing for potential upcoming launches. I'll start with our anti-VEGF franchise and the ongoing launch progress of EYLEA HD. First quarter U.S. net sales grew 63% sequentially to $200 million, as real world experience with efficacy and safety continues to grow. EYLEA HD is delivering on its promise of extending the duration between treatments with the majority of patients achieving this goal. Retina specialists are highly satisfied with EYLEA HD, as demonstrated by prescribing across a broad range of patients."", ""To date, most EYLEA HD patients are being switched from existing medicines, most notably EYLEA and [fasinumab] (ph), and we are also seeing an increase in treatment-naive patients. For the quarter, EYLEA HD and EYLEA together secured 45% of the anti-VEGF category share. Combined U.S. net sales were $1.4 billion, which includes a reduction in wholesaler inventory of approximately $40 million. This reflects the sequential drawdown of EYLEA inventory that was partially offset by a modest increase in EYLEA HD inventory ahead of the permanent J-code on April 1. Since launch, our team has made significant progress to enhance reimbursement and market access for EYLEA HD. The permanent J-code has increased prescribers' reimbursement confidence reflected by increased use among existing customers as well as a step up in new customers ordering for the first time."", ""We're very encouraged by EYLEA HD uptake despite a different payer market today compared to when EYLEA was launched more than a decade ago. For example, while more than 80% of medical benefit lives are now covered for EYLEA HD, increases in utilization management or step edits are impacting all branded products. We are also highly focused on educating patients about the potential for EYLEA HD to deliver best-in-category vision and safety benefits with fewer injections. In mid-March, we began our direct-to-consumer TV campaign designed to raise brand awareness among treatment-experienced and treatment-naive patients. Since initiating the DTC campaign, retina specialists have reported a significant increase in patients actively asking about and being prescribed EYLEA HD."", ""In summary, the EYLEA HD's launch outperformed expectations, and we are on track to establish EYLEA HD as the new standard of care for retinal disease. Turning now to Dupixent, where first quarter global net sales grew 25% on a constant currency basis to $3.1 billion. In the U.S., net sales grew 17% to $2.2 billion, driven by continued robust demand and the impact of customary first quarter seasonality dynamics, including annual resets of insurance plans. Dupixent is the clear leader in new-to-brand prescription share across all five FDA approved indications and leads in total biologic prescriptions in four of its approved indications. More than 850,000 patients are currently on therapy worldwide and three Dupixent indications have achieved blockbuster status: atopic dermatitis, asthma and nasal polyps."", ""Across all three of these indications, Dupixent is competitively differentiated based on its clinical profile, depth of clinical experience and potential to be prescribed to very young patients as young as six months in the case of atopic dermatitis. We continue to see great progress with our recent launches in EoE, Dupixent's GI indication and prurigo nodularis in dermatology. Patient initiations across both indications continue to reach all-time highs. And in late January, Dupixent was approved in pediatric EoE, the brand's fourth pediatric indication. Early launch indicators are positive, as Dupixent is transforming the standard of care for these children aged 1 to 11 as it has for adults and adolescents with the EoE. In addition to its approved indications, there's great potential for Dupixent in an increasing list of additional Type 2 diseases, including COPD."", ""If approved, Dupixent will achieve two important firsts: the first biologic medicine for COPD, and also the first new treatment in more than a decade for this devastating disease. In the U.S., approximately 300,000 patients with uncontrolled COPD show evidence of Type 2 inflammation. If approved, we will rapidly -- we'll work to rapidly establish the unique clinical benefits of Dupixent, activate physician adoption, motivate patients to seek treatment and also advance access and affordability. We are confident that COPD will drive meaningful growth for Dupixent if approved in this indication and see an additional opportunity to address patient unmet need with itepekimab, our investigational IL-33 antibody designed to help COPD patients who are former smokers."", ""With significant runway for growth in existing and potential new indications, we are confident in Dupixent's ongoing growth trajectory. And finally to Libtayo, in the first quarter, global net sales were $264 million, up 44% on a constant currency basis from the prior year, driven by our dual focus in skin and lung cancers. In non-melanoma skin cancer, Libtayo continues to lead the immunotherapy category in CSCC and BCC with opportunity for continued market growth. In lung cancer, we are making steady progress in capturing category share in both monotherapy and chemotherapy combination patients. Our oncology team is also preparing for the upcoming August 22 linvoseltamab PDUFA date. Recent data reinforces that linvoseltamab has the potential to be best in class for late-stage myeloma patients, and we look forward to its potential launch."", ""In summary, our commercial team continues to bring important medicines to patients across an expanding range of diseases. We are focused on differentiating our medicines to increase category share and drive market growth. Potential upcoming launches across our portfolio provide the opportunity to extend the benefits of our medicines to even more patients. And with that, I'll pass the call to Chris."", ""Chris Fenimore: Thank you, Marion. My comments today on Regeneron's financial results and outlook will be on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Regeneron delivered solid financial results in the first quarter of 2024. Excluding contributions from our COVID antibodies, total revenues increased 7% year-over-year to $3.1 billion, primarily driven by continued sales growth and margin expansion from Dupixent and strong global sales growth from Libtayo. First quarter diluted net income per share was $9.55 on net income of $1.1 billion. Moving to collaboration revenue. First quarter ex U.S. net sales of EYLEA and EYLEA HD, known as EYLEA 8 mg outside the U.S., were $849 million, up 2% on a constant currency basis versus the prior year."", ""Total Bayer collaboration revenue was $356 million, of which $334 million related to our share of net profits outside the U.S. Total Sanofi collaboration revenue grew 14% in the first quarter to $910 million. Our share of collaboration profit was $804 million, an increase of 26% versus the prior year, driven by Dupixent's continued volume growth and improving margins. Reimbursement for manufacturing of commercial supply, a component of Sanofi collaboration revenue, was $106 million for the quarter, which is expected to be the lowest of the year. On a full year basis, due to higher Dupixent volumes, we expect the amount of these reimbursements to be comparable to 2023. The Sanofi development balance was approximately $2.2 billion at the end of the first quarter."", 'We anticipate this balance will be fully reimbursed by the end of 2026, which we expect will result in a significant step up in our Sanofi collaboration profits thereafter. Before moving to expenses, I will mention that despite lower volumes, U.S. Praluent sales in the first quarter reflected a gross to net adjustment related to a true-up of rebates due to an adverse change in payer coverage. We now expect U.S. net sales of Praluent to be modestly higher in 2024 as compared to 2023, primarily due to this adjustment. Now to our operating expenses. First quarter R&D expense grew 17% year-over-year to $1.1 billion, reflecting continued investment in our robust pipeline. SG&A grew 13% from the prior year to $544 million in the first quarter, driven by investment to support the launch of EYLEA HD, including direct-to-consumer promotion, as well as higher headcount and related costs primarily for our ongoing international commercial expansion.', 'First quarter gross margin on net product sales was approximately 89%, which was impacted by ongoing start-up costs for our fill/finish manufacturing facility. First quarter COCM was $193 million, reflecting a decline of 22% compared to the prior year, primarily due to lower Dupixent drug substance manufacturing costs. Now to cash flow and the balance sheet. Regeneron generated $1.4 billion in free cash flow in the first quarter and ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities less debt of approximately $14.8 billion. We repurchased approximately $300 million of our shares in the first quarter and had approximately $1.2 billion available for repurchases under our February 2023 authorization at the end of the first quarter. This morning, we also announced a new $3 billion share repurchase program, which provides us with additional flexibility to continue returning capital to shareholders over time, and we remain buyers of our shares.', ""Finally, we have made some minor changes to our full year 2024 financial guidance. A complete summary of our latest full year guidance is available in our press release issued earlier this morning. We now expect 2024 R&D expense to be in the range of $4.4 billion to $4.6 billion. The change in R&D guidance is solely due to the inclusion of operating expenses associated with the acquisition of 2seventy bio's development programs, which closed on April 1. In summary, Regeneron performed well in the first quarter and is positioned to continue to deliver strong results in 2024 and beyond. With that, I'll pass the call back to Ryan."", 'Ryan Crowe: Thank you, Chris. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open the call for Q&A.

And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up.

Value investors who like to invest in profitable companies with high gross margins and net income have made shrewd investments in businesses with a solid track record over these twenty years.

It offers lower growth, but it yields nearly 4% and trades at 11x earnings. AstraZeneca possesses a diversified portfolio of pharmaceuticals, which should deliver double-digit earnings growth, yet it trades at just 16x earnings.

Cisco is transitioning away from selling mainly transactional hardware and toward selling more software and subscriptions. This shift is expected to accelerate revenue growth, improve operating margins and build recurring revenue. Despite these notable business improvements, Cisco still trades near a trough valuation relative to the S&P 500 Index. More recently, Cisco announced its intention to acquire Splunk, a leader in security and observability, adding to its already strong position in the increasingly important security market.
