1,3c2a0a37-327f-3f13-9bea-0f808255d50b,VRSK,2022-10-28,Dun & Bradstreet (DNB) Reports Next Week: What You Should Expect,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dun-bradstreet-dnb-reports-next-140202007.html,1666879322,STORY,"['DNB', 'VRSK']","[The market expects Dun &amp; Bradstreet (DNB) to deliver flat earnings compared to the year-ago quarter on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 3. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.29 per share in its upcoming report, which represents no change from the year-ago quarter.Revenues are expected to be $559.43 million, up 3.2% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 3.13% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Dun &amp; Bradstreet?For Dun &amp; Bradstreet, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.36%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Dun &amp; Bradstreet will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Dun &amp; Bradstreet would post earnings of $0.26 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.25, delivering a surprise of -3.85%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Dun &amp; Bradstreet doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAnother stock from the Zacks Business - Information Services industry, Verisk Analytics (VRSK), is soon expected to post earnings of $1.46 per share for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +1.4%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $757.8 million, down 0.2% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Verisk has been revised 0.4% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a higher Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0.17%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP indicates that Verisk will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

4,3e2f73d4-d73c-3078-b05f-c91338add3eb,SCHW,2022-10-28,Charles Schwab of Local Bounti Corporation (NYSE:LOCL) Just Spent US$7.5m On Shares,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/charles-schwab-local-bounti-corporation-125120244.html,1666875080,STORY,['SCHW'],"[Those following along with Local Bounti Corporation (NYSE:LOCL) will no doubt be intrigued by the recent purchase of shares by insider Charles Schwab, who spent a stonking US$7.5m on stock at an average price of US$2.50. Not only is that a big swing, but it increased their holding size by 25%, which is definitely great to see. See our latest analysis for Local Bounti Local Bounti Insider Transactions Over The Last YearNotably, that recent purchase by Charles Schwab is the biggest insider purchase of Local Bounti shares that we've seen in the last year. Even though the purchase was made at a significantly lower price than the recent price (US$3.22), we still think insider buying is a positive. Because it occurred at a lower valuation, it doesn't tell us much about whether insiders might find today's price attractive.Over the last year, we can see that insiders have bought 3.53m shares worth US$9.9m. But insiders sold 15.28k shares worth US$55k. In total, Local Bounti insiders bought more than they sold over the last year. The average buy price was around US$2.81. To my mind it is good that insiders have invested their own money in the company. However, we do note that they were buying at significantly lower prices than today's share price. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeLocal Bounti is not the only stock insiders are buying. So take a peek at this free list of growing companies with insider buying.Insider Ownership Of Local BountiAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Local Bounti insiders own 51% of the company, currently worth about US$165m based on the recent share price. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Local Bounti Tell Us?It is good to see recent purchasing. We also take confidence from the longer term picture of insider transactions. However, we note that the company didn't make a profit over the last twelve months, which makes us cautious. Once you factor in the high insider ownership, it certainly seems like insiders are positive about Local Bounti. One for the watchlist, at least! So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. At Simply Wall St, we've found that Local Bounti has 2 warning signs (1 is potentially serious!) that deserve your attention before going any further with your analysis.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.' While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.So if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN). While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing. Check out our latest analysis for Texas Instruments How Fast Is Texas Instruments Growing?If you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS. Shareholders will be happy to know that Texas Instruments' EPS has grown 21% each year, compound, over three years. If growth like this continues on into the future, then shareholders will have plenty to smile about.Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. Texas Instruments shareholders can take confidence from the fact that EBIT margins are up from 47% to 53%, and revenue is growing. Both of which are great metrics to check off for potential growth.In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart.earnings-and-revenue-historyIn investing, as in life, the future matters more than the past. So why not check out this free interactive visualization of Texas Instruments' forecast profits?Story continuesAre Texas Instruments Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Since Texas Instruments has a market capitalisation of US$144b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$159m. While that is a lot of skin in the game, we note this holding only totals to 0.1% of the business, which is a result of the company being so large. This still shows shareholders there is a degree of alignment between management and themselves.Does Texas Instruments Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?For growth investors, Texas Instruments' raw rate of earnings growth is a beacon in the night. With EPS growth rates like that, it's hardly surprising to see company higher-ups place confidence in the company through continuing to hold a significant investment. On the balance of its merits, solid EPS growth and company insiders who are aligned with the shareholders would indicate a business that is worthy of further research. What about risks? Every company has them, and we've spotted   3 warning signs for Texas Instruments   (of which 2 are concerning!) you should know about.The beauty of investing is that you can invest in almost any company you want.

The bottom line decreased 92% year over year and 89% quarter over quarter.However, revenues of $3.736 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.9%.The top line decreased 26% year over year. The decline was owing to weak performance across all segments. On a sequential basis, revenues decreased 17%.In the past year, shares of Western Digital have lost 36.4% of their value compared with the industry’s decline of 25.5%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchQuarter in DetailBeginning with first-quarter fiscal 2022, Western Digital started reporting revenues under three refined end markets — Cloud (includes products for public or private cloud), Client (includes products sold directly to OEMs or through distribution) and Consumer (includes retail and other end-user products).Western Digital Corporation PriceWestern Digital Corporation PriceWestern Digital Corporation price | Western Digital Corporation QuoteRevenues from the Cloud end market (49% of total revenues) fell 18% year over year to $1.829 billion owing to weakness in demand for both hard drive and flash products. On a sequential basis, cloud revenues were down 13%.Revenues from the Client end market (33%) were down 34% year over year and declined 25% sequentially to $1.229 billion. The downtick was caused by reduced flash pricing on a year-over-year basis. Sequentially, reduced flash pricing and customers’ (mostly PC OEMs) inventory reductions caused the decline in revenues.Revenues from the Consumer end market (18%) were down 30% year over year and 15% sequentially to $678 million. Sequential performance was affected by lower flash pricing and reduced retail HDD shipments.Considering revenues by product group, HDD revenues (54% of total revenues) decreased 21.4% year over year to $2.014 billion. The downtick was mainly caused by softness in other capacity enterprise product channels and consumer demand. Revenues declined 5% quarter over quarter.Story continuesFlash revenues (46%) declined 30.8% from the year-ago quarter’s figure to $1.722 billion. Sequentially, flash revenues fell 28%.Key MetricsThe company shipped 14.7 million HDDs at an average selling price (ASP) of $125.

This compares to earnings of $2.49 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -33.33%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this maker of hard drives for businesses and personal computers would post earnings of $1.77 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.78, delivering a surprise of 0.56%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Western Digital , which belongs to the Zacks Computer- Storage Devices industry, posted revenues of $3.74 billion for the quarter ended September 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.89%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $5.05 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Western Digital shares have lost about 45.9% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -19.6%.What's Next for Western Digital?While Western Digital has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Western Digital: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is breakeven on $3.54 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $0.87 on $14.34 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Computer- Storage Devices is currently in the top 8% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.One other stock from the same industry, Pure Storage (PSTG), is yet to report results for the quarter ended October 2022.This data storage company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.26 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +18.2%.

16,74c111f6-5712-39ed-874a-0ec82964ec37,UNM,2022-10-28,Why Unum (UNM) is a Great Dividend Stock Right Now,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-unum-unm-great-dividend-154503809.html,1666885503,STORY,['UNM'],"[Whether it's through stocks, bonds, ETFs, or other types of securities, all investors love seeing their portfolios score big returns. However, when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns.Unum in FocusBased in Chattanooga, Unum (UNM) is in the Finance sector, and so far this year, shares have seen a price change of 80.83%. The insurance company is paying out a dividend of $0.33 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 2.97% compared to the Insurance - Accident and Health industry's yield of 2.37% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.71%.Taking a look at the company's dividend growth, its current annualized dividend of $1.32 is up 12.8% from last year. Unum has increased its dividend 4 times on a year-over-year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 6.28%. Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company's payout ratio; a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Right now, Unum's payout ratio is 23%, which means it paid out 23% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Looking at this fiscal year, UNM expects solid earnings growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 is $6.13 per share, representing a year-over-year earnings growth rate of 40.92%.Bottom LineFrom greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages, investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons. But, not every company offers a quarterly payout.High-growth firms or tech start-ups, for example, rarely provide their shareholders a dividend, while larger, more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options. During periods of rising interest rates, income investors must be mindful that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle. With that in mind, UNM is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

17,7a3db555-58c1-3716-8dda-45c77b853e26,UNM,2022-10-28,Trupanion (TRUP) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: Can the Stock Move Higher?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trupanion-trup-expected-beat-earnings-140202672.html,1666879322,STORY,"['TRUP', 'UNM']","[Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when Trupanion (TRUP) reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 3. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis provider of medical insurance covering cats and dogs is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.29 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -625%.Revenues are expected to be $231.21 million, up 27.3% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 5.69% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Trupanion?For Trupanion, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +3.51%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Trupanion will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Trupanion would post a loss of $0.23 per share when it actually produced a loss of $0.33, delivering a surprise of -43.48%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Trupanion appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAmong the stocks in the Zacks Insurance - Accident and Health industry, Unum (UNM) is soon expected to post earnings of $1.40 per share for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +35.9%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $2.99 billion, up 0.6% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Unum has been revised 0.5% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -3.04%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Unum will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

18,bfc887c4-5280-3f10-9609-727feb9a2e73,STT,2022-10-28,The 7 Best Retirement Stocks to Buy Now,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-retirement-stocks-buy-july-105720460.html,1666645220,STORY,"['JNJ', 'CAT', 'STT', 'ORCL', 'ENB']","[As the bear market continues, the opportunity remains to load up on the best retirement stocks at favorable prices. Macro uncertainties may be putting pressure on these names in the near-term, but over a long timeframe, these types of stocks can generate strong returns.First, through steady dividends. These payouts should provide a baseline of returns as you’re growing a retirement nest egg and can provide income in your golden years. Second, via price appreciation. Each of these stocks represents ownership in a high-quality business.Over time, this points to consistent growth, which will translate into higher prices for their respective shares. Not to mention, higher dividend payouts over time as well.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsEach of the seven names below, all of which earn an A rating in Portfolio Grader, fit the criteria of best retirement stocks. Consider them great additions to your portfolio at current prices.BCBPBCB Bancorp$19.12GLPGlobal Partners$28.79HWKNHawkins, Inc.$42.30SFBSServisFirst Bancshares$72.20SIRESisecam Resources$22.70TRQTurquoise Hill Resources$28.26VRTVVeritiv$109.11BCB Bancorp (BCBP)Piggy bank on a wooden table with stacks of coins next to it.Source: FabrikaSimf / ShutterstockBCB Bancorp (NASDAQ:BCBP) is a regional bank, with branches across New Jersey as well as in New York. Admittedly, regional banks are a dime a dozen in the public markets, but this is one of the best retirement stocks for a reason.BCBP stock offers investors a safe, solid dividend. While yielding 3.37%, this bank’s payout ratio is only 24.6%. That means BCB pays out less than a quarter of its earnings right now as dividends, signaling sufficient room for dividend growth.Also, BCBP also sports a super-low valuation. Today, you can buy it for only 6.6 times earnings, a meaningful discount to the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios of peers. This may explain management’s latest move to increase the size of its share repurchase program by more than six-fold.Story continuesGlobal Partners (GLP)In the field, the oil pump in the evening, the evening silhouette of the pumping unit, the silhouette of the oil pump. Oil stocks and energy stocksSource: zhengzaishuru / Shutterstock.comAs I discussed last month, Global Partners (NYSE:GLP) has been on a tear. High oil prices have translated into high earnings for this gasoline wholesaler and retailer. This has resulted in high earnings for this master limited partnership (or MLP).Between the 19.2% jump in the price of GLP stock since January and the payout of $1.78 per share in distributions, GLP’s investors have generated high returns during this down year overall for the stock market. High energy prices will enable Global Partners to maintain its current rate of payout.This payout currently gives GLP stock (which earns an A in my Portfolio Grader) a 8.41% yield. Global is also investing its high earnings back into the business, through efforts such as its purchase of Tidewater Convenience.After completing this deal, this Northeast-centric firm will further increase its presence in the mid-Atlantic United States.Hawkins, Inc. (HWKN)Detail of chemical plant, silos and pipesSource: ShutterstockA distributor of specialty chemicals for water treatment, food products and industrial end-users, Hawkins Inc. (NASDAQ:HWKN) is hardly a household name. HWKN should, however, be considered one of the best retirement stocks out there.Buying up five competitors in the past two years, at first this company may seem to be little more than a “roll-up” acquirer. However, this has been the main factor behind its growth. As seen in recent results, organic growth has played a leading role in increasing the company’s revenue and earnings.Given its low valuation (13.4 times earnings), the market has yet to become fully appreciative of HWKN stock (which earns an A in Portfolio Grader).In time, however, this is likely to change. As steady growth continues, and its 1.35% dividend (which has increased 11 years in a row) keeps growing, this stock will likely receive a much-deserved re-rating.ServisFirst Bancshares (SFBS)100 dollar bills being passed from one hand to the other. Can represent stimulus checks or payment.Source: Maryna Pleshkun/Shutterstock.comBased in Birmingham, ServisFirst Bancshares (NYSE:SFBS) is a regional lending institution, with operations throughout the Southern United States. Holding steady for most of 2022, in recent weeks SFBS shares have taken a dive.Loan charge-offs resulted in a surprise earnings miss, causing this bank stock to plunge from around $85 per share to around $70 per share. With this in mind, I still consider SFBS stock (which earns an A in Portfolio Grader) a great retirement stock.Recent performance notwithstanding, forecasts continue to call for this growth-focused bank to keep steadily increasing its earnings.Its earnings growth makes the current multiple of 15.2 more than reasonable. This growth also points to ServisFirst continuing to grow its dividend. Although yielding just 1.31% today, SFBS’s payout has grown by an average of 37.09% annually over the past five years.Sisecam Resources (SIRE)Lithium element on the periodic table. LITM Stock.Source: tunasalmon / ShutterstockSisecam Resources (NYSE:SIRE) is another master limited partnership worth considering, for both its dividend (8.81% yield)  and capital growth potential. This MLP is a miner of trona ore, which it then processes into soda ash.Among a plethora of commercial and industrial applications, soda ash is also used in the production of lithium batteries.This indirect connection to the electric vehicle (or EV) revolution helps to explain the big jump in Sisecam earnings over the past year. During the summer, this MLP’s general partner made an offer to buy out holders of its publicly-traded partnership units.Yet based on the negative response from investors, chances are SIRE’s days as a publicly traded security aren’t numbered. As Sisecam continues to profit from robust demand for soda ash, everyday investors will stay able to join along for the ride, by purchasing SIRE stock, which earns an A in Portfolio Grader.Turquoise Hill Resources (TRQ)Person holding cellphone with website of Canadian mining company Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd on screen in front of logo. Focus on phone display. TRQ stock.Source: T. Schneider / ShutterstockTurquoise Hill Resources (NYSE:TRQ) is based in Canada, but its main asset is literally on the other side of the world.Developing the Oyu Tolgoi copper-gold mine in Southern Mongolia, there is a lot of long-term upside potential with this stock. That is, if a pending takeover offer from its majority owner doesn’t go through.Last month, Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) raised its offer to buy out public shareholders of TRQ stock. Offering a large premium (67%) to the stock’s pre-bid trading price, there is a good chance this offer is accepted.Or is there? The leading proxy advisors are split on whether shareholders should accept this deal. If this transaction does not go through, shares are likely to take a dive, as merger arbitrageurs cash out. Yet for long-term investors, this could create an ideal buying opportunity for TRQ stock, which earns an A in Portfolio Grader.Veritiv (VRTV)A magnifying glass zooms in on the website for Veritiv (VRTV).Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comPackaging products provider Veritiv (NYSE:VRTV) is in a dull business, but that’s not a reason to skip out on this “boring” stock.With the prosaic nature of its business keeping “hot stock” investors away, this is a great value opportunity.Today, VRTV stock trades for only 5 times earnings. Part of this low valuation is due to the expectation of a moderately-high decrease in profitability next year. Even so, when valuing it on next year’s reduced earnings, Veritiv remains cheap. Based on 2023 analyst forecasts, this stock still sports a single-digit price-to-earnings (or P/E) ratio (6.7).Profitability improvements in recent years have enabled Veritiv to pay down debt. Now with low-leverage, management can now return much of this cash to shareholders via share buybacks. A stable business at a dirt cheap price, VRTV stock (earning an A in Portfolio Grader) is one of the best retirement stocks. On the date of publication, Louis Navellier held GLP and VRTV.

While some disabilities are physical, others, like learning disabilities, autoimmune disorders or conditions impacting an individual's daily life, are invisible.For Brian Francisco, this hit home when his aunt disclosed that she had hidden her diagnosis of Parkinson's disease, a brain disorder that causes uncontrollable movements, for many years. Even though the two are incredibly close, she was apprehensive about how her diagnosis would impact the family. Since then, he's heard similar concerns about disclosing a disability echoed in conversations with other people.""When I started working in the accessibility inclusion space a few years ago, the number of people who were afraid to disclose their disability was eye-opening,"" said Francisco, a senior corporate trainer who sits on the board of the company's Disability business resource group (BRG) as the accessibility director. ""At the same time, it was heartbreaking for me to hear why they were afraid. That's why I'm grateful that for our Disability BRG and support circles, which create safe spaces for employees to network and share resources.""U.S. Bank is dedicated to enhancing inclusivity and creating a workplace where everyone can thrive and has been recognized for its efforts, including earning the highest score on the 2022 Disability Equality Index®. The Disability BRG plays a leading role in fostering equity and inclusion for individuals with disabilities, with members drafting the business case for creating a disability and accessibility consultant position to help ensure U.S. Bank has the infrastructure to support access and inclusion for employees who experience disability-related barriers in the workplace. The BRG's managing committee sponsors approved the role, and in 2021, the company hired Emily Norenberg, who held a similar position at the University of Minnesota.Story continuesCreating this new position ""really says a lot about the influence of the Disability BRG, and demonstrates the company's willingness to listen to people with lived experiences who say, ‘hey, we need this,' and then take action on it,"" Norenberg said.Since joining U.S. Bank, Norenberg has collaborated with Francisco and the Disability BRG to create a new Disability Awareness and Workplace Accessibility web-based training that reinforces the value employees with disabilities bring to U.S. Bank and offers practical ideas and resources for meaningfully supporting them. The course is required for managers and optional for all other employees. The training also links to a recently created ""Disability Accessibility Playbook"" that provides guidance for managers who receive an employee disclosure of a disability.With more than 70,000 employees, the need for disability accessibility accommodations at U.S. Bank is vast. ""Many of these accommodations often provide a better experience for all employees and customers,"" said Kelly Risser, global chair of the Disability BRG and accessibility banking director. Just one example: adding closed captions to videos - originally designed to help people with hearing issues - can also be helpful for someone who is multitasking or doesn't want to disturb people nearby.""When our products aren't accessible, or our systems aren't accessible, we are, whether intentionally or not, preventing people from being able to independently use our services. No one wants to ask for an accommodation,"" Risser said. ""It creates a much stronger sense of belonging for our employees and customers to have accessibility built in.""In 2018, U.S. Bank created a dedicated function within User Experience that allows teams to fully consider accessibility as part of the design process and was recognized by Forrester Research as one of 22 leading companies ""getting it right - with a focus on how to progress by establishing a solid accessibility practice.""While a foundation has been laid, for Norenberg, the work continues in collaboration with the Disability BRG and larger efforts like the new training course.""A lot of the ways people think about disabilities are rooted in oppression. We're trying to shift the narrative to think of disability as part of the human experience,"" she said. ""When we think about the sense of belonging that we hope to foster, how can we do that for our employees with disabilities? Because at the end of the day, one thing we all want is for people to feel empowered to do the work they were hired to do.""Learn more about U.S. Bank hereU.S. Bank, Thursday, October 27, 2022, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from U.S. Bank on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: U.S. BankWebsite: https://www.usbank.com/index.htmlEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: U.S. BankView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/722679/Shifting-the-Narrative-Around-People-With-Disabilities]"

You can skip our detailed analysis of Berkshire Hathaway's strategy and Warren Buffett's background and go directly to the 5 Best Value Stocks To Buy According To Warren Buffett.Born in 1930 in Omaha, Nebraska, Warren Buffett is considered the most successful investor in history. Popularly known as the ""Oracle of Omaha,"" he is the sixth wealthiest person in the world, with a net worth of $95 billion.After Buffett was denied admission by Harvard Business School, he went on to complete his Masters in economics at Columbia University. Buffett learned the principles of investing from his mentor Ben Graham at Columbia. Graham's ""value investing"" included searching for companies that were trading at a significant discount to their ""intrinsic value,"" or the worth of their underlying assets. Buffett internalized the concept and added to the ideas of Ben Graham by theorizing that the quality of the company's management and the product's competitive edge in the market are key factors in evaluating companies.Warren Buffett created Buffett Partnership, Ltd in 1956. In 1969, he purchased Berkshire Hathaway, a textile manufacturing business, and transformed it into a diversified holding corporation.  Since 1970, Buffett has served as Berkshire Hathaway's chairman and biggest shareholder. Berkshire Hathaway is the parent firm of a number of other companies, including the insurance provider Geico, and has significant investments in a number of Fortune 500 corporations.Berkshire Hathaway's investment principles include having a long-time horizon which is why some of its holdings have been in the portfolio for over several decades.

The analyst currently has a Market Perform rating on the stock and believes that the decline in the sales of the company's printers, which are a major revenue contributor for the company, presents a headwind for HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ) going forward.At the end of Q2 2022, Berkshire Hathaway held the highest stake in HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ) with a holding of 104,476,035 shares of the company, constituting 1.14% of the fund's portfolio.

In MIS (Moody's Investors Service) which houses the traditional ratings business, the outlook for debt issuance was raised for the remainder of the year, while MA (Moody's Analytics) also came in ahead of expectations. The company leveraged strong revenue growth with strong operating profit margin improvement of 200 bps, with EPS coming in $0.22 ahead of consensus estimates. Management alluded to having interesting opportunities in their M&amp;A pipeline, which we will have to assess when the time comes, but Moody's management team has been very effective at allocating capital in the past toward value-creating bolt-on acquisitions, especially in their Moody's Analytics business, a key growth driver for the company.7.

But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task.In addition to volatility, these stocks carry above-average risk by their very nature. Also, one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end.However, the task of finding cutting-edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.Our proprietary system currently recommends CF Industries (CF) as one such stock. This company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this fertilizer maker is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:Earnings GrowthEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.While the historical EPS growth rate for CF is 75.1%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 362.5% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 164.3%.Cash Flow GrowthWhile cash is the lifeblood of any business, higher-than-average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds.Story continuesRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for CF is 90.8%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of 82.6%.While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 24% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 22.8%.Promising Earnings Estimate RevisionsSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.The current-year earnings estimates for CF have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 2.3% over the past month.Bottom LineCF has not only earned a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This combination indicates that CF is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Cameco is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CCJ's full-year earnings has moved 22% higher within the past quarter.

The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Edwards Lifesciences shares have lost about 33% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -19.6%.What's Next for Edwards Lifesciences?While Edwards Lifesciences has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Edwards Lifesciences: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.66 on $1.42 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $2.51 on $5.47 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well.

(PRNewsFoto/Edwards Lifesciences Corporation)Third Quarter Highlights and OutlookQ3 sales of $1.32 billion grew 1 percent; constant currency1 sales grew 7 percentQ3 TAVR sales grew 1 percent; constant currency sales grew 6 percentQ3 EPS of $0.55; adjusted1 EPS increased 13 percent to $0.61Recently discontinued surgical HARPOON program resulted in a net $0.07 per share charge2022 adjusted EPS guidance revised: $2.40 to $2.50, compared to 2021 adjusted EPS of $2.22Received U.S. FDA and CE Mark approval for PASCAL PrecisionReceived U.S. FDA approval for SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA valve""The third quarter strengthened our conviction in our company's patient-focused innovation strategy,"" said Michael A. Mussallem, chairman and CEO.  ""Despite a challenging macro environment, our team made significant progress advancing our breakthrough technologies.  Our rigorous evidence generation has resulted in new global product approvals of innovative therapies, which will enable us to reach many more patients.""Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR)In the third quarter, the company reported TAVR sales of $862 million, a year-over-year increase of 1 percent, or 6 percent on a constant currency basis.  Sales were impacted primarily by persistent U.S. hospital staffing shortages and COVID headwinds in Japan, which intensified the typical summer seasonality.  In the U.S., Edwards' TAVR procedures increased in the mid-single digits versus the prior year.During the quarter, Edwards received approval to begin selling the SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA valve in the U.S.  The company's industry-leading SAPIEN 3 Ultra transcatheter aortic heart valve now incorporates Edwards' breakthrough RESILIA tissue technology.Outside the U.S., in the third quarter, Edwards' constant currency TAVR sales grew in the low-double digits on a year-over-year basis.  Long-term, the company sees excellent opportunities for international growth as TAVR therapy adoption remains low.Story continuesGlobally, the company's local average selling prices and market positions were stable.The company continues to estimate that the global TAVR opportunity will reach $10 billion by 2028, implying a low double-digit compounded annual growth rate.Transcatheter Mitral and Tricuspid Therapies (TMTT)Edwards continued to make progress on three key value drivers for TMTT in the third quarter: a portfolio of differentiated therapies, positive pivotal trial results to support approvals and adoption, and favorable real-world clinical outcomes.During the third quarter, the company received U.S. FDA approval for the PASCAL Precision system for the treatment of patients suffering from degenerative mitral regurgitation, as well as European regulatory approval for PASCAL Precision.  The company remains very positive about its three new valve replacement therapies, which include SAPIEN M3, EVOQUE Eos and the EVOQUE tricuspid replacement system.  Due to the uncertain Medical Devices Regulation process, the company now anticipates CE Mark approval for EVOQUE in late 2023.Third quarter TMTT sales were $30 million and grew sequentially despite summer seasonality. Adoption of the PASCAL system in Europe increased as the company initiated a limited introduction of PASCAL Precision.  This therapy continues to have excellent outcomes for patients as the company gradually expands into more centers in Europe.Edwards anticipates that the global TMTT opportunity will reach $5 billion by 2028.  The company remains committed to transforming the treatment of patients with transcatheter solutions for mitral and tricuspid valve diseases around the world.Surgical Structural Heart and Critical CareSurgical Structural Heart sales for the quarter were $220 million, up 1 percent compared to the third quarter of 2021, or up 8 percent on a constant currency basis.  The company experienced strong global growth driven by increased penetration of its premium RESILIA tissue products.  In addition, adoption of the MITRIS surgical mitral valve, launched in the U.S. in the second quarter, now represents the majority of the company's mitral valve sales in this region.Critical Care sales were $207 million for the quarter, down 3 percent versus the third quarter of 2021, or up 3 percent on a constant currency basis.  Sales growth was driven by increased adoption of Edwards' broad portfolio of Smart Recovery products, including FloTrac and ClearSight sensors with its unique Hypotension Prediction Index algorithm.Additional Financial ResultsFor the quarter, the adjusted gross profit margin was 81.0 percent, compared to 76.3 percent in the same period last year.  The improvement was driven by the expected positive impact from the company's FX program, which includes hedge contract gains and natural hedges that offset the negative sales impact from the weakening of the Euro and Yen against the dollar.Selling, general and administrative expenses in the third quarter were $377 million, or 28.6 percent of sales, compared to $364 million in the prior year.  The year-over-year increase was primarily due to a resumption of in-person commercial activities, partially offset by the strengthening of the dollar.Research and development expenses in the third quarter declined 2 percent to $234 million, or 17.7 percent of sales.  The decline reflects unusually high year-ago spending.The discontinuation of the company's HARPOON surgical mitral repair system resulted in a net $0.07 per share charge, consisting of a non-cash impairment of intangible assets, a reduction of contingent liabilities, and other related exit costs.  Additional details of the charge and a reconciliation between GAAP and adjusted EPS is included with today's release.Free cash flow for the third quarter was $250 million, defined as cash flow from operating activities of $310 million, less capital spending of $60 million.Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $1.7 billion as of September 30, 2022.OutlookThe company anticipates that the U.S. hospital staffing challenge and strong U.S. dollar are likely to persist and now expects total company sales for 2022 at the low end of its previous range of $5.35 to $5.55 billion.  TAVR sales are also expected at the low end of the previous range of $3.5 to $3.7 billion.  For TMTT, Edwards expects reported fourth quarter sales to be similar to the third quarter as the weaker Euro impacts sales.  The company continues to expect full year Surgical Structural Heart sales of $870 to $950 million, and Critical Care sales of $820 to $900 million.  Edwards now expects full year adjusted EPS of $2.40 to $2.50, up from 2021 adjusted EPS of $2.22.  The company had previously guided to the bottom end of its $2.50 to $2.65 range.For the fourth quarter of 2022, Edwards projects year-over-year and sequential sales growth in constant currency.  The company expects reported sales and adjusted EPS to be similar to the third quarter.""Despite ongoing procedure headwinds associated with the pandemic, we are pleased with our year-to-date performance, which includes strong progress on strategic milestones.  We believe hospital staffing constraints will gradually improve and we are committed to aggressively investing in our focused innovation strategy for the broad group of patients suffering from structural heart disease,"" said Mussallem.  ""We remain confident that the innovative therapies resulting from our investments will allow us to treat more patients and continue to drive strong organic growth in the years to come.""About Edwards LifesciencesEdwards Lifesciences is the global leader of patient-focused innovations for structural heart disease and critical care monitoring.  We are driven by a passion for patients, dedicated to improving and enhancing lives through partnerships with clinicians and stakeholders across the global healthcare landscape.

accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (""GAAP""), the Company uses non-GAAP historical financial measures.  Management makes adjustments to the GAAP measures for items (both charges and gains) that (a) do not reflect the core operational activities of the Company, (b) are commonly adjusted within the Company's industry to enhance comparability of the Company's financial results with those of its peer group, or (c) are inconsistent in amount or frequency between periods (albeit such items are monitored and controlled with equal diligence relative to core operations).  The Company uses the term ""underlying"" when referring to non-GAAP sales and sales growth information, which excludes currency exchange rate fluctuations. The Company uses the term ""adjusted"" to also exclude intellectual property litigation expenses, amortization of intangible assets, fair value adjustments to contingent consideration liabilities arising from acquisitions, and a significant program discontinuation.Management uses non-GAAP financial measures internally for strategic decision making, forecasting future results, and evaluating current performance.  These non-GAAP financial measures are used in addition to, and in conjunction with, results presented in accordance with GAAP and reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of the Company's operations by investors that, when viewed with its GAAP results, provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting the Company's business and facilitate comparability to historical periods.Non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP; therefore, the information is not necessarily comparable to other companies and should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.  A reconciliation of non-GAAP historical financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure is provided in the tables below.Fluctuations in currency exchange rates impact the comparative results and sales growth rates of the Company's underlying business. Management believes that excluding the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations from its sales growth provides investors a more useful comparison to historical financial results. The impact of the fluctuations has been detailed in the ""Reconciliation of Sales by Product Group and Region.""Guidance for sales and sales growth rates is provided on an ""underlying basis,"" and projections for diluted earnings per share, net income and growth, gross profit margin, taxes, and free cash flow are also provided on a non-GAAP basis, as adjusted, for the items identified above due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting such items without unreasonable efforts.  The Company is not able to provide a reconciliation of the non-GAAP guidance to comparable GAAP measures due to the unknown effect, timing, and potential significance of special charges or gains, and management's inability to forecast charges associated with future transactions and initiatives.Management considers free cash flow to be a liquidity measure which provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by business operations, after deducting payments for capital expenditures, which can then be used for strategic opportunities or other business purposes including, among others, investing in the Company's business, making strategic acquisitions, strengthening the balance sheet, and repurchasing stock.The items described below are adjustments to the GAAP financial results in the reconciliations that follow:Intellectual Property Litigation Expenses, net - The Company incurred net intellectual property litigation expenses of $7.1 million and $6.4 million in the first quarter of 2022 and 2021, respectively, $6.1 million and $2.4 million in the second quarter of 2022 and 2021, respectively, and income of $2.4 million and expense of  $4.7 million in the third quarter of 2022 and 2021, respectively.Change in Fair Value of Contingent Consideration Liabilities, net - The Company recorded gains of $2.9 million and $4.5 million in the first quarter of 2022 and 2021, respectively, $20.9 million and $102.6 million in the second quarter of 2022 and 2021, respectively, and gains of $12.5 million and expense of $1.1 million in the third quarter of 2022 and 2021, respectively, related to changes in the fair value of its contingent consideration liabilities arising from acquisitions.Amortization of Intangible Assets - The Company recorded amortization expense related to developed technology and patents in the amount of $1.7 million and $1.1 million in the first quarter of 2022 and 2021, respectively, $1.2 million and $3.3 million in the second quarter of 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $1.5 million and $1.7 million in the  third quarter of 2022 and 2021, respectively.Program Discontinuation - The Company recorded a $68.4 million charge in the third quarter of 2022 as a result of its decision to exit its HARPOON surgical mitral repair system program.  The charge primarily related to the impairment of intangible assets associated with the technology and other related exit costs.EDWARDS LIFESCIENCES CORPORATIONUnaudited

For more companies, head on over to 5 Biggest Data Science Companies In USA. Big data analytics, also known as data science, is one of the hottest fields in information technology. This is due to the fact that it is nearly ubiquitous across industries, and the growth and popularity of the Internet has led to vast sums of data being generated daily for advertisers to capitalize on.Estimates show that the amount of data that is generated globally will grow to unbelievable amounts. Research firm IDC believes that global data will grow at a stunning compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 61% between 2018 and 2025, to 175 zettabytes by 2025. For the uninitiated, a gigabyte of information contains 1024 megabytes, and a zettabyte has roughly 1,100 trillion megabytes - much larger than your daily Internet usage we'd assume. To better understand the significance of IDC's estimates, if all this data was written onto blu-ray disks, then these disks could be stacked to the Moon 23 times over.This growth has also spurred a strong interest in the field itself, with the Department of Labor estimating that the data science sector is expected to grow by 26% through 2026. Naturally, this growth will also boost salaries in the field, and the average salary for the field sits at $111,000 in the U.S. right now. Finally, looking at the sector as a whole, Markets and Markets estimates that the data science platform market was worth $95 billion last year, and between then and 2026, it will grow at a CAGR of 27.7% to be worth $322.9 billion. It further outlines that the growth in the business and finance sectors will lead the way for the industry.Therefore, it's fairly accurate to say that the data science sector has a great future ahead of it, and in today's piece we have narrowed down the top data science companies. Among these, the renowned players are Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon.com, Inc.

(WMT): Here is What You Need to Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-walmart-inc-130001074.html,1666875601,STORY,['WMT'],"[Walmart (WMT) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this world's largest retailer have returned +6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +5.4% change. The Zacks Retail - Supermarkets industry, to which Walmart belongs, has gained 7% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Walmart is expected to post earnings of $1.31 per share, indicating a change of -9.7% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.1% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.85 points to a change of -9.4% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.1%.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.53 indicates a change of +11.6% from what Walmart is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.1%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Walmart is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for WMT _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Walmart, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $147.29 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +4.8%. For the current and next fiscal years, $600.58 billion and $618.89 billion estimates indicate +4.9% and +3.1% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryWalmart reported revenues of $152.86 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +8.4%. EPS of $1.77 for the same period compares with $1.78 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $151.41 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.95%. The EPS surprise was +10.63%.Over the last four quarters, Walmart surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Walmart is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Walmart. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Banks and finance have recently seen a boost from higher interest rates. But Raymond James is also taking careful note of what it calls a challenging and volatile market environment.Joining us now to talk about earnings and the sector, we've got Paul Reilly, Raymond James CEO in a First on Yahoo interview. Great to have you here with us this morning. First, as we were breaking down some of the earnings that have just come across and largely the season that we've been navigating through, if there's kind of a common denominator or a set of them that you've been taking away from this, what are they, from your perspective?PAUL REILLY: Well, first, great to be here. And it's always good to be on the show. There's just a lot of uncertainty. And I think this is the great thing in our business, is people need their financial advisor more than ever. You have uncertain equity markets. All you have to do is listen to four or five speakers with different views. So it's not certain where we're going.The Fed clearly has said they're going to continue to raise interest rates. And inflation numbers high. The GDP number was actually good today. But again, that shows the economy is going.You have to pick stocks. You have to pick your choices because it's a very uncertain market. And, frankly, in the last almost decade, as long as you were in did pretty well. And that's not the case today.And investors are, they're individuals. They're in different situations. Some are still longer term and they can take the downs with the ups. Some can't afford the risk.And now fixed income is giving them a chance to invest in. And most people are in between. How do I balance the long-term bets in equities against inflation versus making sure I have income? And so it's a complicated environment. But it's a chance to really show your value also.Story continues- Paul, it's good to see you. Thanks for being here. If people are coming to you because they're concerned about the environment and they want advice, as they seem to be, what is happening in terms of their willingness to pay for it? I did see asset management fees were down 6% collectively.But I wonder what's happening on an individualized basis. Have you been-- I mean, we've been talking to everybody about raising prices. Are you all raising your fees?PAUL REILLY: Well, you look with us, the advisor, really has the primary client relationship. And the fee pricing is really set with them with our oversight but to what they're doing for their client. And what we've seen is most advisors aggressively managing fees in terms of what funds they go in and how they're managing what the cost is to the investor, to the end client.But surprisingly, I mean, those fees with the advisor have held up extremely well. And it just shows the value. The value isn't just investing. It's psychology.So many people wanted to get out of the market pre-COVID. They would have lost a huge opportunity. Or they can look at the down in the last few months and say, well, look at my down. And they could remind, look, this is your-- you're on plan. This is your plan for your life.You are up more than you thought. You're down a little bit now, but you're still on plan. Stay invested so you don't get hurt. And that value in almost a family psychologist in many cases has shown that people are still willing to pay the fees. And the fee to the advisor themselves has been under surprisingly a lot less pressure than the overall cost for us to produce more effectively.- Paul, a lot of your peers in the industry are now looking at a lot of belt tightening as the industry has slowed. What are you doing inside of Raymond James?PAUL REILLY: Well, we're trying to be very thoughtful. So first we have comp pressure, as the whole industry has seen. We started talking about it a year ago before people did. And we're going to treat our people well, both with our record results this year and quarter, but also because that's the market today. And we have to make sure we keep people.We can only belt tighten so much. We're still growing. We're growing across all of our businesses. And so we're still recruiting and hiring people. So the focus is where do you spend smartly? And where do you stay focused?For example, our tech spend is going up. Our technology, for which we believe is leading edge, industry leading for our advisors in terms of wealth planning, we can't let that slip because that's what's driven our continued top-of-the-industry recruiting and retention. And now the apps to the individual clients, again, we've got to invest there because that's part of the market.So in other areas in the back office, we pride ourselves in top-level service. And we have to push to be more cost efficient. And what technologies and processes can we use to keep those costs in check?So we're still in a growth mode. We're cautious on the economy. The great thing about the company well before I got here, it's always been long term focused. We've been criticized maybe over the last two years of having too much capital and liquidity. We aren't right now.And so in bull markets maybe we look like we're being too conservative. But we plan for these kind of markets. And it's showing up in our growth. And we still have plenty of balance sheet flexibility to operate, even if we do have a hard landing.- When you think about the absence of easy money policies and what that means for some of the more speculative assets that even the wealthiest clients that you may deal with would be prone to perhaps nibble at it in the past, where have you seen that strategy start to wane and perhaps shift into some of the other spaces? And what types of recommendations are you providing them?PAUL REILLY: Well, you still see that as cyclical. So certainly when rates move quickly, like they have-- so if you go to the bond markets, certainly the nonrated bonds and things get hit first and get hit hardest. But at some point at that price adjustment, that's when the very wealthy or hedge funds or investment funds see the opportunity and invest. So it's really calling when that happens.So you have to look through the whole cycle and look at the opportunities for those clients. Now, a lot of clients don't have that extra net worth. So you've got to keep them down the middle. But others that do have that ability, it's kind of a wait and see and strike when they see the opportunity.Now, if you believe there's going to be a hard landing, that means there's going to be a lot more opportunity and you keep powder dry. If you think this is going to be a softer one and you're going to get a pickup, then you can be a little more aggressive now. And we see clients on all sides of that right now.So it's, again, not an easy call to say, where are we going to be six months from now. But from a company standpoint, with our flexible balance sheet-- we didn't lock in rates, which a lot of our competitors did-- and we're seeing the benefit of that now. And we just don't try to focus on maximizing short-term earnings. We're saying over a cycle, what's the right thing to do? And so even if it gets into tough times, I like where we're positioned right now.- We always appreciate your soothing tone, Paul, especially in these crazy times. Always good to get some time with you. Raymond James CEO Paul Reilly, we'll talk to you soon.]"

The bottom line was, however, down 2% from the prior-year quarter.Higher interest rates and a rise in loan demand acted as tailwinds, which led to a solid rise in net interest income (NII). Further, the performance of the Private Client Group was impressive. Also, the acquisitions over the past years supported the company’s financials to some extent.Yet, a rise in expenses and poor investment banking (IB) performance due to heightened geopolitical and macroeconomic ambiguities were the undermining factors. Also, RJF recorded bank loan provision for credit losses during the quarter, which indicates “a weaker macroeconomic outlook.”Net income available to common shareholders (GAAP basis) was $437 million, up 2% year over year.In fiscal 2022, adjusted earnings per share of $7.49 beat the consensus estimate of $7.37 and grew 3% year over year. Net income available to common shareholders (GAAP basis) was $1.51 billion, increasing 7%.Revenues &amp; Costs IncreaseNet revenues were $2.83 billion, increasing 5% year over year. The rise was mainly driven by higher NII and account and service fees. The top line also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.73 billion.In fiscal 2022, net revenues rose 13% to $11 billion. The top line outpaced the consensus estimate of $10.90 billion.Segment-wise, in the reported quarter, RJ Bank registered a surge of 143% from the prior year in net revenues. This was driven by higher interest rates and the inclusion of TriState Capital for a full quarter. Also, Private Client Group recorded an 11% growth in net revenues. Capital Markets’ top line declined 28%, while Asset Management’s net revenues fell 9%. Others recorded negative revenues of $207 million compared with negative revenues of $72 million in the prior-year quarter.Non-interest expenses were up 4% to $2.22 billion. The rise was mainly due to an increase in all cost components except Compensation, commissions and benefits expenses and investment sub-advisory fees. Also, RJF recorded a bank loan provision for credit losses of $34 million compared with $5 million in the prior-year quarter.As of Sep 30, 2022, client assets under administration were $1.09 trillion, down 7% from the end of the prior-year quarter. Financial assets under management were $173.8 billion, down 9%.Strong Balance Sheet &amp; Capital RatiosAs of Sep 30, 2022, Raymond James reported total assets of $81 billion, down 6% from the prior quarter. Total equity fell 1% sequentially to $9.3 billion.Book value per share was $43.41, up from $40.08 as of Sep 30, 2021.As of Sep 30, 2022, total capital ratio was 20.5% compared with 26.2% as of Sep 30, 2021. Tier 1 capital ratio was 19.2% compared with 25% as of September 2021-end.Return on common equity (annualized basis) was 18.7% at the end of the reported quarter compared with 21.3% a year ago.Share Repurchase UpdateDuring the reported quarter, RJF repurchased 0.6 million shares for $62 million.As of Oct 26, 2022, approximately $800 million remained under the buyback authorization. This included $38 million worth of repurchases done in October.Our TakeRaymond James’ global diversification efforts, strategic acquisitions and higher rates are expected to keep supporting top-line growth.

The bottom line rose 31% from the prior-year quarter.SCHW’s results benefited from higher rates, which led to a rise in NII. Thus, revenues witnessed an improvement despite higher volatility hurting the trading income. Also, the absence of fee waivers and solid brokerage account numbers acted as tailwinds in the quarter. However, higher expenses were a headwind for SCHW.Interactive Brokers Group’s IBKR third-quarter 2022 adjusted earnings per share of $1.08 handily surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 99 cents. The bottom line reflects a rise of 38.5% from the prior-year quarter.Results were primarily aided by an improvement in revenues. Also, the capital position remained strong.

40,531e2e6a-541d-34fa-b166-c5c7dba2bebe,UAA,2022-10-28,Under Armour (UAA) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: What to Know Ahead of Q2 Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/under-armour-uaa-expected-beat-140202604.html,1666879322,STORY,['UAA'],"[The market expects Under Armour (UAA) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 3, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis sports apparel company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.16 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -48.4%.Revenues are expected to be $1.56 billion, up 0.6% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.82% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Under Armour?For Under Armour, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +1.02%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Under Armour will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Under Armour would post earnings of $0.03 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.03, delivering no surprise.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Under Armour appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Organic growth was led by all components of the segment.  Health business growth was driven by new client appointments and increases in advisory work and product sales. Organic revenue growth in Wealth businesses was due to higher levels of regulatory work in Great Britain and increased project activity related to financial market volatility. The growth was partially offset by headwinds from the negative impact of capital market performance.Career businesses grew revenues organically with increased participation, sales in compensation benchmarking surveys as well as through increased project activity. Benefits Delivery &amp; Outsourcing organic revenue growth was due to Medicare Advantage sales.The operating margin was 20.3%, which decreased 30 bps from the prior-year second quarter, primarily due to investments in resourcing to support near term revenues expansion and technology operating model.Risk &amp; Broking: Total revenues of $765 million decreased 2.8% year over year (3% increase constant currency and 6% increase organic). On an organic basis, Corporate Risk &amp; Broking generated organic revenue growth across all regions.

Considering the completion of the divestiture, present conditions, and current assessments about the impact of the divestiture on future revenues and expenses, WTW has recast its 2024 financial targets. Willis Towers projects the annualized run-rate impact from the divestiture of its Russian operations nearly $120 million of revenues.

The number of employees who are considering leaving their employer has increased to 36% compared to 28% in 2021, with low-income (those who make less than $60k per year), frontline (healthcare, retail, hospitality, etc.), and underrepresented employees being more likely to consider leaving than other groups. The findings also show significant declines in employee satisfaction and commitment across the board since last year, most noticeably in compensation, benefits, and career goals.The purpose of this survey was to understand the root causes of high turnover and how employees’ needs and wants have shifted over the past year since the term ""Great Resignation"" was coined in May 2021. The findings reveal that, among all demographics, concerns over inflation have placed financial health as the greatest unmet need* – covering monthly expenses now claims the top spot, up from #9 in 2021. The ability to retire is now the second top concern amongst all demographics, up from #5 in 2021.Third on the list is work-life balance and boundaries – employees continue to say burnout is a key reason for them to consider leaving their employer. More than half (51%) of employees reported feeling exhausted on a typical day at work. These concerns were most pronounced in front-line workforces, such as those working in healthcare, retail, food service, and hospitality. Concerns about physical health have declined this year as health and safety measures at work and the threat posed by COVID-19 have improved, though it still remains a top concern overall (#4, down from the #1 spot last year).Story continuesAdam Pressman, Mercer’s US Employee Research Leader said, ""During the pandemic, organizations that led with empathy, and prioritized health and flexibility saw the benefits through employee commitment, engagement, and productivity. But 2022 has brought new challenges – inflation, labor shortages, a war in Ukraine, and more.""""It’s clear now more than ever that employees are prioritizing their well-being now. The top three reasons employees consider leaving their employer are pay and benefits, burnout due to workload, and insufficient healthcare benefits,"" he added. ""For some, especially front-line and low-income employees, that means financial survival. Others, who have their basic financial needs met, are placing increased importance on their lives outside of work.""With the onset of remote and hybrid work, 2 out of 3 employees report they feel empowered, valued, connected, and stimulated. However, half of the employees say they feel exhausted on a typical day at work. The study revealed that flexibility is highly valued, and was the top item that would attract employees to a new employer, behind only pay.Americans across demographics are experiencing significant financial stressAbove all, the research revealed that the financial concerns of employees reign supreme this year, despite US employers increasing base pay between 5% and 7% in 2022. Financial concerns remain high even for high-income earners -- 71% of employees who make more than $200k per year say that high inflation and market volatility have increased their financial stress. Overall, nearly 2 out of 3 employees (62%) say they’ve reduced spending, and a third say they’ve reduced savings or tapped into savings to supplement their spending needs.Low-income employees are the most vulnerable to inflation, as pay levels often fall below living expenses. Nearly 1 in 3 employees making less than $60k per year say they’ve taken on additional work to supplement their income. They’re also less likely to ask for a raise, as compared to higher-income workers. More than 8 in 10 workers across all income levels say it’s important that their employer clearly and strongly supports living wages, through both internal/external statements and tangible actions. However, today only 21% of employers say they’ve adjusted compensation so that all employees in their organization are paid at least a living wage.Employees are increasingly concerned about retirement and healthcare affordabilityEmployees report that behind pay and workload, insufficient healthcare benefits are the next top reasons they would consider leaving their employer. 68% of employees report challenges with getting the care they need, with the top challenge being trouble affording the healthcare costs that aren’t covered by health insurance plans, such as deductibles and co-pays. Over 60% of employees purchase healthcare services outside of their insurance plan, with the top item being prescription drugs (31%).Additionally, fewer than half of respondents feel confident they can turn their retirement savings into a steady income to last the rest of their life. When asked what changes they would value most in retirement benefits, employees overall chose an increase in the contribution amount matched by their employer. Employees under 45, who are less likely to have discretionary income to contribute to their retirement plan, would value matching payments made to student loan debt and contributions to a health savings account (HSA).DEI is improving, but underrepresented employees still face unique challengesThe survey also found some improvements in diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) practices, most notably, an 8-percentage point increase in Black and African American employees who say they feel a sense of belonging to their team (up to 74%). However, a greater number of underrepresented workers are considering leaving their employers, especially Hispanic and Latino, and LGBTQ+ workers.Where Hispanic and Latino workers showed a significant decline in balance, satisfaction, and commitment across all categories since last year, one in three LGBTQ+ workers reported a lack of sense of belonging with their team, and fewer than half believe they can meet their career goals at their current organization. LGBTQ+ employees are significantly more likely to consider leaving their employer – an 8-percentage point difference over non-LGBTQ+ employees. LGBTQ+ employees rank mental health as the second greatest concern (behind only covering monthly expenses) and employees report significantly higher levels of exhaustion and frustration during a typical day.""In 2022, employees value a workplace that centers on well-being; where they have more sustainable workloads and more resources to support their holistic health - financial, physical, and mental. We see this as a defining moment – a new contract between employers and employees – the ""Lifestyle Contract,"" said Lauren Mason, Senior Principal in Mercer’s Career Business.""There will be no return to pre-pandemic ways of working; employers who adopt this lifestyle contract will gain a committed and productive workforce and be an employer of choice in today’s job market,"" she added.Note to editors:*Unmet needs* are the concerns that keep your employees up at night and prevent them from having adequate mental and emotional bandwidth to do a great job at work.About Inside Employees’ MindsThis study includes 4,049 full-time employees in the United States, working for organizations with more than 250 employees.

46,6602c496-4369-3d18-8578-7b3ec2070494,NCLH,2022-10-28,Bluegreen Vacations Holding Corporation (BVH) Earnings Expected to Grow: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bluegreen-vacations-holding-corporation-bvh-140202468.html,1666879322,STORY,['NCLH'],"[The market expects Bluegreen Vacations Holding Corporation (BVH) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 3, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.08 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +1.9%.Revenues are expected to be $237.07 million, up 10.5% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 4.07% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Bluegreen Vacations Holding Corporation?For Bluegreen Vacations Holding Corporation, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -15.35%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #5.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Bluegreen Vacations Holding Corporation will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Bluegreen Vacations Holding Corporation would post earnings of $0.89 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.87, delivering a surprise of -2.25%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Bluegreen Vacations Holding Corporation doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAmong the stocks in the Zacks Leisure and Recreation Services industry, Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH) is soon expected to post loss of $0.71 per share for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +67.3%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $1.58 billion, up 929.4% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Norwegian Cruise Line has been revised 12.4% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a higher Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 21.13%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP indicates that Norwegian Cruise Line will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company could not beat consensus EPS estimates in any of the last four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The 2021 version sees oil demand reaching a plateau after 2035.Another decade or more of oil demand growth would be a boost for producers and OPEC, whose 13 members depend on oil income, and would justify continued investment in new supplies. Consumers and governments urging efforts to curb oil use to combat climate change would be less happy.OPEC made a shift in 2020 when the pandemic hit demand, saying it would eventually slow after years of predicting ever-increasing consumption. The latest update is likely to keep OPEC among the more bullish forecasters of oil demand.""It is similar to last year in terms of the demand outlook,"" one of the OPEC sources said on condition of anonymity. The second source said OPEC has not brought forward its timeline for when plateau demand is forecast.Other predictions see oil demand peaking earlier. TotalEngergies has forecast this will take place before 2030.The International Energy Agency on Thursday for the first time in its history of modelling said demand for all fossil fuels was set to peak, with oil demand levelling off in the middle of the next decade.OPEC's Vienna headquarters declined to answer questions ahead of the publication's launch on Monday in Abu Dhabi that will be attended by OPEC Secretary General Haitham Al Ghais and other OPEC officials.Another OPEC source said Russia's invasion of Ukraine - which has sent oil and gas prices soaring and led to an energy crisis - could boost oil demand in the near term due to fuel switching, as could the ongoing recovery from the pandemic.Story continues""It is expected that oil and gas will remain as the dominant fuels in the world's energy mix until the middle of the century,"" this source said.INCREASED PROJECTION?Last year, OPEC saw oil demand reaching 108.2 million barrels per day in 2045, up from 90.6 million bpd in 2020.The group steadily lowered the 2045 projection over the last few years, citing changes to consumer behaviour brought about by the pandemic and competition from electric cars.By contrast, this year OPEC is expected to increase the 2045 demand forecast, two sources said.Two former OPEC officials, however, cited longer-term trends that will weigh on demand.""Even oil-producing countries are interested in electrification because of pollution,"" said Hasan Qabazard, OPEC's head of research from 2006 to 2013, and a Kuwaiti. ""In Kuwait, people are starting to buy electric cars.""Qabazard last year said demand could peak within a decade but maybe later and maintains that view.A former OPEC minister said the longer-term implications of the Ukraine war could encourage the shift towards renewables.""The war in Ukraine has changed Europe and the United States' reliance on Russia's oil and gas,"" said Chakib Khelil, a former Algerian oil minister and OPEC president. ""Europe will rely more and more on renewable energy in the future and less on oil and gas from Russia.""He added that it was ""highly probable"" demand could plateau earlier than expected in the current OPEC forecast.(Editing by Kirsten Donovan and Barbara Lewis)]"

The index is down 4% for the month and roughly 31% for the year.European stock futures indicated stocks were set to fall, with the Eurostoxx 50 futures down 0.75%, German DAX futures down 0.71% and FTSE futures down 0.61%.Disappointing earnings reports have added to the gloom, with Amazon.com the latest tech behemoth to face heavy punishment from investors after forecasting a slowdown in sales.Resilient corporate profits have been one bright spot in an otherwise dismal year, although the recent dismal results are increasing doubts over how long this can last.""The concern is becoming increasingly related to earnings,"" said Frank Benzimra, head of Asia equity strategy at Societe Generale, adding that interest rate hikes remain part of the worry.""It is the earnings and the risk of a recession which is hurting the market.""In the currency market, the Japanese yen swirled between losses and gains against the dollar after the Bank of Japan held on to its dovish policy and maintained ultra-low interest rates but raised its inflation target.The widely expected move from BOJ comes after the European Central Bank on Thursday raised interest rates again, but said ""substantial"" progress had already been made in its bid to fight off a surge in inflation.Investors now turn their attention to the Federal Reserve meeting next week. While a 75 basis point rate hike at the conclusion of its Nov. 1-2 policy meeting is all but assured, the likelihood of a smaller, 50 basis-point hike in December was 55%, according to CME's FedWatch tool.Story continues""I don't think there will be any surprise here (in terms of rate hike), but it will be more on the message that the Fed will deliver,"" said Societe Generale's Benzimra.The less hawkish comments from the ECB added to expectations that central banks are likely to slow the pace of monetary tightening, especially after the Bank of Canada surprised the market by delivering a smaller-than-anticipated rate hike on Wednesday.Markets have started to trade a Fed pivot again, but this is defined as hiking in smaller increments, not as a ""proper"" pivot from hikes to cuts, according to Citi strategists, noting that an actual pause is still some time away.Over in China, the stock market fell 0.8%, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index down 2.3%, rounding up a rough week after a brutal sell-off on Monday. Bleak industrial profit figures and widening COVID-19 outbreaks have also weighed on sentiment.Elsewhere, Japan's Nikkei fell 0.45%, while Australia's S&amp;P/ASX 200 index lost 0.87%.The yen strengthened 0.01% versus the greenback at 146.27 per dollar, while the dollar index fell 0.109%.The euro is up 0.17% to $0.9979, threatening to rise above parity again, following a more than 1% slide overnight, after the dovish tone from ECB.Oil prices fell on Friday after China, the world's top crude oil importer, widened its COVID-19 curbs, but were poised for a weekly gain on supply concerns.(Editing by Jacqueline Wong and Ana Nicolaci da Costa)]"

65,e78e6670-0387-3f7e-991a-e8710333adfb,MS,2022-10-28,Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) institutional owners may be pleased with recent gains after 18% loss over the past year,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/morgan-stanley-nyse-ms-institutional-130122876.html,1666875682,STORY,['MS'],"[Every investor in Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. With 64% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Institutional investors would probably welcome last week's 4.2% increase in share prices after a year of 18% losses as a sign that returns are likely to begin trending higher.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Morgan Stanley. See our latest analysis for Morgan Stanley ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Morgan Stanley?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that Morgan Stanley does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Morgan Stanley's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Morgan Stanley is not owned by hedge funds. Our data shows that Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 22% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 7.2% and 7.0%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.We also observed that the top 7 shareholders account for more than half of the share register, with a few smaller shareholders to balance the interests of the larger ones to a certain extent.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Story continuesInsider Ownership Of Morgan StanleyThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Morgan Stanley in their own names. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$339m of stock. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 14% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Morgan Stanley. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Public Company OwnershipIt appears to us that public companies own 22% of Morgan Stanley. It's hard to say for sure but this suggests they have entwined business interests. This might be a strategic stake, so it's worth watching this space for changes in ownership.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company.

Income investors who counted on yield alone thrived up until earlier this year. Since then, the Federal Reserve has realized it was behind the curve. Inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, rose uncontrollably. Thus, the central bank appears intent on increasing interest rates at every meeting, until price increases start to slow. Higher rates on risk-free assets like bonds, debt, and cash are bad news for dividend stocks.Companies that have strong pricing power have nothing to worry about. Conversely, firms that sell goods that are demand-elastic, or sensitive to prices, are in trouble. Input costs rose with inflation, meaning companies that are unable to pass higher costs to customers will post lower profits.I expect the Fed to raise rates by at least 75 basis points in each of the two meetings to end this year. That will take the Federal Funds rate to a range of 4.75% to 5.00% by early next year.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsDividend Stocks to SellDividend yield compared to growth score.Chart courtesy of StockRoverDividend stocks in the table above have fair growth scores. Their generous dividend yields may not convince investors to overlook scores as low as 45/100. This list of dividend stocks to sell represents a wide variety of sectors, from telecom to consumer discretionary to pharmaceutical.CAHCardinal Health$73.67MSMorgan Stanley$79.07PEPPepsiCo$176.86PGProcter &amp; Gamble$129.00TAT&amp;T$17.50TAKTakeda Pharmaceutical$12.63TROWT. Rowe Price$104.54Cardinal Health (CAH)Cardinal Health (CAH) sign with bushes in front of itSource: ShutterstockFirst on the list of dividend stocks to sell is Cardinal Health (NYSE:CAH). This company began its business transformation before the pandemic. It focused on increasing its Cardinal brand mix to increase profit margins. Both during and following the Covid pandemic, macro supply chain disruptions hurt its momentum.Now, the company is investing heavily to strengthen its supply chain. That said, these added costs will weigh on Cardinal Health’s margins. Customers will not experience benefits from those investments in the short-term. For example, the sales team needs time to re-engage to drive sales volumes.Story continuesRecently, some bullish momentum has taken CAH stock on a nice ride, with the stock now trading near 52-week highs. Many investors appear to be betting that the company’s pharma business will remain resilient. Still, the company may deploy its excess capital inefficiently. It will have $3.1 billion in cash to invest. With a tight labor market and increasing competition for resources, the company may disappoint investors.Cardinal Health shares pay a dividend of $1.98, which yields 2.72%. This rate will fall significantly behind that of risk-free Treasury Bills. The 2-year U.S. Treasury now yields 4.483%.Morgan Stanley (MS)The logo for Morgan Stanley is displayed on the side of a building.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comMorgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) has an attractive dividend that yields almost 4%. In the third quarter, the company posted a drop in net revenue and net income.Indeed, the company’s results may not necessarily speak to this being among the dividend stocks to sell, at least on an initial look.Looking deeper, Morgan Stanley posted revenue of $13.0 billion, with the company’s net income falling from $1.98 a share to $1.47. Investors should worry about the bank’s defensibility in terms of its return on equity. The world is disengaging from the easy monetary policies that boosted stocks for over a decade. Global tensions are hurting market sentiment. For example, Europe had its first land war in Europe in 70 years.MS stock faces selling pressure as the Fed handles the highest inflation rates in 40 years. The higher rates rise, the sooner investors look at bank stocks to sell. Bulls might buy Morgan Stanley because it benefits from high net interest income. However, an economic slowdown hurts deal-making volumes, offsetting this tailwind to a considerable degree.The bank managed to attract $65 billion in investment for its Wealth Management unit, despite tough market conditions. I think investors should play it safe by waiting for broader investing activity to recover before jumping into this dividend stock.PepsiCo (PEP)Cans of PepsiCo's Pepsi soda are in a bucket of ice.Source: suriyachan / Shutterstock.comAnother top holding of many investors, I view PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) as one of the top dividend stocks to sell. That’s despite the company posting strong revenue growth in the third quarter. Revenue grew by 8.8% in Q3, to $21.97 billion. Thus, after raising its full-year outlook, why is PEP stock on this list at all?Indeed, Pepsi’s strong organic growth rate of 12% (up from 10% previously) and capital distributions to shareholders are impressive. The company expects to return $6.2 billion to investors through dividends. In addition, it will buy back $1.5 billion worth of shares.That said, the company’s recent earnings per share outlook came in basically in-line with estimates. I think the company’s bottom line is where it will see weakness. Moving forward, Pepsi might experience weaker-than-expected demand. Consumers face higher costs from big-ticket purchases. If demand falls by 1% to 2%, investors will fear an accelerated slowdown for Pepsi’s business.Pepsi has invested heavily in its brands, including in digitizing its business. This strengthens its long-term sustainability. That said, the stock trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 24.54 times. Thus, Pepsi really needs to post only one bad quarter to trigger a stock selloff. At these prices, the stock is not worth the risk.Procter &amp; Gamble (PG)A Procter &amp; Gamble (PG) distribution center in Vandalia.Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comAnother one of the dividend stocks to sell that made this list despite strong earnings is Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE:PG). The consumer goods giant posted revenue of $20.61 billion in its first fiscal quarter of 2023. That said, the company’s revenue growth of 1.3% year-over-year is too low for a firm whose stock trades at a 22.16-times price-earnings ratio.For the fiscal year, P&amp;G expects an earnings per share growth rate at the low end of its guidance range. This range only goes up to 4%, which many would call anemic. Shareholders might count on the company’s $9 billion in dividend payments and $6 billion to $8 billion in stock buybacks to boost its price. However, this is also a company that’s been investing heavily, and may need to pull back on these distributions in difficult times.This investment is exemplified by the company’s accelerated push toward greater productivity. To accelerate growth, P&amp;G needs to find potential acquisitions that complement the company’s existing product lines. Productivity increases eventually peak. Fortunately, the company is building digital capabilities. This may help it deliver results at lower costs over time.P&amp;G said that it spent more than $1.2 billion on media. As consumers tighten their wallets, this company might need to increase its spending to support sales further.AT&amp;T (T)a ground-up view of multiple cell towers in a circleSource: ShutterstockNext on the list of dividend stocks to sell right now is a more volatile option of late, AT&amp;T (NYSE:T). Recently, T stock bounced from around $14.65 to close at $17.10 by Oct. 21, 2022. This is due to markets responding positively to the company’s subscription growth rates. After languishing throughout the year, I think investors should sell T stock before other profit-takers do.AT&amp;T added 708,000 postpaid phone customers and 338,000 fiber customers. While the company’s $14 billion in free cash flow will attract income investors, the telecom firm has high capital expenditure requirements. It must spend $6.8 billion in capital to support its infrastructure. In the fourth quarter, AT&amp;T might convert its investment efforts to support cash flow growth. Thus, investors should expect the company’ stock price to peak sometime this quarter.AT&amp;T’s high debt load appears to be manageable. That said, before interest rate rates increase further, AT&amp;T many plan to use its cash to cut its debt. The company has a net debt to adjusted EBITDA target of 2.5-times. Investors might panic sell the stock ahead of management posting its status report on its planned debt reduction in the fourth quarter.Takeda Pharmaceutical (TAK)pharmaceutical industry. Production line machine conveyor with glass bottles ampoules at factorySource: Dmitry Kalinovsky / Shutterstock.comTakeda Pharmaceutical (NYSE:TAK) is a Japan-based pharmaceutical company which has been treading water of late. This year, TAK stock has tried many times to break out above the $15 level. When it failed in August, investors appear to have given up. Shares closed at $12.68 last week.On its conference call, Takeda hinted it would post strong first-quarter results. The firm posted improving margins. At a product level, the company’s management team is watching for revenue erosion from generic Velcade. This drug treats multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma.The drug firm needs its Entyvio drug, which treats ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease, to take market share. Additionally, Takeda is expected to launch a subcutaneous formulation of this drug in the U.S. in the next few years. In this market climate, investors are likely unwilling to wait that long for Takeda’s efforts to pay off.U.S. investors might prefer domestic drug stocks. That’s because domestic options generally remove currency exchange risks seen with Takeda. Indeed, the weakened Yen has already considerably hit the company’s margins. This could be exacerbated in the coming quarters.T. Rowe Price (TROW)T row price (TROW) logo magnified through a lens while displayed on a web browserSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comThe last entry on our list of dividend stocks to sell is investment management firm T. Rowe Price (NASDAQ:TROW). The stock market’s plunge is scaring investors. In August, the company posted a net outflow of $24.6 billion in the third quarter of 2022. The fewer dollars T. Row Price has to manage, the less revenue it collects from asset management fees.TROW stock faces significant selling pressure. Despite the stock’s dividend yielding 4.7% (which is above that of risk-free Treasury bonds), weak stock markets prospects has hit this company hard. Despite T. Rowe Price being a great asset management firm, in the short term, these macroeconomic headwinds are too great for its shareholders to overcome.The macro environment could get worse before it gets better. This increases the risk of a steeper sell-off in the stock. Now that the company’s price-earnings ratio is below 10 times, this stock actually shows promising value. That said, should a panic ensue in the stock market, I think the company’s price-earnings ratio could drop as low as 8-times earnings, implying 20% downside from here.This is a stock to take profits on and to add to the watch list. The company has good long-term prospects, once investors return to the stock market.On the date of publication, Chris Lau did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

We are committed to embracing DEI so everyone feels appreciated and valued. While we are proud of what we have achieved during our almost 50-year history, we know that DEI must always be at the forefront of our business strategy.In 2020, we established four consistent, strategic pillars across our enterprise to frame our DEI work and share our progress: Our People; Our Education and Engagement; Our Communities, Customers, and Suppliers; and Our Story. This year, we continued to align our strategy with these pillars by investing in programs, initiatives, and people across our workforce, culture, marketplace, and communities.Our peopleThe most important outcomes of our DEI efforts have been the opportunities created for our team members to grow and advance their careers. We actively invest in recruiting, developing, and retaining a diverse workforce that reflects the communities we serve. In FY21, our operating companies collaboratively participated in five enterprise-wide recruitment events, partnering with the National Black MBA Association, the Society for Women Engineers, Hiring Our Heroes, the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers, and the Society of Asian Scientists and Engineers to diversify our external talent pool. We are evaluating how to expand and connect with even more groups at an enterprise level.Our operating companies continued to advance and update their initiatives in support of our DEI strategy this year. The FedEx Ground workforce career path program, Purple Pathways, targets career growth and engagement of frontline managers and package handlers-our most diverse population. Over 11,000 team members are registered for the program, with more than 500 Purple Pathways mentors. FedEx Express launched OnDeck, a training and development program that provides front-line workers with skills to prepare for management roles.Story continuesSee the Data appendix for statistics on our workplace gender, race/ethnicity, and generational diversity. To further our transparency efforts regarding our workforce composition, in 2021 we began reporting the prior year gender, racial, and ethnic composition of our U.S. workforce by EEO-1 job category, as set forth in the consolidated EEO-1 Reports filed by FedEx and its operating subsidiaries with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.Our education and engagementWe strive to have a workplace where team members can bring their whole and best self to work. Through education, training, regular communications, and resources our team members are encouraged to maintain open dialogues that lead to an inclusive environment.Across our operating companies, our team members participate in employee-led business resource teams, employee networks, and affinity groups that help recruit, develop, and retain talent, create connections, and build community. Numerous networks are available to team members, including, but not limited to: Women in Leadership, Black Professionals Network, Hispanic Action Network, All-Generations, Multi-Ethnic Leadership Community, Asian Network, Women Leading Change, LGBT &amp; Friends, U.S. Military Veterans, Growing Professionals, Parents Working Together, EnABLE Network, Men Leading Inclusively, Multi-Faith Network, and many others.We continued to increase DEI education for team members this year by providing micro-learning DEI content across our operating companies. The DEI Real Talk Speaker Series, for officers and directors across the enterprise, is designed to foster acceptance, promote anti-biases, and encourage a more inclusive society. FedEx Ground launched SVP Real Conversations to prepare participants for the next level of leadership through Senior Vice President-hosted forums. FedEx Ground also hosted several Courageous Conversation sessions where leaders and team members candidly discussed DEI topics. FedEx Freight launched The Culture Brief &amp; DEI Tune-Up email and podcast to provide short content on DEI topics to leaders.This year, FedEx Services included five DEI questions in its engagement survey to capture team member perspectives on inclusion in the workplace. This overall inclusion index showed a 92% favorability rating and approximately 13,500 team members completed the survey. FedEx Ground also included a DEI engagement question in its annual engagement survey and added DEI as a standard goal in the FY22 team member annual performance review process. FedEx Express launched the Convene program, where a rotating group of four vice president- level diversity sponsors mentor other team members through a virtual mentoring program.Our commitment to diversity starts at the topThe FedEx Board of Directors includes 12 directors, four of whom are women and four of whom are ethnically diverse. In the U.S., women represent 27% of FedEx management employees, while 41% of management employees are minorities.Our communities, customers, and suppliers Our commitment to DEI extends beyond our business-it is an investment we make to serve and support our communities, customers, and suppliers. We are proud to have contributed more than $7 million to non-profit organizations focused on supporting DEI in FY21.We provide more than $1 million annually for leadership development programs in the U.S., mainly through seven scholarship funds. We also sponsor endowed scholarships at four Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs): Tennessee State University, Jackson State University, LeMoyne-Owen College, and Mississippi Valley State University. These funds provide scholarships that range from $1,000 to $25,000 annually to more than 120 college and university students across various STEM, business, and specialist disciplines.This year, we continued our longstanding support of HBCUs by providing $5 million to a group of HBCUs across the country to help prepare students for the workforce beyond formal education. Additionally, in 2022 we launched the FedEx-HBCU Student Ambassador Program, which will prepare students at HBCUs to be future leaders by interacting with FedEx executives and building leadership and career-ready skills.Across our operating companies and in cooperation with key organizations, we recruit candidates from a variety of backgrounds to build a workforce that reflects the world and communities we serve. The FedEx Services College Connections program builds relationships with college campuses in close proximity to main FedEx Services geographies to effectively compete for talent. FedEx Freight implements ""The Boardroom Experience"" to introduce Black, Hispanic, and other students of color to career possibilities at FedEx through a simulated board meeting. Additionally, FedEx Ground created a six-session High School Pathways program to expose high school students to various FedEx Ground careers and prepare them to transition from high school into the workforce.In June, our operating companies came together for Pride Month by creating a leadership-led video series showcasing our commitment to the LGBTQ+ community, designing a FedEx Cares Pride logo, and introducing pronouns into our email signature line. We also pledged $2.5 million to The Asian American Foundation to support Asian American and Pacific Islander communities across the U.S. We are proud to support diverse businesses and know that our suppliers enable us to better serve our customers and compete more effectively in the global marketplace. We formed our Supplier Diversity program in 1992 to formalize our commitment to a supply chain that intentionally develops small and minority-owned businesses. Furthermore, in the U.S., FedEx has hosted a Small Business Grant Contest for the past 10 years.In 2021, we gave away over $250,000 in grants and prizes to contest winners-of which 50% was given to minority-owned businesses and more than 75% was given to woman-owned businesses. To learn more about our Supplier Diversity program, please see the Our supply chain section of this report.Our storyFedEx amplifies team member stories to celebrate our differences and promote DEI efforts across the enterprise. Our DEI Depot is an enterprise-wide online platform where team members can access DEI resources, events, and team member stories. FedEx Corporate, FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, and FedEx Services circulate a quarterly DEI Download newsletter, which provides managers and leaders with useful insights and resources to promote DEI conversations within their teams.

You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods, please click here&gt;&gt;&gt;Here are the key points:·        The picture emerging from the 2022 Q3 earnings season continues to go against pre-season fears of an impending earnings cliff. Overall corporate profitability isn't great, but it isn't bad either.·        For the 170 S&amp;P 500 members that have reported Q3 results already, total earnings are down -3.2% from the same period last year on +9.7% higher revenues, with 76.5% beating EPS estimates and 67.6% beating revenue estimates.·        The earnings and revenue growth rate for these 170 companies compares modestly favorably to what we had seen from the same group of companies in the first half of the year.·        Looking at the calendar-year picture, total S&amp;P 500 earnings are expected to be up +6.3% in 2022 and +5.1% in 2023. On an ex-Energy basis, total 2022 index earnings would be down -0.4% (instead of +6.3%, with Energy).We continue to see the ongoing Q3 earnings season as a replay of what we witnessed in the June-quarter reporting cycle, when estimates and sentiment had weakened so much that the actual results ended up looking a lot better in comparison.Having seen results from about a third of S&amp;P 500 members by now, we can see that results are by no means great, but they are not bad either. It is all about expectations and those had been adjusted lower ahead of the start of this earnings season.Story continuesImportantly, many in the market appeared ready for earnings to 'fall off the cliff', with management teams guiding lower. We have seen some of that, but for the most part the long-feared development has not materialized, at least not yet.The banks got us off to a good start this reporting cycle, with most of them not only coming out with strong Q3 results but also providing reassuring commentary for Q4. Results from other spaces like food and beverage operators and the air carriers were also broadly favorable. The strong UPS UPS results and reaffirmed guidance confirmed that FedEx's FDX doom-and-gloom report earlier was mostly due to company-specific factors.At the risk of repeating ourselves, earnings are by no means great and a broad-based slowdown is unfolding in front of us. Take Tech for example, where the early signs are pointing to some chinks in the armor from the likes of Microsoft MSFT whose guidance for the cloud computing business was on the weaker side. This comes on top of the slowing trend in digital advertising that we saw again in the Alphabet GOOGL report.We knew coming into the Microsoft release that its PC-centric business faced rougher seas given the post-Covid drop off in PC demand, but the tell-tale signs of moderation in cloud demand may have read-through for other vendors in the space like Amazon AMZN. Importantly, it would suggest that the Tech sector's weak spots may not be restricted to digital advertising and semiconductors but might also include other areas of enterprise spending.The cost headwinds have been with us for a while, as have the foreign-exchange translation issues. All of this collectively is weighing on estimates for the current and coming periods, as we have been pointing out in this space.We saw this in the run up to the start of the Q3 earnings season and the trend continues with respect to estimates for the current period (2022 Q4) and full-year 2023. The charts below show how earnings growth expectations for the 2022 Q4, as a whole and on an ex-Energy basis, have evolved in recent weeks.Aggregate S&amp;P 500 earnings outside of the Energy sector have declined -8.1% since mid-April, with double-digit percentage declines in Retail, Construction, Consumer Discretionary, and Tech. Estimates have been coming down in the Industrial Products, Medical and Transportation sectors as well.The Overall Earnings PicturePlease note that a big part of this year's growth is thanks to the strong momentum in the Energy sector whose earnings are on track to grow +138.7%. Excluding this extraordinary Energy sector contribution, earnings growth for the rest of the index would be down -0.4%. This relatively flat earnings picture for this year is also in-line with the economic ground reality.Earnings next year are expected to be up +5.1% as a whole and +6.8% excluding the Energy sector. This magnitude of growth can hardly be called out-of-sync with a flat or even modestly down economic growth outlook. Don't forget that headline GDP growth numbers are in real or inflation-adjusted terms while S&amp;P 500 earnings discussed here are not.As mentioned earlier, 2023 aggregate earnings estimates on an ex-Energy basis are already down -8.1% since mid-April. Perhaps we see a bit more downward adjustments to estimates over the coming weeks, after we have seen Q3 results. But we have nevertheless already covered some ground in taking estimates to a fair or appropriate level.This is particularly so if whatever economic downturn lies ahead proves to be more of the garden variety rather than the last two such events. Recency bias forces us to use the last two economic downturns, which were also among the nastiest in recent history, as our reference points. But we need to be cautious against that natural tendency as the economy's foundations at present remain unusually strong.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

Many investors view the 30 stocks that make up the Dow as the bluest of blue chips, and it is a good starting point for looking for investment opportunities because membership in the Dow essentially screens out low-quality companies.

But in the case of the software company, it’s not annoyed customers critiquing restaurants, but employees reviewing their managers.Flipping the power switch, Salesforce has an internal scoreboard that tracks effectiveness among managers with more than five direct reports based on biannual surveys from employees. Around since pre-pandemic times and updated two years ago, it’s used as more of a leadership development tool than a performance tool, a Salesforce spokesperson explained to Fortune.This “leadership score,” as Brent Hyder, president and chief people officer at Salesforce, described it to the Wall Street Journal, has worked: 90% of Salesforce workers feel their bosses are helping them be more successful, Hyder said, adding that the scoreboard pressures managers to hold one-on-ones and manage appropriately.Sometimes reviews or feedback can feel like throwing a shoe into a long hallway: ineffective. But Salesforce’s scoreboard is making a clear difference for several reasons. For one, it’s accessible to all employees, making it easier for them to know what manager they want to work for if they’re switching teams, the spokesperson said. It also increases transparency and holds managers to their word.“People here do take it so seriously,” the spokesperson said. “It helps you be accountable all year long too, because if you are not doing right by your team, then people are [going to] know, including your boss and your boss's boss, and anyone else at the company who cares to look into it.”This doesn’t mean managers with a bad score get fired; rather it’s a learning opportunity and a time to check in with one’s team, they added.The also attributed the success of manager effectiveness to Salesforce’s new management training program, which offers leadership courses meant to sharpen hybrid skills—24,000 managers joined, per the Journal.These courses come at a time when managers are feeling more stress than ever. The middleman is often given the task of bridging the gap in communication between executives and employees, often stuck implementing return-to-office plans. All this extra work has led to middle-manager burnout.Story continues“We’re hearing people say, ‘We’d like to encourage teams to come back.’ You need to be clear about why they’re doing it,” Jane, a customer service operations manager, told the Financial Times. “Otherwise it is just putting pressure on middle managers.”Even Salesforce noticed during the pandemic that its leadership scores started to dip as managers became more burnt-out.“This was in direct response to what we were seeing during the pandemic, that managers and particularly middle managers were struggling the most, because they lack the resources of our most senior leaders,” explained the Salesforce spokesperson. “And then their jobs completely changed.”Being a middle manager was already a stressful job pre-pandemic, thanks to switching modes between teams and bosses. But the changes in social norms have led to increased anxiety and depression among people in this position, according to research from Columbia University and the University of Toronto. These days, managers feel added pressure as we return to the office and navigate new workplace dynamics.As Hyder told the Journal, “Managers have always been important, but they’ve never been this important.”This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: I proudly wake up at 8:59 a.m., one minute before starting my remote work job.

You can skip our detailed analysis of Berkshire Hathaway's strategy and Warren Buffett's background and go directly to the 5 Best Value Stocks To Buy According To Warren Buffett.Born in 1930 in Omaha, Nebraska, Warren Buffett is considered the most successful investor in history. Popularly known as the ""Oracle of Omaha,"" he is the sixth wealthiest person in the world, with a net worth of $95 billion.After Buffett was denied admission by Harvard Business School, he went on to complete his Masters in economics at Columbia University. Buffett learned the principles of investing from his mentor Ben Graham at Columbia. Graham's ""value investing"" included searching for companies that were trading at a significant discount to their ""intrinsic value,"" or the worth of their underlying assets. Buffett internalized the concept and added to the ideas of Ben Graham by theorizing that the quality of the company's management and the product's competitive edge in the market are key factors in evaluating companies.Warren Buffett created Buffett Partnership, Ltd in 1956. In 1969, he purchased Berkshire Hathaway, a textile manufacturing business, and transformed it into a diversified holding corporation.  Since 1970, Buffett has served as Berkshire Hathaway's chairman and biggest shareholder. Berkshire Hathaway is the parent firm of a number of other companies, including the insurance provider Geico, and has significant investments in a number of Fortune 500 corporations.Berkshire Hathaway's investment principles include having a long-time horizon which is why some of its holdings have been in the portfolio for over several decades.

The company leveraged strong revenue growth with strong operating profit margin improvement of 200 bps, with EPS coming in $0.22 ahead of consensus estimates. Management alluded to having interesting opportunities in their M&amp;A pipeline, which we will have to assess when the time comes, but Moody's management team has been very effective at allocating capital in the past toward value-creating bolt-on acquisitions, especially in their Moody's Analytics business, a key growth driver for the company.7.

The quarter’s EPS lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 38.5%.GAAP EPS for the quarter was 93 cents, down from the year-ago EPS of $2.28, reflecting a 59.2% decline year over year.RevenuesRevenues declined 12.4% year over year to $890.3 million in the quarter and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8.1%. According to the company, increasing inflation, rising interest rates, and less patient traffic and dental practices are lengthening sales cycles and conversion time, hampering sales significantly. Further, a significant impact from unfavorable foreign exchange rates across all currencies affected the company’s operations.At constant exchange rate or CER, total revenues in the third quarter dropped 6.1% year over year – one of the largest foreign exchange impacts Align has ever experienced in one quarter.Segments in DetailIn the third quarter, revenues at the Clear Aligner segment were down 12.5% year over year to $732.8 million. Revenues were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange translation of approximately $47.4 million or 6.1% year over year. Within the segment, Invisalign case shipments amounted to 577,170, down 11.9% year over year.Align Technology, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseAlign Technology, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseAlign Technology, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Align Technology, Inc. QuoteRevenues from Imaging Systems &amp; CAD/CAM Services were down 11.7% to $157.5 million in the quarter. Lower scanner volume was partially offset by higher services revenues from a larger installed base. Revenues witnessed an unfavorable currency impact of 5.9% year over year.MarginsGross profit in the third quarter was $619.2 million, reflecting an 18% decline year over year. Gross margin in the quarter under review contracted 479 basis points (bps) year over year to 69.5% on a 3.9% uptick in cost of net revenues.Story continuesDuring the quarter, Align Technology witnessed a 6.9% year-over-year fall in selling, general and administrative expenses to $398.5 million and a 17.3% rise in research and development expenses to $76.9 million.Operating income in the quarter under review was $143.6 million, indicating a decline of 44.9%. The operating margin contracted 957 bps to 16.1%.Financial DetailsAlign Technology exited the third quarter of 2022 with cash, cash equivalents of $1.04 billion compared with $877.5 million recorded at the end of Q2.Cumulative net cash provided by operating activities at the end of the quarter was $424 million compared with $899.6 million a year ago.The company did not make any share repurchases during Q3. Currently, Align Technology has $450.0 million remaining for repurchase under its existing $1.0 billion repurchase program. The company plans to repurchase up to $200.0 million of its common stock in the fourth quarter.GuidanceAlign Technology expects to report below its 2022 GAAP operating margin target of 20%, which considers the impact from the current unfavorable foreign exchange of approximately two to three points that was not factored into the operating margin guidance for 2022, which was given back in April.For 2022, the company continues to expect investments in capital expenditures to exceed $300 million. Capital expenditures primarily relate to building construction and improvements, as well as additional manufacturing capacity to support Align Technology’s international expansion.Our TakeAlign Technology registered dismal revenue and EPS performance in the third quarter of 2022 with both metrics missing the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate and declining significantly on a year-over-year basis. The sluggish results were due to a dull underlying market, which, per management, was impacted by macroeconomic environmental factors and extremely unfavorable currency translation. The quarter witnessed the largest foreign exchange impact that Align has ever experienced in one quarter.The contraction of both margins is worrisome. The volatility surrounding inflationary pressure,weaker consumer confidence, the lingering impacts of COVID-19 shutdowns, primarily in China and Japan, and other macroeconomic headwinds continue to pose challenges for the company.Zacks Rank and Key PicksAlign Technology currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are Elevance Health, Inc.

The stock's dividend yield on October 20 came in at 2.86%.Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) is also one of the largest oil companies in the world, as it produces 3.5 million barrels of oil per day and has an equally impressive portfolio of 46,000 gas stations. It also used the recent oil price increases to decrease its debt by 45%. According to experts, Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) balance sheet is strong and its debt load is reasonable. JPMorgan analyst Christian Malek on October 13 reiterated an Overweight rating on Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) but lowered the price target on the shares to 2,900 GBp from 3,000 GBp.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 39 hedge funds were long Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) at the end of the second quarter of 2022, compared to 37 funds in the prior quarter. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management held the leading stake in the company, consisting of 20.25 million shares worth over $1 billion.Here’s what Third Point Management said about Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“We have continued to add to our position in Shell, as it trades at the same deeply discounted multiple today that it did last year due to a move up in commodity prices. We are engaged in discussions with management, board members, and other shareholders, as well as informal talks with financial advisors. We have discussed various alternatives with the aim of both increasing shareholder value and allowing Shell to effectively manage the energy transition. We have reiterated our view that Shell’s portfolio of disparate businesses ranging from deep water oil to wind farms to gas stations to chemical plants is confusing and unmanageable. Most investors we have discussed this with agree that the company would be more successful over the long term with a different corporate structure. Discussions among the parties have been constructive and will be ongoing since stakeholders clearly see these corporate changes as instrumental, particularly if Shell wishes to become a leader in the energy transition rather than be left behind as a tarnished legacy brand.Beyond our discussions around corporate structure, there have been two important developments since our last update. First, Shell announced a plan to redomicile its headquarters to the UK and create a single shareholder class. This move allows greater flexibility to modify its portfolio (either through asset sales or spin-offs) and allows for a more efficient return of capital, specifically via share repurchases. Second, fundamental and geopolitical events have highlighted the strategic importance of reliable energy supplies, especially in Europe. Shell’s LNG business, the largest in the world outside of Qatar, will play a critical role in ensuring energy security for Europe. In our view, the value of this business has increased dramatically since our original investment.While Shell continues to trade at a large discount to its intrinsic value, with proper management we believe the company can simultaneously deliver shareholder returns, reliable energy and decarbonization of the global economy. We look forward to continued engagement with management and other shareholders and to more strategic clarity from the Company.”06.

For more companies, head on over to 5 Biggest Data Science Companies In USA. Big data analytics, also known as data science, is one of the hottest fields in information technology. This is due to the fact that it is nearly ubiquitous across industries, and the growth and popularity of the Internet has led to vast sums of data being generated daily for advertisers to capitalize on.Estimates show that the amount of data that is generated globally will grow to unbelievable amounts. Research firm IDC believes that global data will grow at a stunning compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 61% between 2018 and 2025, to 175 zettabytes by 2025. For the uninitiated, a gigabyte of information contains 1024 megabytes, and a zettabyte has roughly 1,100 trillion megabytes - much larger than your daily Internet usage we'd assume. To better understand the significance of IDC's estimates, if all this data was written onto blu-ray disks, then these disks could be stacked to the Moon 23 times over.This growth has also spurred a strong interest in the field itself, with the Department of Labor estimating that the data science sector is expected to grow by 26% through 2026. Naturally, this growth will also boost salaries in the field, and the average salary for the field sits at $111,000 in the U.S. right now. Finally, looking at the sector as a whole, Markets and Markets estimates that the data science platform market was worth $95 billion last year, and between then and 2026, it will grow at a CAGR of 27.7% to be worth $322.9 billion. It further outlines that the growth in the business and finance sectors will lead the way for the industry.Therefore, it's fairly accurate to say that the data science sector has a great future ahead of it, and in today's piece we have narrowed down the top data science companies.

The strong dollar has been a particular headwind.Growth in Amazon Web Services (AWS), the firm's lucrative cloud unit serving enterprises, has ticked down consistently in the past four quarters, adjusted for changes in forex.Net sales in the business grew 28% in the July-September period versus 39% a year earlier, the slowest since the fourth quarter of 2020. They fell short of a 31% average analysts' forecast.Amazon shares slumped 12% after the bell on Thursday after it forecast a slowdown in sales growth for the holiday season, erasing some $140 billion from its market value and capping a week of dismal earnings from global tech firms.""The AWS slowdown is a clear sign that businesses are beginning to trim costs, so this will likely put more of a squeeze on Amazon's bottom line in the coming quarters,"" said Andrew Lipsman, principal analyst at Insider Intelligence.Microsoft's cloud business Azure, which had supercharged revenue growth at the software giant for years, dropped to 35% growth in the July-September quarter from 50% a year earlier, missing estimates of a 36.5% increase according to Visible Alpha.The company projected another drop in the holiday quarter.Alphabet's Google Cloud revenue grew 38% in the quarter, beating estimates. That was a silver lining in an otherwise gloomy quarter but a far cry from the 45% growth the company posted a year earlier.Story continuesEUROPE, CHINA DRAGSpeaking broadly about cloud deployments from AWS, Microsoft and Google-parent Alphabet, YipitData research specialist Matt Wegner said: ""We really first started to see (a slowdown) in April ... and it's continued. The European region is a source of weakness.""Eurozone inflation is close to 10% and European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde on Thursday acknowledged that the risk of an economic contraction is on the rise due to soaring energy prices and higher interest rates.Intel, which makes chips for data center customers including AWS, said third-quarter revenue from that business slumped 27% and profits were nearly wiped out. The business was hurt partly due to soft demand from Chinese enterprise customers, Intel boss Pat Gelsinger said.The company cut its profit and revenue forecast for the year, reflecting economic uncertainty that Gelsinger said he expected to last into next year and that it was taking time to ramp up sales into datacenters.Cloud services typically help companies save money so budget cuts in this sector could be especially worrying, indicating that companies think cost is king going into tougher times.Businesses usually build out more cloud and datacenter capacity than needed and then wait for it to be absorbed, said Dean McCarron, president of Mercury Research, which tracks chipmakers.""The ""build more"" happened in 2021 and we've been coasting down since then,"" said McCarron. He added that he expects Intel's datacenter weakness to be bottoming soon ""though there are larger macroeconomic concerns about how much improvement we might see on the next growth cycle.""(Reporting by Tiyashi Datta and Chavi Mehta in Bengaluru, Jeffrey Dastin in Palo Alto and Jane Lanhee Lee in Oakland, California; Writing by Sayantani Ghosh; Editing by Richard Pullin)]"

(NASDAQ:HQI) is a leading provider of on-demand labor and staffing solutions in the United States, with a nationwide network of branches. The company offers a flexible and convenient solution for businesses of all sizes that need skilled workers for a variety of positions, including industrial, commercial, and construction.

The hedge fund sentiment for the stock is positive.Here is what Rhizome Partners had to say about HireQuest, Inc. (NASDAQ:HQI) in its second-quarter 2022 investor letter:“Our smaller positions in both HireQuest and Cross Country Healthcare are trading around 10 times normalized P/FCF multiples. Both companies have long growth runways and are led by talented CEOs. The ongoing maintenance capital expenditures of both companies are minimal. We keep looking for ways to disprove both investment theses and have a hard time coming up with valid reasons. HireQuest is more cyclical because it’s tied to blue collar temporary staffing. But HireQuest has the unique know-how to acquire staffing companies and convert them into high-performing franchises. HireQuest has consistently paid about 5 times P/FCF multiple for the acquisitions. Adjusting for sales of branches locations to franchisees, the P/FCF multiple falls even further. The current acquisition strategy is better than a greenfield approach as the acquired free cashflow yield is over 20% and HireQuest does not have to compete for market share. We believe the company can grow to five times its current size, with little share-count dilution.”8. Heidrick &amp; Struggles International, Inc.

We expect continued robust demand for ASGN’s solutions given its focus on staffing areas with strong secular growth, chronic shortages of skilled IT workers, and the ongoing digital transformation of U.S. businesses. ASGN is better insulated from economic headwinds than traditional staffing providers given its significant exposure to more stable, counter-cyclical government work and the mission-critical nature of its IT infrastructure work and longer-term consulting engagements.Management is not seeing any change in tone from its clients, demand remains strong, and pipeline growth is still accelerating. Wage inflation is being offset by higher billing rates, which are being successfully passed through to customers. ASGN is rapidly expanding its solution capabilities, which in turn expands the scope of work for which it can compete and presents new cross-selling opportunities. The company is tracking ahead of its three-year $6 billion revenue target (including $4.9 billion organic revenue growth) which was set just this past September.We believe investors do not appreciate ASGN’s differentiated positioning and remain optimistic about the outlook for the company. Trading at around 8.5 times 2023 adjusted cash flow, we think the shares are incredibly cheap.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Staffing Company Stocks To Buy Now. Suggested articles:10 Best Stocks Under $1012 Best Stocks To Buy Under $5010 Biggest ETF Providers in USADisclosure: None. 10 Best Staffing Company Stocks To Buy Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

USFD, Signet Jewelers SIG, Celestica CLS, Delek US Holdings DK and HF Sinclair Corp. DINO.4 Low Price-to-Book Stocks to Build Your PortfolioPrice to earnings (P/E) and price to sales (P/S) are the first ratios that come to an investor's mind while narrowing down a list of undervalued stocks. However, the price-to-book ratio (P/B ratio), though underrated, is also an easy-to-use valuation tool for identifying low-priced stocks with high-growth prospects.P/B ratio is calculated as below:P/B ratio = market capitalization/book value of equity.The P/B ratio helps to identify low-priced stocks that have high growth prospects. US Foods Holding Corp., Signet Jewelers, Celestica, Delek US Holdings and HF Sinclair Corp. are some such stocks.Now let us understand the concept of book value.What's Book Value?Book value is the total value that would be left over, according to the company's balance sheet, if it goes bankrupt immediately. In other words, this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off all its liabilities.It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company. In most cases, this equates to the common stockholders' equity on the balance sheet. However, depending on the company's balance sheet, intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine book value.Understanding P/B RatioBy comparing the book value of equity to its market price, we get an idea of whether a company is under-or overpriced. However, like P/E or P/S ratio, it is always better to compare P/B ratios within industries.A P/B ratio of less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value, or the stock is undervalued and, therefore a good buy. Conversely, a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive.Story continuesFor example, a stock with a P/B ratio of 2 means that we pay $2 for every $1 of book value. Thus, the higher the P/B, the more expensive the stock.But there is a caveat. A P/B ratio of less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets or that the assets are overstated, in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value. Conversely, the stock's price may be significantly high — thereby pushing the P/B ratio to more than one — in the likely case that it has become a takeover target, a good enough reason to own the stock.Moreover, the P/B ratio isn't without limitations. It is useful for businesses — like finance, investments, insurance, and banking or manufacturing companies — with many liquid/tangible assets on the books. However, it can be misleading for firms with significant R&amp;D expenditure, high debt, service companies, or those with negative earnings.In any case, the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number. One should analyze other ratios like P/E, P/S, and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision.Here are our five picks out of the eight stocks that qualified the screening: US Foods Holding is a foodservice distributor.

(NYSE:WDAY), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT).9. HireQuest, Inc. (NASDAQ:HQI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 5HireQuest, Inc. (NASDAQ:HQI) is a leading provider of on-demand labor and staffing solutions in the United States, with a nationwide network of branches. The company offers a flexible and convenient solution for businesses of all sizes that need skilled workers for a variety of positions, including industrial, commercial, and construction.

(NASDAQ:HQI) in its second-quarter 2022 investor letter:“Our smaller positions in both HireQuest and Cross Country Healthcare are trading around 10 times normalized P/FCF multiples. Both companies have long growth runways and are led by talented CEOs. The ongoing maintenance capital expenditures of both companies are minimal. We keep looking for ways to disprove both investment theses and have a hard time coming up with valid reasons. HireQuest is more cyclical because it’s tied to blue collar temporary staffing. But HireQuest has the unique know-how to acquire staffing companies and convert them into high-performing franchises. HireQuest has consistently paid about 5 times P/FCF multiple for the acquisitions. Adjusting for sales of branches locations to franchisees, the P/FCF multiple falls even further. The current acquisition strategy is better than a greenfield approach as the acquired free cashflow yield is over 20% and HireQuest does not have to compete for market share. We believe the company can grow to five times its current size, with little share-count dilution.”8. Heidrick &amp; Struggles International, Inc.

We expect continued robust demand for ASGN’s solutions given its focus on staffing areas with strong secular growth, chronic shortages of skilled IT workers, and the ongoing digital transformation of U.S. businesses. ASGN is better insulated from economic headwinds than traditional staffing providers given its significant exposure to more stable, counter-cyclical government work and the mission-critical nature of its IT infrastructure work and longer-term consulting engagements.Management is not seeing any change in tone from its clients, demand remains strong, and pipeline growth is still accelerating. Wage inflation is being offset by higher billing rates, which are being successfully passed through to customers. ASGN is rapidly expanding its solution capabilities, which in turn expands the scope of work for which it can compete and presents new cross-selling opportunities. The company is tracking ahead of its three-year $6 billion revenue target (including $4.9 billion organic revenue growth) which was set just this past September.We believe investors do not appreciate ASGN’s differentiated positioning and remain optimistic about the outlook for the company. Trading at around 8.5 times 2023 adjusted cash flow, we think the shares are incredibly cheap.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Staffing Company Stocks To Buy Now. Suggested articles:10 Best Stocks Under $1012 Best Stocks To Buy Under $5010 Biggest ETF Providers in USADisclosure: None. 10 Best Staffing Company Stocks To Buy Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

(NDLS) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 3, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis restaurant chain is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.05 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -58.3%.Revenues are expected to be $127.06 million, up 1.5% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Noodles &amp; Co.For Noodles &amp; Co.The Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +31.25%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination indicates that Noodles &amp; Co. Will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Noodles &amp; Co. Would post earnings of $0.07 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.05, delivering a surprise of -28.57%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release.

Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for MGP?For MGP, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -3.83%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that MGP will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that MGP would post earnings of $0.88 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.15, delivering a surprise of +30.68%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.MGP doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAnother stock from the Zacks Food - Miscellaneous industry, Sysco (SYY), is soon expected to post earnings of $0.99 per share for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +19.3%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $18.63 billion, up 13.2% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Sysco has been revised 0.2% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -2.02%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Sysco will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This compares to earnings of $1.13 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -1.67%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this utility would post earnings of $0.60 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.60, delivering no surprise.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates just once.Xcel , which belongs to the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry, posted revenues of $4.08 billion for the quarter ended September 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 13.54%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $3.47 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Xcel shares have lost about 7.6% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -19.6%.What's Next for Xcel?While Xcel has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook.

If you want to skip our primer on penny stocks and need to jump ahead to the top five stocks in this list, then take a look at 5 Most Successful Penny Stocks That Made It Big. The world of investing is full of tricks and opportunities, and the massive success of a handful of firms on the stock market has made their founders and investors billionaires. The market is responsible for producing some of the richest individuals in history, such as the founder of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) Mr. Bill Gates, and the electric vehicle billionaire Mr. Elon Musk. At the same time, it has also caused others painful losses.These fantastic gains continue to draw large amounts of attention from retail investors in particular, and one segment that catches a lot of this interest is the penny stock sector. Defined as those stocks that trade at less than $5 per share by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), droves of investors flock to these stocks as the low share price presents an attractive entry point and even small gains can result in large profits.When evaluating a penny stock, some metrics take precedence over others. Mostly these stocks either belong to firms will small market shares and revenues or those that are struggling. These factors require careful stock picking, and a look at the balance sheet and the cash flow statement can provide useful tools to sift out any potential problems. For example, through the Debt Ratio, which analyses a firm's total debt with its total assets, an investor can determine if a company is overly leveraged and has taken on too much debt. Too much debt not only ends up burdening the income statement in the form of interest payments, but it also affects payouts to shareholders in case a firm ceases to be a going concern since debt holders get the first priority for payments.Another ratio, which is especially useful for a penny stock, is the price to cash flow ratio. A firm's cash flow is the amount that is left for investors after its expenses are deducted, and when the share price is divided by the cash flow per share, an estimate of the 'market premium' for the share price can be determined. The usefulness of this metric lies in the fact that if a company has sound fundamentals, then it might see its share price jump in the future if there is little premium to it at the time of investment.Story continuesToday's piece focuses on some of the most successful penny stocks in history, and these firms have seen their share prices jump exponentially since they were first listed. Among these, the top performers are Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA).Our MethodologyWe took a look at the countless companies that have made it big on the stock market and then found out the share price at which they had started to trade or the lowest share price in their trading history, after accounting for stock splits. These companies once traded as penny stocks but have now grown to become major players in the market. The companies are then ranked through hedge fund holdings courtesy of Insider Monkey's Q2 2022 survey of 895 hedge funds.10 Most Successful Penny Stocks That Made It Big10. GameStop Corp.

Stronger changes might be afoot at the company too since the renowned activist investor Carl Icahn is rumored to be interested in its affairs.Jefferies kept its $26 share price target for GameStop Corp.

This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis energy drink maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.58 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -7.9%.Revenues are expected to be $1.65 billion, up 16.7% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.24% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Monster Beverage?For Monster Beverage, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -2.92%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Monster Beverage will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Monster Beverage would post earnings of $0.68 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.51, delivering a surprise of -25%.The company has not been able to beat consensus EPS estimates in any of the last four quarters.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Monster Beverage doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

And he never worked for a company that gave him stock options.How'd He Do It? According to an interview with him on Marketwatch conducted by Adam Seessel, CIO of Gravity Capital Management, he didn't even start investing until he was in his 40s.Avedisian, according to Marketwatch, was a self-taught investor who read investing books, the Wall Street Journal and Investor Business Daily, and watched CNBC and Bloomberg on cable tv.He liked IPOs and would read the IPO prospectuses in his spare time.While he didn't tell Marketwatch what his exact investments were, he did say they were well-known companies that everyone would recognize.Tracey has some ideas about what he might have bought.5 Big Caps an Investor Could Have Bought Over the Last 40 Years1.       Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) The first thing Tracey thought when she saw the headline about a retired musician having a portfolio worth $170 million was that he could have been an early investor in Berkshire Hathaway.Story continuesThere have been many Berkshire Hathaway millionaires revealed over the years. These were people who were early investors and held the stock for decades. In 2004, the New York Times interviewed some of them including one man who bought shares at $175 in 1978 and still owned some in 2004. They were trading at $93,000 per share at that time.What if he had held on until 2022?$10,000 invested in Berkshire Hathaway on Jan 3, 1978 and held through Oct 25, 2022, were up 166,896% and would be worth $16.69 million.But Mr Avedisian told Marketwatch that while he DID own shares of Berkshire over the years, it wasn't the main catalyst behind the portfolio.2.       Microsoft (MSFT) Mr. Avedisian did mention Microsoft and Bill Gates in the article. Could he have bought the Microsoft IPO in 1986?$10,000 invested in the Microsoft IPO in 1986 through Oct 25, 2022, would have been up 261,000% and worth $26.1 million. That doesn't get you to $170 million. But what if an investor had put in $100,000? It would be worth $260 million.There are a lot of Microsoft millionaires out there.3.       Amazon (AMZN) Or maybe Mr. Avedisian bought the Amazon IPO in 1997. It's been a bit rockier for Amazon over those years, however.$10,000 invested in Amazon at the IPO and held through Oct 25, 2022 is up 160,699% and would be worth $16.06 million. (On the podcast, Tracey has a much lower number which isn't correct.) But just a year ago these numbers would have been much higher before the shares slid in 2022.But there are still many ""Amazon millionaires"" out there who have stayed the course. Was Mr. Avedisian one of them?4.       Monster Beverage (MNST) Monster Beverage also had an IPO in the 1990s. Perhaps Mr. Avedisian bought that one? Monster Beverage would go on to be one of the top performing S&amp;P 500 stocks of the last 30 years.$10,000 invested in the Monster Beverage IPO on Aug 18, 1995 and held through Oct 25, 2022, would be up 319,874%. That would be $32 million.Few people talk about the wealth generator that was Monster Beverage over the last 27 years.5.       ExxonMobil (XOM) But not all big cap companies have been stock market winners. Take the example of ExxonMobil. In the 1970s, when Mr. Avedisian started investing, the best performing sector was energy.But ExxonMobil has had big periods of underperformance which have hurt returns of long-term investors.$10,000 invested in ExxonMobil on Jan 3, 1978 and held through Oct 25, 2022, would be up 3,591% and would be worth $359,000.That doesn't sound so bad, right? However, the S&amp;P 500 was up 4209% during the same time. An investor could have just bought the index.Finding the big winning stocks isn't as easy as Mr. Avedisian makes it seem.What Else Should You Know About This Amazing Stock Investor?

Rafael Cosquiere / PexelsSouthwest Airlines reported a record setting third quarter on Thursday in spite of a pilot shortage that’s preventing the carrier from running its full pre-pandemic flight schedules.“In the other areas, we aren’t perfect, but we’re nearly staffed. We are just short on pilots to fly all our aircraft,” said CEO Bob Jordan said Thursday on CNBC program Squawk Box. Pilot shortages were one of the factors that slowed down the U.S. airline industry’s recovery this summer.Jordan added Southwest isn’t lacking qualified candidates to fill its pilot shortages, noting all of its training centers are full. But they acknowledge they wouldn’t be ready until late next year.“If we had all the pilots that we needed, we could probably fly 5 to 8 percent more (available seat miles) in capacity.”Jordan spoke after Southwest reported record revenue of $6.2 billion in its third quarter earnings call on Thursday. The company also recorded a net income of $277 million. Southwest’s successful quarter came despite the carrier experiencing a 2 percent crop in capacity from the same timeframe in 2019.“It’s a great quarter,” Jordan said. “We’ve got record revenues. We’ve got record passengers. We tied for a record load factor.”He added that Southwest expects the trends boosting the company’s revenue to continue into the fourth quarter. The carrier expects revenue for the fourth quarter to jump up to 17 percent from 2019 levels, citing a bump in post-Labor Day business travel.Southwest is preparing for a surge in bookings while it deals with delays in the delivery of its Boeing aircraft. However, Jordan believes the issue of whether the planemaker can meet a late December deadline for certification of new MAX 7 shouldn’t affect aircraft deliveries to Southwest.“Even though we are off our delivery plan with Boeing, because we are still pilot constrained, it is not affecting our capacity,” he said.Southwest plans to expand its first quarter capacity by 10 percent and its second quarter capacity by 14 percent. The company also expects to hit 90 percent of its pre-pandemic flight schedule by next summer and fully restore it by December.Get breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.]"

Capacity or available seat miles (ASMs) climbed 1.3% year over year to 39.27 billion. The load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) improved to 85.4% from 80.7% in the year-ago quarter as traffic growth outweighed capacity expansion.Passenger revenue per available seat mile (PRASM: a key measure of unit revenues) ascended 31% year over year to 14.29 cents. Revenue per available seat mile (RASM) improved 31.2% to 15.84 cents.Operating Expenses &amp; IncomeIn the third quarter, Southwest incurred an operating income (as reported) of $395 million compared with $733 million in the year-ago period. On an adjusted basis (excluding special items), the company reported an operating income of $425 million against a loss of $59 million. Total adjusted operating expenses (excluding profit sharing, special items, and fuel and oil expenses) increased 9.8%.Story continuesFuel cost per gallon (inclusive of fuel tax: economic) rose 68.7% to $3.39. However, consolidated unit cost or cost per available seat mile (CASM) excluding fuel, oil and profit-sharing expenses, and special items, increased 8.4% year over year.LiquiditySouthwest Airlines ended the third quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $10,443 million compared with $13,234 million at the end of June 2022. As of Sep 30, 2022, the company had long-term debt (less current maturities) of $8,315 million compared with $8,877 million at the end of June 2022.Q4 &amp; Full-Year OutlookFor fourth-quarter 2022, operating revenues are expected to register 13-17% growth compared with 2019. ASMs are estimated to decline 2% from the comparable period in 2019. Economic fuel costs per gallon are expected to be $3.15 to $3.25. LUV expects CASM, excluding fuel, oil and profit-sharing expenses, and special items, to increase 14-18% in the fourth quarter from the comparable period in 2019. Interest expenses are expected to be $70 million in the fourth quarter.For 2022, Southwest now expects capacity to decline approximately 4.5% (prior view: down 4%) from the 2019 level. Economic fuel costs per gallon are now estimated between $3.05 and $3.15 (prior view: $2.95 - $3.05). CASM, excluding fuel, oil and profit-sharing expenses, and special items, is anticipated to increase 14-15% (prior view: 12-16%) in 2022 from 2019.

Multiple flight cancelations and booking weaknesses due to Hurricane Ian also hurt results. DAL reported earnings of 30 cents per share a year ago, dull in comparison to the current scenario, as air-travel demand was not so buoyant then.DAL reported revenues of $13,975 million, which lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $14,157.2 million. Driven by the high air-travel demand, total revenues increased more than 52% on a year-over-year basis.United Airlines’ UAL third-quarter 2022 earnings (excluding 5 cents from non-recurring items) of $2.81 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.21 and our estimate of $2.17. An upbeat in air-travel demand aided results.In the year-ago quarter, UAL incurred a loss of $1.02 per share when air-travel demand was not as buoyant as in the current scenario. The third quarter of 2022 was the second consecutive profitable quarter at UAL since the onset of the pandemic.Operating revenues of $12,877 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12,709.5 million and our estimate of $12, 631.6 million. UAL’s revenues increased more than 66% year over year owing to an upbeat in air-travel demand. The optimistic air-travel demand scenario is also evident from the fact that total operating revenues increased 13.2% from third-quarter 2019 (pre-coronavirus) levels.J.B.

That is Southwest Airlines. The company reported earnings for the third quarter that beat estimates on the bottom line as the airline posted load factor numbers higher than prepandemic. This is what we've been hearing from some of the airlines here, as we see strong demand for travel and revenue basically in line with estimates here.The company says Hurricane Ian cut its revenue by $18 million in the third quarter. And it's still going to have an effect in the fourth of $10 million as well. And also it's looking still at costs that are at relatively elevated levels here.- Yeah, fuel expenses continue to remain high. And this is something that we've heard as a throughpoint, or at least a common denominator in many of the airlines' earnings and a larger question of, of course, when they start to bring some of the capacity back online. But I think with the comps that we've continued to see, there is that strong demand. That pulls through to the comparables back to 2019, which was the last prepandemic normalization year.They were up in comparison by about 13% to 17%, at least in their guidance and outlook. That's the expectation that they're looking in terms of going forward from here and into a busy holiday travel season.- Yeah, Brad, sure looked like they had a lot of momentum exiting September, or another way of looking at it, entering October. Total liquidity, another airline sitting on a lot more liquidity compared to the depths of the financial crisis. It was $15 billion, well in excess of their total debt of about $8.7 billion. That's certainly good as well.But I think as we step back, we've now gotten all the results from the major airlines. JetBlue, we just talked about them, probably the worst quarter out of that whole group.Story continues- It was a bad quarter for JetBlue. And, I mean, when you think about how much they were paying more for gas and fuel-- fuel, I should say-- I think that was about 83% higher or 87% higher, rather, for fuel. And that really weighed on some of the margins there, too.But for Southwest, for American, for Delta and United, those had been relatively strong on the better demand that we had seen. And so it's just now a question of how much they continue to invest in bringing that capacity up to scale. And, honestly, if they do that any time soon, I mean, if you're already seeing this type of demand on reduced routes and that's going to help you manage some of the interim costs while you're waiting to bring more pilots back online, the average throughput for that or at least bringing those pilots into the system, that could take as much as a year and a half, two years. So it's going to be a cost management cycle here for the companies as well.- Yeah, and it's not just-- to your point, it's not just about fuel. It's the personnel is a big part of that cost structure, too.- Absolutely.]"

This compares to loss of $0.23 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 21.95%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this airline would post earnings of $1.17 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.30, delivering a surprise of 11.11%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.Southwest , which belongs to the Zacks Transportation - Airline industry, posted revenues of $6.22 billion for the quarter ended September 2022, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.14%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $4.68 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Southwest shares have lost about 19.8% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -19.6%.What's Next for Southwest?While Southwest has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Southwest: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.72 on $6.39 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $2.10 on $24.09 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Transportation - Airline is currently in the top 26% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Another stock from the same industry, Allegiant Travel (ALGT), has yet to report results for the quarter ended September 2022. The results are expected to be released on November 2.This travel services company is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.34 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -151.5%.

Shareholders not resident in Sweden who wish to accept the Offer (as defined below) must make inquiries concerning applicable legislation and possible tax consequences. Shareholders should refer to the offer restrictions included in the section titled ""Important information"" at the end of this announcement and in the offer document, which has been published on the Offer website (www.smokefree-offer.com). Shareholders in the United States should also refer to the section entitled ""Special notice to shareholders in the United States"" at the end of this announcement.On May 11, 2022, Philip Morris Holland Holdings B.V.1 (""PMHH""), an affiliate of Philip Morris International Inc. (""PMI""), announced a recommended public offer to the shareholders of Swedish Match AB (""Swedish Match"") to tender all shares in Swedish Match2 to PMHH (the ""Offer"").

Any information documents, including the offer document, are being disseminated to U.S. Holders on a basis comparable to the method pursuant to which such documents are provided to Swedish Match’s other shareholders.The U.S. Holders should consider that the price for the Offer is being paid in SEK and that no adjustment will be made based on any changes in the exchange rate.It may be difficult for U.S. Holders to enforce their rights and any claims they may have arising under the U.S. federal or U.S. state securities laws in connection with the Offer, since Swedish Match and PMHH are located in countries other than the United States, and some or all of their officers and directors may be residents of countries other than the United States.

It is also the global industry leader for nicotine pouches.Under Swedish law, PMI needs 90% of shareholders to agree to the deal, aimed at getting a slice of the fast-growing smoke-free market, in order to get full control over the company.By increasing its stake to 10.5%, worth about 18.2 billion Swedish crowns ($1.66 billion) at Friday's market prices, from 7.25% previously, Elliott could scupper the deal if it rejects the offer.Bloomberg News reported in July, citing sources, that Elliott was planning to oppose the deal. That was before PMI sweetened the terms last week. Elliott has not commented on its intentions.""Our updated offer retains a 90% acceptance condition, which is critical to allow us to capture the full potential of the combination,"" PMI said in an emailed comment. ""This is our best and final price, and we hope to complete the transaction next month to achieve full ownership.""New York-based hedge fund Davidson Kempner Capital Management also raised its stake in Swedish Match to 5%, a regulatory filing with the Swedish Financial Authority showed on Wednesday.BlackRock Inc boosted its ownership to 5.1% in Swedish Match. The world's biggest asset manager previously held a 4.4% stake in the company.PMI also has the option to reduce the acceptance threshold and take a majority stake in order to prevent the bid from failing.Elliott and Swedish Match declined to comment.The investor has been building its stake since July. The shares have risen by more than 9% in that time.Story continuesSpeaking to Reuters earlier, following its Q3 results and before Elliott disclosed the higher stake, Swedish Match CEO Lars Dahlgren said that he believed the company could thrive by itself or together with Philip Morris.""I believe we have exciting prospects as a standalone company, but I see exciting opportunities with a potential combination,"" he said.The deal has also faced opposition from other shareholders.Swedish Match shares were little changed on Friday, albeit outperforming a weak broader market.($1 = 10.9900 Swedish crowns)(Reporting by Marie Mannes, additional reporting by Agata Rybska and Deborah Sophia; Editing by Josephine Mason and Kirsten Donovan)]"

The metric came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate and beat our estimate of $7.5 billion.Total operating expenses of Molina Healthcare escalated 11.3% year over year to $7.6 billion, primarily due to higher medical care costs, general and administrative expenses, and premium tax expenses.

However, the downside was partly mitigated by better net earnings.2022 GuidanceManagement altered guidance for this year with respect to certain metrics.Premium revenues are projected to be roughly $30.5 billion, higher than the prior outlook of around $30 billion. The revised guidance implies an improvement of 13.4% from the 2021 figure. The Public Health Emergency, extended from October of this year to January 2023, solid third-quarter 2022 results and the AgeWell buyout completed this month contributed to the positive revision in the premium revenue guidance.Adjusted EPS is estimated to be a minimum of $17.75, up from the previous projection of at least $17.60. The hiked outlook suggests growth of 31.1% from the 2021 reported figure.Net income of Molina Healthcare is expected to be $1 billion, marginally higher than the prior estimate.

GPN is set to report its third-quarter 2022 results on Oct 31, before the opening bell.In the last reported quarter, the leading payment technology company’s adjusted earnings of $2.36 per share met the Zacks Consensus Estimate, thanks to strong performances across its Merchant Solutions and Issuer Solutions segments. Global Payments achieved strong performance in the second quarter despite headwinds related to the exit of its Russia business and adverse foreign currency fluctuations. However, an elevated operating expense level partly offset the upside.Let’s see how things have shaped up prior to the third-quarter earnings announcement.The Trend in Estimate RevisionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings per share of $2.49 suggests a 14.2% increase from the prior year's reported figure of $2.18. It witnessed no upward revision in the past week versus two in the opposite direction. Global Payments beat the consensus estimate for earnings in three of the prior four quarters and met once, the average surprise being 1.1%. This is depicted in the graph below:Global Payments Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Global Payments Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseGlobal Payments Inc. price-eps-surprise | Global Payments Inc. QuoteThe consensus estimate for third-quarter revenues of $2.1 billion indicates a 2.7% increase from the year-ago reported figure.Factors to NoteIn the third quarter, profits from GPN’s Merchant Solutions — its biggest operating segment — are likely to have increased from higher customer spending. Higher travel and entertainment-related spendings are expected to have benefited the company’s performance, positioning GPN for year-over-year growth.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from Merchant Solutions is pegged at $1,481 million, indicating a rise from $1,358 million reported in the year-ago period. Strong software businesses and the continued execution of a technology-enabled strategy are expected to have driven the segment’s performance.Story continuesThe consensus mark for Issuer Solutions’ revenues is pegged at $497 million, signaling an increase from $458 million reported in third-quarter 2021. The addition of the leading accounts payable automation, as well as business-to-business payments solutions provider MineralTree, is likely to have aided the segment’s performance.However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from the Business and Consumer Solutions segment indicates an 8.7% year-over-year decrease. Higher levels of unemployment assistance benefits are anticipated to have affected the segment.Profits from the business are likely to have been partially offset by increased operating costs in the third quarter, making an earnings beat uncertain. Higher cost of service, and selling, general and administrative expenses are likely to have affected the bottom line. Continuous investments to upgrade digital capabilities are expected to have weighed on the margins.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Global Payments this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Earnings ESP: The company’s Earnings ESP is -0.67%. This is because the Most Accurate Estimate is currently pegged at $2.47 per share, lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.49.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Global Payments currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.Stocks to ConsiderWhile an earnings beat looks uncertain for Global Payments, here are some companies from the Business Services space that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this time around:Shift4 Payments, Inc.

140,36543d69-f356-3a78-9d2d-84502e0b1a4d,GPN,2022-10-28,Earnings Preview: Nuvei Corporation (NVEI) Q3 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-nuvei-corporation-nvei-140202067.html,1666879322,STORY,"['NVEI.TO', 'NVEI', 'GPN']","[Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when Nuvei Corporation (NVEI) reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 3, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.41 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -2.4%.Revenues are expected to be $187.27 million, up 1.8% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 5.95% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Nuvei Corporation?For Nuvei Corporation, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -5.23%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Nuvei Corporation will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Nuvei Corporation would post earnings of $0.46 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.51, delivering a surprise of +10.87%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Nuvei Corporation doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAmong the stocks in the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry, Global Payments (GPN) is soon expected to post earnings of $2.49 per share for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +14.2%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $2.05 billion, up 2.7% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Global Payments has been revised 1.4% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of -0.67%, reflecting a lower Most Accurate Estimate.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Global Payments will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NASDAQ:MAT) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Mattel Step By Step Through The CalculationWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$625.9mUS$666.0mUS$804.0mUS$837.0mUS$863.7mUS$888.1mUS$910.9mUS$932.7mUS$953.9mUS$974.7mGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x5Analyst x2Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 3.19%Est @ 2.82%Est @ 2.57%Est @ 2.39%Est @ 2.27%Est @ 2.18% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.0% US$580US$571US$639US$616US$589US$561US$533US$506US$479US$453(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$5.5bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.0%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$975m× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (8.0%– 2.0%) = US$17bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$17b÷ ( 1 + 8.0%)10= US$7.7bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$13b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$19.2, the company appears quite good value at a 49% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Mattel as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.0%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.277. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Looking Ahead:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price? For Mattel, there are three fundamental elements you should further examine:Risks: Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 2 warning signs  with Mattel (at least 1 which is a bit concerning)  , and understanding these should be part of your investment process.Future Earnings: How does MAT's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

The bottom line came in below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.68. The underperformance reflects lower production and a pullback in refining margins from their second-quarter highs.However, SHEL’s bottom line was well above the year-earlier quarter’s adjusted profit of $1.06 per ADS, backed by stronger commodity prices.Shell’s revenues of $98.8 billion were up significantly from third-quarter 2021 sales of $61.6 billion.Meanwhile, Shell repurchased $5 billion of shares in the third quarter. The energy group also announced that it completed the $6 billion buyback program scheduled for the third quarter of 2022. Moreover, SHEL expects another $4 billion of repurchases for the fourth quarter and promised to increase its dividend by 15%.Shell PLC Unsponsored ADR Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseShell PLC Unsponsored ADR Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseShell PLC Unsponsored ADR price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Shell PLC Unsponsored ADR Quote Inside Shell’s SegmentsUpstream: The segment recorded a profit of $5.9 billion (excluding items) during the quarter, skyrocketing from $1.7 billion (adjusted) in the year-ago period. This primarily reflects the impact of higher oil and gas prices, partly offset by lower volumes.At $93.02 per barrel, the group’s worldwide realized liquids prices were 38.6% above the year-earlier levels, while natural gas prices almost tripled.Shell’s upstream volumes averaged 1,789 thousand oil-equivalent barrels per day (MBOE/d), down 11.9% from the year-ago period, mainly due to the loss of contribution from the company’s Salym petroleum development in Russia. Liquids production totaled 1,273 thousand barrels per day (down 14.8% year over year) and natural gas output came in at 2,995 million standard cubic feet per day (down 3.5%).Chemicals and Products: In this segment, the London-based super-major reported an adjusted income of $772 million, 62.5% higher than the year-ago period. The highly favorable comparison was due to strong refining margins, robust trading contribution and lower depreciation charges, which offset lower chemicals profitability. Meanwhile, refinery utilization came in at 70%, down marginally from 71% during the September-end quarter of 2021.Integrated Gas: The unit reported an adjusted income of $2.3 billion, up from $1.8 billion in the July-September quarter of 2021. Results were primarily impacted by higher LNG sales volumes, which increased 3.2% from the third quarter of 2021 to 15.66 million tons. However, total Integrated Gas production fell 6.6% year over year to 924 MBOE/d.Marketing: The segment recorded an income of $820 million (excluding items) during the quarter compared to the year-ago earnings of $1.1 billion due to a dip in lubricants margins.Renewables and Energy Solutions: The segment logged an adjusted income of $383 million, turning around from the year-ago loss of $171 million. The performance boost reflects higher trading and optimisation margins for gas and power. Moreover, external power sales were up 4.7% year over year to 67 terawatt hours, though piped gas sales fell 18.2% to 157 terawatt hours.Story continues Financial PerformanceAs of Sep 30, 2022, the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company had $36 billion in cash and $82 billion in debt (including short-term debt). Net debt-to-capitalization was approximately 20.3%, down from 25.6% a year ago.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.During the quarter under review, Shell generated cash flow from operations of $12.5 billion, returned $1.8 billion to its shareholders through dividends and spent $5.3 billion on capital projects.The company’s cash flow from operations decreased 21.8% from the year-earlier level. Meanwhile, the group raked in $7.5 billion in free cash flow during the third quarter compared to $12.2 billion a year ago.GuidanceShell expects fourth-quarter 2022 upstream volumes of 1,750-1,950 MBOE/d, while Integrated Gas production is expected between 910 MBOE/d and 960 MBOE/d. The company also foresees marketing sales volumes of 2,250-2,750 thousand barrels per day, Chemicals sales volumes of 2,700-3,200 thousand tons and refinery utilization in the range of 88-96% were also guided.Important Energy Releases So FarLet’s take a look at some key energy releases so far.Schlumberger SLB, the largest oilfield contractor, announced third-quarter earnings of 63 cents per share (excluding charges and credits), which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 55 cents. SLB recorded total revenues of $7.5 billion, outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.7%.Schlumberger’s strong quarterly earnings resulted from strong activities in land and offshore resources in North America and Latin America. In more good news for investors, SLB generated a free cash flow of $1.1 billion during the period. The Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company’s capital expenditure came in at $382 million. As of Sep 30, 2022, SLB had approximately $3.6 billion in cash and short-term investments. It had long-term debt of $12.5 billion at the end of the third quarter.Smaller rival Halliburton HAL reported third-quarter adjusted net income per share of 60 cents, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 56 cents and well above the year-ago quarter profit of 28 cents. HAL’s outperformance reflects stronger-than-expected profit from both its divisions and came in spite of the company’s exit from Russia.Meanwhile, revenues of $5.4 billion were 38.8% higher than the corresponding period of 2021 and above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.3 billion. North American revenues rose 63.2% year over year to $2.6 billion, while revenues from Halliburton’s international operations were up 21.2% from the year-ago period to $2.7 billion. Investors should know that HAL has outsized exposure to the North American land drilling market.On the other hand, energy infrastructure provider Kinder Morgan KMI reported third-quarter 2022 adjusted earnings per share of 25 cents, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 29 cents per share. The disappointing bottom line numbers could be blamed on lower pipeline volumes of gasoline and diesel fuel, partially offset by higher contributions from KMI’s natural gas pipelines and CO2 segments.As of Sep 30, 2022, Kinder Morgan reported $483 million in cash and cash equivalents. The company’s long-term debt amounted to $29 billion, resulting in a debt to capitalization of 49.6%. For 2022, KMI expects a dividend of $1.11 per share, suggesting an increase of 3% from the prior-year reported figure.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

143,de6e6fc4-a02a-3a88-93f5-62a96512e556,SLB,2022-10-28,Pick These 4 Stocks With Excellent Interest Coverage Ratio,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pick-4-stocks-excellent-interest-130801147.html,1666876081,STORY,"['SLB', 'CDNS', 'MCK', 'HCCI']","[We often judge a company on the basis of its sales and earnings. These, however, may not be enough. Sometimes, a stock gets a boost if these numbers climb year over year or surpass estimates in a particular quarter, thus offering a great opportunity for an investor with a shorter horizon to cash in on. But if you seek long-term returns, investments backed only by sales and earnings numbers may not yield the desired results.A critical analysis of a company’s financial background is a prerequisite for an informed investment decision. Here, coverage ratios that determine whether a company is sound enough to meet its financial obligations play a crucial role. The higher the ratio, the better. The focus of this article is on “Interest Coverage,” which is one such ratio.Interest Coverage Ratio = Earnings before Interest &amp; Taxes (EBIT) divided by Interest Expense.Why Interest Coverage Ratio?The interest coverage ratio is used to determine how effectively a company can pay the interest charges on its debt.Debt, which is crucial for most of the companies to finance operations, comes at a cost called interest. Interest expense has a direct bearing on the profitability of a company and its creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets interest obligations. Therefore, Interest Coverage Ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision.The interest coverage ratio suggests the number of times the interest could be paid from earnings and gauges the margin of safety a firm carries for paying interest.An interest coverage ratio lower than 1.0 implies that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations and could default on repaying debt. A company that is capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardships. Definitely, one should also track the company’s past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over a period of time.Heritage-Crystal Clean, Inc. HCCI, Cadence Design Systems, Inc. CDNS, McKesson Corporation MCK and Schlumberger Limited SLB boast an impressive interest coverage ratio.Story continuesThe Winning StrategyApart from having an Interest Coverage Ratio that is more than the industry average, adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a VGM Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to better results.Interest Coverage Ratio greater than X-Industry MedianPrice greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.5-Year Historical EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry Median: Stocks that have a strong EPS growth history.Projected EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry Median: This is the projected EPS growth over the next three to five years. This shows that the stock has near-term earnings growth potential.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.VGM Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best upside potential.Here are four of the nine stocks that qualified the screening:Heritage-Crystal Clean, a leading provider of parts cleaning, used oil re-refining, hazardous and non-hazardous waste disposal, emergency and spill response, and industrial and field services, carries a Zacks Rank #2. It has an expected EPS growth rate of 15% for three-five years. The company has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 37%, on average.

144,e87f7046-16f0-380c-a655-5434531f2f57,SLB,2022-10-28,A Look At The Intrinsic Value Of Schlumberger Limited (NYSE:SLB),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/look-intrinsic-value-schlumberger-limited-130114340.html,1666875674,STORY,['SLB'],"[In this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of Schlumberger Limited (NYSE:SLB) by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. View our latest analysis for Schlumberger Is Schlumberger Fairly Valued?We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$3.96bUS$4.90bUS$5.33bUS$5.62bUS$5.85bUS$6.06bUS$6.24bUS$6.41bUS$6.57bUS$6.72bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x12Analyst x7Analyst x2Analyst x1Est @ 4.09%Est @ 3.46%Est @ 3.01%Est @ 2.7%Est @ 2.49%Est @ 2.33% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 9.0% US$3.6kUS$4.1kUS$4.1kUS$4.0kUS$3.8kUS$3.6kUS$3.4kUS$3.2kUS$3.0kUS$2.8k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$36bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 9.0%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$6.7b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (9.0%– 2.0%) = US$98bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$98b÷ ( 1 + 9.0%)10= US$42bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$77b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$52.2, the company appears about fair value at a 4.5% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Schlumberger as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 9.0%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.491. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Looking Ahead:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. For Schlumberger, we've compiled three fundamental factors you should consider:Risks: Case in point, we've spotted   1 warning sign for Schlumberger  you should be aware of.Future Earnings: How does SLB's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

145,7835bf9e-5efd-3977-bb38-8810674ff736,APTV,2022-10-28,Aptiv PLC (APTV) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/aptiv-plc-aptv-reports-next-140202411.html,1666879322,STORY,"['APTV', 'TT']","[The market expects Aptiv PLC (APTV) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 3, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.04 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +173.7%.Revenues are expected to be $4.28 billion, up 17.2% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.19% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Aptiv PLC?For Aptiv PLC, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.24%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Aptiv PLC will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Aptiv PLC would post earnings of $0.62 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.22, delivering a surprise of -64.52%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Aptiv PLC doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerTrane Technologies (TT), another stock in the Zacks Technology Services industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $2.12 for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of +17.8%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $4.16 billion, up 11.8% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Trane Technologies has been revised 1.4% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a higher Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 2.09%.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggests that Trane Technologies will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NASDAQ:NFLX) has a market capitalization of $119.252 billion.Polen Capital made the following comment about Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“We have spent months analyzing Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)’s ability to monetize shared passwords, as there are over 100 million households that use, but do not pay for, Netflix. We believe Netflix has outlined reasonable plans for cracking down on password sharing and now expect the company to be able to monetize roughly 30% of that user base in the short term, which has the potential to add billions of dollars to annual free cash flow. In addition, we have analyzed the opportunity for an advertising-supported subscription model, and Netflix has also made meaningful progress in this area by partnering with Microsoft and attracting new digital advertising talent.Ad inventory inside, we believe Netflix content will be highly valued by advertisers and could add quite substantially to the company’s revenue and free cash flow growth. Netflix will likely generate roughly $1 billion in free cash flow this year. With password sharing monetization, free cash flow should exceed $3 billion-$4 billion in 2023. In our opinion, the ad-supported model plus new non-ad subscriptions should lead to annualized free cash flow growth at least in the mid-teens from there over the next five years.While Netflix faces formidable competition, we believe its ability to consistently deliver compelling original programming across geographies, categories, and cultures is unmatched. This is supported in our view by Netflix’s share of time spent within the important original programming category in the U.S., its most competitive market, which remains multiples higher than its next closest competitor.”Pixabay/Public DomainStory continuesNetflix, Inc.

But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.Right now, both Cumulus Media and Netflix are sporting a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy). The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that both of these companies have improving earnings outlooks. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics, including the tried-and-true P/E ratio, the P/S ratio, earnings yield, and cash flow per share, as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use.CMLS currently has a forward P/E ratio of 3.98, while NFLX has a forward P/E of 29.24. We also note that CMLS has a PEG ratio of 0.27. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. NFLX currently has a PEG ratio of 1.50.Another notable valuation metric for CMLS is its P/B ratio of 0.34. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, NFLX has a P/B of 6.47.These metrics, and several others, help CMLS earn a Value grade of A, while NFLX has been given a Value grade of C.Both CMLS and NFLX are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks, but based on these valuation figures, we feel that CMLS is the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

152,d51adea8-9070-3a61-8494-d445713d31cc,AMGN,2022-10-28,Earnings Preview: Amgen (AMGN) Q3 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-amgen-amgn-q3-140302748.html,1666879382,STORY,"['AMGN', 'EDIT']","[Amgen (AMGN) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 3. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis world's largest biotech drugmaker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $4.43 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -5.1%.Revenues are expected to be $6.56 billion, down 2.1% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 4.18% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Amgen?For Amgen, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.10%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Amgen will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Amgen would post earnings of $4.40 per share when it actually produced earnings of $4.65, delivering a surprise of +5.68%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Amgen doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAnother stock from the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry, Editas Medicine (EDIT), is soon expected to post loss of $0.87 per share for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -52.6%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $5.86 million, down 5.5% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Editas has been revised 3.3% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a higher Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 1.67%.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), suggests that Editas will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This compares to earnings of $1.49 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 1.53%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this company would post earnings of $2.32 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.55, delivering a surprise of 9.91%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Teck Resources Ltd , which belongs to the Zacks Mining - Miscellaneous industry, posted revenues of $3.58 billion for the quarter ended September 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 6.47%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $3.15 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Teck Resources Ltd shares have added about 19.5% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -19%.What's Next for Teck Resources Ltd?While Teck Resources Ltd has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Teck Resources Ltd: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.01 on $3.02 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $7.08 on $14.58 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Mining - Miscellaneous is currently in the top 22% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.One other stock from the same industry, Newmont Corporation (NEM), is yet to report results for the quarter ended September 2022. The results are expected to be released on November 1.This gold and copper miner is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.29 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -51.7%.

We wonder if and what role the company's financials play in that price change as a company's long-term fundamentals usually dictate market outcomes. In this article, we decided to focus on General Dynamics'  ROE.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. View our latest analysis for General Dynamics How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for General Dynamics is:19% = US$3.4b ÷ US$18b (Based on the trailing twelve months to October 2022).The 'return' is the yearly profit. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.19 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.General Dynamics' Earnings Growth And 19% ROETo start with, General Dynamics' ROE looks acceptable. On comparing with the average industry ROE of 10% the company's ROE looks pretty remarkable. Despite this, General Dynamics' five year net income growth was quite flat over the past five years. We reckon that there could be some other factors at play here that's limiting the company's growth. These include low earnings retention or poor allocation of capital.Story continuesAs a next step, we compared General Dynamics' net income growth with the industry and were disappointed to see that the company's growth is lower than the industry average growth of 3.9% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. What is GD worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether GD is currently mispriced by the market.Is General Dynamics Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?Despite having a normal three-year median payout ratio of 40% (implying that the company keeps 60% of its income) over the last three years, General Dynamics has seen a negligible amount of growth in earnings as we saw above. Therefore, there might be some other reasons to explain the lack in that respect. For example, the business could be in decline.Additionally, General Dynamics has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years, which means that the company's management is determined to pay dividends even if it means little to no earnings growth. Based on the latest analysts' estimates, we found that the company's future payout ratio over the next three years is expected to hold steady at 38%. Accordingly, forecasts suggest that General Dynamics' future ROE will be 21% which is again, similar to the current ROE.SummaryOn the whole, we do feel that General Dynamics has some positive attributes. However, given the high ROE and high profit retention, we would expect the company to be delivering strong earnings growth, but that isn't the case here. This suggests that there might be some external threat to the business, that's hampering its growth. That being so, the latest analyst forecasts show that the company will continue to see an expansion in its earnings.

NOV's M/D Totco™ business unit began providing eVolve services supporting drilling operations on two CCS wells in the North Sea. The project aims to capture CO2 from various onshore industries, transporting it by ships, and injecting it 1,000 – 2,000 meters below the seabed for permanent storage. Well integrity and placement are critical in CCS applications to ensure minimal leakage back into the atmosphere. The enhanced knowledge of formation properties and downhole location provided by real-time broadband data transmission from NOV’s wired drill pipe system enables our customers to construct the safest and most efficient carbon storage wells. NOV was also awarded two eVolve wired drill pipe optimization projects in the Middle East, one from a major integrated oil company and another from a large national oil company. The scope of both projects includes the use of NOV's full suite of optimization and visualization services, wired drill pipe, downhole drilling tools, and real-time sensors along the drill string.NOV introduced the Sjøhest (Norwegian for ""seahorse"") vessel, a novel solution to improve offshore wind turbine blade installation processes. The Sjøhest is designed to work with a large installation jack-up vessel to install the latest generation of offshore wind turbines at heights of 175 to 200 meters. The larger installation vessel is used to install the towers and nacelles, while a dedicated, smaller, Sjøhest jack-up vessel connects directly to the tower with a telescopic leader boom, similar to how a seahorse uses its unique and strong grasping tail to resist ocean currents, creating an aligned and stable platform from which a trolley horizontally transports blades along the leader, rotates the blade into a vertical position, and connects it to the rotor. Splitting tower/nacelle and blade installation optimizes installation efficiencies, reduces fuel usage, and shortens installation times by up to 30%, thereby improving the economics while achieving a lower carbon footprint. Additionally, the enhanced stability provided by the Sjøhest system increases the weather window in which blade installation can occur, resulting in significant uptime benefits and further improving the efficiencies associated with offshore wind development.NOV commercialized its ATOMTM RTX robotics system in the offshore drilling market. During the quarter, NOV booked the sale of its first ATOM RTX system for use by a major on an ultra-deepwater rig contracted for work in Brazil. Additionally, NOV booked the sale of its second land rig system to a leading North American drilling contractor. By enabling hands-free pipe-stabbing and doping, the system presents a step change in drilling efficiencies and safety, removing people from red zone operations and optimizing rig floor performance through automation.NOV delivered its 100th NOVOSTM process automation platform. As the industry's only reflexive drilling system, the NOVOS platform allows drillers to automate repetitive drilling activities, such as making a connection offshore and coming off and on bottom, all while maintaining specific parameters for circulation, weight-on-bit, and more. The result is greater operational consistency for any driller, regardless of individual experience level, driving improved performance time and time again.NOV has been awarded a contract to design, supply, and commission a Cascade Pump System for a Polyhalite mine on the northeast coast of England. Polyhalite is an organic super fertilizer that will be exported to customers around the world. The Cascade Pump System is a dual-purpose design that will de-water vertical mine shafts at depths up to 1,600 meters and pump cooling water to the mine shaft boring machine. In addition to the capital equipment order, NOV was awarded a five-year service contract to supply replacement pump units, critical spares, and onsite labor support during the mine shaft sinking process.NOV continues to lead the evolution of the drill bit market with the launch of the ION+™ 5DX™ Shaped Cutter, the latest in our fit-for-purpose drill bit technology. Built upon the ION+ cutter platform, the ION+ 5DX polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) cutter incorporates an optimized multi-faceted geometry that improves mechanical toughness by approximately 60% vs. conventional cutters, resulting in remarkably effective performance when drilling challenging interbedded lithologies. Based on encouraging results in West Texas, the cutter technology has shown the ability to withstand high shock loads while providing high thermal stability in challenging applications. By providing better protection of the diamond table’s integrity, the ION+ 5DX cutter enables operators to achieve improvements in drilling distances, efficiencies, and, ultimately, well productivity.NOV successfully deployed its automated VectorZIELTM rotary steerable system (RSS) into the U.S. onshore market for the first time. A large independent exploration and production (E&amp;P) company used the VectorZIEL 800 tool to drill two 9,000-ft intermediate tangent sections with 100% tool reliability. Using the tool's automated trajectory control capability, including near-bit inclination and azimuth and closed loop steering, VectorZIEL system delivered desired well plans with significantly less manual intervention than conventional RSS systems.NOV secured an order to provide Tuboscope's TK™-Liner and its Liner Hanger System for two geothermal wells in Hamburg, Germany. Though already established as a reliable solution for large-diameter tubulars used in geothermal applications, this will be the first TK-Liner project in Germany. TK-Ring II crossovers were custom designed to interface with the completion tools, providing cost-effective corrosion protection and thermal insulation.NOV received its first offshore contract for the iNOVaTHERM™ portable treatment unit. Following a successful trial run in the UK, a major operator awarded NOV a three-well contract that is expected to run the entirety of 2023 for operations in the Ivar Aasen Field in the North Sea. The iNOVaTHERM treatment process for drilling waste at the wellsite advances the industry’s objectives of reducing its carbon footprint, lowering operational costs, and keeping people out of harm's way.Third Quarter Earnings Conference CallNOV will hold a conference call to discuss its third quarter 2022 results on October 28, 2022 at 10:00 AM Central Time (11:00 AM Eastern Time).

This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss.

This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.07%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Zoetis will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Zoetis would post earnings of $1.22 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.20, delivering a surprise of -1.64%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower.

NEE may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because NextEra Energy is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for NEE in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 80 cents per share for NEE, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 79 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for NEE, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.63% heading into earnings season.NextEra Energy, Inc.

Vehicle maintenance and repair opportunities from an increasingly aged vehicle fleet will continue to impact the service and repair community as service providers and consumers are working to maintain vehicles that have an average age of 12.2 years.(PRNewsfoto/S&amp;P Global)Experts from S and P Global will share automotive aftermarket insight at AAPEX and SEMA next week""Softening new vehicle sales, led by continued inventory challenges related to global supply chains and forthcoming economic constraints, as well as ongoing COVID concerns, will be significant factors in the coming years,"" said Todd Campau, aftermarket practice leader, S&amp;P Global Mobility. ""The auto industry is not expected to realize the same pent up demand as in previous scenarios given inflationary pressures and other factors,"" he said.""At the same time, the container shipping supply chain is slowly recovering from the historic pandemic-driven disruption, but the system is far from out of the woods,"" said Peter Tirschwell, vice president, maritime and trade for S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence. Port bottlenecks are easing on the U.S. West Coast but are persisting on the U.S. East and Gulf coasts, at inland rail facilities and at warehouses which remain at high levels of utilization. Even if supply chain pressures are easing, perception of risk in the supply chain remains highly elevated, with many importers rightfully concerned about the high potential for future supply chain shocks such as a longshore labor strike, further COVID lockdowns in China or other threats.Story continuesS&amp;P Global analysts will share insights and highlight these and other key factors of influence on the aftermarket during three presentations next week at the Automotive Aftermarket Products Expo (AAPEX) and SEMA Shows in Las Vegas.

The introduction of CBCS to the market is driven by the increasing demand for a simpler and more efficient way of managing proprietary indexes, thematic baskets, and ESG investments.CBCS allows clients to design and set up equity baskets with customized features such as currency, return type, composition, and weights from a pre-approved universe of stocks. The calculated basket level and reference data is validated and distributed along with daily basket weight reports.The service is a result of a close collaboration between Nasdaq and S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, a provider of data and technology solutions to global markets.“We are thrilled to see the launch of what is to be the first major product delivery in a wider collaboration between the two firms. Combining our service capabilities will offer enhanced administrative, calculation and distribution services, to provide a seamless, end- to- end workflow and address the demand for bespoke baskets,” said Christopher Hare, Executive Director at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence. “As we look forward to the next stage in the service, the ability to generate on-demand listed exposure for equity portfolios will introduce an exciting change in the trading vehicles available to consumers, and to the speed at which the customer demand can be satisfied.”Through the new service, Nasdaq clients can now benefit from the calculation of the basket level for each basket, managed and verified corporate actions such as stock splits, dividends, mergers and acquisitions and the implementation of these changes into the defined baskets in a timely and accurate way.“With CBCS, our clients get a fully managed solution for custom basket calculations, an outsourced calculation service to avoid conflict of interest by separating the calculation from the end-user’s own business, and a solution which is provided by Nasdaq’s licensed benchmark administrator and thereby ensures a high quality of data,” said James McKeone, VP Head of European Data at Nasdaq. “To build onto this momentum, we also aim to in the near future launch a solution enabling investors to create a forward contract on customized baskets as an alternative to OTC equity swaps.”Story continuesThe service is available today to Nasdaq Stockholm AB or Nasdaq Clearing members.

182,28fdd2a9-0e4f-3da6-8293-dd4e53cd4b0a,SPGI,2022-10-28,Exclusive Interview with Ukrainian Energy Minister - CERAWeek Conversations,PR Newswire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/exclusive-interview-ukrainian-energy-minister-164800762.html,1666889280,STORY,['SPGI'],"[Minister Herman Halushchenko speaks with S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights Senior Vice President, Amb. Carlos Pascual for a new edition of CERAWeek Conversations – available at https://ondemand.ceraweek.com/cwcWASHINGTON, Oct. 27, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Recent attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure have destroyed more than 30% of the country's power generation capacity. In an exclusive interview for CERAWeek Conversations, Ukraine's minister of energy, Herman Halushchenko makes real the impact on Ukraine's people and the economy—and how Ukraine seeks to rebuild.In a conversation with Amb. Carlos Pascual, senior vice president for global energy and international affairs, S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights and a former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine, Minister Halushchenko details the various dimensions of the war's impact on Ukraine's energy systems and the country's response to Russian attempts to weaponize energy to its strategic advantage.The wide-ranging discussion covered:Aerial attacks on Ukraine's power-generation facilities:A combination of Iranian-supplied drones, aircraft attacks originating from Russian and Belarusian territory, and missile launches from Russia's Black Sea fleet have been targeting Ukraine's thermal generation facilities in central and western Ukraine, Minister Halushchenko notes.""One of the goals which we see in this massive shelling is [Russia] wants to split our energy system into different areas,"" he said. ""The idea [is] that when they split the system—or if they do—it's easier to damage during the wintertime.""Gas flows through Ukraine:Approximately 40-45 mmcm/d of Russian gas are currently still flowing through Ukraine, levels that are well below contracted amounts. Minister Halushchenko says that it is indicative of how gas has been used as a measure to pressure European countries to break their solidarity with Ukraine and with each other. He notes that when the war started, Russia dramatically increased the volumes of gas transited through Ukraine to maximum levels—a move designed to curry European support, he says. However, when support for Ukraine held Russia responded by decreasing flows to minimum levels. Ukraine, he projects, will need to import gas from December through March.Story continuesUkraine's gas storage systems:Ukraine operates one of the largest underground storage systems for natural gas in the world. That storage infrastructure has largely been unscathed by Russian attacks. As Europe prepares for winter, Minister Halushchenko says that Ukraine's storage system can play a role in bolstering energy security across the continent.""[Our storage infrastructure is] quite secure,"" he says. ""Any attempts to hit this infrastructure have failed. It's very difficult to reach.""""We welcome any foreign companies to store gas in our storages. It's important for us to maintain the system. [It is a] good business opportunity for companies to have this gas and then to sell it during the heating season when the price is high. The price of storage in Ukraine is very cheap compared to the storages in Europe.""The Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant:Europe's largest nuclear power facility has been at the center of ongoing shelling for months. Minister Halushchenko provides an operational status report of the plant and details the human toll being exacted on the Ukrainian engineers who oversee day-to-day operations.""Russia is trying to push our staff to agree to work for [them]...,"" Minister Halushchenko said. ""The people are under pressure. [They are] exhausted physically but they are responsible for nuclear safety.""The conversation with Minister Halushchenko also details the status of energy supplies for Ukraine's agribusiness sector and the success of its recent efforts to synchronize the country's power grid with European Union power markets, which he said was an important shield against possible terrorist attacks on the Ukrainian power grid. That synchronization also gave Ukraine the ability to trade electricity with the European Union. Cutting off electricity exports is another motivation for the Russian shelling of energy infrastructure, he said.The complete video is available at: https://ondemand.ceraweek.com/cwcPodcast version available: CERAWeek Conversations is also available via audio podcast on Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Soundcloud, Spotify and Stitcher.About CERAWeek Conversations:CERAWeek Conversations features original interviews and discussion with energy industry leaders, government officials and policymakers, leaders from the technology, financial and industrial communities—and energy technology innovators.The series is produced by the team responsible for the world's preeminent energy conference, CERAWeek by S&amp;P Global.Media Contacts: S&amp;P Global: Jeff Marn +1-202-463-8213, Jeff.marn@spglobal.comAbout S&amp;P GlobalS&amp;P Global (NYSE: SPGI) provides essential intelligence.

This compares to earnings of $3.54 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 5.02%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this independent ratings and analytics provider would post earnings of $2.91 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.81, delivering a surprise of -3.44%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.S&amp;P Global , which belongs to the Zacks Business - Information Services industry, posted revenues of $2.86 billion for the quarter ended September 2022, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.57%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $2.09 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.S&amp;P Global shares have lost about 34% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -19.6%.What's Next for S&amp;P Global?While S&amp;P Global has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for S&amp;P Global: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $2.84 on $2.97 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $11.37 on $11.74 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Business - Information Services is currently in the bottom 43% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Another stock from the same industry, Dun &amp; Bradstreet (DNB), has yet to report results for the quarter ended September 2022. The results are expected to be released on November 3.This company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.29 per share in its upcoming report, which represents no change from the year-ago quarter. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 3.1% lower over the last 30 days to the current level.Dun &amp; Bradstreet's revenues are expected to be $559.43 million, up 3.2% from the year-ago quarter.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to skip our primer on penny stocks and need to jump ahead to the top five stocks in this list, then take a look at 5 Most Successful Penny Stocks That Made It Big. The world of investing is full of tricks and opportunities, and the massive success of a handful of firms on the stock market has made their founders and investors billionaires. The market is responsible for producing some of the richest individuals in history, such as the founder of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) Mr. Bill Gates, and the electric vehicle billionaire Mr. Elon Musk. At the same time, it has also caused others painful losses.These fantastic gains continue to draw large amounts of attention from retail investors in particular, and one segment that catches a lot of this interest is the penny stock sector. Defined as those stocks that trade at less than $5 per share by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), droves of investors flock to these stocks as the low share price presents an attractive entry point and even small gains can result in large profits.When evaluating a penny stock, some metrics take precedence over others. Mostly these stocks either belong to firms will small market shares and revenues or those that are struggling. These factors require careful stock picking, and a look at the balance sheet and the cash flow statement can provide useful tools to sift out any potential problems. For example, through the Debt Ratio, which analyses a firm's total debt with its total assets, an investor can determine if a company is overly leveraged and has taken on too much debt. Too much debt not only ends up burdening the income statement in the form of interest payments, but it also affects payouts to shareholders in case a firm ceases to be a going concern since debt holders get the first priority for payments.Another ratio, which is especially useful for a penny stock, is the price to cash flow ratio. A firm's cash flow is the amount that is left for investors after its expenses are deducted, and when the share price is divided by the cash flow per share, an estimate of the 'market premium' for the share price can be determined. The usefulness of this metric lies in the fact that if a company has sound fundamentals, then it might see its share price jump in the future if there is little premium to it at the time of investment.Story continuesToday's piece focuses on some of the most successful penny stocks in history, and these firms have seen their share prices jump exponentially since they were first listed. Among these, the top performers are Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA).Our MethodologyWe took a look at the countless companies that have made it big on the stock market and then found out the share price at which they had started to trade or the lowest share price in their trading history, after accounting for stock splits. These companies once traded as penny stocks but have now grown to become major players in the market. The companies are then ranked through hedge fund holdings courtesy of Insider Monkey's Q2 2022 survey of 895 hedge funds.10 Most Successful Penny Stocks That Made It Big10. GameStop Corp.

Arm, owned by SoftBank Group Corp., sued Qualcomm for breach of contract and trademark infringement in September, accusing the firm of using the proprietary innovations without permission. In the past, Qualcomm had been one of Arm’s biggest customers.Qualcomm’s lawyers allege Arm’s goal is to “strong-arm Qualcomm into renegotiating the financial terms of the parties’ longstanding license agreements, using this baseless lawsuit as leverage.”The dispute has drawn wide attention in the tech industry. Qualcomm is the biggest maker of the processors and modems used in smartphones, and Arm is one of the world’s most-influential chip companies.“Arm’s claim against Qualcomm is aimed at protecting the Arm ecosystem and partners who rely on our intellectual property and innovative designs,” Phil Hughes, an Arm spokesman, said Thursday in an emailed statement. “We believe our argument is clear, and we are confident the court will agree.”Qualcomm acquired Nuvia last year to beef up its technology and allow it to field more powerful chips. It’s part of a broader strategy by Chief Executive Officer Cristiano Amon for Qualcomm to decrease reliance on the smartphone industry and grab a share of the laptop-chip market and the lucrative server-processor business.Story continuesArm’s suit is designed to hamper Qualcomm’s plans, the US company’s attorneys argued.“With this lawsuit, Arm makes clear to the marketplace it will act recklessly and opportunistically, threatening the development of new and innovative products as a negotiating tactic, not because it has valid license and trademark claims,” according to the filing.Arm is wrongfully demanding Qualcomm destroy all technology with ties to the UK company and misrepresenting its right to that technology to customers, the media and analysts, the US company’s lawyers contend.“The notion ARM has the right to control technology that is not ARM’s -- and worse yet, to ask defendants to destroy their innovation and inventions unless substantial monetary tribute is paid to ARM -- offends customary norms of technology ownership, as well as NUVIA’s and Qualcomm’s rights under their agreements with ARM,” Qualcom’s lawyers said in the filing.The case is Arm Ltd v.

195,c5ae81f3-ce42-39fd-b4f5-a94c313a95fb,EXPE,2022-10-28,Expedia (EXPE) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/expedia-expe-earnings-expected-grow-140202268.html,1666879322,STORY,"['EXPE', 'BKNG']","[The market expects Expedia (EXPE) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 3. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis online travel company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $3.87 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +9.6%.Revenues are expected to be $3.56 billion, up 20.1% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 6.54% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Expedia?For Expedia, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +8.44%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination indicates that Expedia will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Expedia would post earnings of $1.57 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.96, delivering a surprise of +24.84%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Expedia appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAmong the stocks in the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, Booking Holdings (BKNG) is soon expected to post earnings of $49.50 per share for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +31.3%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $5.91 billion, up 26.5% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Booking Holdings has been revised 0.4% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.12%.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Booking Holdings will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

With this in mind, we are always looking at value, growth, and momentum trends to discover great companies.Of these, value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. Value investors use tried-and-true metrics and fundamental analysis to find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.On top of the Zacks Rank, investors can also look at our innovative Style Scores system to find stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will want to focus on the ""Value"" category.

EXPE's industry currently sports an average PEG of 1.64. EXPE's PEG has been as high as 12.10 and as low as 0.74, with a median of 1.26, all within the past year.Finally, investors should note that EXPE has a P/CF ratio of 9.31. This figure highlights a company's operating cash flow and can be used to find firms that are undervalued when considering their impressive cash outlook. This company's current P/CF looks solid when compared to its industry's average P/CF of 16.50. EXPE's P/CF has been as high as 68.56 and as low as 8.44, with a median of 16.39, all within the past year.Story continuesJD.com (JD) may be another strong Internet - Commerce stock to add to your shortlist. JD is a # 2 (Buy) stock with a Value grade of A.JD.com is currently trading with a Forward P/E ratio of 14.98 while its PEG ratio sits at 1.02. Both of the company's metrics compare favorably to its industry's average P/E of 32.13 and average PEG ratio of 1.64.Over the last 12 months, JD's P/E has been as high as 47.56, as low as 14.54, with a median of 28.04, and its PEG ratio has been as high as 1.77, as low as 0.73, with a median of 1.28.Furthermore, JD.com holds a P/B ratio of 1.36 and its industry's price-to-book ratio is 4.49. JD's P/B has been as high as 3.19, as low as 1.32, with a median of 2.18 over the past 12 months.These are only a few of the key metrics included in Expedia Group and JD.com strong Value grade, but they help show that the stocks are likely undervalued right now.

Don't Ignore These 2 Aerospace Stocks Set to Beat Earnings,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/want-better-returns-dont-ignore-130001794.html,1666875601,STORY,"['HII', 'LMT']","[Quarterly financial reports play a vital role on Wall Street, as they help investors see how a company has performed and what might be coming down the road in the near-term. And out of all of the metrics and results to consider, earnings is one of the most important.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Huntington Ingalls (HII) earns a Zacks Rank #2 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $3.54 a share, just seven days from its upcoming earnings release on November 3, 2022.By taking the percentage difference between the $3.54 Most Accurate Estimate and the $3.53 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Huntington Ingalls has an Earnings ESP of 0.35%.HII is just one of a large group of Aerospace stocks with a positive ESP figure. Lockheed Martin (LMT) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.Slated to report earnings on January 24, 2023, Lockheed Martin holds a #3 (Hold) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $7.42 a share 89 days from its next quarterly update.Story continuesLockheed Martin's Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 0.37% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.40.Because both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, HII and LMT could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

201,5dff3208-349b-306c-a5cd-864f99662dbd,LMT,2022-10-28,Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lockheed-martin-corporation-lmt-trending-130001566.html,1666875601,STORY,['LMT'],"[Lockheed Martin (LMT) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this aerospace and defense company have returned +15.6%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +5.4% change. During this period, the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry, which Lockheed falls in, has gained 10.6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Lockheed is expected to post earnings of $7.40 per share, indicating a change of +2.2% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +1.7% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $21.67 points to a change of -4.2% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.6%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $27.75 indicates a change of +28.1% from what Lockheed is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -2%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Lockheed is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for LMT _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Lockheed, the consensus sales estimate of $18.21 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +2.7%. The $65.24 billion and $66.18 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -2.7% and +1.4%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryLockheed reported revenues of $16.58 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +3.5%. EPS of $6.87 for the same period compares with $6.66 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $16.82 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -1.43%. The EPS surprise was +4.41%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Lockheed is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Lockheed. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

BAX reported third-quarter 2022 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 82 cents, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The bottom line, however, declined 20% from the year-ago quarter.GAAP EPS in the quarter was a loss of $5.83 against earnings of 89 cents in the prior-year quarter. The significant loss was due to the recognition of one-time special items totaling $3.4 billion after tax.Revenue DetailsRevenues of $3.77 billion were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, the top line improved 17% year over year on a reported basis and 23% on a constant currency (cc) basis. Sales grew slightly on an operational basis.Geographical DetailsBaxter reports operating results through three geographic segments — Americas (North and South America), EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) and APAC (Asia Pacific).In the Americas, Baxter revenues totaled $1.7 billion, down 1% on a year-over-year basis and flat at cc.In EMEA, revenues totaled $692 million, down 11% from the year-ago quarter while up 3% at cc.In APAC, revenues of $643 million declined 11% from the prior-year quarter and down 2% at cc.Segmental DetailsFollowing the Hillrom buyout (in December 2021), Baxter added three new product categories — Patient Support Systems, Front Line Care and Surgical Solutions. During the quarter under review, the company recorded $735 million in sales from Hilrom’s businesses.

As a percentage of revenues, the gross margin declined 110 basis points (bps) to 42.9% in the third quarter.Selling, general and administrative expenses amounted to $947 million, up 39% from the year-ago quarter. Research and development expenses were $152 million, up 18% on a year-over-year basis.Adjusted operating income remained almost flat year over year at $649 million in the quarter under review. As a percentage of revenues, the operating margin contracted 300 bps to 17.2% in the quarter under review.GuidanceFor fourth-quarter 2022, Baxter anticipates sales to improve by mid-to-high single-digit percentage points on a reported basis. The currency movement is expected to benefit sales by mid-teens percentage points. On an operational basis, the company projects sales to remain nearly flat year over year.For the same period, adjusted EPS is expected between 83 cents and 92 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at 82 cents per share.For full-year 2022, Baxter anticipates sales to improve 17%-18% and by mid-teens percentage points operationally. Sales are expected to grow approximately 23% at cc.Sales from Hilrom businesses are expected to boost Baxter’s top line by 15% in the fourth quarter and 21% in the full year.Adjusted earnings per share are estimated in the range of $3.53 to $3.60 in 2022. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same stands at $3.63.Summing UpBaxter ended third-quarter 2022 on a dismal note, wherein revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and earnings met the same. The company witnessed lower sales across five of its business units. Contraction in growth rates across all geographies and gross and operating margins is concerning. Unfavorable currency movement hurt the sales growth rate and will continue to do so in the second half of 2022.However, the acquisition of Hilrom businesses last year significantly boosted Baxter’s top line in the first nine months of 2022. The trend is expected to continue in the fourth quarter.Meanwhile, cut-throat competition in the MedTech markets remains a woe. An increase in selling, general and administrative expenses is concerning. Weakness in Renal Care, Pharmaceuticals, BioPharma Solutions and Acute Therapies is disappointing.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, Baxter carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are Elevance Health, Inc.

This compares to earnings of $1.02 per share a year ago.

This compares to year-ago revenues of $3.23 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Baxter shares have lost about 32.9% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -19.6%.What's Next for Baxter?While Baxter has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Baxter: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future.

The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.01 on $3.87 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $3.63 on $15.1 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well.

Together, the two natural gas providers serve more than 1 million customers, and the majority receive their electricity service from ComEd.This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20221027005985/en/ComEd’s Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) is a combination of smart meters, communications networks, and data management systems. It has played a key role in ComEd’s ability to deliver record-level reliability, fewer outages and improved customer satisfaction while keeping bills flat.Up to now, Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas have read their customers’ meters by driving a vehicle down every street and transmitting data from each meter via radio signal. AMI will remove that fleet of vehicles from the street, eliminating more than 580,000 driving miles per year and 626 tons of carbon emissions per year. In addition to helping the environment, the cost savings from the reduced driving and other efficiencies will more than offset the cost of AMI. Operational savings for Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas — and in turn, their customers — will total an estimated $5.5 million per year.Connecting to ComEd’s AMI network also will enable Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas customers to view analytics that detail their energy usage and help them control costs. Fewer in-person appointments will be needed as more tasks are able to be completed remotely.""Using AMI will reduce costs for customers and enhance our level of service,"" said Torrence Hinton, president of Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas. ""Combined with the environmental benefits, this is a great step forward for everyone we serve, and across the Chicago region.""Story continues""Our smart grid investments offer value not only for ComEd customers but for other Illinois utilities,"" said Terence Donnelly, ComEd president and COO. ""We are eager to demonstrate the benefits of this innovative solution to the customers we share with Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas.""North Shore Gas expects to complete the implementation of AMI by the end of 2023. Peoples Gas expects to finish implementation by the end of 2024. Installation of any new equipment required will occur in unison with other maintenance work, such as routine safety inspections.The innovative collaboration between ComEd, Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas to eliminate the cost of having two separate networks transmitting meter data will be a model for efficiency and environmental sustainability for utility companies across the United States.ComEd is a unit of Chicago-based Exelon Corporation (NASDAQ: EXC), a Fortune 200 energy company with approximately 10 million electricity and natural gas customers – the largest number of customers in the U.S. ComEd powers the lives of more than 4 million customers across northern Illinois, or 70 percent of the state’s population.

On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis power company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.62 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -12.7%.Revenues are expected to be $1.32 billion, up 0.6% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 228.57% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Pinnacle West?For Pinnacle West, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +1.66%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination indicates that Pinnacle West will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Pinnacle West would post earnings of $1.30 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.45, delivering a surprise of +11.54%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Pinnacle West appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAnother stock from the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry, WEC Energy Group (WEC), is soon expected to post earnings of $0.86 per share for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -6.5%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $1.83 billion, up 5% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for WEC Energy has been revised 0.3% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a higher Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 4.41%.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggests that WEC Energy will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

And out of all of the metrics and results to consider, earnings is one of the most important.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. Goodyear (GT) holds a Zacks Rank #3 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $0.63 a share four days away from its upcoming earnings release on October 31, 2022.By taking the percentage difference between the $0.63 Most Accurate Estimate and the $0.61 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Goodyear has an Earnings ESP of 4.13%.GT is one of just a large database of Auto-Tires-Trucks stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is Rivian Automotive (RIVN).Rivian Automotive is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on November 9, 2022. RIVN's Most Accurate Estimate sits at -$1.77 a share 13 days from its next earnings release.Rivian Automotive's Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 0.47% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of -$1.78.Story continuesGT and RIVN's positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

221,04fa8fff-d432-30c4-9d01-367e1d4872df,RSG,2022-10-28,Republic Services (RSG) Surpasses Q3 Earnings and Revenue Estimates,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/republic-services-rsg-surpasses-q3-212509645.html,1666905909.0,STORY,"['RSG', 'GFLU']","[Republic Services (RSG) came out with quarterly earnings of $1.34 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.21 per share. This compares to earnings of $1.11 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 10.74%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this waste management company would post earnings of $1.18 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.32, delivering a surprise of 11.86%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.Republic Services , which belongs to the Zacks Waste Removal Services industry, posted revenues of $3.6 billion for the quarter ended September 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.93%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $2.93 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Republic Services shares have lost about 4.2% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -19.6%.What's Next for Republic Services?While Republic Services has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Republic Services: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock.

One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. However, after investigating Republic Services (NYSE:RSG), we don't think it's current trends fit the mold of a multi-bagger.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for Republic Services, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.091 = US$2.3b ÷ (US$28b - US$2.9b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2022).Therefore, Republic Services has an ROCE of 9.1%. On its own that's a low return on capital but it's in line with the industry's average returns of 9.5%. See our latest analysis for Republic Services roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Republic Services compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Republic Services here  for free.What The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell UsThere are better returns on capital out there than what we're seeing at Republic Services. The company has employed 39% more capital in the last five years, and the returns on that capital have remained stable at 9.1%. This poor ROCE doesn't inspire confidence right now, and with the increase in capital employed, it's evident that the business isn't deploying the funds into high return investments.Our Take On Republic Services' ROCEIn conclusion, Republic Services has been investing more capital into the business, but returns on that capital haven't increased. Yet to long term shareholders the stock has gifted them an incredible 126% return in the last five years, so the market appears to be rosy about its future. However, unless these underlying trends turn more positive, we wouldn't get our hopes up too high.Story continuesRepublic Services does have some risks though, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for Republic Services  that you might be interested in.If you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

MRK reported third-quarter 2022 adjusted earnings of $1.85 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.67 as well as our estimate of $1.65. Earnings rose 4% year over year (7% excluding the impact of currency) on higher revenues.Including acquisition and divestiture-related costs, restructuring costs, income and losses from investments in equity securities, and certain other items, earnings per share were $1.28, down 29% year over year.Revenues rose 14% year over year (18% on a constant currency basis) to $14.96 billion, driven by higher sales of cancer drugs and most vaccines. Sales comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $14.06 billion and our estimate of $14.12 billion. Excluding Lagevrio sales and currency headwinds, total revenues rose 14%Quarter in DetailThe Pharmaceutical segment generated revenues of $12.96 billion, up 13% year over year. Excluding Lagevrio sales and currency headwinds, Pharmaceutical segment sales were up 9%, driven by higher sales of Keytruda, Gardasil and Bridion. Sales also benefited from easy comparison to the year-ago quarter when sales were hurt by approximately $350 million due to COVID-related business disruptions.Keytruda, the largest product in Merck’s portfolio, generated sales of $5.42 billion in the quarter, up 20% (26% excluding Fx impact) year over year. Keytruda sales gained from continued strong momentum in metastatic indications, including in some types of NSCLC renal cell carcinoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, TNBC and MSI-H cancers, and rapid uptake across recent earlier-stage launches. Keytruda sales beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.24 billion.The company’s COVID-19 drug, Lagevrio generated sales of $436 million during the third quarter, compared to $1.77 billion in the second quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate as well as our estimate for Lagevrio was $300 million.Alliance revenues from Lynparza and Lenvima also boosted oncology sales in the quarter. Merck has a deal with British pharma giant AstraZeneca AZN to co-develop and commercialize PARP inhibitor, Lynparza, and a similar one with Japan’s Eisai for its tyrosine kinase inhibitor, Lenvima.Story continuesAlliance revenues from AstraZeneca-partnered Lynparza increased 16% year over year to $284 million in the quarter. Lenvima alliance revenues were $202 million, up 7% from the year-ago period.In the hospital specialty portfolio, neuromuscular blockade medicine — Bridion injection generated sales of $423 million in the quarter, up 15% year over year, reflecting a recovery in surgical procedures and an increase in market share.Merck’s vaccine portfolio witnessed continued recovery. Sales of HPV vaccines — Gardasil and Gardasil 9 — rose 15% year over year to $2.29 billion due to strong demand in ex-U.S. markets, particularly China, as well as increased supply. U.S. sales increased in the quarter due to the favorable timing of CDC purchasing. Gardasil sales were better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.09 billion, while our estimate is $2.0 billion.Proquad, M-M-R II and Varivax vaccines recorded combined sales of $668 million, up 1% year over year. Sales of the rotavirus vaccine, Rotateq rose 12% to $256 million. Sales of Pneumovax 23 declined 53% to $151 million due to a decline in demand in the United States.Januvia/Janumet (diabetes) franchise sales were down 15% year over year to $1.13 billion. The drug sales were hurt by lower demand and pricing in certain international markets due to generic competition. The drugs lost market exclusivity in China in July and in the European Union in September.Merck’s Animal Health segment generated revenues of $1.37 billion, down 3% year over year due to currency headwinds. Excluding Fx impact, sales rose 4% in the quarter, driven by higher pricing. Animal Health segment sales were less than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.47 billion and our estimate of $1.46 billion.Margin DiscussionAdjusted gross margin was 77.0%, up 20 basis points year over year, driven by the favorable impact of currency and product mix, which offset the impact of lower margins from Lagevrio due to profit-sharing with Ridgeback and higher revenues from third-party manufacturing arrangements.Selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) expenses were $2.5 billion in the reported quarter, up 9% year over year due to higher administrative costs and higher promotional spending. Research and development (R&amp;D) spending was $3.5 billion, reflecting an increase of 45% year over year. The higher R&amp;D costs were due to upfront and other payments made to Moderna MRNA, Orna and Orion in the quarter related to Merck’s collaboration deals with them.In October, Merck exercised its option to jointly develop and commercialize Moderna’s personalized cancer vaccine (PCV) mRNA-4157/V940, per terms of the companies’ existing collaboration agreement. Merck will make an option payment of $250 million to Moderna to exercise this option.2022 GuidanceMerck raised its earnings and sales outlook for the year.Merck expects revenues to be in the range of $58.5-$59.0 billion in 2022 compared with the previous guidance of $57.5-$58.5 billion. The guidance range indicates growth in the range of 20-21% (previously 18-20%).Lagevrio is expected to generate between $5.2 billion and $5.4 billion in sales, compared with the previous expectation of $5 billion to $5.5 billion in 2022.Adjusted earnings per share are expected to be between $7.32 and $7.37 compared with the previously guided range of $7.25 and $7.35The guidance includes a negative impact from foreign exchange of approximately 4% (previously approximately 3%) on sales as well as earnings.Adjusted operating costs are expected to be in the range of $21.3 to $21.7 billion, higher than the earlier expectation of $20.5 to $21.5 billion due to incremental R&amp;D costs. The adjusted tax rate is expected to be approximately 14% (previously between 13.5% and 14.5%).Our TakeMerck’s third-quarter results were better than expected, as it beat estimates for both earnings and sales. An ongoing recovery from the disruptions related to the pandemic and strong global underlying demand across its business, particularly for Keytruda and Gardasil, led to improved sales in the quarter.Merck also slightly upped its sales and earnings expectations for the year. Merck expects better operational growth to be offset by greater than previously expected currency headwinds and incremental R&amp;D expenses recorded in the third quarter, following M&amp;A deals with Moderna, Orna and Orion.Shares of Merck were up 1.6% in pre-market trading, owing to the better-than-expected results and the guidance increase. The stock has rallied 28.4% so far this year compared with the industry’s increase of 0.5%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMerck also made meaningful progress in its pipeline in the quarter.Zacks Rank &amp; Stock to ConsiderMerck currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Merck &amp; Co., Inc.

This compares to earnings of $1.75 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 10.78%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this pharmaceutical company would post earnings of $1.67 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.87, delivering a surprise of 11.98%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.Merck , which belongs to the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, posted revenues of $14.96 billion for the quarter ended September 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 6.43%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $13.15 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Merck shares have added about 28.4% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -19.6%.What's Next for Merck?While Merck has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Merck: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.63 on $13.87 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $7.30 on $58.42 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Large Cap Pharmaceuticals is currently in the top 33% of the 250 plus Zacks industries.

Rafael Cosquiere / PexelsSouthwest Airlines reported a record setting third quarter on Thursday in spite of a pilot shortage that’s preventing the carrier from running its full pre-pandemic flight schedules.“In the other areas, we aren’t perfect, but we’re nearly staffed. We are just short on pilots to fly all our aircraft,” said CEO Bob Jordan said Thursday on CNBC program Squawk Box. Pilot shortages were one of the factors that slowed down the U.S. airline industry’s recovery this summer.Jordan added Southwest isn’t lacking qualified candidates to fill its pilot shortages, noting all of its training centers are full. But they acknowledge they wouldn’t be ready until late next year.“If we had all the pilots that we needed, we could probably fly 5 to 8 percent more (available seat miles) in capacity.”Jordan spoke after Southwest reported record revenue of $6.2 billion in its third quarter earnings call on Thursday. The company also recorded a net income of $277 million. Southwest’s successful quarter came despite the carrier experiencing a 2 percent crop in capacity from the same timeframe in 2019.“It’s a great quarter,” Jordan said. “We’ve got record revenues. We’ve got record passengers. We tied for a record load factor.”He added that Southwest expects the trends boosting the company’s revenue to continue into the fourth quarter. The carrier expects revenue for the fourth quarter to jump up to 17 percent from 2019 levels, citing a bump in post-Labor Day business travel.Southwest is preparing for a surge in bookings while it deals with delays in the delivery of its Boeing aircraft. However, Jordan believes the issue of whether the planemaker can meet a late December deadline for certification of new MAX 7 shouldn’t affect aircraft deliveries to Southwest.“Even though we are off our delivery plan with Boeing, because we are still pilot constrained, it is not affecting our capacity,” he said.Southwest plans to expand its first quarter capacity by 10 percent and its second quarter capacity by 14 percent. The company also expects to hit 90 percent of its pre-pandemic flight schedule by next summer and fully restore it by December.Get breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.]"

A copy of the same can be downloaded here. The fund returned -5.47% net in the third quarter compared to -3.60% return for the Russell 1000 Growth Index and -4.88% return for the S&amp;P 500 Index. Inflation and interest rate hikes caused a decline in the fund’s performance in the quarter. In addition, please check the fund’s top five holdings to know its best picks in 2022.Polen Capital highlighted stocks like Illumina, Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Headquartered in San Diego, California, Illumina, Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN) is a biotechnology company. On October 20, 2022, Illumina, Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN) stock closed at $208.64 per share. One-month return of Illumina, Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN) was 7.83% and its shares lost 49.31% of their value over the last 52 weeks. Illumina, Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN) has a market capitalization of $32.819 billion.Polen Capital made the following comment about Illumina, Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Illumina, Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN) has had a very difficult year on what we believe are transitory issues. First, the company closed its acquisition of Grail, a startup early-stage cancer testing business it re-acquired (Grail was founded inside Illumina originally) for $8 billion without regulatory approval. Illumina management believes that European regulators have no jurisdiction over the transaction as Grail had no European presence or revenue and member states did not complain within the timeframe specified in applicable regulations. The regulators have challenged these assertions and are likely to try to require Illumina to divest Grail subject to Illumina’s appeal. In the meantime, Grail has already been very dilutive to Illumina’s earnings, and Illumina may have to sell the asset at the end of it all. It is unknown how much Grail could be sold for in this environment if Illumina is forced to divest.Second, Illumina’s core sequencing business has also slowed. This is not unusual as the business has always been a bit lumpy, but there are new competitors trying to prove that they can sequence genomes cheaper than Illumina without sacrificing accuracy. Our research here suggests: 1) competitor technologies do not seem to be as cost-effective or accurate in the real world as advertised, providing limited risk to Illumina’s core business; 2) Illumina has unveiled its own next-generation technology, which lowers the cost of sequencing the human genome to only $200, including data processing costs with world-class accuracy; 3) the slowdown in the core business is more macroeconomic as customers are looking to reduce consumables inventory levels in tough times and should pass quite quickly considering customers are continuing to use their sequencers at high levels; and 4) even if Illumina were forced to divest Grail, we think they would likely be able to sell it for above what it purchased it for as all of the clinical data on the company’s Galleri cancer screen is now publicly available (it is very positive in our view). Grail has made significant commercial progress since its acquisition, and the company should only be closer to U.S. regulatory approval. We believe we can buy the shares today at an extremely cheap valuation for the core business of a company that we view as having an unmatched position in a market that should be multiples of its current size in the years to come.""Story continuesBiotech Biochemical Stocks Illumina ILMNIllumina, Inc.

242,55bc01ea-b56b-374a-beb0-95edfb67206e,ILMN,2022-10-28,Illumina (ILMN) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: Can the Stock Move Higher?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/illumina-ilmn-expected-beat-earnings-140202873.html,1666879322,STORY,"['ILMN', 'GSK']","[Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Illumina (ILMN) reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 3. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis genetic testing tools company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.29 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -80%.Revenues are expected to be $1.1 billion, down 0.7% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.06% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Illumina?For Illumina, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.59%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Illumina will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Illumina would post earnings of $0.63 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.57, delivering a surprise of -9.52%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Illumina appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAmong the stocks in the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry, GSK (GSK) is soon expected to post earnings of $0.91 per share for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -27.8%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $7.75 billion, down 38.1% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Glaxo has been revised 9.4% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, reflecting an equal Most Accurate Estimate.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Glaxo will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

243,7bcbf97a-215a-37dc-aaf0-cecd36a1340a,ILMN,2022-10-28,Can Genomics Stop the World's Leading Cause of Death?,ACCESSWIRE,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/genomics-stop-worlds-leading-cause-131500429.html,1666876500,STORY,['ILMN'],"[NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / October 27, 2022 / For decades, cardiovascular disease has remained the number-one cause of death. In 2019 alone, nearly 18 million people around the world died from cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), which include disorders such as coronary heart disease, heart failure, and cerebrovascular disease. Most of these deaths result from heart attack or stroke.While the rate of new CVD occurrence has steadily decreased due to improved preventive and therapeutic strategies, the percentage of people currently affected by it is still increasing due to aging populations. Germany ranks 14th in the world for heart disease, and at least one out of 10 people in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries dies because of heart diseases.Such a widespread problem requires attention on a population scale but also a laser focus at the molecular level. Prof. Dr. Andreas Ziegler, scientific director and CEO of Cardio-CARE, a nonprofit research organization in Switzerland, is using genomics to study the health of thousands of people living in Hamburg. Cardio-CARE, situated near Lake Davos, is dedicated to cardiovascular research, specifically to identify drug targets and develop tools to improve CVD diagnosis and prognosis. ""If you better understand the mechanisms leading to a specific cardiovascular disease, then you are probably able to derive some treatment or prevention concepts,"" Ziegler says. ""If you can identify a new gene that might be involved in, let's say, whether a person develops a myocardial infarction at a young age or not, then this might serve as a potential drug target.""""Think about the richness of the phenotypic data. We could analyze the existing genetic data for years."" - Prof. Dr. Andreas Ziegler, scientific director and CEO of Cardio-CAREThe world's largest local cohortCardio-CARE is the brainchild of logistics magnate Klaus-Michael Kühne. His grandfather cofounded Kühne + Nagel International AG, one of the world's largest third-party logistics companies, which was responsible for distributing Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine worldwide. ""When it comes to logistics and transportation, from my perspective, Mr. Kühne is the most important person for Germany and for Europe,"" says Ziegler. In the 1970s, Kühne's familiy established the Kühne Foundation, which funds Cardio-CARE.Story continuesKühne's birthplace is currently the center of the world's largest population-based local cohort study: The Hamburg City Health Study (HCHS) is enrolling Hamburg residents ages 45 to 75-more than 17,000 to date-and participation requires commitment. One of the study's unique features is its extensive and comprehensive phenotyping; accordingly, its baseline examination lasts six to seven hours per person. Each subject undergoes detailed assessment, including 2D and 3D echocardiography, lung function testing, a dental exam, and skin screening. They're also invited to undergo neurological and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) exams.Cardio-CARE has received whole-genome sequence data from more than 8,000 study participants, and from about another 1,000 patients with specific cardiovascular diseases, such as myocardial infarction (MI) at a young age. With this data, Ziegler and his team will be able to study, for example, whether subjects with an MI contain specific mutations more frequently than population-based controls. ""Think about the richness of the phenotypic data,"" Ziegler says. ""We could analyze the existing genetic data for years.""Enter the DRAGENHCHS conducted its first sequencing in Zurich in November 2019; at the same time, about 150 kilometers away in Davos, Cardio-CARE began facing major hurdles. One was bureaucratic: since Switzerland is not part of the European Union, it took extra time to complete the necessary data protection and exchange documents. Another was technological: They had to set up a high-performance computing cluster that could process, analyze, and store the raw sequence data for 9,000 samples-an estimated petabyte's worth, or about the capacity of 1,000 laptops.Cardio-CARE purchased two Illumina DRAGEN servers, which cut the data-processing time down to about 120 days. Plus, the DRAGEN ORA compression software reduced the storage footprint by about 80%. Their raw data can now be archived on just over 10 external hard disks instead of 50.The Cardio-CARE team decided to go with DRAGEN for the secondary analysis of the WGS data because of its high speed. During the course of the project, the team also observed the high accuracy of DRAGEN.Ziegler has built a lab of 10 people, including bioinformaticians, computer scientists, and biostatisticians, whose collective computer-based training and analytical skills will prove critical in their efforts to prepare, analyze, and process the data. Two professors at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (which is funded by the Kühne Foundation) are affiliated with Cardio-CARE's effort and represent an important component of it: Stefan Blankenberg, the director of the Department of Cardiology, University Heart and Vascular Center; and Raphael Twerenbold, who holds a professorship for clinical cardiology with a focus on genomics and biomarker research.After nearly three years of preparation, they are now merging the phenotypic data with the genetic data and beginning the first true data analysis with a clinical focus. It's been a long journey, and Ziegler is grateful for the efforts of all his colleagues and the Kühne Foundation for granting the opportunity to study this important data, which could one day have a global impact on the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of cardiovascular diseases.Learn more about how Illumina is expanding access to genomics, click here.Illumina, Thursday, October 27, 2022, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Illumina on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: IlluminaWebsite: https://www.illumina.com/company/about-us/corporate-social-responsibility.htmlEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: IlluminaView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/722619/Can-Genomics-Stop-the-Worlds-Leading-Cause-of-Death]"
244,ebcd2a03-a4e5-320c-9401-668cd3c9c6e2,PWR,2022-10-28,Quanta Services (PWR) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/quanta-services-pwr-earnings-expected-140202357.html,1666879322,STORY,"['PWR', 'HWM-P']","[Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Quanta Services (PWR) reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 3, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis specialty contractor for utility and energy companies is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.77 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +19.6%.Revenues are expected to be $4.38 billion, up 30.6% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Quanta Services?For Quanta Services, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.97%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Quanta Services will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Quanta Services would post earnings of $1.51 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.54, delivering a surprise of +1.99%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Quanta Services doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAmong the stocks in the Zacks Engineering - R and D Services industry, Howmet (HWM) is soon expected to post earnings of $0.36 per share for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +33.3%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $1.44 billion, up 12.1% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Howmet has been revised 3.2% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.93%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Howmet will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Their ownership in the project will be recalculated at a future time depending on the total cost to complete the reactors.(Reporting by Scott DiSavino Editing by Bernadette Baum)]"

(SO) came out with quarterly earnings of $1.31 per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.33 per share. This compares to earnings of $1.23 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -1.50%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this power company would post earnings of $0.84 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.07, delivering a surprise of 27.38%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Southern Co. , which belongs to the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry, posted revenues of $8.38 billion for the quarter ended September 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 24.08%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $6.24 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Southern Co. Shares have lost about 4.3% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -19.6%.What's Next for Southern Co.While Southern Co. Has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Southern Co. Mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future.

The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.23 on $6.06 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $3.60 on $26.66 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Utility - Electric Power is currently in the top 50% of the 250 plus Zacks industries.

The results are expected to be released on November 3.This utility is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.72 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +4.2%.

251,cd3876df-2da0-3d72-affb-de64d844c5e5,CI,2022-10-28,Cigna (CI) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cigna-ci-expected-beat-earnings-140202805.html,1666879322,STORY,"['CI', 'JRVR']","[The market expects Cigna (CI) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 3. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis health insurer is expected to post quarterly earnings of $5.70 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -0.5%.Revenues are expected to be $44.87 billion, up 1.3% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Cigna?For Cigna, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.07%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination indicates that Cigna will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Cigna would post earnings of $5.44 per share when it actually produced earnings of $6.22, delivering a surprise of +14.34%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Cigna appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAnother stock from the Zacks Insurance - Multi line industry, James River Group (JRVR), is soon expected to post earnings of $0.40 per share for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +155.6%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $203 million, up 6.3% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for James River Group has been revised 7.4% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, an equal Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that James River Group will beat the consensus EPS estimate.

Northrop estimated 4% to 5% revenue growth in 2023.Northrop had forecast 2022 sales in the range of $36.2 billion to $36.6 billion, and a profit per share between $24.50 and $25.10.Defense companies, still reeling from higher costs and labor shortages, continue to experience supply chain constraints that have impacted production by them and their suppliers.On a post-earnings conference call with investors, Chief Executive Kathy Warden said that ""inflation remains at 40-year high, lead times have been extended in certain areas of our supply chain, and the labor market shows signs of easing, but it remains tight for critical skills.""Northrop, is now seeing improving trends in labor availability after struggling with COVID-19 pandemic-related labor challenges.""Labor availability is gradually improving as 2022 has progressed,"" Chief Financial Officer Dave Keffer told Reuters in an interview, praising his human resources team.There was ""a lot of day-to-day blocking and tackling across a business of our size to have 2,700 net hires"" in the quarter, Keffer said.Revenue at its Aeronautics Systems unit, which manufactures military aircraft such as the B-21 Raider, fell about 7% to $2.54 billion in the third quarter ended Sept. 30 due to lower sales of planes and autonomous aircraft systems.Overall revenue rose 3% in the quarter to $8.97 billion, but missed analysts' average expectation of $9.13 billion, as per Refinitiv data.Sales at the Space Systems division, aided by higher demand for space exploration, rose about 18% to $3.16 billion, helping the Falls Church, Virginia-based company offset lower sales at the aeronautics and defense units.Northrop reported a 14% fall in quarterly adjusted net earnings to $915 million, or $5.89 per share, below expectations of $6.11 per share. Its year-to-date book-to-bill, which is a ratio of orders received to units shipped and billed, was 1.14.

This compares to earnings of $6.63 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -3.28%.

Corporation VFC reported soft second-quarter fiscal 2023 results, with the top and the bottom line missing the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate and declining from the corresponding year-ago fiscal quarter’s readings. Results were hurt by a tough operating environment, including the COVID-related disruption in China, macro-economic and geopolitical headwinds, and the near-term challenges at Vans.Nonetheless, the resiliency of VFC’s brand portfolio and strength in the outdoor, active, streetwear and workwear units are tailwinds.Q2 HighlightsV.F. Corp’s adjusted earnings per share of 73 cents declined 34% year over year and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. On a constant-currency (cc) basis, adjusted earnings per share were down 27%.Net revenues of $3,080.6 million dipped 4% year over year and came below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,103 million. At cc, revenues were up 2%. The top line gained from growth in the EMEA and APAC regions, partly offset by lower sales in the Americas region. Revenues of the company’s big four brands were down 5% (up 1% at cc), while the rest of the portfolio increased 4% (up 13% at cc).VFC’s Outdoor emerging brands in aggregate rose 14% on solid growth at Ultra, registering a double-digit growth rate in road running and trail running. Ultra grew in mid-teens in the Americas and triple-digits in EMEA. Globally, both wholesale and direct-to-consumer businesses recorded low single-digit growth in the quarter. Four of VFC’s five largest markets posted sturdy double-digit growth.Revenues in the Americas were down 3% year over year on a reported basis and 3% at cc. In the EMEA region, revenues dipped 4% (up 12% at cc). APAC revenues decreased 6% on a reported basis (up 2% at cc), whereas revenues in Greater China fell 15% (down 10% at cc). V.F. Corp’s international revenues slipped 5% year over year on a reported basis (up 8% at cc).Channel-wise, wholesale revenues were down 4% (up 3% at cc) year over year. In the direct-to-consumer channel, revenues declined 4% (down 1% at cc). The digital channel witnessed a revenue decline of 7% and 1% on a reported and cc basis, respectively.Gross margin decreased 230 basis points (bps) to 51.4%, mainly driven by increased costs and promotional activity, partly offset by price increases. On an adjusted basis, gross margin decreased 240 bps to 51.5%.Adjusted operating income decreased 29.1% year over year to $378.7 million. The adjusted operating margin contracted 440 bps to 12.3% due to lower gross margin.Story continuesSegmental DetailsRevenues in the Outdoor segment rose 3% to $1,555.3 million (up 10% at cc). The Active segment reported revenues of $1,260.1 million, down 9% (down 4% at cc) year over year. Revenues in the Work segment fell 11% year over year (down 9% at cc) to $265.2 million.Financial DetailsV.F. Corp ended the fiscal first quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $552.8 million, long-term debt of $3,526.1 million and shareholders’ equity of $3,085.6 million. Inventories were up 88% year over year, amounting to $2,749.9 million.For the six months ended September 2022, VFC used an operating cash flow of $914 million from the continuing operations. V.F. Corp returned $194 million to its shareholders through dividend payouts in the fiscal second quarter and $388 million in the first half. VFC declared a quarterly cash dividend of 51 cents per share, reflecting a 2% rise from the prior quarter’s dividend. This will be payable Dec 20, 2022, to its shareholders of record as of Dec 12.Other UpdatesV.F. Corp continues to adjust its business operations per the government guidelines associated with COVID-19. Most of its supply chain is operational at present. Although its raw material suppliers across China are currently operational, it saw an eight-week lockdown in China during the first quarter of fiscal 2023. This led to logistics-related issues causing ongoing product delays. VFC is working with its suppliers to minimize disruptions. Its distribution centers are operating in accordance with the government guidelines to maintain safety and health protocols.All stores in North America and EMEA regions remained open during the reported quarter. In the APAC region, including Mainland China, no stores were shut at the start of the quarter with a peak of 7% stores (including partner doors) closed and an average of 3% of stores shuttered throughout the reported quarter. At the end of the reported quarter, 4% of stores were shut and currently 7% of stores are closed.OutlookFor fiscal 2023, VFC is reaffirming its constant dollar revenue growth of 5-6%. It expects 6.5 points of impact from foreign currency fluctuations on reported revenues. Management expects North Face to grow at least 12%. Vans for the fiscal year will be down mid-single digits.With a more impactful promotional landscape, reflecting the increased levels of inventory across the marketplace and US dollar strengthening, VFC forecasts gross margins to decline 100-150 bps year over year compared with the prior view of a decline of 50 bps. Lower gross margin and higher foreign currency woes induce a fall of nearly 11% in the adjusted operating margin guidance, down from the earlier outlook of an approximate 12%.V.F. Corp envisions earnings per share in the bracket of $2.40-$2.50 compared with $2.60-$2.70 projected earlier. Earnings per share of $3.18 were recorded last year. Management noted that VFC’s balance sheet remains sound with liquidity likely to exceed $2.3 billion by the year-end.Going ahead, adjusted cash flow from operations is likely to be $0.9 billion for fiscal 2023. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $230 million.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe presently Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock has lost 47.8% in the past six months compared with the industry’s decline of 21.3%.Stocks to ConsiderHere we highlighted three better-ranked stocks, namely Designer Brands DBI, Delta Apparel DLA and Caleres CAL.Designer Brands designs, manufactures, and retails footwear and accessories.

Its focus is two-fold:Create affordable homes for people historically precluded from homeownershipReduce the significant racial wealth gapThe Community Foundation, working closely with the City of Atlanta and dozens of nonprofits that support the region's housing sector, has sought solutions for expanded homeownership for communities of color for many years, leading to this coalition of support and funding.A multimillion-dollar grant opportunity from the Wells Fargo Foundation helped galvanize coalition partners. The $7.5 million donation to the Atlanta coalition comes from Wells Fargo's Wealth Opportunities Restored through Homeownership (WORTH) initiative, a $60 million national effort to help create 40,000 new homeowners of color by the end of 2025. Atlanta is one of eight markets across the U.S. to receive a WORTH grant. It was awarded to the Community Foundation for Greater Atlanta, which will lead the new Atlanta collaborative.""Momentum has been building for housing solutions in metro Atlanta for years, and once collaborative partners were asked to put pen to paper and make a financial or in-kind commitment, our region really rose to the challenge,"" said Frank Fernandez, president and CEO of the Community Foundation for Greater Atlanta. ""We have now turned intent into action, with a clear plan, a timeline, and a transparent commitment to drive change. Transforming a $7.5 million Wells Fargo funding opportunity into more than $220 million in leverage is, to say the least, a proof point of our partners' passion for housing equity throughout the region.""Fernandez continued, ""The collaborative partners spent two months actively working together to build the winning grant application, which involved amassing the $220 million in combined capital, philanthropic grants, concessionary debt and in-kind services. Through these four channels, approximately $146 million is committed capital focused on homeownership. Of the $146 million, half is low cost, concessionary debt and the other half is philanthropic grant dollars and a plethora of in-kind services. The remaining $74 million is philanthropic dollars that can be garnered as we produce results on the first $146 million. What's great for Atlanta with this collaborative group is that the leverage brings these dollars together in a coordinated way to have greater impact and unlocks philanthropic dollars that otherwise may have been unavailable because of the sheer volume of the teaming.""Story continuesMetro Atlanta consistently ranks as one of the nation's worst regions for upward mobility(1) despite being home to the second largest population of mortgage-ready Black households(2) in America, in a market that can support accessible prices for homebuyers at most incomes. The racial homeownership gap between Black and white households is now the highest it has been in more than 50 years(3). As of 2019, only 49.9% of households of color owned their home, compared to 75.7% of their white counterparts(4). Black Atlantans, who make up the largest BIPOC demographic in metro Atlanta, are less than half as likely to own their home as white Atlantans. It is estimated that 92% of Black household wealth is in their homes, making home ownership a critical wealth-building strategy.""Affordable housing is at the center of my administration's efforts to build safe, healthy neighborhoods, where ALL Atlantans can thrive,"" said Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens. ""For too long the dream of homeownership has been out of reach for too many of our neighbors. This announcement is a watershed moment for Atlanta and the region, and I am proud to continue to support the efforts of the Community Foundation as they continue to invest in our community.""Collaborative members have committed a broad range of support, including direct funding, education and financial assistance for prospective homeowners, housing units and land for residential development. Partners and resources will be coordinated within an online homeownership HUB, launching later this year from the Urban League, to connect potential buyers and related providers to resources (down payment assistance, Realtors®, etc.) and to connect homebuilders with mortgage-ready buyers. Atlanta Housing, Atlanta Neighborhood Development Partnership (ANDP), the Atlanta Regional Commission, HouseATL and the Urban League of Greater Atlanta are among the key partners who will be advancing the work of the collaborative.""The significant homeownership gap is a pervasive problem throughout our society and too great a challenge for any one entity to tackle,"" said Otis Rolley, president of the Wells Fargo Foundation and head of Philanthropy and Community Impact. ""Through our grant, we want to accelerate the collective strength of the Atlanta WORTH collaborative to help make affordable homeownership a reality for more people so they can pass that legacy on to their children.""The City of Atlanta and Community Foundation committed more than $20 million each to this effort. Other key funders and partners include ANDP, Enterprise Community Partners, Habitat for Humanity regional teams based in Atlanta, DeKalb, Gwinnett/Walton and Northwest Atlanta, LISC and Reinvestment Fund, each committing more than $10 million in capital or housing production and preservation.Nearly 50 organizations, from corporations to municipalities and nonprofits, signed letters of support toward this effort, illustrating the groundswell of commitment and momentum that exists in metro Atlanta. Other organizations were engaged throughout the research, planning and grant application process to analyze market conditions and identify potential solutions.The Community Foundation for Greater Atlanta has more than 70 years of deep leadership for fundraising via multiple avenues and for leveraging philanthropy to connect organizations and resources for successful programs. Additionally, its support of HouseATL as a regional collaboration toward housing equity accelerated in 2022 with enhanced commitments to drive action.Access to affordable housing and addressing the racial wealth gap are key tenets of the Foundation's TogetherATL promise to create a more prosperous and equitable Atlanta for all who call it home.About the Community Foundation for Greater AtlantaThe Community Foundation for Greater Atlanta inspires and leads the Atlanta region toward equity and shared prosperity for all who call it home. TogetherATL is the Foundation's strategic ethos, working through a collaborative approach with community stakeholders, donors, nonprofits and others to examine complex challenges the region faces and create solutions that build a thriving region. Started in 1951, the Community Foundation shepherds approximately $1.4 billion in current assets through its 1,000+ donor funds, while simultaneously raising and deploying more than $120 million annually to thousands of nonprofit organizations. It is Georgia's second largest foundation.

Vaccinations gave PFE a boost during the pandemic with the stock up nicely over the last few years.Post-pandemic, revenue from Covid-19 vaccines may eventually start to fade and investors may want to start paying attention to other business units in the company.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBusiness UnitsPfizer’s business is comprised of six business segments – Oncology, Inflammation &amp; Immunology, Rare Disease, Hospital, Vaccines, and Internal Medicine. During the second quarter, the vaccines segment was up 13% from Q2 2021 at $10.45 billion. This accounted for more than a third of the company’s Q2 revenue with the rare disease segment the only other unit seeing a year over year increase.Still, Pfizer posted record quarterly sales at $27.7 billion. Pfizer beat on both its top and bottom lines during Q2 and blasted earnings expectations by 16% at $2.04 per share. This was driven by strong contributions in its covid-19 vaccine Comirnaty and covid antiviral Paxlovid. While Q3 could see another boost from vaccines Wall Street will eventually be looking for additional growth among its other segments.Q3 OutlookThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for PFE’s Q3 earnings is $1.47 per share, which would be a 10% increase from Q3 2021. Sales for Q3 are expected to be down -12% at $21.04 billion. This would show that Pfizer effectively managed operating costs and perhaps had some pricing power to boost its bottom line.However, estimates for the period have largely gone down from $1.91 per share at the beginning of the quarter. Year over year, PFE earnings are expected to climb 44%, but decline -17% in FY23 at $5.28 per share as it comes up against difficult to compete against periods. With that being said, Fiscal year 2023 earnings estimates have started to rise over the last week.Performance &amp; Valuation Story continuesPFE is down -22% in 2022 to roughly match the S&amp;P 500’s decline while underperforming its peer group’s +1% which includes notable companies like Johnson &amp; Johnson JNJ and AbbVie ABBV. When including dividends over the last 5 years, PFE’s total return is + 65% to slightly outperform the benchmark and beat its peer group’s +34%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThis year’s drop in PFE could be an opportunity for longer-term investors. Trading around $46 a share, PFE has a forward P/E of 7.2X. This is below the industry average of 13.3X. Even better, PFE trades below its decade-high of 17.5X and the median of 13.1X.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineThird quarter earnings will give investors knowledge of Pfizer’s ability to expand Covid-19 revenue. Vaccine revenue will most likely fade as we move further away from the pandemic. The company’s ability to beat earnings expectations may rely on the growth of other business units during the quarter.PFE currently lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and its Large Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry is in the top 33% of over 250 Zacks Industries. PFE offers a solid 3.47% annual dividend yield at $1.60 per share and the Average Zacks Price Target suggests 28% upside from current levels.  Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

It affects people who have had both mild and severe COVID-19, including children, and can be severe enough to keep people out of work.Pfizer did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend investing and returns of dividend stocks relative to the broader market, and go directly to read 5 Best Dividend Stocks Under $5. The investment trends are consistently changing this year as stock markets come under pressure due to rising inflation. Investors are leaning on previously overlooked defensive securities while dumping growth tech stocks. Moreover, in the current rising interest rate environment, investors are finding solace in dividend stocks. The tech-heavy NASDAQ recorded a harsh decline of 29.4% this year, compared with a 19.2% drop in the S&amp;P 500, as of the close of October 25.Over the years, dividend stocks have generated returns that have surpassed the broader market. Especially dividend reinvestments have a significant impact on overall returns. In the last 15 years ending August 2021, the total return of dividend stocks with reinvestments stood at 10.62%, compared with a 6.89% price return, as reported by CIBC Asset Management. The report also mentioned that the High Dividend Index for Canada, America, and the World has outperformed the broader market from 2001 to 2020. According to analysts, investing in dividends can be trickier as investors often fall victim to troubled companies paying hefty dividends. Rather investors should focus on quality companies boasting dividend growth track records with the potential to maintain those payments. Some popular dividend stocks include Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO), JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE).In addition to dividend stocks, mutual funds that specialize in dividend securities have seen record inflows this year. According to a report by Bloomberg, inflows in dividend ETFs grew 25% from the previous record of 2021, reporting positive inflows every month this year. Bloomberg Intelligence estimates high dividend ETFs to double their inflows this year.Story continues11 Best Dividend Stocks Under $5Photo by Artem Beliaikin on UnsplashOur Methodology:For this list, we selected stocks that have share prices below $5 and pay dividends to shareholders.

279,938325a3-b86d-32cb-8bd0-f872efdcc433,PYPL,2022-10-28,Paypal (PYPL) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paypal-pypl-expected-beat-earnings-140202431.html,1666879322,STORY,"['PYPL', 'PAYC']","[The market expects Paypal (PYPL) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 3, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis technology platform and digital payments company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.95 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -14.4%.Revenues are expected to be $6.82 billion, up 10.3% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.35% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Paypal?For Paypal, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +1.66%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Paypal will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Paypal would post earnings of $0.85 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.93, delivering a surprise of +9.41%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Paypal appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAmong the stocks in the Zacks Internet - Software industry, Paycom Software (PAYC) is soon expected to post earnings of $1.18 per share for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +28.3%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $328.09 million, up 28.1% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Paycom has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.85%.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Paycom will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The company's shares saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the NYSE. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Today I will analyse the most recent data on International Business Machines’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists. Check out our latest analysis for International Business Machines Is International Business Machines Still Cheap?Good news, investors! International Business Machines is still a bargain right now. My valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $220.78, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low. Another thing to keep in mind is that International Business Machines’s share price may be quite stable relative to the rest of the market, as indicated by its low beta. This means that if you believe the current share price should move towards its intrinsic value over time, a low beta could suggest it is not likely to reach that level anytime soon, and once it’s there, it may be hard to fall back down into an attractive buying range again.Can we expect growth from International Business Machines?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. International Business Machines' earnings over the next few years are expected to double, indicating a very optimistic future ahead. This should lead to stronger cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since IBM is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With an optimistic outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on IBM for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its prosperous future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy IBM. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the track record of its management team, in order to make a well-informed investment decision.So while earnings quality is important, it's equally important to consider the risks facing International Business Machines at this point in time.

For more companies, head on over to 5 Biggest Data Science Companies In USA. Big data analytics, also known as data science, is one of the hottest fields in information technology. This is due to the fact that it is nearly ubiquitous across industries, and the growth and popularity of the Internet has led to vast sums of data being generated daily for advertisers to capitalize on.Estimates show that the amount of data that is generated globally will grow to unbelievable amounts. Research firm IDC believes that global data will grow at a stunning compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 61% between 2018 and 2025, to 175 zettabytes by 2025. For the uninitiated, a gigabyte of information contains 1024 megabytes, and a zettabyte has roughly 1,100 trillion megabytes - much larger than your daily Internet usage we'd assume. To better understand the significance of IDC's estimates, if all this data was written onto blu-ray disks, then these disks could be stacked to the Moon 23 times over.This growth has also spurred a strong interest in the field itself, with the Department of Labor estimating that the data science sector is expected to grow by 26% through 2026. Naturally, this growth will also boost salaries in the field, and the average salary for the field sits at $111,000 in the U.S. right now. Finally, looking at the sector as a whole, Markets and Markets estimates that the data science platform market was worth $95 billion last year, and between then and 2026, it will grow at a CAGR of 27.7% to be worth $322.9 billion. It further outlines that the growth in the business and finance sectors will lead the way for the industry.Therefore, it's fairly accurate to say that the data science sector has a great future ahead of it, and in today's piece we have narrowed down the top data science companies. Among these, the renowned players are Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon.com, Inc.

Maybe the best evidence: it’s managed to outperform the S&amp;P 500 over the past decade despite a horrible pandemic ending point (+13.2% vs. 11.7%1 ). It trades for 4x 2024 earnings!

This compares to earnings of $0.36 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 4.69%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this company that services ships, jets and trucks would post earnings of $0.29 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.41, delivering a surprise of 41.38%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.World Fuel Services , which belongs to the Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry, posted revenues of $15.66 billion for the quarter ended September 2022, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.88%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $8.35 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.World Fuel Services shares have added about 3.1% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -19.6%.What's Next for World Fuel Services?While World Fuel Services has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for World Fuel Services: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock.

This is the second consecutive year Marathon has supported the organization.A man who lost a leg and had to use a wheelchair was having difficulty getting into his bathroom because of the wheelchair's width. Volunteers from Rebuilding Together El Paso (RTEP) widened the doorway and installed wheelchair-accessible fixtures. Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC) and employees from its El Paso refinery are working to create similar stories across the city over the next year through a $50,000 grant to RTEP.RTEP is an affiliate of Rebuilding Together, a national non-profit organization that coordinates with contractors and volunteers in cities across the country to repair and rehabilitate homes for people in need, including low-income residents, senior citizens, people with disabilities and victims of natural disasters. The projects can involve roof and plumbing repairs, pest control, adding insulation, painting, replacing windows, converting tubs to showers and installing grab bars.""Each project could make a potentially life-changing difference for the homeowner who ... might otherwise have to go on living in unsafe or unhealthy conditions.""This is the second year MPC has supported RTEP with a grant and project volunteers. This year's funds are expected to facilitate projects at 15 homes through next August. The plan is for refinery employees to continue volunteering on projects about once a quarter, primarily in neighborhoods in the vicinity of the refinery. Maintenance Department Manager Brandon Bielamowicz organizes the volunteer teams and serves on RTEP's board of directors.Story continues""I've always been passionate about volunteer work, but especially hands-on work,"" Bielamowicz said. ""When I learned about opportunities in the community to serve on a board, I knew I didn't just want to sit around a table. I wanted to be involved on the ground to make a difference and get my hands dirty.""Empowering womenRTEP's data indicate women and elderly homeowners represent most of its clients, amounting to about 70% of the total in 2020. Beyond rehabilitation projects, RTEP offers a program called SheBuilds, which provides free classes for women that teach home repair and maintenance skills. This program also helps link women-owned and women-led businesses and non-profit organizations to women in need in the community.Since RTEP began in 1991, it has helped more than 2,000 homeowners and their families. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Bielamowicz noted overall financial contributions declined, meaning MPC's recent financial support has come at a pivotal time.""In a typical year, the demand for these services exceeds RTEP's capacity to respond to all requests, and a funding reduction just widens the gap,"" he said. ""Each additional project we can complete could make a potentially life-changing difference for the homeowner who, in many cases, might otherwise have to go on living in unsafe or unhealthy conditions.""View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Marathon Petroleum Corporation on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Marathon Petroleum CorporationWebsite: https://www.marathonpetroleum.com/Sustainability/Email: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Marathon Petroleum CorporationView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/722707/Marathon-Petroleum-Grant-Helps-Rebuilding-Together-Transform-Lives-in-El-Paso]"

This factor can impact your investment portfolio as well as help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.Another thing that can drive investing is the fear of missing out, or FOMO. This particularly applies to tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.What if you'd invested in Marathon Petroleum (MPC) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to MPC for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?Marathon Petroleum's Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at Marathon Petroleum's main business drivers.Findlay, OH-based Marathon Petroleum Corporation is a leading independent refiner, transporter and marketer of petroleum products. The company, in its current form, came into existence following the 2011 spin-off of Houston, TX-based Marathon Oil Corporation’s refining/sales business into a separate, independent and publicly-traded entity.  In October 2018, Marathon Oil completed the acquisition of its rival Andeavor in a $23.3 billion deal, thereby becoming the nationwide largest refining company by market capitalization. The deal also made the company the largest U.S. refiner and the fifth largest in the world by capacity.Marathon Petroleum operates in two segments: Refining and Marketing and Pipeline Transportation.Refining and Marketing: The unit’s operations include 16 refineries, located in the West Coast, Gulf Coast and the Mid-Continent regions of the United States, having a combined crude processing capacity of more than 3 million barrels per day. Additionally, Marathon Petroleum – through its marketing organization – sells transportation fuels, asphalt and specialty products throughout the country to support commercial, industrial and retail operations. In 2021, the Refining &amp; Marketing segment recorded a profit of $1 billion.Story continuesMidstream: This unit mainly reflects Marathon Petroleum’s general partner and majority limited partner interests in MPLX LP and Andeavor Logistics LP - publicly-traded master limited partnerships that own and operate gathering and processing assets along with crude transportation and logistics infrastructure. Marathon Petroleum owns 63.6% each of MPLX’s and ANDX’s common units. The 'Midstream' segment reported total earnings of $4.1 billion in 2021.Last year, Marathon Petroleum sold its Speedway business to Japanese retail group Seven &amp; i Holdings – owner of the 7-Eleven convenience store chain – for $21 billion.As of Dec 31, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $5.3 billion and a total debt, including that of MPLX, of $25.5 billion.Bottom LineWhile anyone can invest, building a lucrative investment portfolio takes research, patience, and a little bit of risk. If you had invested in Marathon Petroleum ten years ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today.A $1000 investment made in October 2012 would be worth $4,068.33, or a gain of 306.83%, as of October 27, 2022, according to our calculations. This return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.The S&amp;P 500 rose 171.30% and the price of gold increased -6.65% over the same time frame in comparison.Analysts are anticipating more upside for MPC.Marathon Petroleum shares have outperformed the Zacks Oil Refining &amp; Marketing industry in a year (+57.7% versus +34.7%) and is poised for further price gains based on a slew of tailwinds. One of the largest oil refiners in the United States, Marathon’s $21 billion sale of its Speedway retail business provided the company with a much-needed cash infusion. The deal also comes with a 15-year fuel supply agreement per which Marathon will supply 7.7 billion gallons of gasoline per year to 7-Eleven, thus ensuring a steady revenue stream. The company’s exposure to the more stable cash flows from logistics segment diversifies earnings stream and offers a buffer against the volatile refining business. Consequently, Marathon is primed for significant capital appreciation and is viewed a preferred downstream operator to own now.Over the past four weeks, shares have rallied 13.02%, and there have been 5 higher earnings estimate revisions in the past two months for fiscal 2022 compared to none lower. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

This is likely to get reflected in the upcoming results.Moreover, solid momentum across product lines like BioAccord and Cyclic IMS might have remained a positive.BioAccord, Waters’ robust liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry solution, is expected to have benefited the Waters segment’s performance in the to-be-reported quarter.Additionally, Waters robust technology portfolio is likely to have strengthened its presence in the liquid chromatography market in the quarter to be reported.Waters’ large molecule applications are expected to have witnessed a strong adoption rate, which is likely to get reflected in the third-quarter results.This apart, WAT’s strengthening presence in the industrial and pharmaceutical end-markets, is a tailwind.Also, growing momentum across biomedical research applications is expected to have contributed well.However, coronavirus-related uncertainties are anticipated to have persisted as major headwinds. Fresh lockdowns in China are likely to have impacted WAT’s third-quarter performance in the country.Story continuesWhat Our Model SaysOur proven model conclusively predicts an earnings beat for Waters this time around.

287,768726ce-3627-31b0-ba1b-89cf0336189b,WAT,2022-10-28,Analysts Estimate Bruker (BRKR) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-estimate-bruker-brkr-report-140202243.html,1666879322,STORY,"['BRKR', 'WAT']","[Bruker (BRKR) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 3. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis scientific equipment maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.53 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -15.9%.Revenues are expected to be $613.53 million, up 0.8% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.24% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Bruker?For Bruker, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Bruker will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Bruker would post earnings of $0.45 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.45, delivering no surprise.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Bruker doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAnother stock from the Zacks Instruments - Scientific industry, Waters (WAT), is soon expected to post earnings of $2.57 per share for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -3.4%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $680.3 million, up 3.2% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Waters has been revised 0.1% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a higher Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0.35%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP indicates that Waters will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In addition, you can check the top 5 holdings of the fund to know its best picks in 2022.Massif Capital discussed stocks like The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES) in the Q3 2022 investor letter. Headquartered in Arlington, Virginia, The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES) is a power generation and utility company. On October 25, 2022, The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES) stock closed at $25.19 per share. One-month return of The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES) was 13.26% and its shares lost 0.71% of their value over the last 52 weeks. The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES) has a market capitalization of $16.825 billion.Massif Capital made the following comment about The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:""Roughly 11% of the portfolio is allocated to U.S. utility The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES) and Canadian independent power producer Polaris Renewable Energy. Both positions have had modest performance this year. Polaris has been more volatile than is justified by the underlying business, putting in an all-time high this year at the beginning of August before tumbling 30.0%. AES has been far more stable and traded in a tighter range but is also down for the year by 5.4%, inclusive of reinvesting the dividends into treasury bills.AES has continued to build its robust pipeline of energy projects and its strong backlog of signed power purchase agreements (PPAs). Currently, AES has 3.8 GW of renewables with signed PPAs under construction, 6.7 GW of signed PPAs for which building has yet to start, and a total development pipeline of 59 GW as of the start of 2022. Of note is that energy storage projects now make up 18% of that pipeline, with roughly 50% of PPA's including some storage component.AES continues to lag some of its peers on a multiple basis, which offers the opportunity for relative and absolute outperformance but raises questions about what the market may be concerned by. Solar supply chain issues are the best explanation for short-term underperformance, but on a two-year basis, AES trades at a roughly 30% discount to peers as measured by P/E and a 27% discount measured on an EV/EBIT basis. Balance sheet concerns may drive the discount, but AES has enjoyed several years of steady credit improvement and notched investment grade ratings across the board in the last 24 months. Still, forward-looking leverage levels remain elevated relative to peers.

This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +2.53%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that AES will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that AES would post earnings of $0.31 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.34, delivering a surprise of +9.68%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.AES doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAvista (AVA), another stock in the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $0.26 for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of +30%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $312.6 million, up 5.6% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Avista has been revised 1.5% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -38.46%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Avista will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

299,178ae6ad-f848-3740-b687-05b3c5bf56e3,PNW,2022-10-28,Pinnacle West (PNW) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: What to Know Ahead of Q3 Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pinnacle-west-pnw-expected-beat-140202173.html,1666879322,STORY,"['PNW', 'WEC']","[The market expects Pinnacle West (PNW) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 3, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis power company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.62 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -12.7%.Revenues are expected to be $1.32 billion, up 0.6% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 228.57% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Pinnacle West?For Pinnacle West, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +1.66%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination indicates that Pinnacle West will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Pinnacle West would post earnings of $1.30 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.45, delivering a surprise of +11.54%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Pinnacle West appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAnother stock from the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry, WEC Energy Group (WEC), is soon expected to post earnings of $0.86 per share for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -6.5%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $1.83 billion, up 5% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for WEC Energy has been revised 0.3% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a higher Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 4.41%.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggests that WEC Energy will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NASDAQ:ISRG)",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/look-fair-value-intuitive-surgical-110043596.html,1666954843.0,STORY,['ISRG'],"[Does the October share price for Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. Check out our latest analysis for Intuitive Surgical Is Intuitive Surgical Fairly Valued?We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.13bUS$2.47bUS$2.71bUS$3.10bUS$3.39bUS$3.62bUS$3.82bUS$3.99bUS$4.14bUS$4.27bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x5Analyst x5Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 9.15%Est @ 7%Est @ 5.5%Est @ 4.44%Est @ 3.7%Est @ 3.19% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.2% US$2.0kUS$2.2kUS$2.3kUS$2.4kUS$2.5kUS$2.5kUS$2.5kUS$2.5kUS$2.4kUS$2.3k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$24bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.2%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$4.3b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (6.2%– 2.0%) = US$104bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$104b÷ ( 1 + 6.2%)10= US$57bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$81b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$242, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Intuitive Surgical as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.894. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Next Steps:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

The company's third-quarter earnings report was particularly impressive, recording sky-high sales growth and positioning it as one of the best performing health care stocks on the market.One has to give credit where it is due. Intuitive Surgical's recent performance has been nothing short of exemplary. It is finally recovering after a massive drop in demand during the early stages of the pandemic, when many elective surgeries were delayed. According to Fortune Business Insights, the global medical devices market saw a decline of 1.4% in 2020 as medical practitioners held off on purchases. Now things are returning to normal, and Intuitive Surgical is reaping the benefits.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with ISRG. Click here to check it out. ISRG 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of ISRGPeter Lynch Chart of ISRGAbout Intuitive SurgicalIntuitive Surgical is a leading developer and manufacturer of innovative medical robotics systems, with its main product being the da Vinci Surgical System. Intuitive Surgical has become one of the most trusted names in medical robotics with its cutting-edge technology that allows surgeons to perform complex surgical procedures with precision and ease.Given the impressive projected growth of the medical robotics market in general, along with Intuitive's other key factors like high procedure and revenue growth, low operating expenses and the ongoing share repurchase program, it's easy to see why Intuitive Surgical has strong popularity with anyone looking to invest in this rapidly evolving industry. Furthermore, with the recent comeback of robotic surgeries after a brief downturn in the beginning of the pandemic, it's clear that Intuitive Surgical's near-term outlook is great. This company is poised for success.Story continuesRecent earningsFor the third quarter, the company reported an increase of 11% in revenue over the same period last year to $1.56 billion. Meanwhile, adjusted earnings per share were $1.19 and topped Wall Street analysts' projections of $1.12. This growth can be attributed to several factors, including Intuitive Surgical's strong financial position and commitment to innovation and quality. The company is debt-free and has $7.4 billion in cash on its books. Furthermore, thanks to the continued popularity of Intuitive Surgical's products, the company has also seen steady growth in revenues from instruments and accessories. Previously, the company had estimated between 14% and 16.5% growth for the fiscal year 2022, but now it is projecting 17% to 18%.Intuitive Surgical continues to be a leader in the minimally invasive robotic surgery field, offering hospitals and patients access to world-class care with life-changing results. The recent results confirm it remains a strong performer during market volatility.Intuitive Surgical will continue to benefit from a growing marketThe global medical devices market experienced significant disruption due to the Covid-19 pandemic. This decline, reported at 1.4% for 2020, was largely attributed to reduced demand for elective surgeries. However, despite this setback, market analysts are projecting robust growth for this sector, with the market expected to reach $495.46 billion for 2022 and $718.92 billion by 2029 according to estimates from Fortune Business Insights.The main drivers of this growth are increased demand for portable medical devices among the public and growing investment in R&amp;D by major industry players. Moreover, certain key trends in the medical devices industry are also contributing to this development: the rising prevalence of chronic diseases worldwide, a steady increase in both diagnostic and inpatient procedures performed annually and improved diagnostic technologies that allow patients to receive quick and reliable diagnoses. Overall, it is clear that despite current challenges, the medical devices market has ample potential for continued growth in the years ahead, though I should caution most of this expected growth appears to be outside of Intuitive Surgical's realm of expertise.Thanks to its well-entrenched position, Intuitive Surgical can maintain a competitive edge over smaller up-and-coming companies looking to gain a foothold in robotic surgeries. Furthermore, Intuitive Surgical's commitment to quality and customer satisfaction has helped it build strong relationships with hospitals and medical professionals, solidifying its reputation as an industry leader.Well-diversified business modelIntuitive Surgical is one of the most dominant health care companies in the world, with products sold in over 67 countries. Despite its focus on robotic surgeries, the company has achieved diversification through its global reach. In fact, during the third quarter alone, Intuitive Surgical placed 175 systems in these key regions. Non-U.S. currencies accounted for over 20% of its total revenue during this period.Intuitive Surgical also has a new product on the market that revolutionizes how surgical procedures are performed. The da Vinci single-port surgical system utilizes advanced robotics and camera technology to allow surgeons to access deep tissue and organs with a single, small incision. Thanks to its versatile design, this cutting-edge system can be used in various surgeries, including those related to the head and neck, thorax, gynecology, general surgery and urology. In September, Japan's Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare approved the da Vinci single-port surgical system for use in surgeries.Over the past several years, Intuitive Surgical has rapidly expanded its global reach, with regulatory approvals for its technologies in North America, South Korea and Japan.This rapid pace of adoption and innovation is very promising for investors.ValuationDespite the recent challenges posed by the pandemic, Intuitive Surgical remains well-positioned for long-term success. With its proven track record of strong performance, Intuitive Surgical has consistently demonstrated that it is a profitable and viable company. Furthermore, given the unprecedented nature of the Covid-19 crisis, Intuitive Surgical's ability to weather severe shifts in demand or unexpected supply pressures will be critical to its continued success.The only issue for investors now is the valuation. While Intuitive Surgical is undoubtedly one of the leaders in robotic surgery, its shares are trading at a price-earnings ratio of 62.76, making it significantly more expensive than many of its peers in the medical devices industry. Furthermore, this high valuation is well above Intuitive Surgical's average price-earnings ratio over the past 10 years, which has averaged just 44.4. Personally, I would wait for a more attractive entry point.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

(ISRG) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this company have returned +25.6%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +5.4% change. During this period, the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry, which Intuitive Surgical, Inc. falls in, has gained 6.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Intuitive Surgical, Inc. is expected to post earnings of $1.24 per share, indicating a change of -4.6% from the year-ago quarter.

After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Intuitive Surgical, Inc. the consensus sales estimate of $1.68 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +8.2%. The $6.26 billion and $7 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +9.6% and +11.8%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryIntuitive Surgical, Inc. reported revenues of $1.56 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +11%. EPS of $1.19 for the same period compares with $1.19 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.52 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.17%. The EPS surprise was +8.18%.Over the last four quarters, Intuitive Surgical, Inc. surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Intuitive Surgical, Inc. is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Intuitive Surgical, Inc. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In a nod to both Galveston and Texas, the Galveston Beach Trio sculpture, designed by Texas-based Brad Oldham Sculpture, will welcome guests as they embark on their vacation from the cruise line's new terminal facility that opens this November.(PRNewsfoto/Royal Caribbean Group)""Our passion lies in sharing the world's incredible destinations with our guests, allowing them to experience cultures from around the world, including the places from which their travels begin,"" said Joshua Carroll, vice president, Destination Development, Royal Caribbean Group. ""Showcasing the history and culture of Galveston was our top priority in establishing this art installation in our new terminal, and we're thrilled to partner with Brad Oldham Sculpture to bring this vision to life.""Forged in stainless steel and lost-wax bronze, the Galveston Beach Trio is the embodiment of island time and a dynamic first impression. The larger-than-life sculpture depicts a musical trio inspired by the rich musical heritage of the historic port city. That heritage includes musicians like, Galveston-native and Grammy Award-winning bass-baritone singer and songwriter Barry White, as well as local artists like Joyce Fields, who played piano for nearly 20 years at Sunday brunch at the historic Hotel Galvez, and Joe Pena, the guitarist known as the Granddaddy of Galveston Rock and Roll.The Royal Caribbean Group team tapped Houston-based Piper Faust Public Art to assemble a slate of Texas artists to consider for this unique opportunity. In the end, the one-of-a-kind trio design concept by the husband-and-wife team of Brad Oldham and Christy Coltrin of Brad Oldham Sculpture was selected. These two artists specialize in narrative-based sculpture and site-specific installations designed to evoke the spirit and heart of unique places.Story continues""When we started working on the design concepts for a placemaking sculpture at Royal Caribbean's new cruise terminal in Galveston, we first talked about our favorite family vacations,"" said Brad Oldham. ""Some of our best memories are from traveling together. We are honored to create a permanent installation that cultivates the vacation vibe with an approachable music theme using native animals to make up the band. It is exciting to think that the Galveston Beach Trio may make it into family vacation pictures to capture the special time together.""Galveston is particularly meaningful to me because my grandfather was a 1925 graduate of Ball High School before attending Texas A&amp;M University,"" said Christy Coltrin. ""He had a private architecture practice in Galveston in the 1940s. I think that he would like to know that his granddaughter helped create a sculpture celebrating his hometown.""This community-inspired feature is the latest initiative of Royal Caribbean Group's Blue Green Promise to protect the oceans it sails, inspire future generations and empower ocean communities.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Hubbell Inc. HUBB, Middlesex Water Co. MSEX, Mueller Water Products Inc. MWA, Visa Inc. V and Rollins Inc. ROL.Here are highlights from Wednesday’s Analyst Blog:Watch These 5 Stocks That Recently Hiked Their DividendWall Street is witnessing a solid rally in October after a highly disappointing September. However, we are not out of the woods. Market participants remain concerned about the Fed's decision about the future course of interest rate movement.The Fed has hiked the benchmark lending rate by 3% so far this year. Yet the inflation rate has stayed at a 40-year high. The yields on the short-term 2-Year U.S. Treasury Note and the benchmark 10-Year U.S. Treasury Note remain elevated at a 14-year high.The U.S. consumer confidence index dropped to a three-month low. The ISM manufacturing PMI has been declining for the last three months. Moreover, manufacturers and retailers are accumulating huge inventories.Despite a tight labor market, job openings have been declining. Several U.S. corporate behemoths have either started retrenching manpower or have given indication of doing so in the near future. Investors are highly worried about an imminent recession.Stocks in FocusAt this stage, dividend-paying stocks should be in huge demand as investors try to safeguard their portfolios. We believe one should consider stocks that have recently raised their dividend payments. Five such companies are Hubbell Inc., Middlesex Water Co., Mueller Water Products Inc., Visa Inc. and Rollins Inc..Hubbell is engaged in the design, manufacture and sale of electrical and electronic products to commercial, industrial, utility and telecommunications markets. HUBB's products include plugs, receptacles, connectors, lighting fixtures, high voltage test and measurement equipment and voice and data signal processing components.Story continuesHubbell operates through two segments — Electrical Solution and Utility Solution.

This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 3. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis hotel company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.69 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +70.7%.Revenues are expected to be $5.27 billion, up 33.5% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.12% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Marriott?For Marriott, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +1.55%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #1.So, this combination indicates that Marriott will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Marriott would post earnings of $1.59 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.80, delivering a surprise of +13.21%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release.

However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NASDAQ:MAR) institutional owners after losing 2.6% over the past year",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/recent-uptick-might-appease-marriott-125334863.html,1666875214,STORY,['MAR'],"[If you want to know who really controls Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 65% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Institutional investors would probably welcome last week's 3.4% increase in share prices after a year of 2.6% losses as a sign that returns are likely to begin trending higher.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Marriott International, beginning with the chart below. Check out our latest analysis for Marriott International ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Marriott International?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.We can see that Marriott International does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Marriott International's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Marriott International. David Marriott is currently the largest shareholder, with 7.9% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 6.9% and 5.0% of the stock.Story continuesAfter doing some more digging, we found that the top 14 have the combined ownership of 51% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Marriott InternationalWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.It seems insiders own a significant proportion of Marriott International, Inc.. It has a market capitalization of just US$50b, and insiders have US$7.8b worth of shares in their own names. That's quite significant. Most would be pleased to see the board is investing alongside them. You may wish to access this free chart showing recent trading by insiders.General Public OwnershipWith a 15% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Marriott International. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Private Company OwnershipOur data indicates that Private Companies hold 4.1%, of the company's shares. Private companies may be related parties. Sometimes insiders have an interest in a public company through a holding in a private company, rather than in their own capacity as an individual. While it's hard to draw any broad stroke conclusions, it is worth noting as an area for further research.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Marriott International better, we need to consider many other factors.

The effects of climate change have shown detrimental impacts to every continent and ocean across the globe, however, its hazardous events and trends have disproportionately impacted vulnerable populations. Recognizing climate change as a socio-economic issue is essential to driving the innovation needed to build climate equity for all people.According to the 2021 Social Vulnerability Report from the United States Environmental Protection Agency, global patterns of inequality on the basis of income, education, race, ethnicity and age are directly linked to the disproportionate effects of climate change we see today. The report finds that with 2 degrees Celsius of global warming:Black and African American people are 34 percent more likely to live in areas with the highest projected increases in childhood asthma diagnoses due to climate-driven changes in particulate air pollution.Individuals with low income or with no high school diploma are 25 percent more likely to live in areas with the highest projected loss of labor due to climate change.American Indians and Alaskan Natives are 48 percent more likely to live in areas where the highest percentage of land is projected to be inundated due to sea level rise.Innovation is essential to building the resilience vulnerable communities need against the harmful impacts of climate change. To advance the mission of building climate equity for all people, the Verizon Climate Resilience Prize, now in its second year, will use the company's resources and networks to identify and scale next-gen climate-equity-based solutions that leverage technological innovations, like 5G technology, and have demonstrated results in real-world application.In partnership with GreenBiz Group, next year's Verizon Climate Resilience Prize will divide an award pool of $500k among four winners, in addition to post-prize developmental support. Last year's winners included Hyfi, a startup based in Michigan providing high-resolution water level data to help stormwater managers, first responders, and the public respond to floods in real time, The Forestry and Fire Recruitment Program (FFRP), a nonprofit organization recruiting and employing formerly incarcerated individuals in forestry work that prevents wildfires, and Coral Vita, an organization dedicated to growing diverse and resilient corals on land and planting them in degraded underwater reefs. All three winners leveraged their awards and support to scale their businesses and further innovate their operations for the betterment of under-resourced communities.Story continuesThe Verizon Climate Resilience Prize is a part of Citizen Verizon, the company's responsible business plan for economic, environmental, and social advancement. In addition to helping vulnerable populations deal with the effects of climate change, Verizon's own sustainability goals are to source and generate renewable energy equivalent to 50 percent of its annual electricity consumption by 2025 and achieve net zero emissions in its operations by 2035.Interested applicants can learn more about the climate prize at: https://www.verizon.com/about/responsibility/verizon-climate-resilience-prizeView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Verizon on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: VerizonWebsite: http://www.verizon.com/responsibilityEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: VerizonView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/722708/Climate-Change-Solutions-Should-Prioritize-Our-Nations-Most-Vulnerable]"

For more companies, head on over to 5 Biggest Data Science Companies In USA. Big data analytics, also known as data science, is one of the hottest fields in information technology. This is due to the fact that it is nearly ubiquitous across industries, and the growth and popularity of the Internet has led to vast sums of data being generated daily for advertisers to capitalize on.Estimates show that the amount of data that is generated globally will grow to unbelievable amounts. Research firm IDC believes that global data will grow at a stunning compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 61% between 2018 and 2025, to 175 zettabytes by 2025. For the uninitiated, a gigabyte of information contains 1024 megabytes, and a zettabyte has roughly 1,100 trillion megabytes - much larger than your daily Internet usage we'd assume. To better understand the significance of IDC's estimates, if all this data was written onto blu-ray disks, then these disks could be stacked to the Moon 23 times over.This growth has also spurred a strong interest in the field itself, with the Department of Labor estimating that the data science sector is expected to grow by 26% through 2026. Naturally, this growth will also boost salaries in the field, and the average salary for the field sits at $111,000 in the U.S. right now. Finally, looking at the sector as a whole, Markets and Markets estimates that the data science platform market was worth $95 billion last year, and between then and 2026, it will grow at a CAGR of 27.7% to be worth $322.9 billion. It further outlines that the growth in the business and finance sectors will lead the way for the industry.Therefore, it's fairly accurate to say that the data science sector has a great future ahead of it, and in today's piece we have narrowed down the top data science companies.

HCCI, Cadence Design Systems, Inc. CDNS, McKesson Corp. MCK and Schlumberger Ltd. SLB.Pick These 4 Stocks with Excellent Interest Coverage RatiosWe often judge a company on the basis of its sales and earnings. These, however, may not be enough. Sometimes, a stock gets a boost if these numbers climb year over year or surpass estimates in a particular quarter, thus offering a great opportunity for an investor with a shorter horizon to cash in on. But if you seek long-term returns, investments backed only by sales and earnings numbers may not yield the desired results.A critical analysis of a company's financial background is a prerequisite for an informed investment decision. Here, coverage ratios that determine whether a company is sound enough to meet its financial obligations play a crucial role. The higher the ratio, the better. The focus of this article is on ""Interest Coverage,"" which is one such ratio.Interest Coverage Ratio = Earnings before Interest &amp; Taxes (EBIT) divided by Interest Expense.Why Interest Coverage Ratio?The interest coverage ratio is used to determine how effectively a company can pay the interest charges on its debt.Debt, which is crucial for most of the companies to finance operations, comes at a cost called interest. Interest expense has a direct bearing on the profitability of a company and its creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets interest obligations. Therefore, Interest Coverage Ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision.The interest coverage ratio suggests the number of times the interest could be paid from earnings and gauges the margin of safety a firm carries for paying interest.An interest coverage ratio lower than 1.0 implies that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations and could default on repaying debt. A company that is capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardships. Definitely, one should also track the company's past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over a period of time.Story continuesHeritage-Crystal Clean, Inc., Cadence Design Systems, Inc., McKesson Corp. and Schlumberger Ltd.  boast impressive interest coverage ratios.Apart from having an Interest Coverage Ratio that is more than the industry average, adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a VGM Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to better results.Here are four of the nine stocks that qualified the screening:Heritage-Crystal Clean, a leading provider of parts cleaning, used oil re-refining, hazardous and non-hazardous waste disposal, emergency and spill response, and industrial and field services, carries a Zacks Rank of #2.

349,9d65610e-1a32-39f8-8de1-bb9b3fa3ea17,MCK,2022-10-28,AmerisourceBergen (ABC) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amerisourcebergen-abc-earnings-expected-grow-140202307.html,1666879322,STORY,"['ABC', 'MCK']","[Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when AmerisourceBergen (ABC) reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 3, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis prescription drug distributor is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.58 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +8%.Revenues are expected to be $60.51 billion, up 2.7% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for AmerisourceBergen?For AmerisourceBergen, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.25%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that AmerisourceBergen will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that AmerisourceBergen would post earnings of $2.57 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.62, delivering a surprise of +1.95%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.AmerisourceBergen doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAmong the stocks in the Zacks Medical - Dental Supplies industry, McKesson (MCK) is soon expected to post earnings of $6.13 per share for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -0.3%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $69.66 billion, up 4.6% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for McKesson has been revised 1.5% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a higher Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0.27%.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), suggests that McKesson will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to see more of the best insurance dividend stocks, go directly to 5 Best Insurance Dividend Stocks To Buy Now.Interest rates have risen substantially in 2022. To fight inflation, the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates five times this year alone, with the last three raises at a pretty steep 0.75 percentage points each. As a result, the federal funds rate is now 3% to 3.25%, which is substantially higher than what it was at the beginning of the year. The interest rate hikes might not be over as many expect the federal funds rate to be between 4% and 4.5% by the end of the year.Like they have in many other sectors, the rising interest rates have affected the insurance industry.According to the Office of Financial Research,Modestly rising interest rates are generally positive for the insurance industry. When rates rise at a reasonable pace, portfolio yields also rise. With these new, higher-yielding corporate and other bond purchases, insurers’ investment earnings also increase. Life insurers, in particular, benefit from a rising interest rate environment as they’re likely to earn improved spreads over the cost of funding liabilities.As a result of the higher rates, some insurance companies have an easier time earning profits and shares of those companies have outperformed the market this year.If inflation becomes too much of a problem, however, many insurers could also face headwinds, especially P&amp;C insurers. The Office of Financial Research added,Adding inflation to the mix, however, affects insurers differently. For example, while property and casualty (P&amp;C) insurers also benefit from increased bond portfolio yields, higher-than-expected claim costs for home, automobile, and other insurance lines may impair earnings.Similarly, if interest rates rise too much, the U.S. economy could enter into a deeper than expected recession and demand for insurance products could decrease.Story continuesGiven the uncertainty in the markets today, it can be a good idea for investors to have a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.In terms of the insurance sector, here are 11 stocks with dividends to consider,Dividend Money, High DividendsCopyright: mozakim / 123RF Stock PhotoMethodologyFor the list of 11 Best Insurance Dividend Stocks To Buy Now, we took many of the largest insurance companies by market cap that are listed on the NYSE or NASDAQ and that also paid dividends.

355,0ff015b9-34c0-30df-94e3-2413cee278dd,APD,2022-10-28,Air Products and Chemicals (APD) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/air-products-chemicals-apd-earnings-140202666.html,1666879322,STORY,"['APD', 'ALB']","[Air Products and Chemicals (APD) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 3. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis seller of gases for industrial, medical and other uses is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.77 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +10.4%.Revenues are expected to be $3.28 billion, up 15.4% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.72% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Air Products and Chemicals?For Air Products and Chemicals, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.57%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Air Products and Chemicals will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Air Products and Chemicals would post earnings of $2.61 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.62, delivering a surprise of +0.38%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Air Products and Chemicals doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAlbemarle (ALB), another stock in the Zacks Chemical - Diversified industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $6.84 for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of +551.4%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $2.12 billion, up 155% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Albemarle has been revised 0.4% up to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 3.64%, reflecting a higher Most Accurate Estimate.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), this Earnings ESP indicates that Albemarle will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Robinson Worldwide's (NASDAQ:CHRW) three-year earnings growth trails the decent shareholder returns,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/c-h-robinson-worldwides-nasdaq-122044565.html,1666873244,STORY,['CHRW'],"[It hasn't been the best quarter for C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. (NASDAQ:CHRW) shareholders, since the share price has fallen 11% in that time. On the other hand the share price is higher than it was three years ago. Arguably you'd have been better off buying an index fund, because the gain of 25% in three years isn't amazing.The past week has proven to be lucrative for C.H. Robinson Worldwide investors, so let's see if fundamentals drove the company's three-year performance. Check out our latest analysis for C.H. Robinson Worldwide To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During three years of share price growth, C.H. Robinson Worldwide achieved compound earnings per share growth of 21% per year. The average annual share price increase of 8% is actually lower than the EPS growth. So it seems investors have become more cautious about the company, over time. We'd venture the lowish P/E ratio of 10.91 also reflects the negative sentiment around the stock.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that C.H. Robinson Worldwide has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? If you're interested, you could check this free report showing consensus revenue forecasts.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, C.H. Robinson Worldwide's TSR for the last 3 years was 34%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that C.H. Robinson Worldwide shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 0.9% over the last year. Of course, that includes the dividend. However, the TSR over five years, coming in at 6% per year, is even more impressive. Potential buyers might understandably feel they've missed the opportunity, but it's always possible business is still firing on all cylinders. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Take risks, for example - C.H. Robinson Worldwide has   5 warning signs  (and 3 which shouldn't be ignored)  we think you should know about.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of companies that have proven they can grow earnings.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on US exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

359,abcbbaba-2427-3845-acca-d57a3c9f902a,CMI,2022-10-28,Are You Looking for a Top Momentum Pick? Why Cummins (CMI) is a Great Choice,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/looking-top-momentum-pick-why-160004942.html,1666886404,STORY,['CMI'],"[Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock's recent trend, which can be in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" And for investors following this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, this can be very tough to define. There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance. The Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.Below, we take a look at Cummins (CMI), which currently has a Momentum Style Score of A. We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score, like price change and earnings estimate revisions.It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Cummins currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;Set to Beat the Market?In order to see if CMI is a promising momentum pick, let's examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this engine maker holds up.A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area.Story continuesFor CMI, shares are up 6.18% over the past week while the Zacks Automotive - Internal Combustion Engines industry is up 6.58% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 14.16% compares favorably with the industry's 7.06% performance as well.Considering longer term price metrics, like performance over the last three months or year, can be advantageous as well. Over the past quarter, shares of Cummins have risen 8.82%, and are up 0.9% in the last year. In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 has only moved -1.88% and -14.85%, respectively.Investors should also take note of CMI's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. Right now, CMI is averaging 934,530 shares for the last 20 days.Earnings OutlookThe Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well. A nice path here can help show promise, and we have recently been seeing that with CMI.Over the past two months, 3 earnings estimates moved higher compared to 1 lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost CMI's consensus estimate, increasing from $17.26 to $17.37 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 4 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.Bottom LineGiven these factors, it shouldn't be surprising that CMI is a #2 (Buy) stock and boasts a Momentum Score of A. If you're looking for a fresh pick that's set to soar in the near-term, make sure to keep Cummins on your short list.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

361,5c1ba790-a215-3e7c-a139-13c4e4dfedeb,CMI,2022-10-28,Cummins (CMI) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cummins-cmi-reports-next-week-140202130.html,1666879322,STORY,['CMI'],"[The market expects Cummins (CMI) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 3, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis engine maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $4.87 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +34.9%.Revenues are expected to be $6.96 billion, up 16.6% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.3% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Cummins?For Cummins, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.16%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Cummins will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Cummins would post earnings of $4.37 per share when it actually produced earnings of $4.77, delivering a surprise of +9.15%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Cummins doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

It had cash and cash equivalents of $21.5 billion as of Sep 30, 2022, compared with $20.5 billion on Dec 31, 2021. The automotive long-term debt increased to $19,073 million from $17,200 million as of the end of 2021. Riding on its financial strength, Ford announced a dividend of 15 cents per share. The dividend is payable on Dec 1 to shareholders of record at the close of business on Nov 15.

Though X Games had gained popularity and seen growth ever since its launch, the millennials and Gen Z aren’t looking forward to watching skateboarding and snowboarding competitions on broadcast TV.The E-Games or Online gaming platforms have been a threat to such sports as it is gaining more traction among the youth, especially after the Covid outbreak, during which all forms of offline sports, including X Games, had been called off.ESPN is now focusing on streaming more popular live sports like hockey, soccer and baseball, which is expected to drive growth in the long haul. The renewal of the Major League Baseball sports rights deal through 2028 and the agreement with Spanish club football’s first division, La Liga, strengthens its sports content offerings.ESPN’s long-term partnership with the National Football League (“NFL”) is also noteworthy, where it has agreed on a five-year rights deal with the NFL to broadcast the league’s Monday night Wild Card playoff game through the 2025 season.ESPN has also recently entered into a partnership with the sports betting firm, DraftKings DKNG. DraftKings has been one of the leaders in the wagering business in the United States and this potential deal will allow the sports broadcaster to capitalize on the growing wave of legalized sports betting.In August, the Premier Hockey Federation (“PHF”) announced ESPN to be the exclusive home of the PHF in the United States for the 2022-23 and 2023-24 seasons.

Together, the two natural gas providers serve more than 1 million customers, and the majority receive their electricity service from ComEd.This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20221027005985/en/ComEd’s Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) is a combination of smart meters, communications networks, and data management systems. It has played a key role in ComEd’s ability to deliver record-level reliability, fewer outages and improved customer satisfaction while keeping bills flat.Up to now, Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas have read their customers’ meters by driving a vehicle down every street and transmitting data from each meter via radio signal. AMI will remove that fleet of vehicles from the street, eliminating more than 580,000 driving miles per year and 626 tons of carbon emissions per year. In addition to helping the environment, the cost savings from the reduced driving and other efficiencies will more than offset the cost of AMI. Operational savings for Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas — and in turn, their customers — will total an estimated $5.5 million per year.Connecting to ComEd’s AMI network also will enable Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas customers to view analytics that detail their energy usage and help them control costs.

This Halloween, ComEd encourages customers to put a stake in energy vampires by taking a few, simple steps that can save both money and energy.Vampire energy, also known as standby energy, is the electricity drawn from outlets when equipment is turned off but still plugged in. Some electronics, including cell phones, computers, printers and game consoles, continue to draw electricity when they are plugged in and turned off; in fact, according to the U.S. Department of Energy, vampire energy can account for up to 10 percent of a home’s energy use.""Starting this Halloween, stop letting appliances with clocks and timers be a drain on your electric bill,"" said Melissa Washington, ComEd's chief customer officer and senior vice president of customer operations. ""These devices masquerade as energy vampires that can trick you into using more electricity. This year, bite-back against energy vampires by treating yourself to these simple, energy-saving tips.""Use a power strip with an on/off switch to completely power down electronics at home.Unplug chargers to mobile phones, e-readers and other electronics once these devices are fully charged.When planning to be away from home for an extended amount of time, unplug all non-essential devices such as televisions and other electronics.Look for the ENERGY STAR® label on home appliances, electronics and other products.

On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis energy company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.73 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -33%.Revenues are expected to be $5.01 billion, down 43.8% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.71% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Exelon?For Exelon, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Exelon will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Exelon would post earnings of $0.46 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.44, delivering a surprise of -4.35%.The company has not been able to beat consensus EPS estimates in any of the last four quarters.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release.

Our focus on science-led, core and premium innovation is providing value at all price points, which is particularly important in today’s difficult macroeconomic environment. Our investments in building and scaling our digital and other capabilities across the enterprise are also paying off with our revenue growth management initiatives helping to drive double-digit pricing worldwide.""As expected, significant increases in raw and packaging material and logistics costs continued during the quarter and the negative impact from currency accelerated. Beyond revenue growth management and the significant pricing actions we are taking, we are also continuing our efforts around funding-the-growth and other productivity initiatives to help offset these headwinds.""Looking ahead, despite the challenging macroeconomic environment, we intend to continue to execute against our strategy in order to drive value for all stakeholders.""Full Year 2022 GuidanceBased on current spot rates:The Company now expects net sales growth to be in the middle of the 1% to 4% range, including an approximately 5% negative impact from foreign exchange and a modest benefit from the Red Collar acquisition.The Company raised its organic sales growth guidance for the year from 5% to 7% to 6% to 7%.On a GAAP basis, the Company still expects a decline in gross profit margin and double-digit earnings-per-share growth, and now expects advertising investment to be roughly flat.On a non-GAAP (Base Business) basis, the Company still expects a decline in gross profit margin and now expects roughly flat advertising investment and a 7% to 8% earnings-per-share decline reflecting the incremental negative impact from foreign exchange due to the move in exchange rates since our second quarter earnings release.Divisional PerformanceThe following are comments about divisional performance for third quarter 2022 versus the year ago period.

CL-EMarket Share InformationManagement uses market share information as a key indicator to monitor business health and performance. References to market share in this press release are based on a combination of consumption and market share data provided by third-party vendors, primarily Nielsen, and internal estimates. All market share references represent the percentage of the dollar value of sales of our products, relative to all product sales in the category in the countries in which the Company competes and purchases data (excluding Venezuela from all periods).Market share data is subject to limitations on the availability of up-to-date information. In particular, market share data is currently not generally available for certain retail channels, such as eCommerce and certain club retailers and discounters. The Company measures year-to-date market shares from January 1 of the relevant year through the most recent period for which market share data is available, which typically reflects a lag time of one or two months. The Company believes that the third-party vendors it uses to provide data are reliable, but it has not verified the accuracy or completeness of the data or any assumptions underlying the data. In addition, market share information reported by the Company may be different from market share information reported by other companies due to differences in category definitions, the use of data from different countries, internal estimates and other factors.Cautionary Statement on Forward-Looking StatementsThis press release and the related webcast may contain forward-looking statements (as that term is defined in the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 or by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in its rules, regulations and releases) that set forth anticipated results based on management’s current plans and assumptions. Such statements may relate, for example, to sales or volume growth, net selling price increases, organic sales growth, profit or profit margin levels, earnings per share levels, financial goals, the impact of foreign exchange, the impact of COVID-19, the impact of the war in Ukraine, cost-reduction plans, including the 2022 Global Productivity Initiative, tax rates, interest rates, new product introductions and digital capabilities, commercial investment levels, acquisitions, divestitures, share repurchases, or legal or tax proceedings, among other matters. These statements are made on the basis of the Company’s views and assumptions as of this time and the Company undertakes no obligation to update these statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law or by the rules and regulations of the SEC. Moreover, the Company does not, nor does any other person, assume responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of these statements. The Company cautions investors that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and that actual events or results may differ materially from those statements. For more information about factors that could impact the Company’s business and cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements, investors should refer to the Company’s filings with the SEC (including, but not limited to, the information set forth under the captions ""Risk Factors"" and ""Cautionary Statement on Forward-Looking Statements"" in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 and subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q). Copies of these filings may be obtained upon request from the Company’s Investor Relations Department or on the Company’s website at www.colgatepalmolive.com.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresThe following provides definitions and other information regarding the non-GAAP financial measures used in this press release and the related prepared materials and webcast, which may not be the same as or comparable to similar measures presented by other companies:Base Business: Base Business refers to non-GAAP measures of operating results that exclude certain items. Base Business operating results exclude, as applicable, charges relating to the 2022 Global Productivity Initiative, a gain on the sale of land in Asia Pacific, acquisition-related costs, a loss on the early extinguishment of debt and a benefit related to a value-added tax matter in Brazil.Organic sales growth: Net sales growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestments.Free cash flow before dividends: Net cash provided by operations less Capital expenditures.This press release discusses Net sales growth (GAAP) and Organic sales growth (non-GAAP). Management believes the organic sales growth measure provides investors and analysts with useful supplemental information regarding the Company’s underlying sales trends by presenting sales growth excluding the external factor of foreign exchange as well as the impact from acquisitions and divestments. See ""Geographic Sales Analysis Percentage Changes"" for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 versus 2021 included with this release for a comparison of Organic sales growth to Net sales growth in accordance with GAAP.Selling, general and administrative expenses, Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of Net sales, Other (income) expense, net, Operating profit, Operating profit margin, Non-service related postretirement costs, Effective income tax rate, Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company and Diluted earnings per common share are disclosed on both an as reported (GAAP) and Base Business (non-GAAP) basis. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude items that, either by their nature or amount, management would not expect to occur as part of the Company’s normal business on a regular basis, such as restructuring charges, charges for certain litigation and tax matters, gains and losses from certain acquisitions, divestitures and certain other unusual, non-recurring items. Investors and analysts use these financial measures in assessing the Company’s business performance, and management believes that presenting these financial measures on a non-GAAP basis provides them with useful supplemental information to enhance their understanding of the Company’s underlying business performance and trends. These non-GAAP financial measures also enhance the ability to compare period-to-period financial results. See ""Non-GAAP Reconciliations"" for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 included with this release for a reconciliation of these financial measures to the related GAAP measures.The Company uses these financial measures internally in its budgeting process, to evaluate segment and overall operating performance and as factors in determining compensation. While the Company believes that these financial measures are useful in evaluating the Company’s underlying business performance and trends, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.As management uses free cash flow before dividends to evaluate the Company’s ability to satisfy current and future obligations, pay dividends, fund future business opportunities and repurchase stock, the Company believes that it provides useful information to investors. Free cash flow before dividends is not a measure of cash available for discretionary expenditures since the Company has certain non-discretionary obligations such as debt service that are not deducted from the measure. See ""Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows"" for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 for a comparison of free cash flow before dividends to Net cash provided by operations as reported in accordance with GAAP.(See attached tables for third quarter results.)Table 1Colgate-Palmolive CompanyCondensed Consolidated Statements of IncomeFor the Three Months Ended September 30, 2022 and 2021(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) (Unaudited)20222021Net sales$4,455$4,414Cost of sales1,9071,791Gross profit2,5482,623Gross profit margin57.2%59.4%Selling, general and administrative expenses1,6341,636Other (income) expense, net(33)20Operating profit947967Operating profit margin21.3%21.9%Non-service related postretirement costs1516Interest (income) expense, net4098Income before income taxes892853Provision for income taxes210172Effective tax rate23.5%20.2%Net income including noncontrolling interests682681Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests6447Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company$618$634Earnings per common shareBasic$0.74$0.75Diluted$0.74$0.75Supplemental Income Statement InformationAverage common shares outstandingBasic835.7843.6Diluted838.5846.4Advertising$486$503Table 2Colgate-Palmolive CompanyCondensed Consolidated Statements of IncomeFor the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022 and 2021(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) (Unaudited)20222021Net sales$13,338$13,018Cost of sales5,6645,202Gross profit7,6747,816Gross profit margin57.5%60.0%Selling, general and administrative expenses4,9324,809Other (income) expense, net5140Operating profit2,6912,967Operating profit margin20.2%22.8%Non-service related postretirement costs6552Interest (income) expense, net98152Income before income taxes2,5282,763Provision for income taxes604613Effective tax rate23.9%22.2%Net income including noncontrolling interests1,9242,150Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests144132Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company$1,780$2,018Earnings per common shareBasic(1)$2.12$2.39Diluted(1)$2.12$2.38Supplemental Income Statement InformationAverage common shares outstandingBasic837.7845.9Diluted840.4849.0Advertising$1,493$1,532Note:(1) Basic and diluted earnings per share are computed independently for each quarter and any year-to-date period presented.

IDCC.Industry: WirelessLink:https://www.zacks.com/commentary/1997312/3-wireless-stocks-set-to-ride-on-fiber-densification-5g-rolloutThe Zacks Wireless Equipment industry appears well poised to gain from healthy demand trends amid fading supply chain adversities with the gradual revival in post-pandemic market conditions and a faster pace of 5G deployment. However, large-scale investments to support the transition to 5G and inflated raw material costs amid a challenging macroeconomic environment are likely to erode margins.Nevertheless, Juniper Networks, Inc., Viasat, Inc. and InterDigital, Inc. are likely to benefit in the long run from the increasing demand for state-of-the-art wireless products with a vast proliferation of IoT and a gradual shift to cloud services.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Wireless Equipment industry primarily comprises companies that provide various networking solutions, wireless telecom products and related services for wireless voice and data communications through scalable modular platforms. Their product portfolio encompasses integrated circuit devices (chips) and system software for wireless voice and data communications, analog and digital two-way radio, satellite telecommunications, wireless networking and signal processing, and end-to-end enterprise mobility solutions.The firms also provide a broad range of routing, switching and security products, video surveillance and machine-to-machine communication components that secure VPN appliances, enable intrusion detection and thwart data theft. Some firms even provide electronic warfare, avionics, robotics, advanced communications and maritime systems to the defense industry.What's Shaping the Future of the Wireless Equipment Industry?Fiber Optic Densification &amp; Faster 5G Rollout: With the exponential growth of mobile broadband traffic and home Internet solutions, demand for advanced networking architecture has increased manifold. This has forced service providers to spend more on routers and switches to upgrade their networks and support the surge in home data traffic. To maintain superior performance standards, there is a continuous need for network tuning and optimization, which creates demand for state-of-the-art wireless products and services.Story continuesMoreover, a faster pace of 5G deployment is expected to augment the scalability, security and universal mobility of the telecommunications industry and propel the wide proliferation of IoT. Expansion of fiber optic networks by carriers to support their 4G LTE and 5G wireless standards, as well as wireline connections, are likely to act as tailwinds.The fiber-optic cable network is vital for backhaul and the last mile local loop, which are required by wireless service providers for 5G deployment. Fiber networks are also essential for the growing deployment of small cells that bring the network closer to the user and supplement macro networks to provide extensive coverage.The industry participants are facilitating its customers to move away from an economy-of-scale network operating model to demand-driven operations and seamlessly migrate to 5G by offering easy programmability and flexible automation through steady infrastructure investments.Eroding Profitability: Although higher infrastructure investments will eventually help minimize service delivery costs to support broadband competition and wireless densification, short-term profitability has largely been compromised. Margins are likely to be affected by the high cost of first-generation 5G products, profitability challenges in China, the Russian invasion of Ukraine and pricing pressure in early 5G deals.Uncertainty regarding chip shortage and supply-chain disruptions leading to a dearth of essential fiber materials, shipping delays, and shortages of other raw materials are likely to affect the expansion and rollout of new broadband networks. Extended lead times for basic components are also likely to affect the delivery schedule and escalate production costs.High technological obsolescence of most products has also escalated operating costs with steady investments in R&amp;D. However, with various administrative and federal support along with the ramp-up in production facilities for chip manufacturing, the demand-supply imbalance is likely to ease gradually in the upcoming quarters.Wide Proliferation of Cloud Networking Solutions: The majority of the industry participants offer mission-critical communication infrastructure, devices, accessories, software and services that enable its customers to run businesses with increased efficiency and safety for their mobile workforce. These systems drive demand for additional device sales, software upgrades, infrastructure overhaul and expansion, as well as additional services to maintain, monitor and manage these complex networks and solutions.The comprehensive suite of services ensures continuity and reduces risks for constant critical communication operations. The wide proliferation of cloud networking solutions is further resulting in increased storage and computing on a virtual plane. As both consumers and enterprises use the network, there is tremendous demand for quality networking equipment.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bullish ProspectsThe Zacks Wireless Equipment industry is housed within the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector.

If you want to see more of the best insurance dividend stocks, go directly to 5 Best Insurance Dividend Stocks To Buy Now.Interest rates have risen substantially in 2022. To fight inflation, the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates five times this year alone, with the last three raises at a pretty steep 0.75 percentage points each. As a result, the federal funds rate is now 3% to 3.25%, which is substantially higher than what it was at the beginning of the year. The interest rate hikes might not be over as many expect the federal funds rate to be between 4% and 4.5% by the end of the year.Like they have in many other sectors, the rising interest rates have affected the insurance industry.According to the Office of Financial Research,Modestly rising interest rates are generally positive for the insurance industry. When rates rise at a reasonable pace, portfolio yields also rise. With these new, higher-yielding corporate and other bond purchases, insurers’ investment earnings also increase. Life insurers, in particular, benefit from a rising interest rate environment as they’re likely to earn improved spreads over the cost of funding liabilities.As a result of the higher rates, some insurance companies have an easier time earning profits and shares of those companies have outperformed the market this year.If inflation becomes too much of a problem, however, many insurers could also face headwinds, especially P&amp;C insurers. The Office of Financial Research added,Adding inflation to the mix, however, affects insurers differently. For example, while property and casualty (P&amp;C) insurers also benefit from increased bond portfolio yields, higher-than-expected claim costs for home, automobile, and other insurance lines may impair earnings.Similarly, if interest rates rise too much, the U.S. economy could enter into a deeper than expected recession and demand for insurance products could decrease.Story continuesGiven the uncertainty in the markets today, it can be a good idea for investors to have a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.In terms of the insurance sector, here are 11 stocks with dividends to consider,Dividend Money, High DividendsCopyright: mozakim / 123RF Stock PhotoMethodologyFor the list of 11 Best Insurance Dividend Stocks To Buy Now, we took many of the largest insurance companies by market cap that are listed on the NYSE or NASDAQ and that also paid dividends.

Many oil and gas businesses seek to reinvent themselves as 2023 approaches by focusing on financial health, adopting capital discipline, addressing climate change, and transforming business models. Some of the best energy companies to invest in include Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN), Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY), and Chesapeake Energy Corporation (NYSE:CHK).10 Best Crude Oil Stocks To Buy TodayPhoto by Viktor Kharlashkin on UnsplashOur MethodologyWe analyzed the crude oil stocks that recently received positive analyst ratings, and have strong financial statements and business growth potential.

On October 19, Jefferies analyst Lloyd Byrne initiated coverage of Hess Corporation (NYSE:HES) with a Hold rating and a $140 price target.The rise in energy prices this year has given most oil and gas equities a boost, including Hess Corporation (NYSE:HES), whose shares are currently trading more than 80% higher year to date. Hess Corporation (NYSE:HES) is one of the greatest bets in the oil and gas sector, given the high rate of inflation and the fact that the energy sector is the final resort for investors looking to safeguard their portfolios.

Harris Associates is the leading position holder in the company, with 16.7 million shares worth about $582 million.Here is what Oakmark Select Fund has to say about APA Corporation (NASDAQ:APA) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“Our oil holding, APA Corporation (NASDAQ:APA) (+54%) was one of our top contributors in the quarter as oil prices rallied due to tight supplies, which were then exacerbated by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Although their share prices have increased considerably, both companies still look quite undervalued even using longer term oil prices in the $65-70 dollar range. Meanwhile, if times are good over the next couple of years, we expect these companies to return significant percentages of their market caps to shareholders.”07. Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders as of Q2, 2022: 39Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) is a London-based energy and petrochemical company operating in Europe, Asia, Oceania, Africa, the United States, and the rest of the Americas. The company operates through Integrated Gas, Upstream, Marketing, Chemicals and Products, and Renewables and Energy Solutions segments.

The stock's dividend yield on October 20 came in at 2.86%.Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) is also one of the largest oil companies in the world, as it produces 3.5 million barrels of oil per day and has an equally impressive portfolio of 46,000 gas stations. It also used the recent oil price increases to decrease its debt by 45%. According to experts, Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) balance sheet is strong and its debt load is reasonable. JPMorgan analyst Christian Malek on October 13 reiterated an Overweight rating on Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) but lowered the price target on the shares to 2,900 GBp from 3,000 GBp.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 39 hedge funds were long Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) at the end of the second quarter of 2022, compared to 37 funds in the prior quarter. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management held the leading stake in the company, consisting of 20.25 million shares worth over $1 billion.Here’s what Third Point Management said about Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“We have continued to add to our position in Shell, as it trades at the same deeply discounted multiple today that it did last year due to a move up in commodity prices. We are engaged in discussions with management, board members, and other shareholders, as well as informal talks with financial advisors. We have discussed various alternatives with the aim of both increasing shareholder value and allowing Shell to effectively manage the energy transition. We have reiterated our view that Shell’s portfolio of disparate businesses ranging from deep water oil to wind farms to gas stations to chemical plants is confusing and unmanageable. Most investors we have discussed this with agree that the company would be more successful over the long term with a different corporate structure. Discussions among the parties have been constructive and will be ongoing since stakeholders clearly see these corporate changes as instrumental, particularly if Shell wishes to become a leader in the energy transition rather than be left behind as a tarnished legacy brand.Beyond our discussions around corporate structure, there have been two important developments since our last update. First, Shell announced a plan to redomicile its headquarters to the UK and create a single shareholder class. This move allows greater flexibility to modify its portfolio (either through asset sales or spin-offs) and allows for a more efficient return of capital, specifically via share repurchases. Second, fundamental and geopolitical events have highlighted the strategic importance of reliable energy supplies, especially in Europe. Shell’s LNG business, the largest in the world outside of Qatar, will play a critical role in ensuring energy security for Europe. In our view, the value of this business has increased dramatically since our original investment.While Shell continues to trade at a large discount to its intrinsic value, with proper management we believe the company can simultaneously deliver shareholder returns, reliable energy and decarbonization of the global economy. We look forward to continued engagement with management and other shareholders and to more strategic clarity from the Company.”06. Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE:MRO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders as of Q2, 2022: 41Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE:MRO) is an oil and gas exploration company that engages in the production of crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids.

An underweight to communication services and an overweight to energy helped performance, while an underweight to consumer staples and an overweight to materials detracted. Stock selection was strong within healthcare and materials but was weak within information technology and industrials. Marathon Oil (NYSE:MRO) increased its quarterly dividend and executed an impressive share buyback that blew by the target it originally announced.” Click to continue reading and see the  5 Best Crude Oil Stocks To Buy Today.Suggested articles:10 Best Industrial Dividend Stocks To BuyTop 10 Healthcare Stocks To Buy10 Best Fundamental Penny Stocks To Invest InDisclosure.

However, total losses seen by insiders are still US$129k but in since the time of purchase.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. View our latest analysis for Oracle Oracle Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider purchase was by Independent Director Charles Moorman for US$1.3m worth of shares, at about US$84.57 per share. That means that even when the share price was higher than US$75.15 (the recent price), an insider wanted to purchase shares. Their view may have changed since then, but at least it shows they felt optimistic at the time. To us, it's very important to consider the price insiders pay for shares. It is encouraging to see an insider paid above the current price for shares, as it suggests they saw value, even at higher levels. Charles Moorman was the only individual insider to buy during the last year.You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeThere are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares. You probably do not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Does Oracle Boast High Insider Ownership?For a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. It's great to see that Oracle insiders own 43% of the company, worth about US$87b. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About Oracle Insiders?The fact that there have been no Oracle insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. But insiders have shown more of an appetite for the stock, over the last year. Judging from their transactions, and high insider ownership, Oracle insiders feel good about the company's future. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. Our analysis shows 4 warning signs for Oracle (2 are concerning!) and we strongly recommend you look at these before investing.Of course Oracle may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free collection of high quality companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

For more companies, head on over to 5 Biggest Data Science Companies In USA. Big data analytics, also known as data science, is one of the hottest fields in information technology. This is due to the fact that it is nearly ubiquitous across industries, and the growth and popularity of the Internet has led to vast sums of data being generated daily for advertisers to capitalize on.Estimates show that the amount of data that is generated globally will grow to unbelievable amounts. Research firm IDC believes that global data will grow at a stunning compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 61% between 2018 and 2025, to 175 zettabytes by 2025. For the uninitiated, a gigabyte of information contains 1024 megabytes, and a zettabyte has roughly 1,100 trillion megabytes - much larger than your daily Internet usage we'd assume. To better understand the significance of IDC's estimates, if all this data was written onto blu-ray disks, then these disks could be stacked to the Moon 23 times over.This growth has also spurred a strong interest in the field itself, with the Department of Labor estimating that the data science sector is expected to grow by 26% through 2026. Naturally, this growth will also boost salaries in the field, and the average salary for the field sits at $111,000 in the U.S. right now. Finally, looking at the sector as a whole, Markets and Markets estimates that the data science platform market was worth $95 billion last year, and between then and 2026, it will grow at a CAGR of 27.7% to be worth $322.9 billion. It further outlines that the growth in the business and finance sectors will lead the way for the industry.Therefore, it's fairly accurate to say that the data science sector has a great future ahead of it, and in today's piece we have narrowed down the top data science companies.

Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU), which has not only revenues, but also profits. Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business. View our latest analysis for Micron Technology How Fast Is Micron Technology Growing?Generally, companies experiencing growth in earnings per share (EPS) should see similar trends in share price. So it makes sense that experienced investors pay close attention to company EPS when undertaking investment research. We can see that in the last three years Micron Technology grew its EPS by 13% per year. That's a good rate of growth, if it can be sustained.One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. The good news is that Micron Technology is growing revenues, and EBIT margins improved by 7.0 percentage points to 32%, over the last year. Both of which are great metrics to check off for potential growth.The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart.earnings-and-revenue-historyIn investing, as in life, the future matters more than the past. So why not check out this free interactive visualization of Micron Technology's forecast profits?Are Micron Technology Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?We would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$60b company like Micron Technology. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$188m. We note that this amounts to 0.3% of the company, which may be small owing to the sheer size of Micron Technology but it's still worth mentioning. This still shows shareholders there is a degree of alignment between management and themselves.Story continuesDoes Micron Technology Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?One important encouraging feature of Micron Technology is that it is growing profits. To add an extra spark to the fire, significant insider ownership in the company is another highlight. These two factors are a huge highlight for the company which should be a strong contender your watchlists. You should always think about risks though. Case in point, we've spotted   1 warning sign for Micron Technology  you should be aware of.Although Micron Technology certainly looks good, it may appeal to more investors if insiders were buying up shares.

403,1d339e07-b90c-3272-8a62-772d8d5c6471,MU,2022-10-28,10 Most Successful Penny Stocks That Made It Big,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-most-successful-penny-stocks-101721114.html,1666952241,STORY,"['F', 'QCOM', 'GME', 'MNST', 'MU', 'AMD', 'TSLA', 'AMZN']","[In this piece, we will take a look at the ten most successful penny stocks that made it big. If you want to skip our primer on penny stocks and need to jump ahead to the top five stocks in this list, then take a look at 5 Most Successful Penny Stocks That Made It Big. The world of investing is full of tricks and opportunities, and the massive success of a handful of firms on the stock market has made their founders and investors billionaires. The market is responsible for producing some of the richest individuals in history, such as the founder of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) Mr. Bill Gates, and the electric vehicle billionaire Mr. Elon Musk. At the same time, it has also caused others painful losses.These fantastic gains continue to draw large amounts of attention from retail investors in particular, and one segment that catches a lot of this interest is the penny stock sector. Defined as those stocks that trade at less than $5 per share by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), droves of investors flock to these stocks as the low share price presents an attractive entry point and even small gains can result in large profits.When evaluating a penny stock, some metrics take precedence over others. Mostly these stocks either belong to firms will small market shares and revenues or those that are struggling. These factors require careful stock picking, and a look at the balance sheet and the cash flow statement can provide useful tools to sift out any potential problems. For example, through the Debt Ratio, which analyses a firm's total debt with its total assets, an investor can determine if a company is overly leveraged and has taken on too much debt. Too much debt not only ends up burdening the income statement in the form of interest payments, but it also affects payouts to shareholders in case a firm ceases to be a going concern since debt holders get the first priority for payments.Another ratio, which is especially useful for a penny stock, is the price to cash flow ratio. A firm's cash flow is the amount that is left for investors after its expenses are deducted, and when the share price is divided by the cash flow per share, an estimate of the 'market premium' for the share price can be determined. The usefulness of this metric lies in the fact that if a company has sound fundamentals, then it might see its share price jump in the future if there is little premium to it at the time of investment.Story continuesToday's piece focuses on some of the most successful penny stocks in history, and these firms have seen their share prices jump exponentially since they were first listed. Among these, the top performers are Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Tesla, Inc.

The president spoke at a Micron Technology Inc. site, where the company plans to invest $100 billion to bolster chip manufacturing, an investment Biden said was spurred by the measure.“Because of the new law I signed and Chuck designed and delivered, we’re turning things way around,” said Biden, who was joined by New York lawmakers and officials, including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer.Biden said Micron’s investment alone would “increase America’s share of global memory chips and production by 500%.”Read more: Micron Plans to Invest Up to $100 Billion in NY Chip Factory (1)The semiconductor subsidy bill is intended to make the US less dependent on Asian chipmaking giants. Yet the measure has spurred concerns abroad, including among American allies such as South Korea and Japan, about the impact on their companies.The US Commerce Department also unveiled sweeping regulations on Oct. 7, intending to curb the sale of advanced semiconductors and equipment to China and banning Americans from helping with the country’s development of chip technologies. The moves strike at the very foundation of China’s efforts to build its own cutting-edge chips.Story continuesChina’s embassy hit back against the recent US economic measures aimed at curbing Beijing’s access to advanced technology. Speaking in an online briefing on Thursday, before Biden’s remarks, senior Chinese diplomat Wang Hongxia criticized the new chip rules as an “abuse of export control measures,” and accused the Biden administration of a “politicized and weaponized” approach to normal economic and business cooperation.“These negative measures have brought huge losses to businesses and consumers in both countries,” said Wang, who is a counselor in the embassy’s office of economic and commercial affairs. “Once the Chinese market is lost, it will be hard to regain.”Read more: China Says Biden’s New Chip Technology Curbs Will Harm RecoveryOn Thursday, the top US official overseeing export controls said he expects a deal with global allies to limit shipments of chip-producing technology to China.“We expect to have a deal done in the near term,” Alan Estevez, under secretary of Commerce for industry and security, said at an event hosted by the Center for a New American Security.Tensions between the US and China have intensified in recent months, with the world’s two largest economies sparring over trade, human rights and Beijing’s aggressive moves against Taiwan.Xi in a letter to the National Committee on US-China Relations’ annual dinner Wednesday, though, said his nation is willing to work with the US to find ways to cooperate.The conciliatory tone comes before a potential face-to-face meeting with Biden at a Group of 20 summit next month in Indonesia. The planning for that encounter is ongoing, though, and a date has not been confirmed.Read more: US Expects Deal With Allies on China Chip Curbs in Near Term (1)Biden on Thursday said making chips in the US would lower costs for American consumers, as the administration seeks to counter perceptions it is not doing enough to combat soaring inflation. With the midterms less than two weeks away, polls show rising costs are voters’ top concern and Democrats are at risk of losing one or both chambers of Congress.“Making these chips in America is going to help lower the costs for families looking to buy a car, replace your washing machine, get a new cellphone,” he said.Micron, which first announced its investment earlier this month, has said the plans will generate about 50,000 jobs in the state, including 9,000 high-paying positions.Biden’s visit to New York is the latest he’s taken to celebrate the chips law.

This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 3. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis maker of precision instruments is expected to post quarterly earnings of $9.83 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +12.7%.Revenues are expected to be $974.94 million, up 2.4% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Mettler-Toledo?For Mettler-Toledo, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.08%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Mettler-Toledo will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Mettler-Toledo would post earnings of $8.73 per share when it actually produced earnings of $9.39, delivering a surprise of +7.56%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release.

(NYSE:FIS) as an investment opportunity by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Fidelity National Information Services What's The Estimated Valuation?We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$4.48bUS$4.98bUS$5.06bUS$5.40bUS$5.64bUS$5.85bUS$6.04bUS$6.22bUS$6.38bUS$6.53bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x10Analyst x11Analyst x2Analyst x1Est @ 4.56%Est @ 3.78%Est @ 3.24%Est @ 2.86%Est @ 2.6%Est @ 2.41% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.6% US$4.2kUS$4.3kUS$4.1kUS$4.0kUS$3.9kUS$3.8kUS$3.6kUS$3.5kUS$3.3kUS$3.2k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$38bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.6%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$6.5b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.6%– 2.0%) = US$120bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$120b÷ ( 1 + 7.6%)10= US$58bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$96b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$82.1, the company appears quite good value at a 48% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Fidelity National Information Services as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.6%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.191. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Looking Ahead:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

408,adc5845e-b43a-3186-935e-54747521d68c,FIS,2022-10-28,FirstCash Holdings (FCFS) Tops Q3 Earnings and Revenue Estimates,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/firstcash-holdings-fcfs-tops-q3-112511308.html,1666869911,STORY,"['FCFS', 'FIS']","[FirstCash Holdings (FCFS) came out with quarterly earnings of $1.30 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.19 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.84 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 9.24%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this pawn store would post earnings of $0.93 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.08, delivering a surprise of 16.13%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.FirstCash , which belongs to the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry, posted revenues of $672.14 million for the quarter ended September 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.27%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $399.67 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.FirstCash shares have added about 15.7% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -19.6%.What's Next for FirstCash?While FirstCash has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for FirstCash: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.50 on $730.49 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $4.87 on $2.72 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Financial Transaction Services is currently in the bottom 21% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Fidelity National Information Services (FIS), another stock in the same industry, has yet to report results for the quarter ended September 2022. The results are expected to be released on November 3.This banking and payment technologies company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.74 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +0.6%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.8% lower over the last 30 days to the current level.Fidelity National Information Services' revenues are expected to be $3.61 billion, up 2.9% from the year-ago quarter.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

409,232443e6-4f1b-35f3-b6d5-d954ad6e450a,YUM,2022-10-28,Analysts Estimate El Pollo Loco Holdings (LOCO) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-estimate-el-pollo-loco-140302447.html,1666879382,STORY,"['LOCO', 'YUM']","[The market expects El Pollo Loco Holdings (LOCO) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 3, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis Tex-Mex fast food chain is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.12 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -55.6%.Revenues are expected to be $116.55 million, up 0.7% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.33% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for El Pollo Loco?For El Pollo Loco, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +2.85%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that El Pollo Loco will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that El Pollo Loco would post earnings of $0.19 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.21, delivering a surprise of +10.53%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.El Pollo Loco doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAnother stock from the Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry, Yum Brands (YUM), is soon expected to post earnings of $1.14 per share for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -6.6%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $1.64 billion, up 2% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Yum has remained unchanged. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 0.10%, reflecting a higher Most Accurate Estimate.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggests that Yum will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

410,af86e4e9-7a2a-3441-a256-8cc6491d2b15,YUM,2022-10-28,Do Yum! Brands' (NYSE:YUM) Earnings Warrant Your Attention?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/yum-brands-nyse-yum-earnings-123055641.html,1666873855,STORY,['YUM'],"[For beginners, it can seem like a good idea (and an exciting prospect) to buy a company that tells a good story to investors, even if it currently lacks a track record of revenue and profit. But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like Yum! Brands (NYSE:YUM), which has not only revenues, but also profits. Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business. See our latest analysis for Yum! Brands How Fast Is Yum! Brands Growing?If a company can keep growing earnings per share (EPS) long enough, its share price should eventually follow. Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS. We can see that in the last three years Yum! Brands grew its EPS by 6.6% per year. That might not be particularly high growth, but it does show that per-share earnings are moving steadily in the right direction.Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. While Yum! Brands did well to grow revenue over the last year, EBIT margins were dampened at the same time. If EBIT margins are able to stay balanced and this revenue growth continues, then we should see brighter days ahead.The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.earnings-and-revenue-historyYou don't drive with your eyes on the rear-view mirror, so you might be more interested in this free report showing analyst forecasts for Yum! Brands' future profits.Story continuesAre Yum! Brands Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Owing to the size of Yum! Brands, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. To be specific, they have US$35m worth of shares. That shows significant buy-in, and may indicate conviction in the business strategy. Even though that's only about 0.1% of the company, it's enough money to indicate alignment between the leaders of the business and ordinary shareholders.Is Yum! Brands Worth Keeping An Eye On?As previously touched on, Yum! Brands is a growing business, which is encouraging. For those who are looking for a little more than this, the high level of insider ownership enhances our enthusiasm for this growth. These two factors are a huge highlight for the company which should be a strong contender your watchlists. It is worth noting though that we have found 3 warning signs for Yum! Brands (2 are concerning!) that you need to take into consideration.The beauty of investing is that you can invest in almost any company you want.

Net income per share attributable to Aon shareholders, adjusted for certain items, increased 16% to $2.02 on a diluted basis, including an unfavorable impact of $0.05 per share if prior year period results were translated at current period foreign exchange rates (""foreign currency translation""), compared to $1.74 in the prior year period. Certain items that impacted third quarter results and comparisons with the prior year period are detailed in the ""Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures - Operating Income and Diluted Earnings Per Share"" on page 10 of this press release.Story continues""In the third quarter, our team continued to deliver strong top and bottom-line results, highlighted by 5% organic revenue growth and 16% adjusted EPS growth, and contributing to strong year-to-date progress on our key financial metrics, including 7% organic revenue growth year-to-date, adjusted operating margin expansion of 80 basis points, and strong free cash flow growth,"" said Greg Case, Chief Executive Officer. ""These results demonstrate the importance of our Aon United strategy in helping clients navigate growing volatility and make better decisions that protect and grow their business.""THIRD QUARTER 2022 FINANCIAL SUMMARYTotal revenue in the third quarter was flat at $2.7 billion compared to the prior year period reflecting 5% organic revenue growth and a 1% favorable impact from fiduciary investment income, offset by a 5% unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation and a 1% unfavorable impact from acquisitions, divestitures, and other.Total operating expenses in the third quarter decreased 40% to $2.1 billion compared to the prior year period due primarily to the $1.0 billion payment made in connection with the termination of the proposed combination with Willis Towers Watson (the ""Termination Fee"") and certain transaction costs incurred related to the termination in the prior year period (together, the ""transaction costs"") and a $138 million favorable impact from foreign currency translation, partially offset by an increase in expense associated with 5% organic revenue growth and investments in long-term growth.Foreign currency translation in the third quarter had a $9 million, or $0.04 per share, favorable impact on net income and a $10 million, or $0.05 per share, unfavorable impact on adjusted net income. If currency were to remain stable at today's rates, the Company would expect an unfavorable impact of approximately $0.11 per share, or an approximately $33 million decrease in operating income, in the fourth quarter of 2022.Effective tax rate in the third quarter was 18.0%, compared to (2.6)% in the prior year period. The primary driver of the change was the impact of the $1 billion Termination Fee payment in the prior year period. After adjusting to exclude the applicable tax impact associated with certain non-GAAP adjustments, the adjusted effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2022 decreased to 19.1% compared to 23.9% in the prior year period. The primary drivers of the change in the adjusted tax rate were the geographical distribution of income and a net favorable impact from discrete items.Weighted average diluted shares outstanding decreased to 212.6 million in the third quarter compared to 225.4 million in the prior year period. The Company repurchased 4.2 million Class A Ordinary Shares for approximately $1.2 billion in the third quarter. As of September 30, 2022, the Company had approximately $6.7 billion of remaining authorization under its share repurchase program.YEAR TO DATE 2022 CASH FLOW SUMMARYCash flows provided by operations for the first nine months of 2022 increased $926 million, or 74%, to $2,177 million compared to the prior year period, primarily due to the transaction costs in the prior year period, and strong operating income growth, partially offset by higher receivables and incentive compensation payments following strong performance in 2021.Free cash flow, defined as cash flows from operations less capital expenditures, increased 79%, to $2,051 million for the first nine months of 2022 compared to the prior year period, reflecting an increase in cash flows from operations, partially offset by a $24 million increase in capital expenditures.THIRD QUARTER 2022 REVENUE REVIEWThe third quarter revenue reviews provided below include supplemental information related to organic revenue growth, which is a non-GAAP measure that is described in detail in ""Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures - Organic Revenue Growth and Free Cash Flow"" on page 9 of this press release.Three Months EndedSeptember 30,(millions)20222021% ChangeLess:CurrencyImpactLess:FiduciaryInvestmentIncomeLess:Acquisitions,Divestitures &amp; OtherOrganicRevenueGrowthRevenueCommercial Risk Solutions$ 1,482$ 1,505(2) %(5) %1 %(3) %5 %Reinsurance Solutions39635312(4)367Health Solutions494497(1)(4)—(2)5Wealth Solutions326351(7)(6)—(3)2Eliminations(2)(4)N/AN/AN/AN/AN/ATotal revenue$ 2,696$ 2,702— %(5) %1 %(1) %5 %Total revenue was flat at $2,696 million compared to the prior year period, with organic revenue growth of 5%, driven by ongoing strong retention and net new business generation.Commercial Risk Solutions organic revenue growth of 5% reflects strong growth across most major geographies driven by strong retention, new business generation, and management of the renewal book portfolio. Strength in retail brokerage was highlighted by double-digit growth in the UK, Asia, and Latin America, driven by continued strength in core P&amp;C. U.S. retail brokerage was pressured primarily by transaction solutions, which declined primarily due to lower external deal volume. On average globally, exposures and pricing were modestly positive, resulting in a modestly positive market impact.Reinsurance Solutions organic revenue growth of 7% reflects strong growth in treaty, driven by strong retention and new business generation, as well as solid growth in both facultative placements and the Strategy and Technology Group. Market impact was modestly positive on results in the quarter. The majority of revenue in our treaty portfolio is recurring in nature and is recorded in connection with the major renewal periods that take place throughout the first half of the year, while the second half of the year is largely driven by facultative placements and capital markets that are more transactional in nature.Health Solutions organic revenue growth of 5% reflects double-digit growth in Human Capital, driven by data and advisory solutions. Results also reflect growth globally in core health and benefits brokerage, driven by strong retention and management of the renewal book portfolio, partially offset by a negative impact from the timing of certain revenues, as described in the second quarter and prior year period.Wealth Solutions organic revenue growth of 2% reflects growth in Retirement, driven by higher utilization rates and project work related to pension de-risking and ongoing impacts of regulatory changes. In Investments, a decrease in AUM-based delegated investment management revenue was partially offset by growth in project-related work.THIRD QUARTER 2022 EXPENSE REVIEWThree Months EndedSeptember 30,(millions)20222021$ Change% ChangeExpensesCompensation and benefits$ 1,532$ 1,835$ (303)(17) %Information technology13313032Premises7198(27)(28)Depreciation of fixed assets3756(19)(34)Amortization and impairment of intangible assets3436(2)(6)Other general expense2991,348(1,049)(78)Total operating expenses$ 2,106$ 3,503$ (1,397)(40) %Compensation and benefits expense decreased $303 million, or 17%, compared to the prior year period due primarily to a $245 million decrease in transaction costs and a $106 million favorable impact from foreign currency translation, partially offset by an increase in expense associated with 5% organic revenue growth.Information technology expense increased $3 million, or 2%, compared to the prior year period due primarily to an increase in expense associated with 5% organic revenue growth, partially offset by a $17 million decrease in transaction costs.Premises expense decreased $27 million, or 28%, compared to the prior year period due primarily to a $22 million decrease in transaction costs and an $8 million favorable impact from foreign currency translation.Depreciation of fixed assets decreased $19 million, or 34%, compared to the prior year period due primarily to a $16 million decrease in transaction costs.Amortization and impairment of intangible assets decreased $2 million, or 6%, compared to the prior year period.Other general expenses decreased $1,049 million, or 78%, compared to the prior year period due primarily to a decrease in transaction costs, partially offset by an increase in expense associated with 5% organic revenue growth, including an increase in travel and entertainment expense.THIRD QUARTER 2022 INCOME SUMMARYCertain noteworthy items impacted adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margins in the third quarters of 2022 and 2021, which are also described in detail in ""Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures - Operating Income and Diluted Earnings Per Share"" on page 10 of this press release.Three Months EndedSeptember 30,(millions)20222021% ChangeRevenue$ 2,696$ 2,702— %Expenses2,1063,503(40) %Operating income (loss)$ 590$ (801)174 %Operating margin21.9 %(29.6) %Operating income - as adjusted$ 624$ 5984 %Operating margin - as adjusted23.1 %22.1 %Operating income (loss) increased $1.4 billion to $590 million and operating margin increased from (29.6)% to 21.9%, each compared to the prior year period. Operating income, adjusted for certain items increased $26 million to $624 million and operating margin, adjusted for certain items, increased 100 basis points to 23.1%, each compared to the prior year period. Operating income increased primarily due to the reduction in operating expenses, as described above, and the increase in operating income, as adjusted for certain items primarily reflects strong organic revenue growth, partially offset by increased expenses and investments in long-term growth.Interest income increased $4 million to $7 million compared to the prior year period. Interest expense increased $23 million to $103 million compared to the prior year period, reflecting an increase in total debt. Other pension expense was $3 million, compared to $5 million of income in the prior year period. Other income was $19 million, compared to $5 million in the prior year period, primarily reflecting net gains due to the favorable impact of exchange rates on the remeasurement of assets and liabilities in non-functional currencies.Conference Call, Presentation Slides and Webcast DetailsThe Company will host a conference call on Friday, October 28, 2022 at 7:30 a.m., central time.

Organic revenue growth includes the impact of intercompany activity and excludes foreign exchange rate changes, acquisitions, divestitures, transfers between revenue lines, fiduciary investment income, and gains or losses on derivatives accounted for as hedges. Currency impact is determined by translating last year's revenue, expense, or net income at this year's foreign exchange rates.

Supplemental organic revenue growth information and additional measures that exclude the effects of certain items noted above do not affect net income or any other U.S. GAAP reported amounts. Free cash flow is cash flows from operating activity less capital expenditures. The adjusted effective tax rate excludes the applicable tax impact associated with expenses for estimated intangible asset amortization and impairment, and certain other noteworthy items. Management believes that these measures are important to make meaningful period-to-period comparisons and that this supplemental information is helpful to investors.

Brooke, can we get the jingle out?BROOKE DIPALMA : [VOCALIZING ""I'M LOVIN' IT""] You had to say, I'm loving it. I'm loving it.- It's been in my head all morning.BROOKE DIPALMA : I have to say that certainly the shares up 3% today after McDonald's came out with this report this morning noting that marketing efforts and the stronger-- or rather higher menu prices really driving this quarter, but largely offset from the strength of the US dollar. If we take a close look at some takeaways from the earnings call this morning, we found that US consumers are getting fewer items per order. Drive-thru is back to pre-COVID levels. This was also the highest delivery sales quarter that McDonald's has ever seen. They did note that more people are heading back into restaurants. They're seeing about a 70% flow rate there.But if we do take a look at what we're really keeping an eye on this quarter, the low-income consumer, they're saying that they're seeing a bit of trade down among low-income consumers and a shift from meal purchases to more value orders. Of course, McDonald's known for its value menu there.And also too, they continue to say that as inflation continues to tick up, they expect to benefit from a mild to moderate recession here, noting that that food away from home category is less pricier than those groceries, of course. But if we take a look at Europe, consumer sentiment low there. They're noting that inflation can take its toll on price of food and energy there. They might step in similar to during COVID and help franchisees. Marketing here, though, a big push this quarter with that Camp McDonald's. They also did give us a quick insight on that Cactus Flea Market box.They sold out 50% of the collectibles during the first four days. And you'd be happy to know the McRib, they've compared it to Tom Brady, Michael Jordan. They've never officially retired with it, so that's making a comeback.- Another comeback. Another comeback.]"

Already, the company been on a purge in recent weeks, shutting down a delivery robot business, a virtual tour feature and a kids-focused video calling device.“We’re taking actions to tighten our belt,” Amazon Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said on a conference call. “We believe our resources are better spent elsewhere.”At Intel, talk has shifted from the chipmaker’s factory expansion plans to an aggressive headcount reduction. After announcing a 20% decline in revenue last quarter, the company said it would begin cutting jobs and spending as it tries to save $3 billion next year.Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, drew ire this week in part by not trying to keep a lid on expenses. The company posted its second straight quarter of disappointing earnings, but Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg urged shareholders to be patient with its expansion plans. They weren’t.With Meta’s costs growing -- including its spending on an elusive metaverse dream -- investors sent the shares down 25% on Thursday.Even Apple Inc., which has fared better than its tech peers this year, has been cutting back. Though it has avoided mass layoffs, the company plans to trim expenditures in 2023 and slow hiring. “Obviously we’re being deliberate in our decisions of where to invest,” CEO Tim Cook said in July.Story continuesCompanies have been battered by inflation and a strong dollar, which has reduced the value of overseas sales. The choppy economic outlook is worrying consumers, who are cutting their spending.The pressure on the big technology companies to do more with less has only grown during a disastrous run of earnings reports this week. Alphabet Inc., Amazon, Meta, Microsoft Corp. and others all fell short of projections, sending their shares plunging and shaving hundreds of millions of dollars from their valuations.Some of the few companies to emerge unscathed were the ones pledging to go on a diet. Intel, which has struggled for years to turn around its business and now faces a broader slump in personal computers, placated investors with its latest cutback plans. Even after results suggested that its plight is only getting worse, the shares climbed more than 5% in late trading Thursday.Intel’s cost-cutting plan was “more aggressive than what investors expected,” said CJ Muse, an analyst at Evercore ISI. “It’s something that gives some comfort.”Chipmaker SK Hynix Inc. reported a 60% in third-quarter profit but soothed fears by vowing to cut its capital expenditures by at least half next year.Companies connected with the personal computer market -- like Intel and Hynix -- are under particular pressure because that market has begun to collapse. Consumers had snapped up PCs during the pandemic, as they equipped home offices, but are now holding off on purchases.Seagate Technology Holdings Plc, the biggest maker of computer hard drives, announced plans to eliminate about 3,000 jobs this week.“The whole industry has to get more pragmatic about PCs because they went irrationally high during the pandemic,” said Glenn O’Donnell, director of research at Forrester Research Group. “There was this surge, and now we’ve having the hangover.”Amazon also has acknowledged that it grew too fast during the pandemic, betting that a shift to e-commerce would justify its sprawling delivery infrastructure. Instead, online sales slowed as consumers sought to return to pre-pandemic lifestyles.Amazon has adjusted by delaying warehouse openings, freezing hiring in its retail group and shutting down experimental projects. But inflation and a shaky economy have only added to the company’s woes.Amazon said it expects revenue of $140 billion to $148 billion in the holiday quarter, far short of the $156 billion estimate. It’s not the only one feeling the pain. Adobe Inc., which tracks e-commerce sales, said US online sales will rise just 2.5% in in November and December from the prior year.“Clearly, Amazon went too big too soon on its expansion plans,” Matt Britzman, an analyst Hargreaves Lansdown, said in a note. “It’s had to put the brakes on and then some to try and get costs back under control.”--With assistance from Mark Gurman and Alex Barinka.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekYeezy Roller Coaster Ended With Two-Minute Phone Call at AdidasFed’s Inflation Fight Is Becoming a Battle Over Jobs, TooThese Five Women Are Helping Doctors Crack the Long-Covid MysteryCan an Election-Denial Alliance Save Republican Senate Hopes in Arizona?Basketball’s Top Shrink on How Finding Purpose Lifts Performance©2022 Bloomberg L.P.]"
422,eda400fe-3ee6-3ad9-80a8-553b47120c46,STX,2022-10-28,Bearish: Analysts Just Cut Their Seagate Technology Holdings plc (NASDAQ:STX) Revenue and EPS estimates,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bearish-analysts-just-cut-seagate-132415485.html,1666877055,STORY,['STX'],"[The analysts covering Seagate Technology Holdings plc (NASDAQ:STX) delivered a dose of negativity to shareholders today, by making a substantial revision to their statutory forecasts for this year. Both revenue and earnings per share (EPS) forecasts went under the knife, suggesting analysts have soured majorly on the business.Following the latest downgrade, the current consensus, from the 23 analysts covering Seagate Technology Holdings, is for revenues of US$8.3b in 2023, which would reflect a substantial 22% reduction in Seagate Technology Holdings' sales over the past 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are supposed to crater 56% to US$2.41 in the same period. Prior to this update, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$9.2b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$4.22 in 2023. It looks like analyst sentiment has declined substantially, with a substantial drop in revenue estimates and a pretty serious decline to earnings per share numbers as well. Check out our latest analysis for Seagate Technology Holdings earnings-and-revenue-growthThe consensus price target fell 12% to US$64.33, with the weaker earnings outlook clearly leading analyst valuation estimates. It could also be instructive to look at the range of analyst estimates, to evaluate how different the outlier opinions are from the mean. There are some variant perceptions on Seagate Technology Holdings, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$88.00 and the most bearish at US$40.00 per share. This is a fairly broad spread of estimates, suggesting that the analysts are forecasting a wide range of possible outcomes for the business.Taking a look at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can understand these forecasts is to see how they compare to both past performance and industry growth estimates. We would highlight that sales are expected to reverse, with a forecast 28% annualised revenue decline to the end of 2023. That is a notable change from historical growth of 0.9% over the last five years. By contrast, our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in the same industry are forecast to see their revenue grow 4.9% annually for the foreseeable future. So although its revenues are forecast to shrink, this cloud does not come with a silver lining - Seagate Technology Holdings is expected to lag the wider industry.Story continuesThe Bottom LineThe biggest issue in the new estimates is that analysts have reduced their earnings per share estimates, suggesting business headwinds lay ahead for Seagate Technology Holdings. Regrettably, they also downgraded their revenue estimates, and the latest forecasts imply the business will grow sales slower than the wider market. After such a stark change in sentiment from analysts, we'd understand if readers now felt a bit wary of Seagate Technology Holdings.Unfortunately, the earnings downgrade - if accurate - may also place pressure on Seagate Technology Holdings' mountain of debt, which could lead to some belt tightening for shareholders.

""We expect economic uncertainty and external disruptions to persist in the near-term and are staying agile, as we adjust our playbook to this environment, while taking decisive actions to maximize profits and cash. We remain confident in the strength of our brands and our ability to drive sustainable and profitable growth over the long term.""Chris Peterson, President and Chief Financial Officer, said, ""During the third quarter we enhanced Newell's financial flexibility and maintained strong cost discipline, as results were impacted by top line deleveraging. We remain laser focused on aligning the company's cost structure with the macro backdrop, reducing inventory and strengthening cash flow, while continuing to invest in core capabilities.""Third Quarter 2022 Executive SummaryNet sales were $2.3 billion, a 19.2 percent decline compared with the prior year period, including the year over year impact from the sale of the Connected Home &amp; Security (CH&amp;S) business at the end of the first quarter 2022.Core sales declined 10.8 percent compared with the prior year period. One of seven business units increased core sales compared with the prior year period.Reported operating margin was 1.6 percent, including the impact of a $148 million non-cash impairment charge, compared with 10.1 percent in the prior year period. Normalized operating margin was 10.2 percent compared with 11.4 percent in the prior year period.Reported diluted earnings per share were $0.07 compared with $0.44 per share in the prior year period.Normalized diluted earnings per share were $0.53 compared with $0.54 per share in the prior year period.The company strengthened its financial flexibility and refinanced its unsecured revolving credit facility as well as its senior notes due April 2023 (April 2023 notes). In September, the company issued $1.0 billion of senior notes and in October, used the net proceeds, together with available cash, to redeem the April 2023 notes.The company's leverage ratio was 3.9x at the end of the third quarter versus 3.1x in the prior year period and 3.0x at the end of 2021.The company updated its full year 2022 net sales and normalized earnings per share outlook to $9.35 billion to $9.43 billion and $1.56 to $1.61, respectively.Story continuesThird Quarter 2022 Operating ResultsNet sales were $2.3 billion, a 19.2 percent decline compared to the prior year period, reflecting a core sales decrease of 10.8 percent, the impact of the sale of the CH&amp;S business at the end of the first quarter 2022, unfavorable foreign exchange, as well as category and retail store exits.Reported gross margin was 29.0 percent compared with 30.4 percent in the prior year period, as fixed cost deleveraging and significant headwinds from foreign exchange and inflation, particularly related to sourced finished goods, transportation and labor, more than offset benefits from pricing and FUEL productivity savings. Normalized gross margin was 29.4 percent compared with 30.6 percent in the prior year period.Reported operating income was $35 million compared with $281 million in the prior year period. A non-cash impairment charge of $148 million related to goodwill and intangible assets was incurred in the current period. Reported operating margin was 1.6 percent compared with 10.1 percent in the prior year period, as the impact of lower net sales, the impairment charge, significant headwinds from inflation and foreign exchange and an increase in advertising and promotion expense as a percentage of sales more than offset benefits from pricing, FUEL productivity savings and lower overhead costs. Normalized operating income was $229 million, or 10.2 percent of sales, compared with $317 million, or 11.4 percent of sales, in the prior year period.Net interest expense was $57 million compared with $65 million in the prior year period.Reported tax benefit was $61 million compared with a tax provision of $25 million in the prior year period, largely reflecting an increase in discrete tax benefits. The normalized tax benefit was $58 million compared with a normalized tax provision of $20 million in the prior year period.The company reported net income of $31 million, or $0.07 diluted earnings per share, compared with $190 million, or $0.44 diluted earnings per share, in the prior year period.Normalized net income was $220 million, or $0.53 normalized diluted earnings per share, compared with $231 million, or $0.54 normalized diluted earnings per share, in the prior year period.An explanation of non-GAAP measures and a reconciliation of these non-GAAP results to comparable GAAP measures are included in the tables attached to this release.Balance Sheet and Cash FlowYear to date, operating cash outflow was $567 million compared with operating cash flow of $490 million in the prior year period, primarily reflecting an increase in working capital use, largely due to higher inventory levels driven by significantly greater than anticipated pullback in retailer orders and slowing consumer demand, lower accounts payable due to the timing of supply plan reductions, as well as a decline in operating income.The company strengthened its financial flexibility by refinancing its prior senior unsecured revolving credit facility and upsizing borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility to $1.5 billion. In September, the company also raised $1.0 billion through the issuance of $500 million of 6.375% notes due 2027 and $500 million of 6.625% notes due 2029 and in October, used the net proceeds, together with available cash, to redeem the remaining $1.1 billion of the April 2023 notes.At the end of the third quarter, Newell Brands had cash and cash equivalents of $636 million and net debt outstanding of $5.2 billion. Newell Brands exited the third quarter with a leverage ratio of 3.9x compared to 3.1x in the prior year period and 3.0x at the end of 2021.Leverage ratio is defined as the ratio of net debt to normalized EBITDA over the preceding twelve-month period. An explanation of how the leverage ratio is calculated and a related reconciliation, as well as a reconciliation of reported results to normalized results, are included in the tables attached to this release.Third Quarter 2022 Operating Segment ResultsThe Commercial Solutions segment generated net sales of $397 million compared with $486 million in the prior year period, reflecting core sales growth of 9.2 percent, which was more than offset by the impact of the sale of the CH&amp;S business at the end of the first quarter 2022 and unfavorable foreign exchange. Reported operating income was $28 million, or 7.1 percent of sales, compared with $18 million, or 3.7 percent of sales, in the prior year period. Normalized operating income was $31 million, or 7.8 percent of sales, versus $21 million, or 4.3 percent of sales, in the prior year period.The Home Appliances segment generated net sales of $305 million compared with $443 million in the prior year period, reflecting core sales decline of 23.2 percent, as well as the impact of exits from certain low margin categories and unfavorable foreign exchange. Reported operating loss was $20 million, or negative 6.6 percent of sales, compared with an operating income of $19 million, or 4.3 percent of sales, in the prior year period. The year over year difference was impacted by a $15 million impairment charge related to intangible assets. Normalized operating loss was $3 million, or negative 1.0 percent of sales, versus an operating income of $24 million, or 5.4 percent of sales, in the prior year period.The Home Solutions segment generated net sales of $510 million compared with $598 million in the prior year period, reflecting core sales decline of 11.6 percent, the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange and the exit of 42 Yankee Candle retail locations during the first nine months of the year. Core sales declined across both the Home Fragrance and Food business units. Reported operating loss was $88 million, or negative 17.3 percent of sales, compared with an operating income of $75 million, or 12.5 percent of sales, in the prior year period. The year over year difference was impacted by a $108 million impairment charge related to goodwill. Normalized operating income was $30 million, or 5.9 percent of sales, versus $86 million, or 14.4 percent of sales, in the prior year period.The Learning &amp; Development segment generated net sales of $751 million compared with $869 million in the prior year period, reflecting core sales decline of 9.9 percent and the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange. Core sales declined in both the Writing and Baby business units. Reported operating income was $120 million, or 16.0 percent of sales, compared with $195 million, or 22.4 percent of sales, in the prior year period. The year over year difference was impacted by a $25 million impairment charge related to intangible assets. Normalized operating income was $148 million, or 19.7 percent of sales, compared with $197 million, or 22.7 percent of sales, in the prior year period.The Outdoor &amp; Recreation segment generated net sales of $289 million compared with $391 million in the prior year period, reflecting core sales decline of 18.4 percent, as well as the impact of exits from certain low margin categories and unfavorable foreign exchange. Reported operating income was $8 million, or 2.8 percent of sales, compared with $27 million, or 6.9 percent of sales, in the prior year period. Normalized operating income was $18 million, or 6.2 percent of sales, compared with $34 million, or 8.7 percent of sales, in the prior year period.Outlook for Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022The company initiated its outlook for fourth quarter 2022 and updated its full year 2022 outlook.Q4 2022 OutlookNet Sales$2.18 to $2.26 billionCore Sales9% to 12% declineNormalized Operating Margin5.1% to 6.5%Normalized EPS$0.09 to $0.14Previous Full Year 2022 OutlookUpdated Full Year 2022 OutlookNet Sales$9.37 to $9.58 billion$9.35 to $9.43 billionCore Sales2% to 4% decline3% to 4% declineNormalized Operating Margin10.0% to 10.5%10.0% to 10.3%Normalized EPS$1.56 to $1.70$1.56 to $1.61The full year 2022 outlook for net sales, normalized operating margin and normalized EPS includes the contribution from CH&amp;S during the first quarter. Core sales growth outlook for full year 2022 excludes the contribution from CH&amp;S. Net sales outlooks for both Q4 2022, as well as for the full year 2022, account for the expected unfavorable foreign exchange movements, using current rates, as well as closures of Yankee Candle retail locations and market and category exits, primarily in the Outdoor &amp; Recreation and Home Appliances segments.For full year 2022, the company currently expects to deliver operating cash flow significantly below its prior range of $400 million to $500 million, including the impact of the loss of profits from the sale of the CH&amp;S business, as well as a one-time cash tax payment on this transaction.The company has presented forward-looking statements regarding core sales, normalized operating margin and normalized earnings per share. These non-GAAP financial measures are derived by excluding certain amounts, expenses or income, from the corresponding financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. The determination of the amounts that are excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures is a matter of management judgement and depends upon, among other factors, the nature of the underlying expense or income amounts recognized in a given period. We are unable to present a quantitative reconciliation of forward-looking normalized operating margin or normalized earnings per share to their most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP financial measures because such information is not available, and management cannot reliably predict all of the necessary components of such GAAP measures without unreasonable effort or expense. In addition, we believe such reconciliations would imply a degree of precision that would be confusing or misleading to investors. The unavailable information could have a significant impact on the company's future financial results. These non-GAAP financial measures are preliminary estimates and are subject to risks and uncertainties, including, among others, changes in connection with quarter-end and year-end adjustments. Any variation between the company's actual results and preliminary financial data set forth above may be material.Conference CallNewell Brands’ third quarter 2022 earnings conference call will be held today, October 28, at 11:00 a.m. ET. A link to the webcast is provided under Events &amp; Presentations in the Investors section of the company’s website at www.newellbrands.com. A webcast replay will be made available in the Quarterly Earnings section of the company’s website.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresThis release contains non-GAAP financial measures within the meaning of Regulation G promulgated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") and includes a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.The company uses certain non-GAAP financial measures that are included in this press release and the additional financial information both to explain its results to stockholders and the investment community and in the internal evaluation and management of its businesses. The company’s management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures and the information they provide are useful to investors since these measures (a) permit investors to view the company’s performance and liquidity using the same tools that management uses to evaluate the company’s past performance, reportable segments, prospects for future performance and liquidity, and (b) determine certain elements of management incentive compensation.The company’s management believes that core sales provides a more complete understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales on a consistent basis as it excludes the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures, retail store openings and closings, certain market and category exits, and changes in foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. The effect of changes in foreign exchange on reported sales is calculated by applying the prior year average monthly exchange rates to the current year local currency sales amounts (excluding acquisitions and divestitures), with the difference between the 2022 reported sales and constant currency sales presented as the foreign exchange impact increase or decrease in core sales. The company’s management believes that ""normalized"" gross margin, ""normalized"" operating income, ""normalized"" operating margin, ""normalized EBITDA"", ""normalized"" net income, ""normalized"" diluted earnings per share, ""normalized"" interest and ""normalized"" income tax benefit or expense, which exclude restructuring and restructuring-related expenses and one-time and other events such as costs related to the extinguishment of debt, certain tax benefits and charges, impairment charges, pension settlement charges, divestiture costs, costs related to the acquisition, integration and financing of acquired businesses, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, inflationary adjustments, expenses related to certain product recalls and certain other items, are useful because they provide investors with a meaningful perspective on the current underlying performance of the company’s core ongoing operations and liquidity. ""Normalized EBITDA"" is an ongoing liquidity measure (that excludes non-cash items) and is calculated as normalized earnings before interest, tax depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation expense. ""Leverage ratio"" is a liquidity measure calculated as the ratio of net debt (defined as total debt less cash and cash equivalents) to normalized EBITDA.The company determines the tax effect of the items excluded from normalized diluted earnings per share by applying the estimated effective rate for the applicable jurisdiction in which the pre-tax items were incurred, and for which realization of the resulting tax benefit, if any, is expected. In certain situations in which an item excluded from normalized results impacts income tax expense, the company utilizes a ""with"" and ""without"" approach to determine normalized income tax benefit or expense.While the company believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating the company’s performance and liquidity, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and not as a substitute for or superior to the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from similar measures presented by other companies.About Newell BrandsNewell Brands (NASDAQ: NWL) is a leading global consumer goods company with a strong portfolio of well-known brands, including Rubbermaid, FoodSaver, Calphalon, Sistema, Sharpie, Paper Mate, Dymo, EXPO, Elmer’s, Yankee Candle, Graco, NUK, Rubbermaid Commercial Products, Spontex, Coleman, Campingaz, Contigo, Oster, Sunbeam and Mr. Coffee.

These statements generally can be identified by the use of words or phrases, including, but not limited to, ""guidance,"" ""outlook,"" ""intend,"" ""anticipate,"" ""believe,"" ""estimate,"" ""project,"" ""target,"" ""plan,"" ""expect,"" ""setting up,"" ""beginning to,"" ""will,"" ""should,"" ""would,"" ""could,"" ""resume,"" ""are confident that,"" ""remain optimistic that,"" ""seek to,"" or similar statements. We caution that forward-looking statements are not guarantees because there are inherent difficulties in predicting future results. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements, including impairment charges and accounting for income taxes. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to:our ability to optimize costs and cash flow and mitigate the impact of retailer inventory rebalancing through discretionary and overhead spend management, advertising and promotion expense optimization, demand forecast and supply plan adjustments and actions to improve working capital;our dependence on the strength of retail and consumer demand and commercial and industrial sectors of the economy in various countries around the world;our ability to improve productivity, reduce complexity and streamline operations;our ability to manage the actual or perceived effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including as a result of any additional variants of the virus or the efficacy and distribution of vaccines;competition with other manufacturers and distributors of consumer products;major retailers’ strong bargaining power and consolidation of our customers;supply chain and operational disruptions in the markets in which we operate, whether as a result of the actual or perceived effects of the COVID-19 pandemic or broader geopolitical and macroeconomic conditions, including the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine;changes in the prices and availability of labor, transportation, raw materials and sourced products, including significant inflation, and our ability to offset cost increases through pricing and productivity in a timely manner;the cost and outcomes of governmental investigations, inspections, lawsuits, legislative requests or other actions by third parties, the potential outcomes of which could exceed policy limits, to the extent insured;our ability to develop innovative new products, to develop, maintain and strengthen end-user brands and to realize the benefits of increased advertising and promotion spend;our ability to consistently maintain effective internal control over financial reporting;the risks inherent to our foreign operations, including currency fluctuations, exchange controls and pricing restrictions;future events that could adversely affect the value of our assets and/or stock price and require additional impairment charges;unexpected costs or expenses associated with dispositions;our ability to effectively execute our turnaround plan, including Project Ovid;risks related to our substantial indebtedness, potential increases in interest rates or changes in our credit ratings;a failure or breach of one of our key information technology systems, networks, processes or related controls or those of our service providers;the impact of U.S. and foreign regulations on our operations, including the impact of tariffs and environmental remediation costs and legislation and regulatory actions related to data privacy and climate change;the potential inability to attract, retain and motivate key employees;changes in tax laws and the resolution of tax contingencies resulting in additional tax liabilities;product liability, product recalls or related regulatory actions;our ability to protect intellectual property rights;significant increases in the funding obligations related to our pension plans; andother factors listed from time to time in our SEC filings, including but not limited to our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and our other SEC filings.The consolidated condensed financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (""U.S. GAAP""). Management’s application of U.S. GAAP requires the pervasive use of estimates and assumptions in preparing the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. The company continues to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, inflationary and supply chain pressures, and the indirect macroeconomic impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, which has required greater use of estimates and assumptions in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements. Although we have made our best estimates based upon current information, actual results could materially differ and may require future changes to such estimates and assumptions, including reserves, which may result in future expense.The information contained in this press release and the tables is as of the date indicated. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or developments.NEWELL BRANDS INC.CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS (UNAUDITED)(Amounts in millions, except per share data)Three Months Ended September 30,Nine Months Ended September 30,20222021% Change20222021% ChangeNet sales$2,252$2,787(19.2)%$7,174$7,784(7.8)%Cost of products sold1,5991,9394,9565,323Gross profit653848(23.0)%2,2182,461(9.9)%Selling, general and administrative expenses467561(16.8)%1,4891,667(10.7)%Restructuring costs, net361216Impairment of goodwill, intangibles and other assets148—148—Operating income35281(87.5)%569778(26.9)%Non-operating expenses:Interest expense, net5765171197Other (income) expense, net81(108)(3)Income (loss) before income taxes(30)215NM506584(13.4)%Income tax provision (benefit)(61)2537108Net income$31$190(83.7)%$469$476(1.5)%Weighted average common shares outstanding:Basic413.6425.4416.4425.2Diluted414.6428.5418.3427.9Earnings per share:Basic$0.07$0.45$1.13$1.12Diluted$0.07$0.44$1.12$1.11Dividends per share$0.23$0.23$0.69$0.69NEWELL BRANDS INC.CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS (UNAUDITED)(Amounts in millions)September 30, 2022December 31, 2021AssetsCurrent assetsCash and cash equivalents$636$440Accounts receivable, net1,5021,500Inventories2,5271,997Prepaid expenses and other current assets483325Total current assets5,1484,262Property, plant and equipment, net1,1241,204Operating lease assets585558Goodwill3,3003,504Other intangible assets, net2,8693,370Deferred income taxes778814Other assets874467TOTAL ASSETS$14,678$14,179Liabilities and stockholders' equityCurrent liabilitiesAccounts payable$1,437$1,680Accrued compensation123270Other accrued liabilities1,4701,364Short-term debt and current portion of long-term debt1,0783Total current liabilities4,1083,317Long-term debt4,7624,883Deferred income taxes641405Operating lease liabilities519500Other noncurrent liabilities872983Total liabilities10,90210,088Total stockholders' equity3,7764,091TOTAL LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY$14,678$14,179NEWELL BRANDS INC.CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS (UNAUDITED)(Amounts in millions)Nine Months Ended September 30,20222021Cash flows from operating activities:Net income$469$476Adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities:Depreciation and amortization222244Impairment of goodwill, intangibles and other assets148—(Gain) loss from sale of businesses(136)2Deferred income taxes211(17)Stock based compensation expense837Other, net(2)(1)Changes in operating accounts excluding the effects of divestitures:Accounts receivable(165)(44)Inventories(738)(488)Accounts payable(143)194Accrued liabilities and other(441)87Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities(567)490Cash flows from investing activities:Proceeds from sale of divested business616—Capital expenditures(221)(181)Other investing activities, net251Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities420(180)Cash flows from financing activities:Net proceeds from issuance of long-term debt990—Payments on current portion of long-term debt(2)(447)Payments on long-term debt—(6)Repurchase of shares of common stock(325)—...]"

The bottom line also increased 9% year over year. For the quarter under review, AXP’s total revenues net of interest expense increased 24% year over year to $13,556 million. The top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13,515 million and our estimate of $13,454.1 million.The strong third-quarter 2022 results gained from continued business momentum and a solid revenue stream. American Express also benefited from better volumes and higher Card Member spending, due to a significant increase in Travel and Entertainment spending. AXP added 3.3 million proprietary cards in the quarter.American Express last week reported stronger-than-expected third-quarter earnings and revenue, while raising its full-year forecast. American Express reiterated its revenue growth guidance in the range of 23-25% and expects earnings per share to be above its guidance of $9.25-$9.65. However, it is building greater provisions, preparing for any potential defaults. The earnings estimate is lower than the consensus mark of $9.89 per share.Below we highlight a few ETFs that can gain from American Express’ upbeat earnings.ETFs in FocusDefiance Hotel Airline and Cruise ETF CRUZ – Up 3.9% Last WeekThe demand for travel is particularly resilient as Americans make up for postponed trips due to the pandemic. Consumers are also splurging on food and entertainment after pandemic lockdowns eased. American Express said its travel and entertainment segment saw spending skyrocket 57% from a year ago with volumes in its international markets surpassing pre-pandemic levels for the first time in the third quarter.iShares Evolved U.S. Discretionary Spending ETF IEDI – Down 0.8% Last WeekAccording to Wells Fargo, consumers had accumulated as much as $2.1 trillion in excess savings during the peak of the pandemic helped by fiscal support and lack of spending options amid lockdowns. That’s a huge sum in an economy with $25 trillion in annual GDP. Though these savings are rapidly declining amid high inflation, consumers still have $1.3 trillion in extra spending power as of August, as quoted on Yahoo Finance. Both Bank of America and American Express said that U.S. consumer is braving red-hot inflation.Story continuesALPS Global Travel Beneficiaries ETF JRNY – Up 1.1% Last WeekAmerican Express “expected the recovery in travel spending to be a tailwind for [the company], but the strength of the rebound has exceeded [management’s] expectations throughout the year,” as quoted on CNBC.

435,e53596f5-2ce8-3725-9304-efb86350c66e,NI,2022-10-28,Consolidated Edison (ED) Earnings Expected to Grow: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/consolidated-edison-ed-earnings-expected-140202886.html,1666879322,STORY,"['ED', 'NIMC']","[The market expects Consolidated Edison (ED) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 3. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis utility is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.47 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +4.3%.Revenues are expected to be $3.73 billion, up 3.1% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Con Ed?For Con Ed, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Con Ed will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Con Ed would post earnings of $0.58 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.64, delivering a surprise of +10.34%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Con Ed doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsNiSource (NI), another stock in the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $0.11 for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate points to no change from the year-ago quarter. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $996.6 million, up 3.9% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for NiSource has been revised 9.3% up to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, reflecting an equal Most Accurate Estimate.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that NiSource will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 3, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis maker of dental products is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.47 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +4.4%.Revenues are expected to be $633.17 million, up 4.3% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.3% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Envista?For Envista, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.36%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Envista will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Envista would post earnings of $0.46 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.48, delivering a surprise of +4.35%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Envista doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAnother stock from the Zacks Medical - Products industry, Zimmer Biomet (ZBH), is soon expected to post earnings of $1.56 per share for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -13.8%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $1.63 billion, down 15.2% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Zimmer has been revised 0.5% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.59%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Zimmer will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

ResMed uses non-GAAP information internally in planning, forecasting, and evaluating the results of operations in the current period and in comparing it to past periods. ResMed believes this information provides investors better insight when evaluating ResMed’s performance from core operations and provides consistent financial reporting. The use of non-GAAP measures is intended to supplement, and not to replace, the presentation of net income and other GAAP measures. Like all non-GAAP measures, non-GAAP earnings are subject to inherent limitations because they do not include all the expenses that must be included under GAAP.Revenue by Product and Region(Unaudited; $ in millions, except for per share amounts)  Three Months Ended  September 30,2022(A)September 30,2021(A)% Change ConstantCurrency (B)U.S., Canada, and Latin America        Devices $339.5 $275.9 23%  Masks and other  238.6  215.1 11   Total Sleep and Respiratory Care $578.1 $491.0 18   Software-as-a-Service  105.9  97.5 9   Total $684.0 $588.6 16            Combined Europe, Asia, and other markets        Devices $178.0 $218.2 (18)% (10)%Masks and other  88.3  97.2 (9) 3 Total Sleep and Respiratory Care $266.3 $315.5 (16) (6)         Global revenue        Devices $517.6 $494.2 5% 9%Masks and other  326.9  312.3 5  8 Total Sleep and Respiratory Care $844.4 $806.5 5  9 Software-as-a-Service  105.9  97.5 9  9 Total $950.3 $904.0 5  9          (A) Totals and subtotals may not add due to rounding.(B) In order to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, we provide certain financial information on a “constant currency basis,” which is in addition to the actual financial information presented.

However, this indicates a 4.2% decline from the figure reported in the prior-year fiscal quarter.The snack food and beverage product company has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 4.6%, on average. MDLZ delivered an earnings surprise of 4.7% in the last reported quarter.Factors to ConsiderMondelez has been gaining from strength in emerging markets and its focus on strengthening the snacking category. In the second quarter of 2022, revenues from emerging markets increased by 22.4% to $2,806 million while rising 22.5% on an organic basis.Mondelez International, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseMondelez International, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseMondelez International, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Mondelez International, Inc. QuoteThe company saw strength in all major business units. On its second-quarter earnings call, the company stated that consumer confidence was reverting to pre-pandemic levels in emerging markets. This bodes well for the quarter under review.Mondelez has been keen on expanding its business through acquisitions. The company has been expanding its snacking category in particular.As consumers prefer snacking over traditional meals, the company’s core categories — chocolates and biscuits — have historically depicted resilience to economic downturns and pricing actions. Consumers in developed countries consider chocolates and biscuits as affordable indulgences and one of the most-valued snacking products.Contributions from the buyouts of Clif Bar (August 2022) and Chipita S.A. (January 2022) are likely to aid Mondelez’s third-quarter results.That said, Mondelez has been battling cost inflation, especially for energy, transportation, packaging, wheat, dairy and edible oils. The company is also navigating through supply-chain bottlenecks due to labor shortages at third parties.  Management’s guidance for 2022 reflects anticipation of the elevated cost of goods sold inflation, the timing impact of extra pricing actions and the impacts of the Ukraine war.While commodity cost inflation may ease, management expects other costs, such as wages, to reflect considerable inflation. Apart from input cost inflation, the guidance includes investments to support brands and other growth-oriented investments. The company has been undertaking strong pricing efforts to counter inflationary headwinds.Volatile currency movements are also an area of concern. On its second-quarter 2022 earnings call, management stated that currency movements are likely to negatively impact net revenues by nearly 5% and the adjusted EPS by 22 cents in 2022. These aspects raise concerns for the quarter to be reported.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model doesn’t conclusively predict an earnings beat for Mondelez this time.

You can skip our detailed analysis of Berkshire Hathaway's strategy and Warren Buffett's background and go directly to the 5 Best Value Stocks To Buy According To Warren Buffett.Born in 1930 in Omaha, Nebraska, Warren Buffett is considered the most successful investor in history. Popularly known as the ""Oracle of Omaha,"" he is the sixth wealthiest person in the world, with a net worth of $95 billion.After Buffett was denied admission by Harvard Business School, he went on to complete his Masters in economics at Columbia University. Buffett learned the principles of investing from his mentor Ben Graham at Columbia. Graham's ""value investing"" included searching for companies that were trading at a significant discount to their ""intrinsic value,"" or the worth of their underlying assets. Buffett internalized the concept and added to the ideas of Ben Graham by theorizing that the quality of the company's management and the product's competitive edge in the market are key factors in evaluating companies.Warren Buffett created Buffett Partnership, Ltd in 1956. In 1969, he purchased Berkshire Hathaway, a textile manufacturing business, and transformed it into a diversified holding corporation.  Since 1970, Buffett has served as Berkshire Hathaway's chairman and biggest shareholder. Berkshire Hathaway is the parent firm of a number of other companies, including the insurance provider Geico, and has significant investments in a number of Fortune 500 corporations.Berkshire Hathaway's investment principles include having a long-time horizon which is why some of its holdings have been in the portfolio for over several decades.

On October 19, Jefferies analyst Lloyd Byrne initiated coverage of Hess Corporation (NYSE:HES) with a Hold rating and a $140 price target.The rise in energy prices this year has given most oil and gas equities a boost, including Hess Corporation (NYSE:HES), whose shares are currently trading more than 80% higher year to date.

APA Corporation (NASDAQ:APA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders as of Q2, 2022: 36APA Corporation (NASDAQ:APA) is a Texas-based company that explores, develops, and produces oil and gas properties.

Although their share prices have increased considerably, both companies still look quite undervalued even using longer term oil prices in the $65-70 dollar range. Meanwhile, if times are good over the next couple of years, we expect these companies to return significant percentages of their market caps to shareholders.”07. Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders as of Q2, 2022: 39Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) is a London-based energy and petrochemical company operating in Europe, Asia, Oceania, Africa, the United States, and the rest of the Americas. The company operates through Integrated Gas, Upstream, Marketing, Chemicals and Products, and Renewables and Energy Solutions segments. Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) is one of the best energy stocks to invest in. The stock's dividend yield on October 20 came in at 2.86%.Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) is also one of the largest oil companies in the world, as it produces 3.5 million barrels of oil per day and has an equally impressive portfolio of 46,000 gas stations. It also used the recent oil price increases to decrease its debt by 45%. According to experts, Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) balance sheet is strong and its debt load is reasonable. JPMorgan analyst Christian Malek on October 13 reiterated an Overweight rating on Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) but lowered the price target on the shares to 2,900 GBp from 3,000 GBp.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 39 hedge funds were long Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) at the end of the second quarter of 2022, compared to 37 funds in the prior quarter. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management held the leading stake in the company, consisting of 20.25 million shares worth over $1 billion.Here’s what Third Point Management said about Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“We have continued to add to our position in Shell, as it trades at the same deeply discounted multiple today that it did last year due to a move up in commodity prices. We are engaged in discussions with management, board members, and other shareholders, as well as informal talks with financial advisors. We have discussed various alternatives with the aim of both increasing shareholder value and allowing Shell to effectively manage the energy transition. We have reiterated our view that Shell’s portfolio of disparate businesses ranging from deep water oil to wind farms to gas stations to chemical plants is confusing and unmanageable. Most investors we have discussed this with agree that the company would be more successful over the long term with a different corporate structure. Discussions among the parties have been constructive and will be ongoing since stakeholders clearly see these corporate changes as instrumental, particularly if Shell wishes to become a leader in the energy transition rather than be left behind as a tarnished legacy brand.Beyond our discussions around corporate structure, there have been two important developments since our last update. First, Shell announced a plan to redomicile its headquarters to the UK and create a single shareholder class. This move allows greater flexibility to modify its portfolio (either through asset sales or spin-offs) and allows for a more efficient return of capital, specifically via share repurchases. Second, fundamental and geopolitical events have highlighted the strategic importance of reliable energy supplies, especially in Europe. Shell’s LNG business, the largest in the world outside of Qatar, will play a critical role in ensuring energy security for Europe. In our view, the value of this business has increased dramatically since our original investment.While Shell continues to trade at a large discount to its intrinsic value, with proper management we believe the company can simultaneously deliver shareholder returns, reliable energy and decarbonization of the global economy. We look forward to continued engagement with management and other shareholders and to more strategic clarity from the Company.”06.

An underweight to communication services and an overweight to energy helped performance, while an underweight to consumer staples and an overweight to materials detracted. Stock selection was strong within healthcare and materials but was weak within information technology and industrials. Marathon Oil (NYSE:MRO) increased its quarterly dividend and executed an impressive share buyback that blew by the target it originally announced.” Click to continue reading and see the  5 Best Crude Oil Stocks To Buy Today.Suggested articles:10 Best Industrial Dividend Stocks To BuyTop 10 Healthcare Stocks To Buy10 Best Fundamental Penny Stocks To Invest InDisclosure.

Recent and anticipated progress for key pipeline programs is summarized below.Cystic FibrosisVertex continues to pursue next-in-class, small molecule CFTR modulator therapies as well as new treatment options for the approximately 5,000 patients who cannot benefit from CFTR modulators.Vertex is conducting two Phase 3 global, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled clinical trials evaluating Vertex’s new once-daily investigational triple combination of vanzacaftor/tezacaftor/deutivacaftor, formerly known as VX-121/tezacaftor/VX-561, in patients with CF 12 years of age and older. The SKYLINE 102 and SKYLINE 103 trials will compare the efficacy and safety of vanzacaftor/tezacaftor/deutivacaftor to TRIKAFTA. Enrollment in both trials is on track to be completed before the end of 2022.In parallel to SKYLINE 102 and SKYLINE 103, Vertex has also initiated a study of vanzacaftor/tezacaftor/deutivacaftor in children with CF 6 to 11 years of age, which is ongoing.In collaboration with Moderna, Vertex is developing a CFTR mRNA therapeutic to treat the underlying cause of CF by programming cells in the lungs to produce functional CFTR protein for the treatment of the approximately 5,000 people with CF who do not produce any CFTR protein. IND-enabling studies have been completed, and Vertex is on track to submit an IND for this program in Q4 2022.Beta Thalassemia and Sickle Cell DiseaseExagamglogene autotemcel (exa-cel), formerly known as CTX001, is a non-viral ex vivo CRISPR gene-editing therapy, which is being developed as a potential functional cure for transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia (TDT) and severe sickle cell disease (SCD).

In the U.S., exa-cel has been granted Fast Track, Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT), Rare Pediatric Disease and Orphan Drug designations.European/U.K. (EMA and MHRA) submissions remain on track for Q4 2022, and exa-cel has been granted EMA Priority Medicines (PRIME) designation in Europe and Orphan Drug designation in Europe and the U.K.Two additional Phase 3 studies of exa-cel in pediatric patients with TDT and SCD are ongoing.Pain (NaV1.8)Vertex has discovered multiple selective small molecule inhibitors of NaV1.8 with the objective of creating a new class of pain medicines that have the potential to provide effective pain relief, without the limitations of opioids and other standard-of-care pain medicines.Vertex reached agreement with the FDA on the Phase 3 pivotal program design for its lead compound, VX-548, for moderate to severe acute pain. The pivotal program has been initiated and will enroll a total of 2,000 patients with moderate to severe acute pain across two randomized controlled trials with treatment for 48 hours following bunionectomy or abdominoplasty surgery. An additional 250-patient single-arm study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of VX-548 in multiple other types of moderate to severe acute pain with a treatment period of up to 14 days.VX-548 has been granted Fast Track and Breakthrough Therapy Designation in the U.S. for moderate to severe acute pain.Vertex also remains on track to initiate a Phase 2 study of VX-548 in neuropathic pain by year-end 2022.APOL1-Mediated Kidney Disease (AMKD)Vertex has discovered multiple oral, small molecule inhibitors of APOL1, pioneering a new class of medicines that target an underlying genetic driver of kidney disease.Vertex continues to enroll the pivotal program for its lead compound, inaxaplin, formerly known as VX-147, in a single Phase 2/3 clinical trial in patients with AMKD.Inaxaplin was granted breakthrough therapy designation by the FDA for APOL1-mediated focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), as well as Orphan Drug and PRIME designations by the EMA for AMKD.Type 1 Diabetes (T1D)Vertex is evaluating cell therapies using stem cell-derived islets to replace the endogenous insulin-producing islet cells that are destroyed in people with T1D, with the goal of developing a potential functional cure for this disease.Proof of concept has been achieved in the VX-880 program, with the first two patients treated with half the targeted dose.Vertex continues to enroll patients in Part B of the Phase 1/2 study.Vertex remains on track to submit an IND for the cells plus device program in Q4 2022.Alpha-1 Antitrypsin (AAT) DeficiencyVertex is working to address the underlying genetic cause of alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency by developing novel small molecule correctors of Z-AAT protein folding, with the goal of increasing the secretion of functional AAT into the blood and addressing both the lung and the liver aspects of AAT deficiency.Vertex recently initiated a first-in-human clinical trial for VX-634, a small molecule AAT corrector in healthy volunteers. VX-634 is the first in a series of next-wave investigational molecules with significantly improved potency and drug-like properties compared to previous Vertex AAT correctors, allowing potential exploration of the full dose response.Additionally, Vertex will soon initiate a 48-week Phase 2 study of VX-864, a first-generation AAT corrector, to assess the impact of longer-term treatment on polymer clearance from the liver, as well as the levels of functional AAT (fAAT) in the plasma.Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD)Vertex is investigating a novel approach to treating DMD by delivering CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing technology to muscle cells, with the goal of restoring near-full length dystrophin protein expression by targeting specific mutations in the dystrophin gene that cause the disease.IND-enabling studies for the first in vivo gene editing therapy for DMD are underway. Vertex anticipates submitting an IND in 2023.Consistent with its overall strategy, Vertex takes a portfolio approach to all of its programs, with additional assets in CF, SCD, Beta Thalassemia, Pain, AMKD, T1D and AATD in earlier stages of development.Investments in External InnovationConsistent with its strategy to develop transformative medicines for serious diseases, on September 27, 2022, Vertex closed the acquisition of ViaCyte, a regenerative medicine company focused on delivering novel stem cell-derived cell replacement therapies as a potential functional cure for type 1 diabetes.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresIn this press release, Vertex's financial results and financial guidance are provided in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) and using certain non-GAAP financial measures. In particular, non-GAAP financial results and guidance exclude from Vertex's pre-tax income (i) stock-based compensation expense, (ii) gains or losses related to the fair value of the company's strategic investments, (iii) increases or decreases in the fair value of contingent consideration, (iv) acquisition-related costs, (v) an intangible asset impairment charge and (vi) other adjustments. The company's non-GAAP financial results also exclude from its provision for income taxes the estimated tax impact related to its non-GAAP adjustments to pre-tax income described above and certain discrete items. These results should not be viewed as a substitute for the company’s GAAP results and are provided as a complement to results provided in accordance with GAAP. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures help indicate underlying trends in the company's business, are important in comparing current results with prior period results and provide additional information regarding the company's financial position that the company believes is helpful to an understanding of its ongoing business. Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures to establish budgets and operational goals that are communicated internally and externally, to manage the company's business and to evaluate its performance. The company’s calculation of non-GAAP financial measures likely differs from the calculations used by other companies. A reconciliation of the GAAP financial results to non-GAAP financial results is included in the attached financial information.The company provides guidance regarding combined R&amp;D, Acquired IPR&amp;D and SG&amp;A expenses and effective tax rate on a non-GAAP basis. The guidance regarding combined GAAP and non-GAAP R&amp;D, Acquired IPR&amp;D and SG&amp;A expenses does not include estimates associated with any potential future business development transactions, including collaborations, asset acquisitions and/or licensing of third-party intellectual property rights. The company does not provide guidance regarding its GAAP effective tax rate because it is unable to forecast with reasonable certainty the impact of excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation and the possibility of certain discrete items, which could be material.Vertex Pharmaceuticals IncorporatedConsolidated Statements of Operations(in millions, except per share amounts)(unaudited)Three Months Ended September 30,Nine Months Ended September 30,2022202120222021Revenues:Product revenues, net$2,334.3$1,984.1$6,628.0$5,500.8Other revenues———1.0Total revenues2,334.31,984.16,628.05,501.8Costs and expenses:Cost of sales289.4236.5797.0656.8Research and development expenses645.0467.01,846.21,370.0Acquired in-process research and development expenses (3)29.026.792.9986.8Selling, general and administrative expenses246.8198.2677.3584.9Change in fair value of contingent consideration(2.6)1.2(59.3)(1.1)Total costs and expenses1,207.6929.63,354.13,597.4Income from operations1,126.71,054.53,273.91,904.4Interest income46.21.158.63.7Interest expense(13.7)(15.2)(43.2)(46.4)Other income (expense), net17.242.4(133.7)(2.2)Income before provision for income taxes1,176.41,082.83,155.61,859.5Provision for income taxes245.9230.9652.5287.5Net income$930.5$851.9$2,503.1$1,572.0Net income per common share:Basic$3.63$3.30$9.78$6.08Diluted$3.59$3.28$9.68$6.03Shares used in per share calculations:Basic256.5257.9255.8258.7Diluted259.5259.7258.7260.9Vertex Pharmaceuticals IncorporatedReconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Net Income and Operating Income(in millions, except per share amounts)(unaudited)Three Months Ended September 30,Nine Months Ended September 30,2022202120222021GAAP net income$930.5$851.9$2,503.1$1,572.0Stock-based compensation expense135.6103.0379.8322.8(Increase) decrease in fair value of strategic investments(4)(16.7)(46.7)143.1(5.0)(Decrease) increase in fair value of contingent consideration (5)(2.6)1.2(59.3)(1.1)Intangible asset impairment charge (5)——13.0—Acquisition-related costs (6)29.72.935.38.5Total non-GAAP adjustments to pre-tax income *146.060.4511.9325.2Tax adjustments (1) *(37.1)(0.8)(138.0)(161.1)Non-GAAP net income *$1,039.4$911.5$2,877.0$1,736.1Net income per diluted common share:GAAP$3.59$3.28$9.68$6.03Non-GAAP *$4.01$3.51$11.12$6.66Shares used in diluted per share calculations:GAAP and Non-GAAP259.5259.7258.7260.9Three Months Ended September 30,Nine Months Ended September 30,2022202120222021GAAP operating income$1,126.7$1,054.5$3,273.9$1,904.4Stock-based compensation expense135.6103.0379.8322.8(Decrease) increase in fair value of contingent consideration (5)(2.6)1.2(59.3)(1.1)Intangible asset impairment charge (5)——13.0—Acquisition-related costs (6)29.72.935.38.5Non-GAAP operating income *$1,289.4$1,161.6$3,642.7$2,234.6Vertex Pharmaceuticals IncorporatedReconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Expenses(in millions, except percentages)(unaudited)Three Months Ended September 30,Nine Months Ended September 30,2022202120222021GAAP cost of sales$289.4$236.5$797.0$656.8Stock-based compensation expense(2.4)(1.6)(7.0)(4.6)Non-GAAP cost of sales$287.0$234.9$790.0$652.2GAAP research and development expenses$645.0$467.0$1,846.2$1,370.0Stock-based compensation expense(80.0)(61.0)(229.9)(196.4)Intangible asset impairment charge (5)——(13.0)—Acquisition-related costs (6)(16.5)(2.9)(22.1)(8.5)Non-GAAP research and development expenses *$548.5$403.1$1,581.2$1,165.1Acquired in-process research and development expenses *$29.0$26.7$92.9$986.8GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses$246.8$198.2$677.3$584.9Stock-based compensation expense(53.2)(40.4)(142.9)(121.8)Acquisition-related costs (6)(13.2)—(13.2)—Non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses$180.4$157.8$521.2$463.1Combined non-GAAP R&amp;D, Acquired IPR&amp;D and SG&amp;A expenses *$757.9$587.6$2,195.3$2,615.0GAAP other income (expense), net$17.2$42.4$(133.7)$(2.2)(Increase) decrease in fair value of strategic investments(4)(16.7)(46.7)143.1(5.0)Non-GAAP other income (expense), net$0.5$(4.3)$9.4$(7.2)GAAP provision for income taxes$245.9$230.9$652.5$287.5Tax adjustments (1) *37.10.8138.0161.1Non-GAAP provision for income taxes *$283.0$231.7$790.5$448.6GAAP effective tax rate21%21%21%15%Non-GAAP effective tax rate21%20%22%21%*Starting in the first quarter of 2022, Vertex no longer excludes research and development charges resulting from upfront or contingent milestone payments in connection with collaborations, asset acquisitions and/or licensing of third-party intellectual property rights from its Non-GAAP financial measures.

Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Vertex Pharmaceuticals What's The Estimated Valuation?We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$3.98bUS$4.59bUS$4.99bUS$5.45bUS$5.80bUS$6.09bUS$6.34bUS$6.56bUS$6.76bUS$6.95bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x7Analyst x6Analyst x5Analyst x5Est @ 6.34%Est @ 5.03%Est @ 4.12%Est @ 3.48%Est @ 3.03%Est @ 2.71% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 5.9% US$3.8kUS$4.1kUS$4.2kUS$4.3kUS$4.4kUS$4.3kUS$4.3kUS$4.2kUS$4.1kUS$3.9k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$41bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 5.9%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$6.9b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (5.9%– 2.0%) = US$182bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$182b÷ ( 1 + 5.9%)10= US$103bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$145b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$311, the company appears quite undervalued at a 45% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Vertex Pharmaceuticals as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 5.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.829. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Next Steps:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price?

(NYSE: MHK) today announced a 2022 third quarter net loss of $534 million and a diluted loss per share of $8.40, including the impact of non-cash impairment charges of $696 million. The Company’s current market capitalization along with challenging economic conditions and higher discount rates prompted a review of its goodwill and intangible asset balances, which resulted in the impairment charges. Adjusted net earnings were $212 million, and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) were $3.34, excluding impairment and other non-recurring charges. Net sales for the third quarter of 2022 were $2.9 billion, an increase of 3.6% as reported and 8.3% on a constant basis. For the third quarter of 2021, net sales were $2.8 billion, net earnings were $271 million and EPS was $3.93. Adjusted net earnings were $272 million, and adjusted EPS was $3.95, excluding restructuring, acquisition, and other charges.For the nine months ended October 1, 2022, net loss and loss per share were $8 million and $0.13, respectively, including the impact of the non-cash impairment charges noted above. Adjusted net earnings excluding impairment and other non-recurring charges were $739 million and adjusted EPS was $11.56. For the 2022 nine-month period, net sales were $9.1 billion, an increase of 7.7% versus prior year as reported or 12.1% on a constant basis. For the nine-month period ending October 2, 2021, net sales were $8.4 billion, net earnings were $844 million and EPS was $12.11; excluding restructuring, acquisition and other charges, adjusted net earnings and EPS were $828 million and $11.89, respectively.Commenting on Mohawk Industries’ third quarter performance, Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum, Chairman and CEO, stated, “Mohawk’s third quarter sales increased primarily from price increases and strength in the commercial sector. Our sales were weaker than we anticipated, as the retail channel softened across all regions and product categories. The strengthening U.S. dollar also negatively impacted our translated sales by $117 million or 4.1%. Our operating income declined as lower volume resulted in higher unabsorbed cost and material, energy and transportation inflation impacted our results. Our global organization responded to the economic challenges with additional actions to optimize cost, productivity and inventory levels.Story continues“Our businesses in Europe have been impacted more than others due to the unprecedented energy crisis and high inflation that has slowed the region’s economy. Our costs have continued to rise, and our pricing in Europe has not kept up with the recent material and energy inflation, which has compressed our margins. The Italian government provided energy subsidies during the third quarter, and additional actions from both the European Union and individual countries are being discussed. The high cost of energy has forced European consumers to concentrate on necessities and defer discretionary purchases. Our sales and margins in the market will remain under pressure until the region overcomes these challenges. These postponed purchases will increase demand when the economy rebounds and enhance our results.“The U.S. is being impacted by high overall inflation and mortgage rates that have risen from below 3% to approximately 7%. The residential market, which is the most significant part of our business, is expected to decline further before we see an inflection point. Remodeling has slowed, and our product mix has been impacted as consumers trade down to options that fit their budgets. It is estimated that the U.S. has a housing deficit of five million units, and more than half of U.S. homes are over 50 years old. Remodeling investments are expected to grow long term as U.S. housing stock ages and families with low mortgage rates choose to remain in their homes.“While we manage through current conditions, we are also investing in our business for the long term. We are expanding our capacity in growing product categories, including LVT, laminate, quartz countertops and premium ceramic and insulation. We have recently completed a number of smaller strategic acquisitions that will enhance our current product offering and leverage our existing market positions. In Europe, these include a sheet vinyl business, a mezzanine flooring company and a wood veneer plant. In the U.S., we acquired a non-woven flooring producer and a flooring accessories company. “In the third quarter, our Global Ceramic Segment’s net sales were $1.1 billion, an increase of 9.8% as reported and 12.4% on a constant basis. The Segment’s operating margin was negative 51.0%, including the impact of a non-cash goodwill impairment charge and higher inflation, partially offset by pricing and mix improvements and productivity. Excluding the impact of the impairment and restructuring charges, the Segment’s adjusted operating margin was 12.1%. The Segment delivered the strongest operating performance during the quarter, even with substantial inflation headwinds in Europe. Sales in the new home construction channel were solid in most geographies, and the commercial channel showed resilience with new construction and remodeling projects continuing. In most markets, residential remodeling has slowed due to tightening consumer discretionary spending and higher interest rates. Sales in our U.S. ceramic business expanded during the quarter, and we are gaining support with our new higher-margin introductions that are an alternative to European imports. Our countertop sales grew during the quarter, led by our high-end quartz collections. Our European ceramic results exceeded our expectations due to our sales and pricing actions, positive mix and Italian energy subsidies. Sales of our premium collections remained strong, while increased gas prices impacted sales of our outdoor and lower-end products. In our other ceramic markets, sales grew primarily through pricing, mix and strength in the commercial channels. All businesses are reducing production in the fourth quarter, which will increase our costs.“For the quarter, our Flooring Rest of the World segment’s net sales were $0.7 billion, a decrease of 4.8% as reported or an increase of 9.4% on a constant basis. The Segment’s operating margin was 6.2% as a result of higher inflation, temporary manufacturing shutdowns and lower volumes, partially offset by product mix improvements. The Segment’s adjusted operating margin was 8.5%, excluding the impact of restructuring activities and the impairment of certain intangible assets. The Segment’s sales rose primarily from price increases and growth in our panels, insulation and Oceania businesses. The Segment’s sales are mostly residential and were more impacted by constrained consumer spending. The retail sector is reducing inventories, and consumers are trading down in all categories. Our margins were compressed by inflation, lower sales volume and reduced production. The weakening markets are making additional price increases more difficult to implement. As flooring sales softened, we increased promotional activity to encourage consumers to trade up. While our premium laminate and LVT faced greater pressures, sales of our more value-oriented sheet vinyl grew. We have completed the acquisition of a small Polish sheet vinyl producer that will expand our business in central and eastern Europe. New building projects in western Europe are beginning to slow, and we are enhancing our insulation distribution by expanding our customer base and exports. Our insulation selling prices were slightly behind inflation, and our panels results weakened as demand softened and competition intensified. The French panels plant we acquired last year is increasing sales, and we have improved its productivity and operating expenses. We expanded distribution of our higher end decorative panels and acquired a small German mezzanine flooring company that will bolt on to our existing business. The Australian market is improving as the country relaxes COVID restrictions and New Zealand is more difficult with residential sales weakening.“In the quarter, our Flooring North America Segment’s net sales were $1.1 billion, an increase of 3.7% as reported, and the Segment’s operating margin was 5.9% as a result of higher inflation, lower volumes and temporary manufacturing shutdowns, partially offset by pricing and mix improvements and productivity. The Segment’s adjusted operating margin was 8.0%, excluding the impact of restructuring, acquisition and integration-related costs and the impairment of certain intangible assets. The Segment’s sales increased primarily from pricing, with hard surface products outperforming due to our investments in premium laminate and LVT. The residential market softened as inflation impacted consumer discretionary spending, and retailers reduced their inventories. Our pricing actions offset material and energy inflation, though lower manufacturing volumes led to unfavorable absorption. We are implementing our restructuring plans to lower both our fixed and variable costs by shutting higher cost assets, reducing staffing and aligning production with demand. Our resilient sales continued to improve, with our strongest performance in the new home construction, multifamily and commercial channels. Sheet vinyl sales strengthened as inflation has increased interest in value-oriented flooring options. The first phase of our new West Coast LVT plant is operating at planned output levels, and additional lines will be installed throughout next year. Demand for our premium laminate continued to grow as a high performing, value alternative to other flooring. We have commitments to saturate our current laminate capacity and have initiated further expansion investments. Market conditions for carpet softened in the third quarter more than we had anticipated, and we reduced production, resulting in unabsorbed costs. In the second quarter, we announced carpet price increases that were implemented in the third quarter as inflation continued to rise. With demand softening, we were not able to increase prices further to recover the inflation after the announcement. We are seeing reductions in raw material costs that should align with our current pricing when our higher cost inventory is depleted. Our commercial business remains good, and the Architectural Billing Index reflects continued construction activity. Our commercial margins were strong as pricing and mix covered our inflation in the quarter. We have acquired a small rubber manufacturer that produces trim primarily used in commercial flooring installations. Sales in our rug business were lower than last year as major national retailers continued to adjust inventories. In July, we acquired a non-woven rug and carpet business, and the integration is delivering synergies.“It is challenging to predict either the duration of the current economic conditions or their impact on our industry. As central banks around the world continue to raise interest rates and inflation reduces discretionary expenditures, we expect our businesses to remain under pressure. Residential remodeling drives a majority of our sales, and consumers are deferring purchases and trading down. In Europe, gas and electricity prices are reducing demand and increasing our manufacturing and material costs. We anticipate that governments in Europe will take actions to lower the impact on the economy, businesses and consumers. We are focused on managing through the current environment while investing to maximize our long-term profitability. We anticipate demand will slow further in the fourth quarter, and we will reduce production, resulting in greater unabsorbed overhead. To enhance sales, we are increasing promotional activity, introducing differentiated collections and reacting to competitive actions. We are executing restructuring actions, lowering administrative and manufacturing costs and reducing investments in marketing and advertising. Material prices spiked in the period and have begun softening in many categories. In Europe, flooring projects are being deferred and compressing industry volumes; at the same time, we are raising inventories of specific products ahead of expected higher energy costs this winter. After our second quarter U.S. pricing announcement, we incurred peak carpet material costs that will compress our margins until they flow through our inventory. We are postponing capital projects that do not impact our long-term strategies, while completing those that are critical to the near-term performance of our business. Finally, we expect the strengthening U.S. dollar will continue to reduce our translated results. Given these factors, we anticipate our fourth quarter adjusted EPS to be $1.40 to $1.50, excluding any restructuring or other one-time charges.“During past decades, Mohawk has successfully managed through many challenging periods and industry recessions. The fundamentals of our business remain strong, and flooring remains an essential component of all new construction and remodeling. Mohawk has built leading positions in key markets around the globe with well-known brands and an extensive product offering. During this period, we are investing for the market rebound that always occurs after our industry contracts. We are expanding our higher growth categories of LVT, laminate, quartz countertops, premium ceramic and insulation which will increase our revenue and profitability with the next growth cycle. We have also made strategic acquisitions that bolt on to our businesses and create significant synergies that will enhance the combined results. Mohawk has a strong balance sheet with low net debt leverage of 1.2 times EBITDA and available liquidity exceeding $1.8 billion to manage through the current environment and optimize the long-term results.”ABOUT MOHAWK INDUSTRIESMohawk Industries is the leading global flooring manufacturer that creates products to enhance residential and commercial spaces around the world.

473,5f8b9e60-65f9-3dff-b8b8-e5a60fada258,INCY,2022-10-28,Incyte (INCY) to Report Q3 Earnings: What's in the Cards?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/incyte-incy-report-q3-earnings-170805716.html,1666890485,STORY,"['INCY', 'NVS']","[Incyte Corporation INCY is scheduled to release its third-quarter 2022 results on Nov 1, before market open.The company’s earnings surprise history has been dismal so far, with its earnings beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters and missing on the other two occasions, the average negative surprise being 2.13%. In the last reported quarter, Incyte beat earnings by 27.8%.Shares of Incyte have risen 0.3% in the year so far against the industry’s decline of 24.5%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s see how things are shaping up for the quarter to be reported.Factors at PlayIncyte primarily derives product revenues from sales of its lead drug, Jakafi (ruxolitinib), in the United States as well as its other marketed drugs.Patient demand for Jakafi, a first-in-class JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor, in all approved indications (polycythemia vera, myelofibrosis and refractory acute graft-versus-host disease [GvHD]) increased 13% year over year in the second quarter. The trend is likely to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Jakafi’s sales stands at $617 million.Incyte also earns product royalty revenues from Novartis AG (NVS) for the commercialization of Jakafi in ex-U.S. markets. Novartis licensed ruxolitinib from Incyte for development and commercialization outside the United States.Jakafi is marketed by Incyte in the United States and is marketed as Jakavi by Novartis outside the country. Jakavi sales, as recorded by Novartis, were up 4% in the third quarter, and hence, Incyte is likely to have received higher royalties from NVS in the third quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is $96 million.Incyte also receives royalties from the sales of Tabrecta (capmatinib), which is approved for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. Novartis has exclusive worldwide development and commercialization rights to Tabrecta.Story continuesWhile Jakafi’s sales and royalties are key catalysts for the company’s revenue growth, Iclusig’s sales and Olumiant’s royalties from Eli Lilly are likely to have contributed to the top line. Hence, these are likely to have aided the company’s revenues in the to-be-reported quarter.Iclusig’s net product revenues were down year over year in the previous quarter and a similar trend is likely to have been witnessed by INCY in the to-be-reported quarter.Incremental sales from newly approved drugs like Opzelura are also likely to have added to sales in the third quarter. The adoption of other newly approved drugs like Monjuvi is also a positive and is likely to have boosted sales in the third quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Opzelura is $31 million.Total costs and expenses increased 16.3% year over year in the second quarter and the same is likely to have increased in the third quarter due to a rise in R&amp;D, selling, general and administrative expenses.Key Pipeline UpdatesIn August 2022, the FDA approved Pemazyre (pemigatinib), a selective fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) inhibitor, for the treatment of adults with relapsed or refractory myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms (MLNs) with FGFR1 rearrangement. MLNs with FGFR1 rearrangement are extremely rare and aggressive blood cancers that may affect less than 1 in 100,000 people in the United States.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Incyte this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. That is not the case here, as you will see below. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Earnings ESP: Earnings ESP for Incyte is -11.65% as the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at 74 cents per share and the Most Accurate Estimate is currently pegged at 65 cents per share.Zacks Rank: INCY currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.Incyte Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Incyte Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseIncyte Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Incyte Corporation QuoteStocks to ConsiderHere are some drug and biotech stocks you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this season.Editas Medicine EDIT has an Earnings ESP of +3.47% and a Zacks Rank of 2.

ELF, Monarch Casino &amp; Resort MCRI, Incyte INCY and Hubbell HUBB.4 Top-Rated Stocks to Buy Now for Solid Earnings GrowthEarnings growth is the highest priority for the top brass of any organization. This is because if the company doesn't make money, it won't last over the long haul. Moreover, earnings growth is the most important variable influencing the share price.Study a company's revenues over a given period, subtract the cost of production, and you have earnings. But, expectations of earnings also play a significant role.Earnings Estimates &amp; Share Price MovementsOften, we have seen a decline in the stock price despite earnings growth and a rally in price following an earnings decline. This is largely the result of a company's earnings failing to meet market expectations.Earnings estimates embody analysts' opinion on factors such as sales growth, product demand, competitive industry environment, profit margins and cost control. Thus, earnings estimates serve as a valuable tool while making investment decisions. Earnings estimates also help analysts assess the cash flow to determine the fair value of a firm.Investors should, thus, be on the lookout for stocks that are ready to make a big move. Hence, it is important for investors to buy stocks that have historical earnings growth and are seeing a rise in quarterly and annual earnings estimates.The above criteria narrowed down the universe of around 7,839 stocks to only 17. Here are the top four stocks that stand out:e.l.f. Beauty, Inc. operates as a cosmetic company. ELF's expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 7.1%.

However, sales declined from the year-ago quarter’s figure and lagged the consensus mark.For 2022, OTIS expects adjusted net sales to be within $13.4-$13.5 billion, lower than the $13.6-$13.8 billion projected earlier.

Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Weyerhaeuser: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock.

The company still expects full year 2022 Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $325 million and now expects basis as a percentage of real estate sales to be 35 to 40 percent for the full year.WOOD PRODUCTSFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS20222022(millions)Q2Q3ChangeNet sales$2,341$1,767$(574)Net contribution to pretax earnings$863$344$(519)Adjusted EBITDA$912$395$(517)Q3 2022 Performance – Sales realizations for lumber and oriented strand board decreased 28 percent and 41 percent, respectively, compared with second quarter averages. Sales and production volumes for lumber were moderately lower, largely due to the work stoppage at our mills in Washington and Oregon that commenced in mid-September. Unit manufacturing costs were higher, and log costs were moderately lower. Sales and production volumes for oriented strand board were slightly lower due to downtime for planned annual maintenance and transportation challenges in Canada. Unit manufacturing costs were higher, and fiber costs were comparable. Sales realizations were higher for most engineered wood products, while sales and production volumes were lower for most products due to downtime for planned annual maintenance, transportation challenges in Canada and labor constraints. Unit manufacturing costs for engineered wood products were higher, and raw material costs were significantly lower, primarily for oriented strand board webstock.Q4 2022 Outlook – Weyerhaeuser anticipates fourth quarter earnings and Adjusted EBITDA will be lower than third quarter 2022, excluding the effect of changes in average sales realizations for lumber and oriented strand board. For lumber, the company expects significantly lower log costs, partially offset by lower sales volumes resulting from the work stoppage at our mills in Washington and Oregon. For oriented strand board, the company anticipates slightly higher sales volumes, comparable fiber costs, and significantly lower unit manufacturing costs due to less downtime for planned annual maintenance. Sales volumes and realizations are expected to be lower for most engineered wood products, partially offset by significantly lower raw material costs, primarily for oriented strand board webstock. For distribution, the company expects lower sales volumes and realizations for most products.ABOUT WEYERHAEUSERWeyerhaeuser Company, one of the world's largest private owners of timberlands, began operations in 1900.

Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. In light of that, when we looked at Stryker (NYSE:SYK) and its ROCE trend, we weren't exactly thrilled.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Stryker:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.11 = US$3.6b ÷ (US$36b - US$4.4b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2022).So, Stryker has an ROCE of 11%.  In absolute terms, that's a satisfactory return, but compared to the Medical Equipment industry average of 9.3% it's much better. Check out our latest analysis for Stryker roceIn the above chart we have measured Stryker's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.What Can We Tell From Stryker's ROCE Trend?On the surface, the trend of ROCE at Stryker doesn't inspire confidence. Over the last five years, returns on capital have decreased to 11% from 15% five years ago. On the other hand, the company has been employing more capital without a corresponding improvement in sales in the last year, which could suggest these investments are longer term plays. It may take some time before the company starts to see any change in earnings from these investments.The Bottom Line On Stryker's ROCETo conclude, we've found that Stryker is reinvesting in the business, but returns have been falling. Since the stock has gained an impressive 56% over the last five years, investors must think there's better things to come. Ultimately, if the underlying trends persist, we wouldn't hold our breath on it being a multi-bagger going forward.Story continuesSince virtually every company faces some risks, it's worth knowing what they are, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for Stryker   (of which 1 is a bit concerning!) that you should know about.While Stryker isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

It is one of the largest medical device manufacturers with a track record of consistently outgrowing its end markets and competitors. Stryker has a highly performance driven culture with a decentralized operating model that results in strong incentive alignment within the company. We believe the management team has executed well, making small but meaningful decisions that have positioned the firm well among competitors. Management operates with a market share gain mentality and strives to be a category leader in the market they are in. Stryker also benefits from its broad portfolio of surgical tools, small and large cap hospital equipment, waste management products, etc., which enables it to address all the needs of a hospital operating room and be a one-stop shop for health care facilities. This is particularly appealing to hospitals, and it positions Stryker to be the supplier of all operating room equipment versus a single product, thus enabling the company to gain market share.""smart.art/Shutterstock.comStory continuesStryker Corporation (NYSE:SYK) is not on our list of 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds.

These increases were partially offset by unfavorable changes in government rates due to the reinstatement of 2% Medicare sequestration as of July 1, 2022, as well as a decrease in commercial mix. The year to date change was primarily driven by an increase in commercial mix and rate, an increase in the Medicare base rate in 2022, and the continued shift to Medicare Advantage plans, partially offset by the reinstatement of 1% Medicare sequestration in each of the second and third quarters of 2022.Patient care costs: The quarter change was primarily due to increases in compensation expenses, health benefit expenses, medical supply costs, other direct operating expenses associated with our dialysis centers, as well as costs related to travel, professional fees and center closures, as described below. These increases were partially offset by decreases in insurance expense and pharmaceutical costs. The year to date change was primarily due to increases in compensation expenses, other direct operating expenses associated with our dialysis centers, including increases in utilities expense, insurance expenses, center closure costs, as described below, and travel expenses. In addition, our fixed other direct operating expenses negatively impacted patient care costs per treatment due to decreased treatments in 2022. These year to date increases were partially offset by decreases in pharmaceutical costs, health benefit expenses and professional fees.General and administrative: The quarter change was primarily due to gains recognized in the second quarter of 2022 on the sale of our self-developed properties, increased closure costs, as described below, as well as increases in compensation expense, and contract wages due to the deployment of IT projects. Other drivers of the increase include increased professional fees and travel costs. The year to date change was primarily due to increases in advocacy costs to counter union policy efforts, compensation expenses, travel costs, and closure costs, as described below. These year to date increases were partially offset by the gains on sale, as described above, and decreases in professional fees and contributions to our charitable foundation.Share repurchases: During the three months ended September 30, 2022, we repurchased 2.1 million shares of our common stock for $185 million, at an average cost of $87.10 per share.Subsequent to September 30, 2022 through October 27, 2022, we did not repurchase any shares.Financial and operating metrics: Three months endedSeptember 30,Twelve months endedSeptember 30,2022202120222021Cash flow:(dollars in millions)Operating cash flow$ 711$ 567$ 1,751$ 1,886Free cash flow(1)$ 500$ 358$ 1,032$ 1,054_____________________(1)For definitions of non-GAAP financial measures, see the note titled ""Note on Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" and related reconciliations beginning on page 17.Three months ended September 30, 2022Nine months endedSeptember 30, 2022Effective income tax rate on:Income20.5 %20.0 %Income attributable to DaVita Inc.(1)28.7 %24.9 %_____________________(1)For definitions of non-GAAP financial measures, see the note titled ""Note on Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" and related reconciliations beginning on page 17.Center activity: As of September 30, 2022, we provided dialysis services to a total of approximately 243,800 patients at 3,128 outpatient dialysis centers, of which 2,776 centers were located in the United States and 352 centers were located in 11 countries outside of the United States. During the third quarter of 2022, we acquired five dialysis centers, opened a total of six new dialysis centers and closed 44 dialysis centers in the United States. We also acquired three dialysis centers, opened three dialysis centers and closed three dialysis centers outside of the United States during the third quarter of 2022.Integrated kidney care (IKC): As of September 30, 2022, we had approximately 43,000 patients in risk-based integrated care arrangements representing approximately $3.3 billion in annualized medical spend. We also had an additional 12,000 patients in other integrated care arrangements; we do not include the medical spend for these patients in this annualized medical spend estimate. See additional description of these metrics at Note 2.Certain items impacting the quarter:Closure costs. During the third quarter of 2022, we incurred higher than normal charges for center capacity closures. These closures are the result of a strategic review of our outpatient clinic capacity requirements and utilization, which have been impacted both by declines in our patient census in some markets due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as by our initiatives toward, and advances in, increasing the proportion of our home dialysis patients.Our third quarter charges for U.S. dialysis center closures were approximately $40 million, which increased our patient care costs by $7 million, our general and administrative expenses by $12 million and our depreciation and amortization expense by $21 million. These capacity closures costs included net losses on assets retired, lease costs, asset impairments and accelerated depreciation and amortization.Advocacy costs: During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, we incurred advocacy costs of approximately $28 million and $51 million respectively to counter union policy efforts, including a California ballot initiative. These costs are included in the U.S. dialysis segment's general and administrative expense.Outlook:The following forward-looking measures and the underlying assumptions involve significant known and unknown risks and uncertainties, including those described below, and actual results may vary materially from these forward-looking measures. For example, the widespread impact of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to generate significant risk and uncertainty, and as a result, our future results could vary materially from the guidance provided below.

(Irfan Khan / Los Angeles Times)A good rule of thumb for assessing the value of a business is to look at how much its owners will spend to defend it from regulations. By that measure, the dialysis business is very valuable indeed.We can determine that from the money the two leading companies in the field are spending to defeat Proposition 29 in next month's election.The companies are Denver-based DaVita and the German firm Fresenius Medical Care, which together own about 75% of the 650 licensed dialysis clinics in California.The medical evidence has been completely overwhelmed by the drive for profits.Samuel Dickman, healthcare researcherThey have contributed about $80 million of the $86 million raised thus far to oppose Proposition 29; a third, much smaller firm, U.S. Renal Care, contributed almost all the rest.That's on top of the $96.6 million the top two firms spent to defeat Proposition 23 in 2020 and the $102.6 million they spent to defeat Proposition 8 in 2018.Those measures were very similar to Proposition 29; all three were placed on the ballot by the Service Employees International Union, which has been trying to unionize dialysis workers. In each of those years, DaVita and Fresenius accounted for about 92% of the spending to oppose the measures.Proposition 29 would require every dialysis clinic to have at least one healthcare professional — doctor, nurse practitioner or physician assistant — on-site during treatment hours. It would require clinics to report infection-related data to state authorities, to disclose their owners and to obtain consent from the state Department of Public Health before shutting down or reducing services. Violations could cost up to $100,000 each.The underlying concern addressed by Proposition 29 (and its earlier iterations) is that treatment at for-profit clinics such as those owned or operated by DaVita and Fresenius is being compromised by the profit motive.Studies have documented that for-profit clinics generally have had lower staffing levels than not-for-profit facilities, lower rates of referrals for kidney transplants — the option with the best outcomes for patients — and higher usage of drugs that bring higher profits but also carry higher stroke and death rates.Story continues""If we were paying attention to the evidence, there would be major policy changes to address what is a life-or-death situation for thousands of patients each year,"" says Samuel Dickman, a co-author of a 2020 survey that showed that patients at for-profit dialysis clinics had a 7% higher mortality rate per year than those at nonprofit facilities.The discrepancy means that 3,800 deaths might be averted annually if for-profit mortality rates matched those of nonprofit facilities, the survey calculated.""The medical evidence has been completely overwhelmed by the drive for profits,"" Dickman says.The dominance of DaVita and Fresenius in this field can't be overstated. Their more than 5,300 outpatient clinics are estimated to account for about 60% of all U.S. facilities. They are estimated to serve 85% of all patients with end-stage kidney disease and collect 90% of the industry's profits.The No on 29 campaign, to which DaVita and Fresenius referred my requests for comment, says the staffing mandate is unnecessary and so costly that hundreds of clinics would be forced to close if it passes. (That's according to a study the dialysis companies commissioned from Berkeley Research Group, a research-for-hire firm.)Given the implication in the campaign's TV commercials that so many dialysis clinics function on the knife-edge of insolvency that the initiative would deprive thousands of kidney disease patients of access to this lifesaving procedure, you might wonder how the companies can afford the No on 29 campaign. Easy: It costs a tiny fraction of their profits.DaVita earned $1.8 billion in operating profits on $11.6 billion in revenue last year, for a healthy profit margin of about 15%, about the same margin it made in each of the two previous years.Fresenius earned about $1.66 billion on North American revenue of $12.2 billion last year, for a margin of 13.6%; the previous year its profits came to about 17% of sales in North America.DaVita has another deep pocket it might be able to pick in a pinch: Billionaire Warren Buffett owns 38% of the company through his Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate, according to DaVita's most recent proxy statement.The DaVita-Fresenius duopoly in outpatient dialysis has raised concerns among healthcare experts for years. Before examining how it affects patient health, let's look at how it came about.As I've reported before, short of a kidney transplant, dialysis is the only life-preserving option for people with end-stage renal disease. That's a condition in which the kidneys have shut down, often because of diabetes or chronic high blood pressure. Patients must undergo dialysis, in which their blood is circulated through a filter to remove waste products, several times a week for hours each time.Dialysis is so expensive — it can cost as much as $150,000 annually per patient — that in the days before the Affordable Care Act, patients couldn’t get insurance. As a result, Congress in 1973 allowed renal patients to enroll in Medicare at any age. That effectively made end-stage renal disease the only condition in America subject to a single-payer program. (Some are also covered by Medicaid.)Combined with the rapid increase in diabetes, hypertension and other underlying conditions, the federal program turned dialysis into a hugely profitable business. About 10,000 patients were covered in 1973; today, more than 470,000 are. Federal spending has soared to about $51 billion a year in 2019 from $1.1 billion (in current dollars) in 1973.DaVita and Fresenius have been big beneficiaries of these trends. The Affordable Care Act was a major boon for the companies because it prohibited private insurers in the individual market from rejecting dialysis patients.Medicare pays about $250 per patient treatment; at three treatments per week, that might yield about $39,000 a year for a Medicare enrollee. But private insurers have been charged $1,000 to $2,000 per treatment, or $156,000 to $312,000 a year.Allegations soon surfaced from insurance companies and shareholders that the dialysis firms were ""steering"" patients away from Medicare and persuading them to sign up for private health plans instead. (The firms deny this.) DaVita settled a shareholder lawsuit over the alleged scheme for $135 million in 2020 without admitting guilt.Suspicions focused on the American Kidney Fund, which describes itself as, among other things, a charity helping kidney patients pay premiums for private insurance coverage and other treatment-related costs. Judging from its financial disclosures, however, the fund resembles an arm of DaVita and Fresenius, which have contributed well more than 80% of its annual revenues in recent years.Lawmakers and healthcare experts have found that relationship disturbing, because the fund's premium assistance has arguably made it easier for patients to give up their Medicare coverage and enroll with private health plans.The money trail is intriguing, to say the least: DaVita and Fresenius are the principal financial backers of a charity that helps patients sign up for insurance that puts more money in the firms' pockets. The fund says it does not steer patients to any particular insurance coverage.The steering allegations are troubling because private insurance plans are the wrong choice for many patients, in part because the American Kidney Fund cuts off premium grants to patients soon after they receive a kidney transplant. That can leave patients unable to afford health insurance, a critical issue for transplant patients.""Horrifically, this impacts the country’s most underserved patients the most, further contributing to the kidney transplant disparity that already exists in this country and is a public health crisis,"" social worker Teri Browne, a former DaVita and Fresenius employee, told the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services at a hearing in 2016.The issue led to a separate regulatory effort in California. This was AB 290, a law signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom in 2019. The measure barred dialysis clinics from steering patients toward any particular coverage type and capped reimbursement at the Medicare rate for any patients receiving third-party financial assistance, such as that provided by the American Kidney Fund.The fund tried to strong-arm Newsom into vetoing the bill by telling its grantees that it would be pulling out of the state if he signed it; he wasn't swayed. After he signed, the fund and others sued. A federal judge blocked the law in December 2019. The case is still pending.That brings us to the question of the quality of treatments provided by the for-profit dialysis industry.A 2019 study attributed the lower rates of access to transplantation among patients at for-profit clinics to factors such as less time that nephrologists at those clinics spend with patients and less counseling about transplantation — even though federal regulations require all dialysis facilities to ""provide transplant education and help interested patients pursue kidney transplantation,"" the study said.Another study by researchers at Brigham Young and Duke universities that tracked the acquisitions of 1,200 independent clinics by large chains over a 12-year period ending in 2010 found a sharp increase in the use of erythropoetin, an anti-anemia drug that carries a high Medicare reimbursement rate but higher health hazards, after clinics were acquired.The large-chain acquirers also replaced high-skilled nurses with lower-skilled technicians, the study found. Patient loads per employee increased by 11.7% and the number of patients treated at each station increased by 4.5%, ""stretching resources and potentially reducing the quality of care,"" the paper reported.Patients at acquired clinics were 4.2% more likely to be hospitalized in any given month and ""8.5% less likely to receive a kidney transplant or to be added to a transplant waiting list during their first year on dialysis.""DaVita and Fresenius want you to think that Proposition 29 is nothing but an attempt by the SEIU to ""extort"" the firms into agreeing to unionization. That's a smokescreen that obscures questions involving the quality of care for kidney patients caught up in the firms' unimpeded march to domination of this highly profitable treatment field.Medical studies suggest that having more and better-trained staff, including unionized staff, produces better patient outcomes at facilities such as nursing homes. Is there any reason to think the same wouldn't be true at dialysis clinics?As DaVita and Fresenius grow even more dominant, they'll have ever more power to dictate the level of care their patients receive. The profit motive will become only stronger, and the only force standing in its way will be voters, at the ballot box.This story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.]"

While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis maker of motion and control products is expected to post quarterly earnings of $4.15 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -2.6%.Revenues are expected to be $3.92 billion, up 4.3% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.06% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Parker-Hannifin?For Parker-Hannifin, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.02%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Parker-Hannifin will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Parker-Hannifin would post earnings of $4.67 per share when it actually produced earnings of $5.16, delivering a surprise of +10.49%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Parker-Hannifin doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAmong the stocks in the Zacks Manufacturing - General Industrial industry, Ingersoll Rand (IR) is soon expected to post earnings of $0.59 per share for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +3.5%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $1.45 billion, up 9.5% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Ingersoll has been revised 1.6% lower over the last 30 days to the current level.

Financial Measures"" for a discussion of the Company's use of non-GAAP financial measures and Table 2, Table 3 and Table 4 for reconciliations of these measures to the nearest GAAP measures.  ""Identified items"" include adjustments for lower of cost or market (""LCM""), impairments and refinery exit costs.LyondellBasell Industries (NYSE: LYB) today announced net income for the third quarter 2022 of $572 million, or $1.75 per share.  Third quarter 2022 EBITDA was $1.1 billion, or $1.2 billion excluding identified items.  During the quarter, the company recognized identified items of $70 million, net of tax, related to the costs incurred in connection with exiting the refining business that impacted earnings by $0.21 per share.Story continues""LyondellBasell's high cash conversion and strong balance sheet enable our company to confidently navigate challenging markets while continuing to prioritize returns for our shareholders,"" said Peter Vanacker, LyondellBasell Chief Executive Officer.During the third quarter, higher energy costs, new supply and weaker markets pressured global petrochemical margins.  Global demand for LyondellBasell's products utilized in consumer packaging remained stable, but demand from durable goods markets softened.  In Europe, olefins, polyolefins and intermediate chemicals markets encountered significantly higher energy costs and weak demand.  In response to these challenging conditions, the company postponed the restart of its ethylene cracker in France until the first quarter 2023 and reduced operating rates across its global asset base to match lower demand.  In China, markets remained weak due to zero-COVID measures and tepid growth.  In North America, new supply and inventory destocking led to declines in polyolefins prices.  The impacts of higher energy, raw material, labor and transportation costs were also visible in Advanced Polymers Solutions results.  LyondellBasell's oxyfuels and refining businesses continued to earn margins above historical averages.  The company proactively managed working capital and optimized asset utilization to deliver high cash conversion and provide strong shareholder returns.LyondellBasell generated $1.4 billion in cash from operating activities during the quarter.  The company remains committed to a disciplined approach to capital allocation.  In the third quarter, approximately $440 million was reinvested in the businesses and more than $550 million was returned to shareholders through the quarterly dividend and share repurchases.""In September, we made changes to our organizational structure and Executive Committee, which includes a new Circular and Low Carbon Solutions business unit to accelerate our leadership in sustainability and serve growing customer demand for our Circulen products.  These strategic decisions helped set the foundation to drive our value enhancement program, which we expect will generate $750 million in recurring annual EBITDA improvement by the end of 2025.  We are positioning our organization to advance our strategic initiatives while enhancing our focus on value and agility,"" said Vanacker.OUTLOOK""LyondellBasell's diverse business portfolio, commercial agility, robust balance sheet and strong liquidity equip our company to navigate difficult environments.  With cost discipline in our DNA, we are increasing our focus on enhancing value through the cycle and remain committed to strong shareholder returns,"" said Vanacker.In October, demand from consumer packaging, oxyfuels and refining markets remains strong.  Nonetheless, persistent inflation and high energy costs coupled with weaker seasonal demand are likely to drive further margin compression across most of the company's businesses in the fourth quarter.  Challenging conditions are expected to continue in European and Asian markets.  To match the global demand outlook, LyondellBasell expects fourth quarter average operating rates of 75% for Olefins &amp; Polyolefins Americas assets, 60% for Olefins &amp; Polyolefins Europe assets and 75% for Intermediates &amp; Derivatives assets.  The company remains watchful for market improvements in China.""Our new organizational structure and value creation initiatives are well-timed to address current market conditions.  These actions are only the beginning of LyondellBasell's journey to increase our focus on value, agility and accountability through continuous improvement.  We will continue to share more information in the coming quarters and provide more clarity and focus around LyondellBasell's North Star strategy development,"" said Vanacker.CONFERENCE CALLLyondellBasell will host a conference call October 28 at 11 a.m. EDT.  Participants on

Actual results could differ materially based on factors including, but not limited to, market conditions, the business cyclicality of the chemical, polymers and refining industries; the availability, cost and price volatility of raw materials and utilities, particularly the cost of oil, natural gas, and associated natural gas liquids; uncertainties and impacts related to the extent and duration of the pandemic; competitive product and pricing pressures; labor conditions; our ability to attract and retain key personnel; operating interruptions (including leaks, explosions, fires, weather-related incidents, mechanical failure, unscheduled downtime, supplier disruptions, labor shortages, strikes, work stoppages or other labor difficulties, transportation interruptions, spills and releases and other environmental risks); the supply/demand balances for our and our joint ventures' products, and the related effects of industry production capacities and operating rates; our ability to manage costs; future financial and operating results; benefits and synergies of any proposed transactions; legal and environmental proceedings; tax rulings, consequences or proceedings; technological developments, and our ability to develop new products and process technologies; our ability to meet our sustainability goals, including the ability to operate safely, increase production of recycled and renewable-based polymers to meet our targets and forecasts, and reduce our emissions and achieve net zero emissions by the time set in our respective goals; our ability to procure energy from renewable sources; the successful shut down and closure of the Houston Refinery, including within the expected timeframe; our ability to successfully implement initiatives identified pursuant to our value enhancement program and generate anticipated earnings; potential governmental regulatory actions; political unrest and terrorist acts; risks and uncertainties posed by international operations, including foreign currency fluctuations; and our ability to comply with debt covenants and to repay our debt.  Additional factors that could cause results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements can be found in the ""Risk Factors"" section of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, which can be found at www.LyondellBasell.com on the Investor Relations page and on the Securities and Exchange Commission's website at www.sec.gov.  There is no assurance that any of the actions, events or results of the forward-looking statements will occur, or if any of them do, what impact they will have on our results of operations or financial condition.  Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they were made and are based on the estimates and opinions of management of LyondellBasell at the time the statements are made.  LyondellBasell does not assume any obligation to update forward-looking statements should circumstances or management's estimates or opinions change, except as required by law.This release contains time sensitive information that is accurate only as of the date hereof. Information contained in this release is unaudited and is subject to change.  We undertake no obligation to update the information presented herein except as required by law.INFORMATION RELATED TO FINANCIAL MEASURESThis release makes reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined in Regulation G of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.We report our financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, but believe that certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as EBITDA, and EBITDA, net income and diluted EPS exclusive of identified items provide useful supplemental information to investors regarding the underlying business trends and performance of the company's ongoing operations and are useful for period-over-period comparisons of such operations.  Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.We calculate EBITDA as income from continuing operations plus interest expense (net), provision for (benefit from) income taxes, and depreciation and amortization.  EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to profit or operating profit for any period as an indicator of our performance, or as an alternative to operating cash flows as a measure of our liquidity.  We also present EBITDA, net income and diluted EPS exclusive of identified items.  Identified items include adjustments for ""lower of cost or market"" (""LCM""), impairment and refinery exit costs.  Our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market.  Cost is determined using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) inventory valuation methodology, which means that the most recently incurred costs are charged to cost of sales and inventories are valued at the earliest acquisition costs.  Fluctuation in the prices of crude oil, natural gas and correlated products from period to period may result in the recognition of charges to adjust the value of inventory to the lower of cost or market in periods of falling prices and the reversal of those charges in subsequent interim periods, within the same fiscal year as the charge, as market prices recover.  Property, plant and equipment are recorded at historical costs.  If it is determined that an asset or asset group's undiscounted future cash flows will not be sufficient to recover the carrying amount, an impairment charge is recognized to write the asset down to its estimated fair value.  In April 2022 we announced our decision to cease operation of our Houston Refinery no later than the end of 2023.  In connection with exiting the refinery business, we began to incur costs primarily consisting of accelerated lease amortization costs, personnel related costs and depreciation of asset retirement costs.Return on invested capital is a measure commonly used by investors to evaluate the efficiency at which a company's capital is allocated to generate income during a particular period.  Return on invested capital means income from continuing operations, adjusted for interest expense, net of tax and items affecting comparability between periods divided by a two-year average of invested capital adjusted for items affecting comparability.These measures as presented herein, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies due to differences in the way the measures are calculated.  This release contains time sensitive information that is accurate only as of the time hereof.  Information contained in this release is unaudited and subject to change.LyondellBasell undertakes no obligation to update the information presented herein except to the extent required by law.Additional operating and financial information may be found on our website at www.LyondellBasell.com/investorrelations.  These measures as presented herein, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies due to differences in the way the measures are calculated.Table 2 -

The insurer delivered an earnings surprise in three of the last four quarters and missed in one, the average being 2.82%.Factors to NoteIn the third quarter, CINF’s property casualty premiums are likely to have gained from premium growth initiatives, increased property casualty agency new business written premiums, higher standard lines new business, higher premiums from Cincinnati Re.Net investment income in the to-be-reported quarter is likely to have benefited from strong cash flow from operating activities, and higher dividend income and interest income.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for investment income, net of expenses is pegged at $200 million, indicating an increase of 11.7% from the year-ago reported figure.

Britain's new prime minister selection is also likely to have boosted investors' confidence.Against this backdrop, an investor might feel encouraged to buy some stocks. However, before investing blindly in stocks that are offering high returns, one should be aware whether these returns are sustainable. To this end, we recommend stocks like Equinor, PBF Energy, Amalgamated Financial, Warrior Met Coal and Valero Energy, which bear low leverage and therefore can shield investors from incurring losses in times of crisis.Now, before selecting low-leverage stocks, let's explore what leverage is and how choosing a low-leverage stock helps investors.In finance, leverage is a term used to denote the practice of borrowing capital by companies to run their operations smoothly and expand the same. Such borrowings are done through debt financing. But there remains an option for equity finance. This is probably due to the cheap and easy availability of debt over equity financing.However, debt financing has its share of drawbacks. Particularly, it is desirable only as long as it successfully generates a higher rate of return compared to the interest rate. So, to avoid considerable losses in your portfolio, one should always avoid companies that resort to exorbitant debt financing.Therefore, the crux of safe investment lies in choosing a company that is not burdened with debt, as a debt-free stock is almost impossible to find.Such an event shows how volatile the equity market can be at times and as an investor if you don't want to lose big time, we suggest you invest in stocks, which bear low leverage and are hence less risky.Story continuesTo identify such stocks, historically several leverage ratios have been developed to measure the amount of debt a company bears and the debt-to-equity ratio is one of the most common ratios.Analyzing Debt/EquityDebt-to-Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities/Shareholders' EquityThis metric is a liquidity ratio that indicates the amount of financial risk a company bears. A lower debt-to-equity ratio reflects improved solvency for a company.With the third-quarter earnings cycle starting, investors must be eyeing stocks that have exhibited solid earnings growth in the recent past. But if a stock bears a high debt-to-equity ratio in times of economic downturn, its so-called booming earnings picture might turn into a nightmare.The Winning StrategyConsidering the aforementioned factors, it is prudent to choose stocks with a low debt-to-equity ratio to ensure steady returns.Yet, an investment strategy based solely on the debt-to-equity ratio might not fetch the desired outcome. To choose stocks that have the potential to give you steady returns, we have expanded our screening criteria to include some other factors.Excluding stocks that have a negative or a zero debt-to-equity ratio, here we present our five picks out of the 24 stocks that made it through the screen.Equinor: It is one of the premier integrated energy companies in the world, with operations spreading across 30 countries.

This compares to earnings of $1.02 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 2.11%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this vehicle components company would post earnings of $1.02 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.09, delivering a surprise of 6.86%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.LKQ , which belongs to the Zacks Automotive - Replacement Parts industry, posted revenues of $3.1 billion for the quarter ended September 2022, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.28%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $3.3 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.LKQ shares have lost about 11% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -19.6%.What's Next for LKQ?While LKQ has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for LKQ: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock.

This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 3. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis medical waste management company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.59 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +34.1%.Revenues are expected to be $670.27 million, up 3.3% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Stericycle?For Stericycle, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -4.55%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Stericycle will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Stericycle would post earnings of $0.43 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.48, delivering a surprise of +11.63%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors.

(Nasdaq: SRCL), a leading provider of regulated medical waste management, secure information destruction and patient engagement solutions, today announced the first project locations for its five year, $1 million partnership with the National Park Foundation. Stericycle's commitment will support wetland restoration efforts at the Timucuan Ecological and Historic Preserve in Jacksonville, Fla., as well as the Cumberland Island National Seashore in Saint Marys, Ga.Stericycle, Inc. (PRNewsfoto/Stericycle)The partnership between the National Park Foundation and Stericycle will support efforts to improve coastal resilience in both parks by implementing a nature-based solution known as a pervious oyster shell habitat (P.O.S.H). These constructed habitats will help provide an effective defense against the impacts of climate change, and the shorelines will benefit from decreased erosion, improved water quality and restored ecosystems.""Stericycle is proud to support the restoration of the wetland shorelines at the Timucuan Ecological and Historic Preserve and the Cumberland Island National Seashore to help fortify a healthier habitat and future for the wildlife that lives there,"" said Cindy J. Miller, president and chief executive officer at Stericycle. ""Every year, Stericycle safely and responsibly disposes of millions of pounds of medical waste and pharmaceuticals, ensuring they do not end up in our communities or waterways. This collaboration with the National Park Foundation further deepens our commitment to environmental stewardship and ensuring a more sustainable future.""Located just 20 minutes from downtown Jacksonville, Timucuan Ecological and Historic Preserve is an area of historic significance and natural beauty. The park consists of salt marshes and coastal dunes and is one of the last unspoiled coastal wetlands on the Atlantic coast. Timucuan Ecological and Historic Preserve has experienced increasingly strong storms and recreational activity that has impacted the shoreline and threatened the tidal habitats of three species of greatest conservation need, including scalloped hammerheads, sandbar sharks and American oystercatchers. Stericycle's support of the National Park Foundation will help protect the park's vital tidal habitats and surrounding ecosystems for future generations.Story continuesCumberland Island National Seashore is the largest of Georgia's Golden Isles and contains a diverse assemblage of ecosystems including pristine maritime forests, undeveloped beaches, and wide marshes. From sea turtles, wild turkeys, bobcats and armadillos to abundant shore birds, the 36,000+ acre park and its 18 miles of shoreline are full of rich biodiversity. Like Timucuan Ecological and Historic Preserve, the park's shoreline has been impacted by extreme weather events, high tides and increased boat recreation, which have contributed to erosion along the park's western coastline and requires intervention.""Healthy coastal wetland environments help filter water and reduce the destructive power of floods and storms, all while providing habitat for fish and wildlife and serving as major carbon sinks. We are excited to partner with Stericycle to restore and improve the parks' coastal resilience at Timucuan Ecological and Historic Preserve and Cumberland Island National Seashore,"" said Chad Jones, senior vice president, corporate partnerships at the National Park Foundation.

The quarterly results are likely to reflect growth in revenues and funds from operations (FFO) per share.In the last reported quarter, this New York-based real estate investment trust’s (REIT) FFO plus assumed conversions, as adjusted, surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5.06%. The quarterly results reflected better-than-anticipated top-line growth. The same-store net operating income (NOI) improved across its portfolio.Over the trailing four quarters, Vornado surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on three occasions and missed the mark in one, the average beat being 4.27%. This is depicted in the graph below.Vornado Realty Trust Price and EPS SurpriseVornado Realty Trust Price and EPS SurpriseVornado Realty Trust price-eps-surprise | Vornado Realty Trust QuoteFactors at PlayPer a Cushman &amp; Wakefield CWK report, the United States office market’s overall absorption continued to be negative even though office-using employment increased in the first three quarters of this year. Notably, on a four-quarter moving average basis, in third-quarter 2022, the U.S. office sector’s overall net absorption improved from negative 26 million square feet (msf) to negative 5.9 msf year over year.However, gross leasing activity has rebounded from its lows in first-quarter 2021. The four-quarter rolling total leasing has increased 45%. Also, third-quarter 2022 marked the third consecutive quarter wherein the four-quarter rolling total leasing was more than 350 msf.Vornado has a portfolio of premium assets in a few select high-rent, high-barrier-to-entry markets of New York, San Francisco and Chicago. We believe that the improving leasing scenario in the U. S. office real-estate market and the return-to-office policy implemented by many companies are likely to have driven the company’s rental revenues during the third quarter.  Also, with consumers’ increased preference for in-person shopping experience, the retail market is experiencing a rebound. This is likely to have aided the company’s Manhattan’s street retail performance during the to-be-reported quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues is pegged at $432.7 million, suggesting 5.8% growth from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Per the Cushman &amp; Wakefield report, vacancy at the national level was 17.8% as of the third-quarter end. For VNO, the rising supply of office properties is anticipated to have limited its ability to achieve high leasing potential in the third quarter.Further, in all likelihood, we expect the company to report higher interest expenses in the quarter on the back of rising interest rates. Higher rates might have also limited the company’s ability to purchase or develop real estate.VNO’s activities during the third quarter were not adequate to secure analyst confidence. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarterly FFO per share has been unchanged at 74 cents over the past month. Nonetheless, the same suggests a 4.2% increase from the prior-year period’s reported number.Story continuesEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively predict a positive surprise in terms of FFO per share for VNO this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — increases the odds of a beat. However, that’s not the case here.Earnings ESP: Vornado has an Earnings ESP of -0.05%.

I get it. Bearish topics don’t appeal organically, as do bullish ones. However, it’s also time for a reality check. You can have higher home prices or higher interest rates. You can’t have both.Indeed, the Fed already laid out the framework, committing to a hawkish monetary policy. Subsequently, the unwinding of the central bank’s balance sheet stoked higher borrowing rates. In turn, home prices started to fall. To really emphasize the point, Fortune labeled the downfall in certain regions as “stunning.” That’s the primary reason to consider real estate stocks to sell.The other: The so-called experts were ultimately inaccurate about the continuation of the housing market surge. A time-targeted Google search revealed that some experts believed higher mortgage rates would incentive buying homes now, thus raising the price. Others stated that 2022 home prices will keep rising at or near double digits. That’s probably not in the cards, meaning it’s time to consider real estate stocks to sell.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsZ  ZGZillow$28.88RDFNRedfin$3.86OPENOpendoor$2.28MTTRMatterport$3.30DHID.R. Horton$71.21KBHKB Home$27.55RKTRocket Companies$6.28Zillow (Z, ZG)The Zillow logo displayed on a web browser and magnified by a magnifying glassSource: II.studio / Shutterstock.comSince the beginning of 2022, both classes of shares of technology-driven real-estate marketplace company Zillow (NASDAQ:Z, NASDAQ:ZG) slipped over 50%. A hefty loss, it’s hardly a unique circumstance in this sector, thus sparking interest regarding real estate stocks to sell. Fundamentally, the case is simple. As mentioned above, you can have high prices or high rates. You can’t have both.Financially, Gurufocus.com identifies Zillow as a possible value trap. Sure, some metrics point to an enticing contrarian opportunity, such as the 50%-plus losses. As well, Zillow’s price-sales ratio of 0.67 times sits favorably below the median ratio of 2.3 times. However, these likely represent deceptive mathematical calculations that lack broader context.Story continuesCurrently, home prices remain historically high while mortgage rates stand above 7% for a 30-year fixed mortgage. Therefore, it’s not surprising that in the second quarter of 2022, Zillow’s revenue dropped 23% against the year-ago period. It’s more than likely going to fall further in the quarters ahead. Thus, Z and ZG represent real estate stocks to sell.Redfin (RDFN)The redfin logo displayed on a for sale sign. RDFN stockSource: ShutterstockOne of the companies that experienced a meteoric rise in market value during the post-pandemic housing boom, Redfin (NASDAQ:RDFN) now struggles for air. It’s not just that RDFN hemorrhaged nearly 90% of equity value on a year-to-date basis. During its peak, RDFN’s average share price neared $100, per Google Finance data. At the moment, shares trade hands for about $3.86.And yet, I still believe Redfin represents one of the real estate stocks to sell. For one thing, I don’t see much indication that the volatility died down. In the trailing month, RDFN lost a staggering 31.4% of market value. That’s a lesson that just because something cratered on a YTD basis does not mean it can’t produce steeper losses. It very well can.Financially, Gurufocus.com warns that Redfin may be another possible value trap. It’s hard to argue otherwise. While RDFN features subterranean PS ratios, for instance, the underlying company’s retained earnings line item has a loss of $541 million on a trailing-12-month basis.Since circumstances will likely worsen from here, this is one sign among many that RDFN ranks among the real estate stocks to sell.Opendoor (OPEN)A picture of the OpenDoor (OPEN stock) app on a phone.Source: PREMIO STOCK/Shutterstock.comA compelling idea on the surface, Opendoor (NASDAQ:OPEN) initially benefitted from the idea of leveraging artificial intelligence to buy and sell real estate. This platform provided convenience for home sellers while providing data-driven upside opportunities for the underlying company. It worked when home prices kept moving higher and higher. But now that the paradigm shifted, OPEN represents one of the real estate stocks to sell.It’s not just my opinion. Wired.com noted that Opendoor may be a canary in the economic coal mine. Specifically, the company cited data that suggested Opendoor lost money on 42% of the homes it sold in August. To be fair, management disputes this figure, stating that the loss was about 20%.“Whichever way you slice it, iBuyers are vulnerable to swings in the market. So what amounts to an undetectable tremor for individual buyers can become an almighty rumble for iBuyers,” the publication stated.To me, it’s going to be a herculean struggle to convince home sellers to accept far less than market value today for Opendoor’s AI-and-algorithm-driven platform to work properly. Thus, I must put OPEN on this list of real estate stocks to sell.Matterport (MTTR)Illustrative Editorial of Matterport's (MTTR) website homepage. MATTERPORT logo visible on display screen.Source: II.studio / Shutterstock.comAlthough not a direct player in the real estate market, Matterport (NASDAQ:MTTR) nevertheless benefited from the housing boom. With the company focusing on specialized optics that produce spatial (3D) images, it allowed people to inspect homes at distance. Of course, with the pandemic still a massive concern at the time, Matterport enjoyed significant relevance.However, with fears fast fading over the global health crisis, Matterport lost much of its relevance. Again, it’s not just my opinion. On Wall Street, MTTR ended up plunging over 82% of equity value. At their peak, the average price of shares stood at nearly $30. Today, they trade hands for only $3.30.To be fair, Matterport enjoys a very strong balance sheet, with a cash-to-debt ratio in the triple digits. Therefore, I wouldn’t short MTTR. Still, it’s one of the real estate stocks to sell because of poor growth prospects. With a sharp rise in borrowing costs, people are losing interest in homebuying. And that doesn’t bode well for housing-related businesses.D.R. Horton (DHI)In this photo illustration the D.R. Horton (DRI) logo seen displayed on a smartphone.Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comAs the largest homebuilder by volume in the U.S., D.R. Horton (NYSE:DHI) benefited handsomely during the post-pandemic housing boom. Unfortunately, with the Fed taking away the monetary punch bowl, I fail to see how D.R. Horton will continue rising. Even with some modest declines in housing prices, the spike in mortgage rates significantly reduced affordability.Sure enough, Raymond James recently downgraded DHI in terms of earnings projections. Per TipRanks, analyst Buck Horne “lowered his expectations on homebuilders, citing high mortgage rates and a hawkish Federal Reserve.” Interestingly, Horne also added that “the monthly cost of a median-priced home is nearly 42% of a median family’s gross income. This is actually higher than the 40% seen during the 2006 housing peak.”Per Gurufocus.com, DHI ranks as a possible value trap. It might be perfectly emblematic of a value trap. On paper, the homebuilder features excellent growth and profitability metrics. But moving forward, against the backdrop of worsening affordability, these metrics no longer command reliability. Thus, DHI represents one of the real estate stocks to sell.KB Home (KBH)A photo of a person in a neon green vest holding blueprints and standing behind a white table covered with supplies like pencils, a computer, a ruler and two wooden house shapes.Source: ARMMY PICCA/ShutterStock.comAs a competing homebuilder, you might consider KB Home (NYSE:KBH) to feature the same poor prospects as D.R. Horton. On headline figures, it’s difficult not to come away with that impression. For instance, since the start of this year, KBH dropped almost 37% of equity value. As well, it faces the same fundamental challenges of higher interest rates.Nevertheless, Gurufocus.com rates KBH as significantly undervalued. Along with strong growth and profitability metrics, KB Home features a forward price-earnings ratio of 3.6 times. That’s well underneath the industry median ratio of 5.4 times.However, before you get too excited, you should note that Raymond James downgraded KB Home to “market perform.” Earlier, the firm had KBH pegged as a “strong buy.”Personally, I think KBH represents too much risks given the fundamental backdrop. For example, in its quarter ended Aug. 31, 2022, KB Home’s days inventory increased by 7.5% against the year-ago level. The affordability crisis will likely exacerbate this circumstance while capping revenue growth. Therefore, I view KBH as one of the real estate stocks to sell.Rocket Companies (RKT)two people shaking hands over a desk with mortgage papers and a small model of a houseSource: ShutterstockOne of the leaders in providing convenient digital solutions for complex transactions, Rocket Companies (NYSE:RKT) established a reputation for its mortgage-related services. When the company made its public market debut in the summer of 2020, it had timing as a tailwind. Unfortunately, this year, the monetary paradigm shift brought severe storms against the mortgage business.As evidence, RKT finds itself down 57% YTD. But that’s just the beginning of the problems. With the Fed committed to raising the benchmark interest rate to control inflation, Rocket will probably suffer an erosion of its total addressable market.Financially, investors could be looking at another value trap. Sure, Rocket presently features a PE ratio of just under 5 times. In contrast, the industry median ratio is 9.42 times. Nevertheless, market participants must consider the predictability of its growth and earnings trajectories.Again, with borrowing costs rising amid rising concerns about a global recession, homebuyer sentiment diminished rapidly. Therefore, just based on harsh realities, I must consider RKT as one of the real estate stocks to sell.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

The surge was apparently driven by positive GDP data for the third quarter. The data showed that U.S. GDP improved 2.6 percent in the September quarter, above analysts' average estimate calling for a gain of 2.4 percent. On the other hand, the 10-year Treasury yield dropped below 4 percent, adding to the gains of these indices.However, the tech-dominated Nasdaq Composite once again fell on Thursday morning following disappointing financial results of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). The social network giant missed earnings expectations for Q3 and issued a weak sales outlook for the current quarter.The latest earnings sent Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) shares down to a nearly seven-year low. Meanwhile, several analysts trimmed their price targets for Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), following the results.In addition, ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) and Canadian Pacific Railway Limited (NYSE:CP) were also among the notable companies that received updated price targets from analysts after their recent earnings.

Corporation (NYSE:VFC) recently decreased its fiscal 2023 adjusted profit outlook to a range of $2.40 - $2.50 per share, from its previous projection between $2.60 - $2.70 per share.

They are not, however, a substitute for U.S. GAAP financial measures. Therefore, the company has provided reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure at the end of the release. The company adjusts U.S. GAAP measures for items not directly related to ongoing operations. However, it is possible these adjusting items have occurred in the past and could recur in future reporting periods. Management also uses non-GAAP measures for goal setting, as a basis for determining employee and senior management awards and compensation and evaluating performance on a basis comparable to that used by investors and securities analysts.Earnings conference callOn Friday, Oct. 28, 2022, at 10:00 a.m. (ET), Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Dan Houston and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Deanna Strable will lead a discussion of results and the impacts on future prospects, asset quality and capital adequacy during a live conference call, which can be accessed as follows:Via live Internet webcast.

non-GAAP financial measures is discussed in this release after segment results. Non-GAAP operating earnings for total company is after tax. The total company impacts of significant variances, including the actuarial assumption review, are also after tax.2 Includes only funds with ratings assigned by Morningstar; non-rated funds excluded (89 total, 82 are ranked).3 Pre-tax return on operating revenues less pass-through expenses = pre-tax operating earnings, adjusted for noncontrolling interest divided by operating revenues less pass-through expenses.4 Premiums and fees = premiums and other considerations plus fees and other revenues.5 Pre-tax operating earnings = operating earnings before income taxes and after noncontrolling interest.6 Net revenue = operating revenues less benefits, claims and settlement expenses less dividends to policyholders.7 Pre-tax return on net revenue = pre-tax operating earnings divided by net revenue.8 The company has provided reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures at the end of the release. The company has determined this measure is more representative of underlying operating revenues growth for PGI as it removes commissions and other expenses that are collected through fee revenue and passed through expenses with no impact to pre-tax operating earnings.9 Combined net revenue (a non-GAAP financial measure): net revenue for all PI companies at 100% less pass-through commissions. The company has determined combined net revenue (at PFG share) is more representative of underlying net revenue growth for PI as it reflects our proportionate share of consolidated and equity method subsidiaries. In addition, using this net revenue metric provides a more meaningful representation of our profit margins.10 Pre-tax return on premium and fees = pre-tax operating earnings divided by premium and fees.11 Other significant variances in 3Q22 include 1) lower than expected variable investment income in RIS-Fee, RIS-Spread, Specialty Benefits, Individual Life and Corporate, partially offset by higher variable investment income in Principal International; 2) lower than expected encaje performance in Principal International; 3) COVID-19 related claims in RIS-Spread and Individual Life.12 Other significant variances in 3Q21 include 1) higher than expected variable investment income in RIS-Spread, Principal International, Specialty Benefits and Individual Life, partially offset by lower variable investment income in Corporate; 2) COVID-19 related claims in RIS-Spread, Specialty Benefits and Individual Life; 3) IRT integration costs in RIS-Fee; and 4) lower than expected encaje performance in Principal International.13 Principal, Principal and symbol design and Principal Financial Group are trademarks and service marks of Principal Financial Services, Inc., a member of the Principal Financial Group.14 As of September 30, 202215 Barron’s, 202216 Pensions &amp; Investments, 2021View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20221027005773/en/ContactsMedia Contact: Jane Slusark, 515-362-0482, slusark.jane@principal.com Investor Contact: Humphrey Lee, 515-235-9500, lee.humphrey@principal.com]"

This compares to earnings of $1.56 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 4.08%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this manufacturer of specialized welding products and other equipment would post earnings of $1.99 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.18, delivering a surprise of 9.55%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.Lincoln Electric , which belongs to the Zacks Manufacturing - Tools &amp; Related Products industry, posted revenues of $935.24 million for the quarter ended September 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.75%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $806.45 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Lincoln Electric shares have lost about 0.8% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -19.6%.What's Next for Lincoln Electric?While Lincoln Electric has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Lincoln Electric: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.91 on $932.1 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $8.16 on $3.74 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Manufacturing - Tools &amp; Related Products is currently in the bottom 32% of the 250 plus Zacks industries.

529,4cc90d0c-a6be-34a8-9f50-842d07695a55,AFL,2022-10-28,Can Declining Premiums Affect Aflac's (AFL) Q3 Earnings?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/declining-premiums-affect-aflacs-afl-143502211.html,1666881302,STORY,['AFL'],"[Aflac Incorporated AFL is set to report its third-quarter 2022 results on Oct 31, after the closing bell.In the last reported quarter, the leading insurance provider reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.46, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 13.2% due to better returns from alternative investments resulting in strong variable investment income. Improved sales in the Aflac U.S. segment, resulting from productivity gains and continued growth-related investments, and reduced benefits and expenses, contributed to the upside.However, the results were partly offset by softness in the Japan segment, which has been grappling with persistent weakness in sales recovery due to volatilities inflicted by the COVID-19 pandemic.Let’s see how things have shaped up prior to the third-quarter earnings announcement.The Trend in Estimate RevisionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings per share of $1.22 has witnessed no movement in the past week. The estimate figure suggests a decrease of 20.3% from the prior-year reported number. Our estimate for third-quarter earnings of $1.23 per share suggests a 19.8% year-over-year decline. Aflac beat the consensus estimate in each of the prior four quarters, the average being 9%. This is depicted in the graph below:Aflac Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise Aflac Incorporated Price and EPS SurpriseAflac Incorporated price-eps-surprise | Aflac Incorporated QuoteBoth the Zacks Consensus Estimate and our estimate for third-quarter revenues of $4.6 billion indicate an 11.6% decrease from the year-ago reported figure.Factors to NoteAFL’s U.S. operations in the third quarter are likely to have benefited from the Fed interest rate hikes but Japan’s operations are likely to have been affected by a lower interest rate environment. As such, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for net investment income of $830 indicates a 16.2% year-over-year decrease. This is expected to have been partially offset by improved returns from alternative investments.Story continuesFurther, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total net earned premiums is pegged at $3,733 million, signaling a decline from $4,372 million reported a year ago. Our estimate suggests an 11.9% year-over-year decline to $3,850.2 million in the third quarter. We expect the metric to decline 2.9% and 16.2% year over year in Aflac U.S. and Aflac Japan, respectively. These are anticipated to have led to a year-over-year decrease in the bottom line for AFL.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for pre-tax income in Aflac U.S. is pegged at $296 million, indicating a decline from $358 million a year ago. Our estimate for the metric is pegged at $292.2 million for the quarter under review.Similarly, the consensus mark for pre-tax income in Aflac Japan is pegged at $718 million, signaling a decrease from $976 million in the year-ago period. We expect the metric to be $717.7 million for the third quarter. Our estimate suggests consolidated adjusted pre-tax income to decline 24.8% year over year to $971.9 million, making an earnings beat uncertain.However, owing to Aflac’s multiple cost-curbing efforts, expenses are likely to have decreased in the third quarter. A decline in operations is likely to have reduced costs, which are expected to have partially offset the fall in the bottom line. Our estimate for benefits and expenses suggests a 6.6% year-over-year decrease.The company is expected to have made substantial investments in core technology platforms or digital capabilities. Among these platforms, AFL has been steadfast in upgrading its dental and vision platforms so that it can manage higher volumes. The investments have been aimed at boosting operational efficiencies and triggering accretive growth in earned premiums in the long run.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Aflac this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Earnings ESP: The company has an Earnings ESP of -0.21%. This is because the Most Accurate Estimate is currently pegged lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.22 per share.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Aflac currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.Stocks to ConsiderWhile an earnings beat looks uncertain for Aflac, here are some companies in the Finance space that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this time around:Atlas Corp.

530,e9bce6c1-14b5-3fb8-a875-8c8dd761a08f,AFL,2022-10-28,How To Support Hispanic Employees During Open Enrollment Season,ACCESSWIRE,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/support-hispanic-employees-during-open-131500872.html,1666876500,STORY,['AFL'],"[NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / October 27, 2022 / Aflac IncorporatedAflac Incorporated, Thursday, October 27, 2022, Press release pictureBy Diana Steinhoff, Senior Vice President, Aflac Dental and VisionMany organizations put significant time and resources into celebrating and recognizing their Hispanic employees, as well as Hispanic culture and Hispanic Americans' contributions to society throughout Hispanic Heritage Month, Sept. 15 to Oct. 15. As these celebrations come to a close, it's important to remember that supporting your Hispanic employees requires being mindful, empathetic and receptive to their needs year-round.With open enrollment season approaching, one way HR and benefits leaders can do this is by understanding how to talk to Hispanic employees about their health benefits. Tailoring communications, messaging and tactics to what Hispanic employees care about when it comes to their health care is absolutely worth the investment. Hispanics are the most uninsured racial or ethnic group in America;1 18%, or nearly 1 in 5, Hispanic people do not have health insurance, compared to 8.6% of the overall population. My own organization's research found more than half (65%) of Hispanic Americans could not afford to pay health care costs, compared to 58% of the U.S. general population.Talking to your Hispanic employees about their health benefits requires understanding of their specific priorities, obligations and pain points. While Hispanic Americans are by no means a monolith, here are some best practices HR and benefits leaders can follow:Make it about the family, not the individual. Hispanic culture is strongly family-oriented, and it's not unusual for Hispanic American households to have multiple generations living under one roof. Talking about the importance of health benefits not only for the individual, but also for their loved ones, is highly effective. Your messaging should include the tangible benefits health insurance provides to employees' families - for example, the ability to add a spouse, partner and children as dependents - as well as the emotional benefits, such as taking care of themselves so they're able to take care of their family and modeling healthy habits for their children.​Put the spotlight on mental health.Up until very recently, mental health was seen as an off-limits topic in the workplace, and talking openly about mental health can still be taboo in Hispanic culture. If the past few years have taught us anything, it's that we are all human, and we are all affected - positively and negatively - by what is happening around us. Fostering a safe and open dialogue around mental health in the workplace is key. Taking it a step further, HR and benefits leaders should ensure their health care plans include coverage for mental health conditions and create workplace policies and perks that promote mental well-being.Be mindful of men. Hispanic men are more likely than women to be uninsured - a trend that also holds true for the general population.1A survey our organization conducted earlier this year found that fewer than half (47%) of U.S. men have an annual checkup, just 37% have had a routine dental exam in the past year, and only 29% have a routine eye exam.2 Understanding these pain points can allow HR and benefits leaders to communicate with male employees more effectively, such as sending reminders that they are due for those regular appointments.Provide health benefits information in Spanish. Even if your Hispanic employees are fluent in English, they still may prefer reading about their benefits (and other sensitive information) in Spanish. And this isn't just the case for the employee, but also for other family members who are impacted by the employee's health care coverage.Give Hispanic employees a seat at the table. Achieving true diversity, equity and inclusion requires having a team who is representative of the group they serve. When tailoring communications about health benefits to Hispanic employees, it's important to involve those who are part of this culture and have a deep understanding of which messages will resonate.Story continuesHispanic Americans are the second fastest growing racial or ethnic group in the U.S.3 and the least likely to have health insurance.1 By truly understanding what your Hispanic employees want and need from their health benefits, employers can play an important role in closing this gap.Learn more about Aflac here1Axios (2021).

We recognize the challenges presented by a rising interest rate environment in the near term. Longer term, the secular outlook on housing construction is positive, as there remains a material shortage of housing stock in the U.S. We also like NVR's approach in which it has an option on land rather than owning it outright, which exposes the company to less risk from falling land prices.Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Housing Stocks To Buy Now.Suggested Articles:11 Best Financial Services Stocks to Buy Now10 Best Dow Jones Dividend Stocks that Hedge Funds LoveWhat Are the Best Stocks to Buy Right Now?Disclosure: None. 13 Best Housing Stocks To Buy Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

The metric came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate and beat our estimate of $7.5 billion.Total operating expenses of Molina Healthcare escalated 11.3% year over year to $7.6 billion, primarily due to higher medical care costs, general and administrative expenses, and premium tax expenses. Our estimate for the metric stands at $7.4 billion.Interest expenses of $28 million fell 6.7% year over year.Net income of MOH surged 60.8% year over year to $230 million in the quarter under review.The consolidated medical care ratio (medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues) or MCR improved 50 basis points (bps) year over year to 88.4%.

However, the downside was partly mitigated by better net earnings.2022 GuidanceManagement altered guidance for this year with respect to certain metrics.Premium revenues are projected to be roughly $30.5 billion, higher than the prior outlook of around $30 billion. The revised guidance implies an improvement of 13.4% from the 2021 figure.

This compares to earnings of $1.20 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -11.21%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this water utility would post earnings of $0.60 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.36, delivering a surprise of -40%.Over the last four quarters, the company has not been able to surpass consensus EPS estimates.California Water Service Group , which belongs to the Zacks Utility - Water Supply industry, posted revenues of $266.31 million for the quarter ended September 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.43%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $256.72 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.California Water Service Group shares have lost about 20.9% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -19.6%.What's Next for California Water Service Group?While California Water Service Group has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for California Water Service Group: favorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future.

In the last reported quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 5.3%.Let’s discuss the factors that are likely to be reflected in the upcoming quarterly results.Factors to ConsiderAmerican Water’s third-quarter earnings are expected to have benefited from efficient cost management and new water rates effective in different territories. It got approval for the implementation of new rates worth $182 million from Jan 1, 2022, which is likely to have a positive impact on its third-quarter earnings.The ongoing addition in customer volume due to acquisitions and organic means is likely to have increased the demand for water and wastewater services as well as boosted earnings in the third quarter. The Military Service Group received its first Navy contract during the third quarter. Existing contracts and the new ones are likely to have contributed to its third-quarter earnings.ExpectationsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.50 per share, indicating a year-over-year decline of 1.96% from the year-ago reported figure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues is pegged at $1.02 billion, indicating a year-over-year decline of 6.65% from the year-ago reported figure.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for American Water this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat.

Income investors who counted on yield alone thrived up until earlier this year. Since then, the Federal Reserve has realized it was behind the curve. Inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, rose uncontrollably. Thus, the central bank appears intent on increasing interest rates at every meeting, until price increases start to slow. Higher rates on risk-free assets like bonds, debt, and cash are bad news for dividend stocks.Companies that have strong pricing power have nothing to worry about. Conversely, firms that sell goods that are demand-elastic, or sensitive to prices, are in trouble. Input costs rose with inflation, meaning companies that are unable to pass higher costs to customers will post lower profits.I expect the Fed to raise rates by at least 75 basis points in each of the two meetings to end this year. That will take the Federal Funds rate to a range of 4.75% to 5.00% by early next year.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsDividend Stocks to SellDividend yield compared to growth score.Chart courtesy of StockRoverDividend stocks in the table above have fair growth scores. Their generous dividend yields may not convince investors to overlook scores as low as 45/100. This list of dividend stocks to sell represents a wide variety of sectors, from telecom to consumer discretionary to pharmaceutical.CAHCardinal Health$73.67MSMorgan Stanley$79.07PEPPepsiCo$176.86PGProcter &amp; Gamble$129.00TAT&amp;T$17.50TAKTakeda Pharmaceutical$12.63TROWT. Rowe Price$104.54Cardinal Health (CAH)Cardinal Health (CAH) sign with bushes in front of itSource: ShutterstockFirst on the list of dividend stocks to sell is Cardinal Health (NYSE:CAH). This company began its business transformation before the pandemic. It focused on increasing its Cardinal brand mix to increase profit margins. Both during and following the Covid pandemic, macro supply chain disruptions hurt its momentum.Now, the company is investing heavily to strengthen its supply chain. That said, these added costs will weigh on Cardinal Health’s margins. Customers will not experience benefits from those investments in the short-term. For example, the sales team needs time to re-engage to drive sales volumes.Story continuesRecently, some bullish momentum has taken CAH stock on a nice ride, with the stock now trading near 52-week highs. Many investors appear to be betting that the company’s pharma business will remain resilient. Still, the company may deploy its excess capital inefficiently. It will have $3.1 billion in cash to invest. With a tight labor market and increasing competition for resources, the company may disappoint investors.Cardinal Health shares pay a dividend of $1.98, which yields 2.72%. This rate will fall significantly behind that of risk-free Treasury Bills. The 2-year U.S. Treasury now yields 4.483%.Morgan Stanley (MS)The logo for Morgan Stanley is displayed on the side of a building.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comMorgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) has an attractive dividend that yields almost 4%. In the third quarter, the company posted a drop in net revenue and net income.Indeed, the company’s results may not necessarily speak to this being among the dividend stocks to sell, at least on an initial look.Looking deeper, Morgan Stanley posted revenue of $13.0 billion, with the company’s net income falling from $1.98 a share to $1.47. Investors should worry about the bank’s defensibility in terms of its return on equity. The world is disengaging from the easy monetary policies that boosted stocks for over a decade. Global tensions are hurting market sentiment. For example, Europe had its first land war in Europe in 70 years.MS stock faces selling pressure as the Fed handles the highest inflation rates in 40 years. The higher rates rise, the sooner investors look at bank stocks to sell. Bulls might buy Morgan Stanley because it benefits from high net interest income. However, an economic slowdown hurts deal-making volumes, offsetting this tailwind to a considerable degree.The bank managed to attract $65 billion in investment for its Wealth Management unit, despite tough market conditions. I think investors should play it safe by waiting for broader investing activity to recover before jumping into this dividend stock.PepsiCo (PEP)Cans of PepsiCo's Pepsi soda are in a bucket of ice.Source: suriyachan / Shutterstock.comAnother top holding of many investors, I view PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) as one of the top dividend stocks to sell. That’s despite the company posting strong revenue growth in the third quarter. Revenue grew by 8.8% in Q3, to $21.97 billion. Thus, after raising its full-year outlook, why is PEP stock on this list at all?Indeed, Pepsi’s strong organic growth rate of 12% (up from 10% previously) and capital distributions to shareholders are impressive. The company expects to return $6.2 billion to investors through dividends. In addition, it will buy back $1.5 billion worth of shares.That said, the company’s recent earnings per share outlook came in basically in-line with estimates. I think the company’s bottom line is where it will see weakness. Moving forward, Pepsi might experience weaker-than-expected demand. Consumers face higher costs from big-ticket purchases. If demand falls by 1% to 2%, investors will fear an accelerated slowdown for Pepsi’s business.Pepsi has invested heavily in its brands, including in digitizing its business. This strengthens its long-term sustainability. That said, the stock trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 24.54 times. Thus, Pepsi really needs to post only one bad quarter to trigger a stock selloff. At these prices, the stock is not worth the risk.Procter &amp; Gamble (PG)A Procter &amp; Gamble (PG) distribution center in Vandalia.Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comAnother one of the dividend stocks to sell that made this list despite strong earnings is Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE:PG). The consumer goods giant posted revenue of $20.61 billion in its first fiscal quarter of 2023. That said, the company’s revenue growth of 1.3% year-over-year is too low for a firm whose stock trades at a 22.16-times price-earnings ratio.For the fiscal year, P&amp;G expects an earnings per share growth rate at the low end of its guidance range. This range only goes up to 4%, which many would call anemic. Shareholders might count on the company’s $9 billion in dividend payments and $6 billion to $8 billion in stock buybacks to boost its price. However, this is also a company that’s been investing heavily, and may need to pull back on these distributions in difficult times.This investment is exemplified by the company’s accelerated push toward greater productivity. To accelerate growth, P&amp;G needs to find potential acquisitions that complement the company’s existing product lines. Productivity increases eventually peak. Fortunately, the company is building digital capabilities. This may help it deliver results at lower costs over time.P&amp;G said that it spent more than $1.2 billion on media. As consumers tighten their wallets, this company might need to increase its spending to support sales further.AT&amp;T (T)a ground-up view of multiple cell towers in a circleSource: ShutterstockNext on the list of dividend stocks to sell right now is a more volatile option of late, AT&amp;T (NYSE:T). Recently, T stock bounced from around $14.65 to close at $17.10 by Oct. 21, 2022. This is due to markets responding positively to the company’s subscription growth rates. After languishing throughout the year, I think investors should sell T stock before other profit-takers do.AT&amp;T added 708,000 postpaid phone customers and 338,000 fiber customers. While the company’s $14 billion in free cash flow will attract income investors, the telecom firm has high capital expenditure requirements. It must spend $6.8 billion in capital to support its infrastructure. In the fourth quarter, AT&amp;T might convert its investment efforts to support cash flow growth. Thus, investors should expect the company’ stock price to peak sometime this quarter.AT&amp;T’s high debt load appears to be manageable. That said, before interest rate rates increase further, AT&amp;T many plan to use its cash to cut its debt. The company has a net debt to adjusted EBITDA target of 2.5-times. Investors might panic sell the stock ahead of management posting its status report on its planned debt reduction in the fourth quarter.Takeda Pharmaceutical (TAK)pharmaceutical industry. Production line machine conveyor with glass bottles ampoules at factorySource: Dmitry Kalinovsky / Shutterstock.comTakeda Pharmaceutical (NYSE:TAK) is a Japan-based pharmaceutical company which has been treading water of late. This year, TAK stock has tried many times to break out above the $15 level. When it failed in August, investors appear to have given up. Shares closed at $12.68 last week.On its conference call, Takeda hinted it would post strong first-quarter results. The firm posted improving margins. At a product level, the company’s management team is watching for revenue erosion from generic Velcade. This drug treats multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma.The drug firm needs its Entyvio drug, which treats ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease, to take market share. Additionally, Takeda is expected to launch a subcutaneous formulation of this drug in the U.S. in the next few years. In this market climate, investors are likely unwilling to wait that long for Takeda’s efforts to pay off.U.S. investors might prefer domestic drug stocks. That’s because domestic options generally remove currency exchange risks seen with Takeda. Indeed, the weakened Yen has already considerably hit the company’s margins. This could be exacerbated in the coming quarters.T. Rowe Price (TROW)T row price (TROW) logo magnified through a lens while displayed on a web browserSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comThe last entry on our list of dividend stocks to sell is investment management firm T. Rowe Price (NASDAQ:TROW). The stock market’s plunge is scaring investors. In August, the company posted a net outflow of $24.6 billion in the third quarter of 2022. The fewer dollars T. Row Price has to manage, the less revenue it collects from asset management fees.TROW stock faces significant selling pressure. Despite the stock’s dividend yielding 4.7% (which is above that of risk-free Treasury bonds), weak stock markets prospects has hit this company hard. Despite T. Rowe Price being a great asset management firm, in the short term, these macroeconomic headwinds are too great for its shareholders to overcome.The macro environment could get worse before it gets better. This increases the risk of a steeper sell-off in the stock. Now that the company’s price-earnings ratio is below 10 times, this stock actually shows promising value. That said, should a panic ensue in the stock market, I think the company’s price-earnings ratio could drop as low as 8-times earnings, implying 20% downside from here.This is a stock to take profits on and to add to the watch list. The company has good long-term prospects, once investors return to the stock market.On the date of publication, Chris Lau did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

(NASDAQ: REGN) today announced that Inmazeb™ (atoltivimab, maftivimab, and odesivimab-ebgn) has been recognized as the ""Best Biotechnology Product"" of 2022 by the Galien Foundation, which acknowledges extraordinary scientific innovations that improve the human condition. The Prix Galien USA Award was presented in a ceremony in New York City last night.""We are honored that the Galien Foundation has recognized Inmazeb, which was invented by Regeneron scientists committed to helping people impacted by the deadly Ebola virus,"" said George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D., President and Chief Scientific Officer of Regeneron. ""Our ability to rapidly respond to Ebola was based on decades of deep investment in our enabling antibody technologies, starting with our remarkable VelocImmune® mouse. Our scientists realized that the science demanded they adapt these technologies to deliver the first FDA-approved recombinant monoclonal antibody treatment for any viral disease, and they picked one of the most challenging ones in Ebola. The success with Ebola ushered in a new era in which monoclonal antibodies could be used to fight viral diseases and global pandemics.""""Our groundbreaking 'rapid response' application of our VelociSuite® technologies to address the Ebola outbreak laid the foundation for our COVID-19 efforts,"" said Christos Kyratsous, Ph.D., Senior Vice President, Research, at Regeneron. ""By strategically pursuing a multi-antibody approach, parallel tracking certain steps and speeding hand-offs between groups, we are able to advance novel antibody treatments in a very expedited manner. Thank you for this recognition of the decades of diligent scientific research and technological investment that led to this important therapeutic discovery.""In October 2020, Inmazeb became the first therapy approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for Zaire ebolavirus. The three antibody combination neutralizes the Ebola virus by blocking the virus from entering into host cells via the glycoprotein and/or enables antibody-dependent effector function by bringing in other immune cells to target infected cells, which is a way for an antibody to get extra help from the immune system in order to clear infected cells from the body.Story continuesThe safety and efficacy of Inmazeb was established through the 681-patient PALM  (PAmoja TuLinde Maisha) Trial, a randomized, multicenter, controlled trial initiated in 2018 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The World Health Organization (WHO), the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Institut National de Recherche Biomédicale (INRB) in the DRC jointly sponsored and served as co-principal investigators of the trial. In 2019, as reported in the New England Journal of Medicine, the PALM Trial was stopped early following a pre-specified interim analysis that showed superiority of Inmazeb to ZMapp (another three antibody combination) and remdesivir (an antiviral) with respect to mortality. Adverse events (AEs) that occurred in at least 10% of Inmazeb patients were chills, elevation in fever (pyrexia), rapid heartbeat (tachycardia), rapid breathing (tachypnea), vomiting, low blood pressure (hypotension), diarrhea and inadequate oxygen supply to the tissue (hypoxia); of these, only chills occurred more frequently with Inmazeb than ZMapp. The evaluation of AEs in Inmazeb patients may have been confounded by the signs and symptoms of the underlying Zaire ebolavirus infection.In keeping with our mission and values, Regeneron is committed to making this important medicine available to the people who need it. Since 2018, we have worked with the WHO, FDA and other global organizations to offer Inmazeb under compassionate-use protocol to affected African countries. Importantly, these countries received our treatment at no cost. To be prepared for potential new outbreaks, Regeneron has an internal leadership group focused on advancing our access strategy to ensure continued access to Inmazeb in low- and middle income countries (LMICs). Regeneron is actively working with non-governmental organizations and public health agencies to ensure continued access to Inmazeb in LMICs.About InmazebInmazeb, previously called REGN-EB3, was created using Regeneron's VelocImmune® platform and associated VelociSuite® technologies. The treatment consists of three monoclonal antibodies of similar structure, atoltivimab, maftivimab and odesivimab, that bind to different, non-overlapping epitopes on Zaire ebolavirus glycoprotein. The three antibodies help neutralize the Ebola virus by blocking its ability to invade patients' and/or enlisting other immune cells to target infected cells and remove them from the body.Inmazeb is administered as a single, weight-based intravenous infusion (50 mg atoltivimab, 50 mg maftivimab and 50 mg odesivimab per kg). Inmazeb was developed in collaboration and with federal funds from BARDA, part of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response at the HHS under ongoing USG Contract Nos. HHSO100201700016C and HHSO100201500013C.About Regeneron's VelocImmune TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's co-Founder, President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985, they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse, and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create approximately one in five of all original, FDA-approved or authorized fully human monoclonal antibodies. This includes REGEN-COV® (casirivimab and imdevimab), Dupixent, Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc), Praluent® (alirocumab), Kevzara® (sarilumab), Evkeeza® (evinacumab-dgnb) and Inmazeb.IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION AND INDICATIONWARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONSHypersensitivity Reactions Including Infusion-Associated Events: Hypersensitivity reactions including infusion-associated events have been reported during and post-infusion with INMAZEB. These may include acute, life-threatening reactions during and after the infusion. Monitor all patients for signs and symptoms including, but not limited to, hypotension, chills and elevation of fever, during and following INMAZEB infusion. In the case of severe or life-threatening hypersensitivity reactions, discontinue the administration of INMAZEB immediately and administer appropriate emergency care.Infusion could not be completed in 1% of subjects who received INMAZEB due to infusion-associated adverse events. The rate of infusion of INMAZEB may be slowed or interrupted if the patient develops any signs of infusion-associated events or other adverse events.ADVERSE REACTIONS:The most common adverse events reported in at least 10% of subjects who received INMAZEB were pyrexia (or elevation in fever), chills, tachycardia, tachypnea, vomiting, hypotension, diarrhea and hypoxia. The evaluation of adverse events in subjects who received INMAZEB may have been confounded by the signs and symptoms of the underlying Zaire ebolavirusSelected grade 3 and 4 laboratory abnormalities for INMAZEB included high sodium (≥ 154 mmol/L), low sodium (&lt;125 mmol/L), high potassium (≥ 6.5 mmol/L), low potassium (&lt; 2.5 mmol/L), creatinine ((mg/dL) ≥ 1.8 x ULN), high alanine aminotransferase ((U/L) ≥ 5 x ULN) and high aspartate aminotransferase ((U/L) ≥ 5 x ULN).DRUG INTERACTIONS: INMAZEB may reduce the efficacy of live vaccine therefore, avoid the concurrent administration of a live vaccine during treatment with INMAZEB. The interval between live vaccination following initiation of INMAZEB therapy should be in accordance with current vaccination guidelines. The efficacy of INMAZEB among subjects who reported receipt of a recombinant live vaccine prior to their enrollment in the PALM clinical trial was similar to subjects who did not receive a vaccine.INDICATIONINMAZEB is indicated for the treatment of infection caused by Zaire ebolavirus in adult and pediatric patients, including neonates born to a mother who is RT-PCR positive for Zaire ebolavirus infection.Limitations of Use: The efficacy of INMAZEB has not been established for other species of the Ebolavirus and Marburgvirus genera. Zaire ebolavirus can change over time, and factors such as emergence of resistance, or changes in viral virulence could diminish the clinical benefit of antiviral drugs. Consider available information on drug susceptibility patterns for circulating Zaire ebolavirus strains when deciding to use INMAZEB.Please see accompanying full Prescribing Information.About Regeneron Regeneron is a leading biotechnology company that invents, develops and commercializes life-transforming medicines for people with serious diseases.

It had previously forecast growth of 15%.It also reported a 26.5% rise in third-quarter business operating income, or adjusted earnings before interest and tax, to 4.5 billion euros ($4.5 billion), well ahead of an average analyst estimate of 4.17 billion.Sanofi shares had plunged in August after disappointing trial results of a once-promising breast cancer drug candidate, heightening concerns about its development pipeline, while investors also fretted over legal claims that heartburn drug Zantac caused cancer.The shares have not recovered much and Credit Suisse analysts have said Sanofi is trading about one third below its European peers, relative to estimated 2023 earnings.Finance chief Jean-Baptiste de Chatillon, who has described the discount as grossly overdone, said on Friday that Sanofi would follow through on its strategy.""We know we have some headwinds and we are there to fight them and to demonstrate to our shareholders that we can create more value,"" he told journalists on a call.The shares jumped 2% at the open.CANCER DRUGBut in a further development setback, 1.6 billion euros were written off the value of the most advanced drug project of Synthorx, a U.S. biotech firm Sanofi agreed to acquire for $2.5 billion in 2019. The cancer drug would come to market later than hoped, it said.Story continuesAs a result, quarterly net income fell 10% to 2.1 billion euros.Revenue from exzema and asthma drug Dupixent, jointly developed with Regeneron, jumped by a currency-adjusted 44.5% to 2.3 billion euros in the quarter, soundly beating an analyst consensus of 2.1 billion.The company is pursuing further growth for Dupixent in inflammatory skin conditions and smoker's lung, where keenly awaited trial data is expected in the first half of 2023.Sales from influenza vaccines jumped by a currency-adjusted 32.4% to 2 billion euros, surpassing an analyst consensus of 1.6 billion, on swift uptake of a more expensive new high-dose shot.CFO de Chatillon said the company also benefited from bringing forward the seasonal production ramp-up and distribution but added that overall appetite in the U.S. population for flu shots was low.A strong U.S. dollar also boosted the value of overseas group revenue.($1 = 1.0015 euros) (Reporting by Ludwig Burger; Editing by Susan Fenton and David Holmes)]"

It is worth considering Regeneron (REGN), which belongs to the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry.When looking at the last two reports, this biopharmaceutical company has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 18.58%, on average, in the last two quarters.For the last reported quarter, Regeneron came out with earnings of $9.77 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.53 per share, representing a surprise of 14.54%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $9.37 per share and it actually produced earnings of $11.49 per share, delivering a surprise of 22.63%.Price and EPS SurpriseWith this earnings history in mind, recent estimates have been moving higher for Regeneron. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the company is positive, which is a great sign of an earnings beat, especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Regeneron has an Earnings ESP of +7.43% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on November 3, 2022.Story continuesWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 3, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis biopharmaceutical company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $8.97 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -41.6%.Revenues are expected to be $2.79 billion, down 19.1% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 3.23% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Regeneron?For Regeneron, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +7.43%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Regeneron will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Regeneron would post earnings of $8.53 per share when it actually produced earnings of $9.77, delivering a surprise of +14.54%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Regeneron appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerGritstone bio Inc. (GRTS), another stock in the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $0.41 for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of -13.9%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $2.79 million, up 6.9% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Gritstone bio Inc. has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. However, a higher Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 7.32%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP indicates that Gritstone bio Inc. will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.

Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.So if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP). Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide Union Pacific with the means to add long-term value to shareholders. See our latest analysis for Union Pacific How Fast Is Union Pacific Growing?Generally, companies experiencing growth in earnings per share (EPS) should see similar trends in share price. So it makes sense that experienced investors pay close attention to company EPS when undertaking investment research. Over the last three years, Union Pacific has grown EPS by 11% per year. That growth rate is fairly good, assuming the company can keep it up.Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. Not all of Union Pacific's revenue this year is revenue from operations, so keep in mind the revenue and margin numbers used in this article might not be the best representation of the underlying business. Union Pacific maintained stable EBIT margins over the last year, all while growing revenue 15% to US$24b. That's a real positive.In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time.

But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$188m. While that is a lot of skin in the game, we note this holding only totals to 0.2% of the business, which is a result of the company being so large. This still shows shareholders there is a degree of alignment between management and themselves.Should You Add Union Pacific To Your Watchlist?One positive for Union Pacific is that it is growing EPS. That's nice to see. If that's not enough on its own, there is also the rather notable levels of insider ownership. These two factors are a huge highlight for the company which should be a strong contender your watchlists. What about risks?

Clinic in Plainfield, N.J.This will include lab tests for chronic conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, sexually transmitted infections and Lyme disease.Under the program, clinicians send laboratory orders directly to a nearby Quest patient service center, which allows patients to visit immediately after their appointment. The results are transmitted directly back to the clinic for follow up with the patient.Gianella Burga, a physician assistant student at Rutgers who volunteers at the H.O.P.E. Clinic, which is owned and operated by the Rutgers School of Health Professions, knows first-hand how difficult it is for people without insurance to access even the most basic medical care such as lab tests.""Many of my family members are uninsured and struggle to get testing for conditions like diabetes or high cholesterol. It's difficult for them to take a day off from work for a doctor's visit and then another day for tests,"" said Burga. ""This is why I went into medicine: To address these gaps in care.""Burga is one of about 75 students who volunteer at the H.O.P.E. Clinic, which provides free primary care to hundreds of uninsured adults in Plainfield, many of whom are Spanish-speaking.One day each week, Rutgers faculty and physician assistant students see patients who are trying to manage acute and chronic diseases and provide them with referrals to specialists as well as critical education on managing their health conditions.For well over a decade, the Rutgers physician assistant program has provided free primary care services in various locations throughout the state. The H.O.P.E. Clinic, which was opened in 2021, provides an essential service to a city where about 30 percent of residents are uninsured and 39 percent report not having a primary-care provider.Story continuesFollowing through with lab tests can be challenging for this community and compromise their care, said Frank Giannelli, director of the H.O.P.E. Clinic and an assistant professor in the physician assistant program at Rutgers School of Health Professions.""If lab tests are required, the patient has to find a lab, schedule an appointment, receive the lab results and bring them back to us for a consultation,"" Giannelli said. ""It's a multi-step process where at any point, something can go wrong or they may find the cost is astronomical and leave. Navigating this process is difficult - especially for non-English speakers - and could ultimately prevent them from getting the treatment they need.""""This one-stop-shop testing streamlines the process and makes it easier for patients to receive the treatment they need,"" said Jessica Romero, a physician assistant student at Rutgers who works at the clinic.Quest, the world's leading provider of diagnostic information services, has a history of helping underserved and minority communities throughout the nation gain access to the information they need to take control of their health. Recognizing early in the pandemic that COVID-19 was having a disproportionate impact on communities of color, the company launched Quest for Health Equity with an initial focus on giving these communities access to COVID-19 testing and critical health care services.""This has since grown to become a more than $100 million initiative focused on addressing health care disparities,"" said Ruth Clements, Vice President and General Manager of Infectious Diseases and Immunology at Quest Diagnostics and leader of Quest for Health Equity. ""This collaboration with Rutgers is a great example of joining forces to make a difference in underserved communities. As our headquarters is based in New Jersey, we are honored to work to address health inequities in our home state with a strong teammate like Rutgers.""The H.O.P.E. Clinic is one of an estimated 1,400 free and charitable clinics in the U.S. that serve about 7 million people annually. Quest's commitment to the clinic addresses a concern Giannelli sees nationwide.""Not only does being uninsured make accessing health-related services challenging, but people who are uninsured disproportionately use emergency departments for the management of conditions that could easily be managed in the outpatient setting,"" he said. ""Based on the average one-time emergency department visit cost of $1,389, free clinics save emergency departments an estimated $9.6 billion each year. When companies such as Quest help reduce barriers to care in uninsured populations, it allows clinicians to make realistic treatment plans that will help keep people out of the hospital, which is also good for our nation's health care costs.""Quest Diagnostics , Thursday, October 27, 2022, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Quest Diagnostics on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Quest Diagnostics Website: http://www.questdiagnostics.comEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Quest DiagnosticsView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/722648/Reducing-Barriers-to-Health-Care-A-Public-Private-Solution]"

Preventive health care for children is critical to address physical, mental, and emotional conditions and essential for providing routine vaccinations, tracking developmental milestones, treating identified health concerns, and providing support to families. According to a recent Public Health Report, missed visits among children under 5 years old were more common among lower-income, Black, and Latinx households than among higher-income and White households. The program's English and Spanish-language resources are designed to connect and support parents and healthcare providers as partners in children's care.New research conducted by Sesame Workshop indicates a need for active and supportive ""healthy teams"" to promote young children's well-being—a circle of care that includes parents, culturally-competent healthcare providers, and other caring adults. The initiative aims to reduce disparities by highlighting the unique strengths of each family and community; developing a common language around health and wellness and providing easy-to-understand resources; and fostering strong partnerships between families, healthcare providers, and other trusted individuals so that they can work together to make informed health-related decisions for each child.""Sesame Workshop and Quest can promote positive outcomes for children and affirm families' health and well-being by supporting equitable, culturally-competent practices,"" said Jeanette Betancourt, Sesame Workshop's Senior Vice President of U.S. Social Impact. ""Together, we're creating strategies and messages around preventive and everyday healthy practices, building health literacy, and addressing the increase in children's food insecurity to reduce health inequities by empowering parents, caregivers, and the providers who serve them.""Story continuesQuest is teaming up with Sesame Workshop as part of Quest for Health Equity (Q4HE), a multi-year program focused on providing a combination of donated testing services, education programs, and funding to support initiatives working to close the gap in healthcare disparities in underserved communities across the U.S.""We are excited to support the launch of this important program to help reduce health inequities,"" said Ruth Clements, Vice President and General Manager of Infectious Diseases and Immunology at Quest Diagnostics and leader of Quest for Health Equity. ""This collaboration with Sesame Workshop will create a solid network dedicated to supporting and improving health and wellness outcomes for children in under-resourced communities and empower parents to become strong advocates for their families.""The program's bilingual resources are designed to connect and support parents and healthcare providers as partners in children's healthcare by:Promoting Whole Child Well-Being Focusing on Forming a Healthy TeamBuilding on Families' StrengthsThe new resources will be available on sesamestreetincommunities.org/topics/health/, and will also be implemented with key national partners to reach families and children, especially those in marginalized communities, and distributed through Sesame Street in Communities, a program to support community providers in their work to help children face challenges, big and small.

The Cisco Global Problem Solver Challenge is an online competition that awards cash prizes to early-stage tech entrepreneurs solving the world's toughest problems. Since 2017, the competition has awarded $3.25 million USD to 78 start-ups from 25 countries.We are excited for you to learn more about the 2022 winning teams addressing some of the biggest challenges we face through technology-based solutions.In response to the growing urgency to reverse climate change, we introduced five new Climate Impact and Regeneration prizes totaling $300,000 USD. These prizes recognize solutions that can reduce or remove greenhouse gas (GHG) from the environment or regenerate depleted ecosystems.Meet Katchi, a rural Canadian company that won a $50,000 USD Climate Impact &amp; Regeneration Runner-Up Prize. Both Katchi's CEO and founder, Marc d'Entremont, and CFO, Angela ""Angie"" Greene's, families and community are rooted in the fishing industry. They have watched over the years as increased regulation collides with existing fishing methods. Their solution works to achieve balance that helps both the fisher and the ocean.What problem is your technology solution trying to solve?Angie: With changes in the environment and an ever-increasing world population, healthy fish stocks are essential for achieving a sustainable future while still benefitting from one of the best forms of protein available - wild caught fish.Fishers excel at knowing the sea and finding fish but are relying more on technology to target sustainable species. Katchi's technology seeks to enhance fishing precision, while limiting the impact to both the environment and the fisher's equipment. We believe that both goals are achievable through advancements using hydrodynamic engineering, sonar, sensors, and fish behavior research.Story continuesCan you explain how the solution works?Marc: Our net system removes the need for heavy trawl doors, which are currently used to keep the net open. Water pressure works in tandem with hydrodynamic blocks to keep the net mouth open, while sensor data is used to automate the net's tow cable winches, allowing the net to ‘fly' close to the ocean floor without making contact. A contactless, deep-water net achieves many goals for both fishers and the environment. The main benefit is reducing fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions by 25 to 30 percent.Katchi's method reduces fuel consumption, damage to and loss of fishing gear, and bycatch (untargeted fish and marine species such as sea grasses and coral). It also increases vessel safety and allows fishers the potential to fish in areas that have been previously too difficult to fish. Our system uses technology to map and stream information to the vessel's computer systems, which in turn controls the behavior and positioning of the net. The ability to position and automate a net will hopefully allow more flexibility in both ground fishing and mid-water trawling.What is innovative about the way you are solving the issue? What sets your solution apart?Angie: Our technology is designed to hug, not touch, the ocean floor. This allows fishers to continue to target sustainable ground fish species. Our net also allows fishers to follow schools of fish up and down the water column. Traditional trawl nets are not designed to do this. Our hope is that our system allows fishers to apply their knowledge with the new technology to fish different species in different locations more efficiently.How will winning a prize in the Cisco Global Problem Solver Challenge help you advance your business?Marc: The reputation and worldwide stage of Cisco and the Cisco Global Problem Solver Challenge is something that we are very grateful for. The prize money will be used to move faster towards our goal in our upcoming sea trials. We are completing a full-scale net this fall/winter, which has been previously tested at the flume tank at Memorial University in Newfoundland. The next round of tests involves mounting the system onto a large fishing vessel (the MV Lery Charles owned by Scotia Harvest Inc. - Digby Nova Scotia) and exposing it to the harsh conditions of a deep-water environment.What advice do you have for other social entrepreneurs?Angie: Be passionate and set the expectation that you will have to spend upwards of 100 hours talking to and meeting people before you gain traction. It took us a long time before we found like-minded people who loved our cause, and it took us even longer to find a niche group of specialists committed to our project to achieve results. This process was long, but key to building trust, interest, and relationships.Stay tuned for more articles in our blog series, featuring interviews with every Cisco Global Problem Solver Challenge 2022 winning team!View original content here.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Cisco Systems Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Cisco Systems Inc.Website: http://csr.cisco.com/Email: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Cisco Systems Inc.View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/722631/Katchi-How-Sustainable-Fishing-Helps-Both-Fishers-and-the-Ocean]"
